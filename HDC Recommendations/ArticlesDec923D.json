        "text":["<p>In a different political constellation, Haifa and the Taiwanese capital Taipei could have been twin cities. Both are on mountains and have a sea view, and both take pride in their universities.</p> \n<p>Two years ago Taipei gave Haifa a present: traditional Chinese dragon boats; the gesture could have marked the start of a beautiful friendship. But given the international politics, the potential Israeli twin denied its sister city.</p> \n<p>Haifa did accept the boats, in a nice ceremony where one might have expected the flag of Taipei or Taiwan to be flown next to the flag of Haifa or Israel. But Beijing heard about it and the Taiwanese flags were kept in the cupboard.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 'Trump will be furious': U.S.-Israel tensions simmer over China infrastructure projects | Analysis</p> \n<p>Outsiders might wonder why the Chinese would care about a Taiwanese flag being flown at a modest ceremony in the Middle East. The Haifa municipality is an independent body not subject to the opinion of the Foreign Ministry. It didn’t have to cave in to Beijing’s pressure.</p> \n<p>The city said it “respects the One China policy that Israel is following, which recognizes the government in Beijing and does not recognize Taiwan’s symbols of sovereignty. However, there is nothing to stop or limit cooperation at the municipal level.”</p> \n<p>The story of the Taiwanese flag that wasn’t is just one small anecdote in the Chinese deluge against the slightest legitimization of what Beijing considers a rebellious province. Others, however, see Taiwan as the democratic version of what China could have been if it hadn’t been taken over by communists.</p> \n<p>Last month Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan visited Israel, another sign of the warming relations between the two countries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu takes great pride in this relationship, justifiably so. The closer ties are part of a much broader trend: China’s growing power vis-&agrave;-vis the West. And Taiwan is paying a price for this.</p> \n<p>Exports &agrave; la Israel</p> \n<p>Taiwan is a small island, certainly in Chinese terms, though with 23 million people – under political siege – it looks big to Israel.</p> \n<p>Taiwan’s relationship with China is complex. The Taiwanese are following the path of Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist who lost mainland China to the Communists. Their domestic politics are marked by democratic values and free elections, but when it comes to security and foreign relations, the Taiwanese are very much constrained by the Chinese.</p> \n<p>Cheng Cheng-mount, a deputy minister at Taiwan’s National Development Council, told Haaretz his country was under a lot of pressure from China. During a visit funded by the Taiwanese government, Cheng said that even if China sought to block Taiwanese sovereignty, the island could still trade with the mainland.</p> \n<p>He said Taiwan, much like Israel, has an economy based largely on exports; in Taiwan’s case, especially electronics. Also, the Taiwanese are very proud of their banking system; the country boasts 38 banks, a sector that helps keep the island’s unemployment rate at only 4.7 percent.</p> \n<p>Cheng said banks in Taiwan fund education for their employees, and if a&nbsp; branch closes, the employees can’t be laid off so easily.</p> \n<p>But there's a bit of bad news in this sector: The Taiwanese banking system faces more than 12,000 cyberattacks every year.</p> \n<p>Chui Chui-chen, deputy minister on the Mainland Affairs Council, said Taiwan was keen to a resolve disputes with the mainland through negotiations.</p> \n<p>But the Taiwanese know this isn’t so easy.</p> \n<p>The only diplomatic outlet for the island is therefore to buy relationships with countries that the Chinese haven’t yet bought. But over time more and more countries are lining up with Beijing. Today the island nation has full diplomatic relations with only 17 countries, mostly minnows such as Swaziland, Belize, Kiribati, Nauru and the Marshall Islands.</p> \n<p>Putting aside the special relationship with the Vatican, all these relationships are based on economic support. Taiwan has special agencies to handle this. Taiwan’s International Cooperation and Development Fund finances educational and agricultural projects in poor countries; the correlation between the countries that get money and the list recognizing Taiwan is close.</p> \n<p>The politics of fear</p> \n<p>The Taiwanese admit that this diplomatic channel is doomed; any country that China decides to “buy” is a done deal.</p> \n<p>Timothy Hsiang, the fund’s secretary-general, admitted that the fund couldn’t compete with China no matter how much it invested.</p> \n<p>He said there were substantial difficulties in cooperating with countries that have ties with China. The fund tried to cooperate with Ecuador, but the effort fell through when the fund was requested not to use its name in projects.</p> \n<p>One Asian country that suffered a natural disaster rejected Taiwanese aid because a drawing of a Taiwanese flag adorned the equipment.</p> \n<p>Employees of Paul Kuobong Chang, Taiwan’s representative to Israel, say he’s Taiwanese’s ambassador to Israel. But Jerusalem doesn’t see him as such because of a deep fear of China. Instead, Chang’s office is called the Economics and Cultural Office.</p> \n<p>In fact, people from Israel’s Foreign Ministry won’t meet with him at the ministry lest the Chinese think Israel and Taiwan are getting closer. The closest Chang can get to the foreign minister’s office is the Aroma caf&eacute; in Jerusalem’s nearby Cinema City.</p> \n<p>Chang says the Taiwanese never try to challenge the relationship between Israel and China, the world’s second largest economy. Every country wants a relationship with the People’s Republic.</p> \n<p>Chang declined to comment on whether he feels that China and Israel’s warming ties are bad for Taiwan.</p> \n<p>He did, however, tell of attempts to persuade El Al Israel Airlines to fly directly between Tel Aviv and Taipei. The official reason for El Al’s refusal do this has been economic: not enough passenger traffic.</p> \n<p>But El Al’s website suggests something else. You can book a ticket to Taipei through a connecting flight – and the airline mentions “Taipei, China.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON – The Trump administration on Friday voted for the first time against a United Nations resolution that condemned Israel’s occupation of the Golan Heights.</p> \n<p>While the resolution passed easily through the UN General Assembly, with 151 “yes” votes and only 2 “no” votes, the American position represented a policy shift that could also have implications for the future. The U.S. has previously abstained from voting on the move.</p> \n<p>The only other country other than the U.S. who voted against the resolution was Israel itself. Israel has been lobbying the Trump administration and Congress to recognize its sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which were captured from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War. So far the administration has stated it is not considering such a move, but the UN vote on Friday could hint at a change on that front.</p> \n<p>The administration stated that it is voting against the resolution because it is “extremely biased against Israel” and did not provide a position on the sovereignty issue in its statement.</p> \n<p>The Israeli government thanked the Trump administration and specifically the U.S. ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, for the vote.</p> \n<p>In a&nbsp;press release announcing that the U.S. would vote no, Haley said that the U.S. &quot;will no longer abstain when the United Nations engages in its useless annual vote on the Golan Heights.&quot;</p> \n<p>The resolution is &quot;biased against Israel&quot; and in light of tensions on the Syrian border, there is no justification for supporting the move, the statement said.</p> \n<p>The Syrian regime's &quot;atrocities prove its lack of fitness to govern anyone,&quot; the statement read, adding that the Iranian presence inside Syria presents &quot;major threats to international security&quot; and that &quot;ISIS and other terrorist groups remain in Syria.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;This resolution does nothing to bring any parties closer to a peace agreement. The United States will vote no,&quot; the statement said.</p> \n<p>Following the announcement, Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon thanked Haley for her decision to vote &quot;no on a despicable resolution.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;It is time the world distinguishes those who stabilize the region from those who sow terror,&quot; he wrote on Twitter.</p> \n<p>Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan also responded. &quot;The Golan is part of Israel and it will always be. There is no sane person who thinks that the Golan will return to the murderer Assad and the Iranian regime, which is trying to establish a 'Syrian Hezbollah' in the region,&quot; he tweeted.</p> \n<p>Chairman of the Yesh Atid party, Yair Lapid, thanked Haley and reiterated that the Golan Heights is part of Israel. &quot;It's time for the rest of the world to recognize that reality too,&quot; he tweeted.</p> \n<p>In a separate tweet in Hebrew, Lapid praised the decision as &quot;another step in the right direction.&quot;</p> \n<p>In October, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the Golan Heights remains under Israeli sovereignty otherwise &quot;Iran and Hezbollah will sit on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Israel in the Golan Heights is a guarantee for stability in the surrounding area,&quot; Netanyahu said in a speech in the Golan Heights. The event took place against the backdrop of the arrival of Russia's S-300 missiles to Syria.</p>",

This comes after Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor said on Thursday that the country is seeking the death penalty for five out of 11 suspects charged in the murder of Khashoggi, in a case that has strained the kingdom's ties with key Western allies.</p> \n<p>He said the Washington Post columnist was murdered after &quot;negotiations&quot; for his return to the kingdom failed and that the person who ordered the killing was the head of the negotiating team that was sent to repatriate Khashoggi.</p> \n<p>The whereabouts of Khashoggi's body remain unknown, he said.</p> \n<p>Riyadh had offered numerous contradictory explanations for Khashoggi's disappearance before saying he was killed in a rogue operation, in a case that has sparked a global outcry, opened the kingdom to possible sanctions and tarnished the image of the crown prince.</p> \n<p>Read more: Khashoggi Killing: Turkey Confirms New Audio Linking Journalist's Murder to Saudi Crown Prince | Trump Nominates Retired Army General as U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</p> \n<p>According to the Washington Post report, Khalid bin Salman, the younger brother of Prince Mohammed and Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the U.S., had made a phone call to&nbsp;Khashoggi telling him to go pick up documents at the consulate in Istanbul. It is unclear if Khalid knew that Khashoggi would be killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Khalid responded to the report, denying that he had any contact with Khashoggi. Khalid claimed that the last contact he had with Khashoggi was on&nbsp;October 26, 2017, adding that he never discussed anything related to going to Turkey.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Turkish officials have accused Prince Mohammed of ordering the murder while President Erdogan said the killing was ordered at the &quot;highest levels&quot; of the&nbsp;Saudi government. U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested ultimate responsibility lies with the prince as de facto ruler.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Public Prosecutor has requested the death penalty for 5 individuals who are charged with ordering and committing the crime and for the appropriate sentences for the other indicted individuals,&quot; Shaalan said, without naming the five.</p> \n<p>He said 11 out of 21 suspects have been indicted and that their cases will be referred to court, while the investigation with the remaining suspects will continue in order to determine their role in the crime.</p> \n<p>A travel ban has been imposed on a top aide to the crown prince, Saud al-Qahtani, while investigations continue over his role, Shaalan said, adding Qahtani had met the team ordered to repatriate Kashoggi ahead of their journey to Istanbul to brief them on the journalist's activities. Qahtani has already been fired from the royal court.</p> \n<p>Turkey says it has a recording related to the killing which it has shared with Western allies. President Tayyip Erdogan said the recordings are &quot;appalling&quot; and shocked a&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;intelligence officer who listened to them, Turkish media reported on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>DPA contributed to this report</p>",

        "text":["<p>Two officers from the Shin Bet security service who were investigated last year on the suspicion that they ordered two female Israeli soldiers to conduct an invasive search of a Palestinian woman's private parts after her arrest without any operational reason have not been suspended from their jobs.</p> \n<p>In addition, the Civil Service Commission was not informed that an investigation had been opened in the case.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian woman's complaint, which Haaretz has obtained, states that one of the Shin Bet officers is an area coordinator and the other is an investigator. Both were only identified by the initial &quot;A.&quot;</p> \n<p>The search was conducted after the woman was arrested in 2015 on suspicion of actively abetting terrorist activity.&nbsp;Despite the more serious suspicions against her, she was ultimately convicted of less serious crimes and sentenced to two years in prison, after which she was released.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;The Shin Bet's disgrace veiled in secrecy | Editorial&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The investigation of the Shin Bet officers has been completed and the file has been transferred to State Prosecutor Shai Nitzan, who will decide whether to file indictments.</p> \n<p>It is possible that Nitzan will decide that instead the two will face agency disciplinary proceedings within the Shin Bet, while the criminal case against them would be closed.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, Haaretz reported new details about the investigation, which was initiated by Jana Mudzgurishvilly, who was then head of the Justice Ministry department that investigates misconduct complaints against the&nbsp;Shin Bet. Mudzgurishvilly&nbsp;left the position at the end of September after serving for five years as head of the department.</p> \n<p>This is the first criminal investigation conducted by the unit, known by its Hebrew acronym Mivtan, into allegations of violations of suspects’ rights during a Shin Bet interrogation, even though hundreds of complaints have been filed since the department was established.</p> \n<p>According to the Palestinian woman's complaint, her arrest by the Israeli army took place at her West Bank home at around 1 A.M. and she had been sleeping at the time. The soldiers who arrested her were from a unit of combat engineers, but the two female soldiers accompanying them were not combat soldiers, a source with knowledge of the details of the investigation said. The Palestinian claimed that the force consisted of two female soldiers, five male soldiers and two “captains” — a term commonly used by Palestinians for Shin Bet officers.</p> \n<p>The woman alleged that the two began questioning her and issued threats, including a threat that they would demolish her home. After a search of her house, the two female soldiers asked her to undress, she said. According to the complaint, one of the women soldiers asked her to consent to “an internal search in the nature of a gynecological examination.” The Palestinian woman said she objected but one of the women soldiers told her that this was an order and if she refused, they could force her to undergo it.</p> \n<p>One of the female soldiers put on gloves and carried out a vaginal and anal search, which yielded nothing, the complaint alleges. But after the first soldier finished her examination, the Palestinian woman said she was surprised that a second female soldier repeated the search, and the pair said these were the orders that they received.</p> \n<p>The searches were conducted without the Shin Bet officers being present, the woman said. Sources with knowledge of how the Shin Bet operates said it is likely that the order to conduct the intrusive search was not given by the investigator, but rather by the area coordinator, who in practice commands the operations along with the army officers.</p> \n<p>After the search was completed and the female soldiers informed her that they had found nothing, she was allowed to dress and was taken to a military jeep, the Palestinian woman recounted. From there she was taken for questioning to a Shin Bet facility at the Shikma prison in Ashkelon.</p> \n<p>In her complaint, the woman alleged that she was subject to harsh questioning there by a number of investigators who identified themselves only by nicknames, in questioning that lasted for most of the day. They allegedly cursed at her and threatening that if she did not tell them everything she knew, she would remain in solitary confinement.</p> \n<p>Because the woman was suspected of abetting terrorism, she was prevented from meeting with a lawyer for two weeks. “This was a gross violation of the total ban on torture, brutality, inhumane or humiliating treatment,” a source close to the woman alleged. “The search conducted on her constitutes a sex crime and physical violence and as a result of it, she felt helpless and threatened.”</p> \n<p>She filed a complaint about the search after her arrest, but no investigation was opened at the time.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Head of unit urges filing of a complaint</p> \n<p>In 2017, Mudzgurishvilly, the head of Mivtan, heard about the incident and tried to meet with the Palestinian woman and convince her to file a detailed complaint, but the woman refused.</p> \n<p>A few months later, when the Palestinian was again arrested on suspicions of security offenses, Mudzgurishvilly convinced her to file another complaint, which led to a criminal investigation after Nitzan ordered that one be conducted by a special Justice Ministry team.</p> \n<p>In addition to the two suspected Shin Bet officers, a third Shin Bet officer, who was the commander of the two, was apparently questioned “under caution,&quot; meaning that he was considered a criminal suspect.</p> \n<p>None of those involved in the incident has been suspended from their jobs and no administrative proceedings have been instituted against them. The two female soldiers who conducted the invasive searches provided testimony to the investigative team but were not questioned as criminal suspects.</p> \n<p>&quot;On the face of it, the Shin Bet personnel and security forces committed a serious criminal offense,&quot; Efrat Bergman-Sapir of the Public Committee against Torture in Israel said. &quot;A vaginal search can only be carried out with the detainee's consent, following the approval of a physician and at an appropriate location.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Palestinian woman was released from prison while her complaint was under investigation. She left Israel on a foreign passport and is now living abroad. She has not returned to the West Bank since, and it is thought unlikely that she will return to testify. No replacement has been named to succeed Mudzgurishvilly as head of Mivtan.</p> \n<p>Even though the investigation has been completed, sources close to the Palestinian woman said they were not optimistic about the prospects that criminal charges would be filed in the case. “We have no hopes for the Israeli legal system,” one of them said.</p> \n<p>If Nitzan seeks to have the Shin Bet officers' case handled in internal disciplinary proceedings, the law authorizes the head of the Shin Bet, Nadav Argaman, to order the proceedings before a three-person panel. Such proceedings are usually held in cases of alleged disciplinary infractions connected to operational Shin Bet activities. The decision to convene the disciplinary panel would also require the approval of Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit and would be held instead of filing of criminal charges.</p> \n<p>Disciplinary proceedings are usually conducted behind closed doors at the Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court. The panel would be head by a judge and would be joined by a representative appointed by the Shin Bet and another by the Mossad intelligence service.</p> \n<p>Asked for a response for this article, the Shin Bet said: “The matter is being handled by the State Prosecutor’s Office so we cannot comment at this stage.” The State Prosecutor’s Office did not respond on the matter.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Hamas declared a huge victory after each of the three Israeli offensives since 2008 that left behind many dead and enormous destruction in the Gaza Strip. So how can Hamas not declare victory when its 400 or so rockets (and one person killed by a rocket, who was a Palestinian worker) didn’t end in a fourth war?</p> \n<p>The victory lap reflects the duality in Hamas’ view of itself and how it presents itself to the outside world: on the one hand a resistance group against a colonial occupier, on the other the Gaza Strip’s sovereign – one that expresses the wishes of Allah and the people (in the 2006 elections, but who’s counting?) and is marching toward the leadership of the entire Palestinian people.</p> \n<p>As the resistance, Hamas takes pride in its true – or fake – victories. As the sovereign with roads to pave and government officials to pay salaries, it tried for a cease-fire.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Hamas chief in Gaza warns Israel after botched IDF operation: Don't test us again&nbsp;■&nbsp;Early elections will limit Netanyahu's room for maneuver in Gaza | Analysis ■&nbsp;Botched special op in Gaza brings Israel and Hamas to brink of war | Analysis</p> \n<p>Here too, as with the suitcases filled with Qatari money, Hamas and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at a crossroads of mutual interests: guaranteeing that the organization keeps control of Gaza on condition that it’s only Gaza. In other words, on condition that the internal Palestinian split persists, meaning the continuation of overall Palestinian weakness.</p> \n<p>The exposure of the Israeli unit that infiltrated Gaza to conduct some sort of operation (a routine infiltration, we are told) was indeed an achievement for the fighters of the Iz al-Din al-Qassam brigades, another example (like the rockets) of Hamas’ increasing military prowess. It’s not the prowess of a guerrilla group fighting in the jungle but an organization that sees itself as the head of a state that must defend its sovereignty and respond to any invasion.</p> \n<p>The Israeli media made a huge story out of the Gaza youth who managed to reach the greenhouses of Netiv Ha’asara, reporting it as a terrible security failure. Why should Israelis expect Hamas to treat a hostile military infiltration as insignificant just because it’s a routine event of the kind rarely detected? Hamas, which even Netanyahu treats as the head of an almost-state, can’t regard routine invasions as Israel’s inalienable right, even if they’re something the army does daily and openly in Palestinian enclaves in the West Bank without a response.</p> \n<p>An essential ingredient of Hamas’ effort to paving its way as the leadership of all Palestinians and perhaps to international recognition as such (whether as part of an artificially revived nonexistent PLO, or under a new umbrella) is declaring great military victories in the present. Yasser Arafat already knew how to turn the bloodiest of battles, successful or not, into groundbreaking victories for the Palestinian struggle for independence.</p> \n<p>Hamas’ trophies</p> \n<p>Last week, the rocket-attack fears of Israelis living near Gaza were portrayed as a victory, as was the military bus set on fire and the reports of Israeli economic losses. All are trophies or medals for Hamas. The group isn’t only competing with Israel but mainly with Fatah. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman’s resignation was the pinnacle, a platinum trophy.</p> \n<p>A much more real prize was the admiration won by Hamas in the Palestinian diaspora and in the West Bank, where many people are hungering for achievements and proof that Israel isn’t omnipotent (in uncomplimentary comparison, to put it mildly, to the actions of the Palestinian Authority that earns more scorn from the public each day).</p> \n<p>But if these World Cup trophies were filled with water from Gaza’s taps, they wouldn’t be fit to drink from. That’s the final proof of Israeli control over the Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank: At the end of the day, Israel is the first and last to decide how much water the Palestinians will have and how polluted it will be. That’s a much more painful, invasive and destructive long-term means of control than the ability to issue or not 5,000 Israeli work permits that would increase Gaza’s monthly income by thousands of percent.</p> \n<p>Therefore, Netanyahu should be believed when he says Hamas begged for a cease-fire, even if the begging was heard through envoys. The Hamas leadership doesn’t survive on its image alone, as a hologram to inflate the chest of Palestinians living outside Gaza – it must also cope with reality.</p> \n<p>It’s a reality in which no Gaza Palestinian (except perhaps those trained to be soldiers and those with access to a fully supplied bunker) can bear the thought of the nightmarish horror of a new Israeli offensive – all the dead and wounded who bleed to death under the rubble because the Israeli army doesn’t let rescue crews reach them.</p> \n<p>In reality, a dwindling UNRWA will have an even harder time than in past Israeli offensives providing emergency services to people fleeing the bombing of their neighborhoods.</p> \n<p>In reality, it’s no consolation to know that perhaps – and certainly much more slowly than in the past – international funding will be found to rebuild homes and infrastructure destroyed for a sixth or 10th time since 2000, and that international volunteers will show up again to counsel the children and other trauma victims.</p> \n<p>No comparison to Israel’s army</p> \n<p>Hamas’ half-hidden desire for a cease-fire is also proof of its governance and maturity as a leader. The calculation isn’t that of a guerrilla organization counting the dead on the other side and which anyway lacks the tools to contain the spread of Israeli settlements – and it doesn’t even try to do so. Hamas’ calculation is no longer that of an organization seeking to thwart the PA or embarrass the rival movement – Fatah – by pushing the youths of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades to compete over who can kill more Israelis. The considerations are of a civilian leadership living among its people and listening to them.</p> \n<p>And even if the people are afraid to say in front of the cameras that they’re afraid and sick of total wars, the leaders know it. They also know that all the Iranian weapons they have and the partisan enthusiasm of the Iz al-Din al-Qassam brigades bear no comparison to the destructive power that a single Israeli operations room can exercise. And the leaders remember that there are the problems of water, sewage and electricity to be solved.</p> \n<p>Despite Hamas’ declarations of its willingness to hold elections as soon as tomorrow, its leaders know very well that even if they won again they couldn’t govern for a moment in the West Bank. Israel would immediately arrest all Hamas’ elected officials, freeze the transfer of customs revenue and confiscate even more money from the banks. But it’s doubtful whether Hamas wants to govern there; this would show how it’s just as helpless as the PA vis-&agrave;-vis Israel’s deepening control over most of the West Bank and East Jerusalem and the expanding settlements.</p> \n<p>Hamas can’t return to being a guerrilla organization after having built a capability exceeding that of a militia and establishing itself as a civilian government. Even if Israel would allow it – and it wouldn’t – the PA would not resume control in Gaza if Hamas held on to its separate military power. But Hamas wouldn’t agree to just become an umbrella for charities.</p> \n<p>Therefore all that remains for the Islamic organization is to continue on with the support of Israel and Qatar – to hold the reins of civil and military control in Gaza alone. Palestinian unity and reconciliation will remain nice declarations. In any case realization of the project of Palestinian statehood, (within the ‘67 or ‘48 borders, it makes no difference) is far from sight.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s support for Gaza as a separate political entity is nothing new. He’s continuing the policies of previous Israeli governments. Even before Ariel Sharon’s unilateral disengagement from Gaza in 2005, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Ehud Barak already sought to separate the Gazans from the other Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Ehud Olmert followed the same policy. The Israelis issued statements but in effect thwarted the old arrangement that most of the international community envisaged in funding the Oslo Accords: the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), which were captured in 1967.</p> \n<p>In its place Israeli governments have created a reality of separate Palestinian enclaves, and the Palestinians have contributed by creating their dual self-rule. Hamas and Netanyahu prove that it’s possible to maintain this reality even without terrible bloodshed.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It's not just the northern front Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at when he said earlier this week at the memorial for Paula Ben-Gurion that there are security considerations he can't share with the public.</p> \n<p>In private conversations and, unusually, in several recent speeches, the prime minister has sounded crystal clear: He will continue to do everything in his power to prevent a war that he sees as dangerous and unnecessary.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, like Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who just resigned, he is undoubtedly afraid of suffering political damage, even though he said this week that he’s willing to absorb such damage. In Wednesday’s Israel Television News poll, Netanyahu’s Likud party made its worst showing of the last eight months.</p> \n<p>In the holding action he is waging against supporters of a war in Gaza, Netanyahu has a reliable ally in IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot. The two appear to be completely coordinated. It was Eisenkot who gave the security cabinet a sober description of the week’s events.</p> \n<p>In this case, it was Israel that began the escalation. Thanks to pressure from Egypt, which sent intelligence officials to Gaza, Hamas reined in the violent demonstrations along the fence over the last two weeks. Hamas leaders were also pleased by the positive momentum created by the delivery of fuel and cash from Qatar, and especially the tripling of the number of hours of daily electricity Gaza residents received. Israel thought the atmosphere would also enable progress in talks about a long-term cease-fire.</p> \n<p>But despite the volatile situation, a special operation&nbsp; by an elite unit was authorized near the Gazan town of Khan Yunis. Such operations take place under the enemy’s radar dozens of times a year in various sectors. The army considers them essential and thinks they justify the permanent risk of complications, such as casualties or capture, even under delicate strategic circumstances.</p> \n<p>The soldiers’ discovery by a Hamas military wing patrol sparked a gun fight that killed Lt. Col. M., the commander of the Israeli force, and seven armed Palestinians. M.’s deputy was wounded, as were seven other Palestinians. The resourcefulness displayed by the wounded reservist officer and the other soldiers enabled them to make contact with the helicopter that evacuated them, thereby saving the officer’s life.</p> \n<p>In the army’s view, Hamas’ response may have been unjustified, but it was understandable. The organization came across a secret Israeli operation behind its lines and suffered many casualties.</p> \n<p>Its response included firing some 460 rockets and mortars at Israel and launching an anti-tank missile at a bus near the border on Monday afternoon. The IDF responded with a series of airstrikes against Hamas and Islamic Jihad targets, including several multi-story buildings.</p> \n<p>At the security cabinet meeting and in other security discussions, three options were raised: refraining from any response, dealing Hamas a blow the army termed “significant,” or launching a major military operation, another version of the 2014 Gaza war. The IDF, as veteran officers would say it always does, recommended the middle option, which it deemed proportionate.</p> \n<p>Some ministers wanted the army to explain why it hadn’t assassinated senior Hamas officials. The answer lies in part in the way the latest round of fighting began. Israel didn’t plan it in advance, and as soon as it erupted, Hamas leaders went underground, so the element of surprise was lost. But in any case, the IDF isn’t enthusiastic about resuming assassinations.</p> \n<p>Some ministers think it’s possible to wage a lengthy campaign from afar without sending ground forces into Gaza. But Eisenkot believe the domino effect would come into play. The Palestinians would escalate by firing on the Tel Aviv area, and the government, under public pressure, would call up the reserves. And when the escalation continued, it would send them into Gaza.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Netanyahu's dilemma: Surrender to his arch-enemies or be forcefully dragged into elections&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>At that point, one of two things would happen: Israel would occupy Gaza and get embroiled in maintaining the occupation, or it would stop the fighting after a few weeks – at which point the negotiations with Hamas would resume exactly where they left off.</p> \n<p>The General Staff doesn’t believe the number of casualties justifies going to war, and it was a bit surprised by some ministers’ evident yearning to return to the glory days of the Second Lebanon War of 2006 and Operation Protective Edge of 2014. True, this week, an officer was killed, and then a Palestinian worker was killed by a Katyusha rocket Hamas fired at Ashkelon. But the number of fatalities on the Palestinian side is much greater. Some 250 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the year, compared to three people killed in Israel.</p> \n<p>The army doesn’t accept Lieberman’s view that this is a “war of no choice.” By that logic, senior officers said, we’d have been launching a large-scale operation every two weeks for the last 70 years. It’s better to take a deep breath and think before doing something stupid.</p> \n<p>War, the army says, must be a last resort, used only after every other option has been thoroughly explored. Former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, whom Eisenkot served as military secretary, launched a war – Operation Defensive Shield in the West Bank – only after more than 130 Israelis were killed in a single month, the terrible March of 2002.</p> \n<p>The intelligence agencies say that Hamas understands the military balance of power, and it, too, is trying to avoid a war, knowing that the price paid by the Palestinians would be incomparably greater. Moreover, the fact that Egypt and Qatar have demonstrated a deep commitment to arranging a cease-fire means an indirect agreement could still be reached, one that would prevent a war and start easing Gaza’s severe humanitarian distress.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, after a week of almost-war, a last-minute cease-fire, a coalition crisis and the defense minister’s dramatic resignation, Friday is upon us once again, and everyone is waiting to see what will happen along the Gaza border. The IDF will presumably take an especially hard line this Friday to show that it isn’t willing to return to a situation of violent weekly clashes with protesters along the border fence.</p>",

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – Prof. David Myers finds it hard to define himself as a Zionist, and at the same time he calls himself a &quot;tribal Jew&quot; who thinks it will be &quot;a serious blow&quot; if his daughters get married outside of the tribe. As a historian, he thinks anti-Semitism in America could fortify the Jewish collective identity. As a political activist, he believes that Jews in Israel and the Diaspora should never stop criticizing one another.</p> \n<p>Our interview took place in three stages and was spread out over several months, two languages (English and Hebrew) and two turning points in his career.&nbsp;The Hebrew version will be published on the Shalom Hartman Institute blog.</p> \n<p>When we met in New York last spring, Myers was president of the Center for Jewish History, but also invested in his academic career as a historian at UCLA. We discussed his political views and activities (than as a board member of the nonprofit New Israel Fund) and his public criticism of official Israeli policy.</p> \n<p>But politics and Israel were not the main reasons for reaching out to Myers. Sometime after our meeting, he resigned from the Center for Jewish History and in October was named the new president of NIF's international board. Public activism is now his main calling card.</p> \n<p>As a result, we sat down for a second interview. But this time Myers was much more circumspect, asking to check every quotation. The third and final part of the interview came after the attack at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last month. In the shadow of the deadliest attack ever on the American-Jewish community, I wanted to hear his views as both a historian and a leading member of the community.</p> \n<p>In your latest book &quot;Jewish History: A Very Short Introduction&quot; (Oxford, 2017), you present a challenging analysis of Jewish survival throughout history. What is your central thesis?</p> \n<p>&quot;There are two unlikely keys to survival, which are both relevant and irrelevant to the present century. The first key is assimilation, in the absence of which Jewish culture would have stagnated long ago.&nbsp; If Jews in Ashkenazic lands, for example, had remained in a corner, entirely cut off from the outside world, without adopting the norms and customs of the surrounding society, they would have become petrified. If Jews hadn't done that repeatedly, we would be frozen in history.</p> \n<p>&quot;The second component – which is crucial and plays a dialectic role together with the first factor – is anti-Semitism. I'm of course talking about anti-Semitism in nonlethal doses and not about anti-Semitism of the scale that reached murderous proportions in the Holocaust. Without assimilation, there would be no absorption of the cultural norms and habits of the host society; but without anti-Semitism there would be no limits to this process of integration nor affirmation of Jewish difference.</p> \n<p>&quot;For example, after the terrible tragedy in Pittsburgh in October, Jews came together – many even made their way to synagogues other than during Yom Kippur – to affirm their sense of Jewish solidarity and distinctiveness. This response to tragedy has been played out many times in the past. Anti-Semitism, as Spinoza suggested in the 'Theological-Political Treatise,' reaffirms Jews’ own particular group identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;To be sure, there are other factors that explain the survival of the Jews. But these are two key – and counterintuitive – ones given that they are usually seen as pathways to Jewish disappearance rather than survival.&quot;</p> \n<p>If we apply these principles roughly to what's happening in America today, we have to regard the new anti-Semitism from the right and the left – nonlethal anti-Semitism – with satisfaction from a Jewish point of view. How do you read the present situation?</p> \n<p>&quot;Until now, there has been relatively little anti-Semitism in the United States – [certainly] when compared to Europe. We shouldn’t ignore the discrimination against Jewish immigrants, the hateful agitation of Father [Charles] Coughlin or the social exclusion of Jews from universities, clubs and businesses until quite recently. And again, we cannot forget Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;But until the last few years, rates of anti-Semitism in the United States were dropping to the point that one could imagine a world without it. And that, ironically, raised a problem: Because without the restraining force of anti-Semitism, the drift and alienation of Jews in America might well continue to the point of serious diminution – certainly among the non-Orthodox sectors. It’s possible that that's where we're headed.</p> \n<p>&quot;On the other hand, it’s possible that the rising rates of anti-Semitism– which, astonishingly, some on the right seek to deny – will fortify Jewish collective identity. It’s possible that Jews in the United States will continue to say what Sartre wrote in 'Anti-Semite and Jew': 'I’m a Jew because the anti-Semite reminds me that I am.' On the basis of this proposition, Jews in the modern age have often based their identity on membership in groups such as the ADL, devoted to fighting anti-Semitism. As a general matter, I suspect there will be less anti-Semitism, less of a constraining force to assimilation, and therefore the community will get smaller.&quot;</p> \n<p>What could save it from such a fate?</p> \n<p>&quot;The Jewish community in America is rich in institutions but not in collective identity. This has to do with the powerful ethos of liberal individualism. I think back to my hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania, where, in my romanticized recollection, everyone had a clearly marked ethnic identity. This one was the Irishman, that one Italian, the other a Jew. That kind of ethnic patchwork is less present now, certainly for the third and fourth generations whose ancestors immigrated here in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The American melting pot has done its part. And now we have the added factor of a philosophical pushback against 'identity' in the name of a central liberal individualism. There are serious costs to this pushback.</p> \n<p>&quot;I think back to one of my favorite Jewish thinkers, Simon Rawidowicz, who once wrote that we should add a fifth freedom to the four freedoms described by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his 1941 State of the Union address: What he called 'libertas differendi' – the right to be different.</p> \n<p>&quot;There are two types of people in the world, two types of political theories: There are those who favor a neutral liberalism, which holds that a person should look exactly like his neighbor; and there are those who acknowledge difference and the possibility of creating a rich and colorful mosaic out of that difference. I belong to the second group.</p> \n<p>&quot;I grew up in a community where everyone knew to what group they belonged, and there were a series of institutions that supported it – synagogues, the community center, the Federation.&quot;</p> \n<p>In which group did you grow up?</p> \n<p>&quot;I grew up in a Conservative community, but the boundaries between Jewish groups were more porous than today. There was dialogue and interaction across denominations, there was a sense of communal concern. I suppose I aspire to something paradoxical: It's not enough to simply be a part of the larger American collective – you also need a strong group identity to add color to that larger American entity. This is what Judah L. Magnes called in the early 20th century a 'symphony of nationalities.' I like that ideal. But we live now in a different era.&quot;</p> \n<p>What has replaced communal solidarity?</p> \n<p>&quot;Hyper-individualism, in which there's a distinct door for each person to enter his or her Jewishness. That has its own benefits. I recognize that. I have daughters who grew up in a Shabbat-observant home and who will decide by themselves how to live as Jews – and it's likely not to be the same way I live my Jewish life. So I acknowledge the fact that the present generation enters its Jewishness, when it does so, through different doors. That continues a process that began already in the late 18th century, in the time of Moses Mendelssohn, but the culture of individualism has dramatically expanded in recent decades.&quot;</p> \n<p>That's pessimistic. Since it seems the memory of the Holocaust and solidarity with the State of Israel can no longer do the job, what connects American Jews?</p> \n<p>&quot;There's a degree of pessimism, I suppose. But I'm enough of a historian to know that past Jewish generations have often feared being the last link in the chain. It’s why Rawidowicz famously called Jews 'the ever-dying people.' Throughout their Diaspora wanderings, Jews developed an adaptive mechanism that allowed them to integrate in the surrounding culture without losing their identity – and I think that's been part of the genius of Jewish survival over time.</p> \n<p>&quot;The question to which we return here in America is whether that mechanism still exists. Or has the balance been thrown off – for example, by the high rate of intermarriage. That's a key question.&quot;</p> \n<p>And what's your answer?</p> \n<p>&quot;I won't sit shivah if my daughters marry non-Jews. I'll be sad, and they know that. It's hard to explain that to our good liberal-minded friends who are not Jewish. If you preach the ideals of humanism and universalism, and say that those values stem from your Jewishness, it's hard to explain why you want to preserve your tribe. But that's how I am. In the final analysis I'm a tribal Jew – although one who believes in a universal impulse in Judaism. So it wouldn’t be a disaster, but it would be a serious blow to me if my daughters and future grandchildren wouldn’t be serious Jews. We have both a historical and moral obligation to continue the shalshelet hakabbala, the chain of tradition.&quot;</p> \n<p>And in real life? After all, you won't tell your daughters they're inflicting a disaster on the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>&quot;Well, I recognize the present situation – that over half the members of my daughters' generation marry non-Jews. One could say: You’re lost to the Jewish people, and we'll simply rest content in being a smaller community. I think that's a mistake. I've seen quite often that the non-Jewish partner becomes the more Jewish of the partners in the household.</p> \n<p>&quot;I don't know what the community will look like. But without enough foresight and resources, the Jewish community can plan for that day by building institutions that accept and educate such couples.&quot;</p> \n<p>Many Jewish communities do open their doors to non-Jewish marriage partners, as well as any gentile who wants to enter.</p> \n<p>&quot;True. This is in the spirit of encouraging openness, inclusivity and the traditional principle of hakhnasat orchim (welcoming visitors).&nbsp; I like that, but there is another impulse inside of me as well. For example, I am not thrilled with Conservative rabbis performing a Jewish wedding ceremony for interfaith couples. But that's the reality rabbis face today. The ideal of dwelling within an internal Jewish vacuum rather than an outward-facing community is nice if you live in the Hasidic community of Williamsburg [in Brooklyn]. But what about the rest of the world?</p> \n<p>&quot;In thinking of the demographic future, we need to recognize emerging trends. According to a 2012 survey, 16 percent of the residents of the metropolitan New York area are Jewish. Of these, 30 percent are Orthodox – and some 60 percent of Jewish first-graders are Orthodox. So you could say that in New York at least, Orthodoxy is the future of the Jewish community – barring some significant shift in the way we treat interfaith couples.&quot;</p> \n<p>So do you envy the isolationists? For example, do you feel there's something more complete about Jews who are Satmar Hasidim in America, whose Kiryas Joel village you and your wife are researching?</p> \n<p>&quot;Yes and no. I'm envious and not envious. I'm a serious Jew, but I live in a very different, pluralist world than Satmar Hasidim.&quot;</p> \n<p>You won't move to the ultra-Orthodox community of Borough Park in Brooklyn or to Kiryas Joel?</p> \n<p>&quot;While I have good friends in Kiryas Joel, I don’t see moving there anytime soon. That said, part of me envies the simplicity and clarity of that world, where you don’t have to torture yourself or constantly ask questions. In fact, in such communities, it's strongly discouraged to ask challenging questions. Those who can’t stop asking often end up leaving, but that is a very hard thing to do.</p> \n<p>&quot;There is something alluring about the fact that everything is organized, and you know exactly what, when and how. But I'm a modern Jew and couldn’t live in such a world of conformity. What’s the word that defines the modern Jew more than any other? Autonomy. I would prefer to preserve the tension between autonomy on the one hand, and obligation and responsibility on the other. It yields the enormous creativity of the modern Jews.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Why do you miss the Jewish world where you grew up in Pennsylvania?</p> \n<p>&quot;Look, in the modern liberal world, Jews have often sought out strong forms of community.&nbsp; In communities like Scranton or as we just saw in Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh, you belonged to a strong community. There was a sense of responsibility to assume leadership positions, which my grandparents and parents did. Whenever there was an emergency campaign related to Israel, my grandfather would step into a leadership role. He was the guy who sat everyone down in the room and made clear that nobody was leaving until they doubled their pledges.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;There was also an ethos of service, a belief that you owed a debt to both the Jewish and the wider community. That is what we saw recently in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; That was the example of my parents and grandparents.&quot;</p> \n<p>I want to discuss the NIF, which was the cause of a campaign against you and against your appointment to the Center for Jewish History last year. But what role does this position fill for you as a Jew?</p> \n<p>&quot;At a certain point I realized that I'm a Jew with deep ties to Israel, but who can't keep quiet and accept the community dictate that says you shouldn’t voice criticism in public. I felt that for the first time in the Lebanon war in 1982, and again surrounding the collapse of the Oslo process and the second intifada.</p> \n<p>&quot;So a few things: First, I don’t believe that it is necessary or healthy to remain silent. Second, I reject the claim that somehow public criticism of Israel pushes you beyond the bounds of the community. And third, my own sense of public commitment has been continually expanding. It's not only about Israel. I'm a different person from when I began my career as a Jewish historian in 1991. I increasingly admire the ideal of being both a Thinker and a Doer.&quot;</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, it seems that these are ideals that don't go together in reality – creating a community and incisive political discourse. It seems that the Jewish community in America is suffering greatly from the political debate. Community rabbis from all denominations are fleeing from it, it's too sensitive.</p> \n<p>&quot;I’d love to see a community in which 'those words and these words are the words of the living God.’&nbsp; I’d love to see a community in which we don’t dwell in the comfort of our own bubbles, but force ourselves to meet our ideological opposite across the table. It’s about extending the culture of the ancient beit midrash [study hall] or of the modern coffeehouse – both of which featured loud and intense debate – to the present day. It’s a world in which left and right could sit at the same table and argue over what they see as the best path forward for the Jewish people.&quot;</p> \n<p>You're an American Jew who wouldn't define himself as a Zionist, but in the end Israel is the heart of your Jewish identity. How come?</p> \n<p>&quot;The problem is that the term Zionism has been hijacked by the radical right. I very much identify with the Zionism of the Declaration of Independence – with the right of the Jews to return to their homeland and also to the ideals of freedom, peace and justice outlined in the Declaration.</p> \n<p>&quot;But there is a problem in the United States and elsewhere. I'm very connected to Israel, I love and speak Hebrew. I feel that it is very much a part of my soul. At the same time, I fear that we have sold ourselves into a very meager relationship with Israel via philanthropic Zionism. You gave us a blank check, we’ll give you a bit of identity. That’s a problem, because it encourages a shallow and brittle sense of connection. So one antidote is to make Israeli culture the default Jewish culture in our educational institutions.</p> \n<p>&quot;Don’t get me wrong: It's great that we teach our children Israeli folk dances and songs. And I really love Israeli music. But it’s important to remember that there are other rich Jewish cultures – Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Mizrahi – that we’re losing. There's a homogenization of Jewish cultures both in the Diaspora and in Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>It seems you blame the State of Israel for that as well. And I'm thinking of American ultra-Orthodox Jews. They have a rich Jewish culture, Torah and Yiddishkeit, regardless of their feelings toward Israel. They have responsibility for their culture. Do you envy the Jews of Williamsburg or Kiryas Joel, who have solved the problem that's bothering you?</p> \n<p>&quot;In a certain sense, yes. But I don't want to live their life. There's a degree of admiration that they are preserving Jewish culture and not surrendering to the powerful cultural mainstreams in both America and Israel. I admire that. We need to be careful to avoid an erasure of classical Jewish cultures. We can’t succumb just to Israeli culture, which I know, love and&nbsp; grew up on.&quot;</p> \n<p>At what point did you encounter it?</p> \n<p>&quot;In college I discovered both modern Jewish and Hebrew literature (under the tutelage of my teacher and colleague Arnie Band). Just after, when I moved to Israel to begin graduate studies, I happened [upon] the Israeli singer Yehuda Poliker and [his rock band] Benzeen. Amazing! And I saw one of the greatest Israeli movies I've ever seen, 'Because of that War,' in which Yehuda Poliker features prominently. Ever since, I’ve been an avid consumer of Israeli literature, music, comedy and film.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We spoke about anti-Semitism. Each side, the right and the left, is willing to forgive anti-Semites on his side, and to say that those on the other side are more dangerous. You are, in fact, in the same camp as the anti-Semites on the left. Do you think there is excusable anti-Semitism?</p> \n<p>&quot;No, anti-Semitism is never excusable. But that shouldn’t prevent us from making distinctions. As I see it, anti-Semitism on the right has far more influence on what's happening in our political life in America. The ones who are encouraging and engaging in violence come from the right.&nbsp; It is nothing short of stupefying for me to hear self-respecting people, including Israeli government ministers, deny that anti-Semitism from the right is growing and becoming more visible and lethal. What is that? It’s the height of self-delusion, cynicism, or both.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, BDS, has no anti-Semitism in it?</p> \n<p>&quot;Let’s try to make some distinctions here. Yes, some who support BDS are motivated by anti-Semitism. But I don't believe all who support BDS are anti-Semitic. BDS is a nonviolent movement that would not have come into existence were it not for the occupation. Among its supporters are those who say that the State of Israel should be a state of all its citizens. Is that anti-Semitic? Not necessarily. It's a political vision based on democratic principles. On the other hand, when someone comes along and says that the Jews are not a nation – as [BDS co-founder] Omar Barghouti says – that makes me mad. It's no different from a Jew or an Israeli saying that there's no such thing as a Palestinian people.&quot;</p> \n<p>So is Barghouti an anti-Semite?</p> \n<p>&quot;I have no idea what’s in his heart. And he is not preaching for the death of Jews, as they are on the right. But I don't like people telling me who I am. That impulse to deny the right to self-definition of the other deeply disturbs and offends me.&quot;</p> \n<p>But you still work with them?</p> \n<p>&quot;How so? I neither support BDS nor work with BDS groups. I do have friends who support BDS. And they’re not anti-Semites. That said, BDS is not my way. Nor is it the most effective way to fight injustice and inequality in Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>When you were at the Center for Jewish History, Israelis and some American Jews were angry at the fact you were part of the New Israel Fund.</p> \n<p>&quot;They were – which, frankly, was crazy. Over its 40 years, NIF has contributed some $300 million to every corner of Israeli society, to supporting a robust civil society, to fulfilling the values of democracy, fairness, and equality. If you care about battered women, respect for the environment, religious pluralism, Jewish-Arab cooperation or civil and human rights, then NIF is your address. So how did it come about that NIF is the enemy? Clearly, there is a playbook of vilification – and NIF appears on page one.</p> \n<p>&quot;In the case of the protests against me in September-October 2017, there was a small campaign organized by a local PR guy who knows how to make noise. It was never more than a handful of people, and it had no effect on my time at CJH. Let’s be clear: We will not stand down in the face of bullies or intimidation. We will not stand down, because we believe in the importance of what we do. We will not stand down, because we believe that NIF is one of the most effective tools we have to guarantee the fulfillment of the ideals of Israel's Declaration of Independence. And, by the way, that is a document I take seriously; I carry it around with me in my backpack. It is my obligation to care deeply about Israel and to fight for the fulfillment of its most noble Jewish and human values. Nobody is going to tell me that I'm a traitor.&quot;</p> \n<p>Isn't there a difference – morally or at least psychologically – between an Israeli president of the NIF and an American one? You live in Los Angeles and are staying in LA.</p> \n<p>&quot;The New Israel Fund presidency shifts every two years from Israel to the United States, it's a regular part of the bylaws of the NIF.&nbsp;But … there needs to be a two-way street. It can't be that the State of Israel expresses responsibility and concerns for the well-being of World Jewry and tells it what it should do. But on the other hand, Diaspora Jews are not allowed to express their interests and concerns in Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>The NIF isn't alone: Jewish donors also fund right-wing activity and try to promote deep change in Israel. And that might be legitimate, but speaking based on mutuality, I don't see the exact parallel Israeli actors – official or unofficial – who sharply criticize American Jewry or its leadership in order to change it radically. But if such an actor exists, what do you think of it?</p> \n<p>&quot;Well, first of all, we obviously see different things. I see Israeli leaders and emissaries frequently telling Jews how they should educate their kids, lead their religious lives, and [to] pick up and move to Israel, usually in the wake of tragedy. It would be hypocritical to say that they can’t, but [instead] that I can voice my view on Israeli affairs – and vice versa.</p> \n<p>&quot;I believe we are entitled to express our opinions about the well-being of our family members, our fellow Jews, throughout the world. There is a higher principle here. It is one that Rawidowicz explained in his 1949 essay 'Two That are One.' He spoke of the ideal of a meaningful, bidirectional shutafut, or partnership, between Israel and the Diaspora. He even spoke of the need for a constitution between the two sides, which together make up a single nation or people.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;I agree with him about the importance of mutuality of respect, and the need for values and institutions that promote it. I’ve been speaking for years of an idea that President [Reuven] Rivlin mentioned at the GA last month: A 'reverse Birthright' that would bring Israelis to the Diaspora to learn about the wide range of Jewish expressions to be found here, alongside a Birthright that brings Diaspora Jews to Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>An Israeli who comes to be your guest on Shabbat, what will he see? To which congregation will you take him?</p> \n<p>&quot;I'm a member of four synagogues in Los Angeles, across the denominational and trans-denominational spectrum. That means I'm very invested in Jewish life. It means that I have ample choices, for which I feel blessed. But it also means that the perfect synagogue has not yet been found. That’s for Moshiach Zeit, the time of the Messiah. In the meantime, I’m blessed to live in a world of choice, between and across denominations, between Israel and America, between Ivrit and Yiddishkeit, and between my traditional and progressive values.&nbsp; That’s what it means to be a modern Jew.&quot;</p>",

According to Polish researchers, 3 million Poles (in addition to the 3 million Polish Jews) were killed by the Nazis.</p> \n<p>The German historian Prof. Stephan Lehnstaedt uses the term “genocidal violence” in relation to Germany’s treatment of Polish citizens at the beginning of the war. Lehnstaedt says that from the first day of the war, September 1, 1939, the SS was given full authority to eradicate the Polish intelligentsia. He added that by the spring of 1940, 60,000 Polish citizens had been killed.</p> \n<p>According to Lehnstaedt’s research, at the beginning of the occupation the murderous German agenda was focused on the Polish nation and the Catholic Church, not the Jews. He emphasized that Germans today are unaware that Polish Jews were not the only victims of the Nazis, but that Poles, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, and Belarusians living in Poland had also been victims.</p> \n<p>In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Lehnstaedt said that Poland is home to some 40,000 former prisoners of German camps, most of which never received any sort of reparations. He called for a rectification of the situation, and said that it is an ethical and historical obligation. He called the lack of recognition for these victims, 70 years after the war, a “scandal.”</p> \n<p>His statements reflect the Polish demand for comprehensive reparations from Germany for damages caused during the war, an issue that has come to the fore in the public and political discourse of Poland.</p> \n<p>The Polish historian, Pawe Machcewicz, former director of the Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk, called for the erection of a monument in Berlin for the Polish victims of the Nazis. He added that he is aware of the concern that such a monument would prompt other groups to demand similar recognition, yet he believes it is justified, morally and symbolically, due to the extensive scope of the “murder of the Polish nation.”</p> \n<p>He added that such a gesture could be instrumental in facilitating German and Polish reconciliation. Another idea that came up during the conference was to create museums devoted to German-Polish relations – one in Berlin and a second in Warsaw.</p>",

The time to cash the check has come earlier than Trump expected.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia tried last week to lighten the load for the president by announcing the arrests of 21 suspects and the indictment of 15, while the attorney general said he would demand the death penalty for five, though he didn’t provide any names.</p> \n<p>Earlier King Salman fired Ahmed al-Asiri, the deputy intelligence chief, and Saud al-Qahtani, Mohammed’s senior adviser. In so doing the king set a ceiling on how high the punishment could go. But now it seems there will be no choice but to examine his own son’s future.</p> \n<p>According to The Washington Post, Prince Mohammed’s brother Khalid, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, was the one who phoned Khashoggi and encouraged him to go to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The prince’s adviser and aide, intelligence man Maher Abdulaziz Mutrib, allegedly led the ring and after the murder phoned Qahtani and asked him to tell the boss that it was mission accomplished.</p> \n<p>Mutrib didn’t explicitly say the boss’ name but Qahtani has only one boss and that’s Prince Mohammed. The Saudi ambassador has strongly denied having any telephone conversation with Khashoggi, and a Post reporter has written that their last meeting came in 2017; afterward they corresponded several times. The top Saudi prosecutor said Thursday that Khashoggi was murdered by a “lethal injection” and that his body was dismembered, with his organs handed to someone outside the consulate for disposal.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Turkey takes aim at MBS: What's driving Erdogan in the Khashoggi scandal&nbsp;■&nbsp;Like a mafia boss, Erdogan plans to milk the Khashoggi investigation for all it’s worth</p> \n<p>The collaborator hasn’t yet been found, or the burial place of Khashoggi’s remains; Ankara says the Saudis have refused to provide that information. This is the most detailed statement Riyadh has supplied on the affair, but according to the Saudi explanation, the people responsible for the murder acted on their own without permission, and the crown prince didn’t know about the plot.</p> \n<p>This is the fourth version of events that has been provided by the kingdom, after first denying any connection to the murder while claiming Khashoggi had mysteriously disappeared or committed suicide. Only after Turkey started leaking details from recordings at the consulate were the Saudis forced to admit partial involvement and finally declare that senior people in the kingdom had plotted and carried out the murder.</p> \n<p>Reports by the famous Saudi tweeter Mujtahidd, apparently based on reports from the royal court, people close to the king have been applying great pressure and are demanding Prince Mohammed’s ouster.</p> \n<p>According to these reports, the prince doesn’t let anyone near his father unless the matter is extremely urgent. He has sent his mother to a vacation palace in the Asir Mountains and has cloistered himself with his closest aides to decide how to keep his seat in light of the ever increasing pressure, especially by Washington.</p> \n<p>A removal of Prince Mohammed would not be easy. It’s believed that in 2006 King Abdullah authorized a council of the royal family to decide who the crown prince would be; this panel is also empowered to decide on the crown prince’s removal.</p> \n<p>But this authority has never been employed, even when Prince Mohammed was named instead of his brother, Ahmed bin Abulaziz, who recently returned to Saudi Arabia and stirred speculation about intentions to replace the crown prince or even the king.</p> \n<p>The king can oust his son, but such a step would be seen as weakness and depict Salman as someone who erred in naming his son in the first place. Such weakness could stir controversy among other family members who have felt slighted or ignored.</p> \n<p>Other options would be to name a custodian for Prince Mohammed – a responsible adult who would shrink the crown prince’s authority and monitor his policies, or an advisory council that would assist him.</p> \n<p>Judging by Prince Mohammed’s brutal behavior toward his enemies, he can be expected to wage an all-out war against anyone who dares challenge his authority or try to oust him. After the prince agreed to make his two top advisers scapegoats to calm the United States and the international community, he won’t volunteer his own head without a fight.</p> \n<p>A key question is whether Washington will suffice with the executions of the five and the jailing of the others without demanding Prince Mohammed’s removal. In light of the CIA’s conclusions, such a decision becomes nearly impossible, especially after demands by Congress to punish the Saudis by freezing weapons sales to the kingdom – a demand that could cost the U.S. a $110 billion “deal of the century.”</p> \n<p>Other factors include the position of Russia, whose Foreign Ministry has said Moscow is relying on the Saudi investigation’s conclusions, meaning Russia will lay the matter to rest if Riyadh decides Prince Mohammed wasn’t involved. Will Washington want to be more Orthodox than the Russians and endure all the sanctions the Saudis would apply, including those that foil sanctions against Iran?</p> \n<p>In any case, entities with a greater influence than Russia on how Trump would proceed are U.S. public opinion, Congress and the CIA. The Republican Party and its leaders are recovering from the blows they took in the midterms, and the Khashoggi murder may prove to be a topic that interests the Americans no less than the sanctions on North Korea and Iran.</p>",

He guided Israel through the Arab Spring without getting us entangled in wars, he has finessed a warm relationship with Putin and fostered closer ties with China and India. More dubiously (but in any case successfully), he blocked Obama’s efforts as peace.</p> \n<p>When it comes to economic policy, Bibi has been content to leave the work to a succession of finance ministers whose performance has been mediocre. Nevertheless, the economy has happily chugged along through most of the Netanyahu years.</p> \n<p>The last time Israel experienced a real recession was more than 15 years ago. Unemployment is at a record low. Israel’s high-tech industry has been thriving. Housing is unaffordable, but for the majority of Israelis the Bibi years have been good ones – an era of unprecedented consumerism and wealth. Even many of the biggest blots on the economic record, like high rates of poverty and income inequality, have improved.</p> \n<p>Because Israel’s economy has been such a reliable and consistent performer, it’s faded into the background. But prosperity has a lot to do with Netanyahu’s success. It’s enabled to him to win elections and to weather police probes, his wife’s and son’s misbehavior, and a deep suspicion from the right that he really isn’t one of them.</p> \n<p>I even would argue that the economy has been a key reason why Israel hasn’t joined the wave of populist politics that has overtaken the United States and much of Europe.</p> \n<p>Since 2017, Australia has been the world record holder for uninterrupted economic expansion, but Israel is certainly among the world leaders. Alas, it’s the nature of economics that prosperity can’t last forever.</p> \n<p>Right now, there is little in Israel’s economic headline figures to cause much worry. The Bank of Israel predicts GDP will keep growing next year at the same pace is has in recent years, and the International Monetary Fund is similarly sanguine about the global economy.</p> \n<p>It’s the nature of big institutions, on the record at least, to avoid dire predictions. In October 2007, for instance, when the world economy was on the edge of the precipice, this what the IMF had to say: “Although turbulence in financial markets has clouded prospects … the baseline projection for 2008 global growth has been reduced by almost half a percentage point relative to the July 2007 World Economic Outlook Update. This would still leave global growth at a solid 4.75%.”</p> \n<p>To be fair, the IMF warned then about growing “downside risks,” which is what it did in its latest report, too. Those are, among other things, the impact of Trump’s trade wars and growing levels of debt whether it is held by U.S. corporations or by China. By cutting taxes, Trump is presiding over a dangerous fiscal expansion.</p> \n<p>In Israel, the labor market is tapped out, and consumers are spending heavily. Our import bill is rising rapidly, far faster than export growth. It all points to a fin de si&egrave;cle for a long era of prosperity. One wrong move by Trump or a sudden turn lower on Wall Street will quickly expose Israel’s weaknesses.</p> \n<p>A decade ago, Israel stayed aloof from the global recession thanks to a current account surplus, restrained government spending and a conservative banking industry. The Bank of Israel kept economic activity going by cutting interest rates.</p> \n<p>If the world economy goes bust now, Israel won’t be in as good a position to insulate itself. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon has pursued a fiscally expansionist policy, causing the deficit to balloon. Interest rates are close to zero, depriving the government of the tools it will need to cope with a downturn.</p> \n<p>Kahlon himself hinted at the risk on Thursday, although he put the cause and effect in reverse. He said early elections were good for the economy; I’d say the economy is good for early elections, because if Bibi waits too long, he may find himself with both the economy and Gaza working against him.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Michael Tsur, 55, lives in Mevasseret Zion; arriving from Beijing</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask what you were doing in China?</p> \n<p>I’m a negotiation specialist by profession – I prepare people and organizations for negotiating processes – and I was asked to give a talk on the subject at a conference of the Israel Chamber of Commerce in China.</p> \n<p>Does something special happen if negotiations are held between Israelis and the Chinese?</p> \n<p>In negotiations we examine whether there is a convergence of wills, or of needs, in the case of the Chinese (laughs). There are global methodologies that always work.</p> \n<p>Give an example.</p> \n<p>One rule is that whoever controls the method, controls the content, and whoever controls the process, will control the result. That’s true of everything. You dictated that we would sit and I “gave in” to sitting and also to the interview. The moment I give in, I have very little control over the result.</p> \n<p>Still, you chose to surrender.</p> \n<p>I read this column, so from my point of view, there’s a precedent. I believe it will be all right. It starts and ends with trust.</p> \n<p>Thanks, but what happens when there isn’t any?</p> \n<p>It’s possible to work at building trust, or simply to put it on the table and say, “I find it hard to believe you” – but without accusing the other of being a liar.</p> \n<p>And if he is a liar?</p> \n<p>Sometimes a bad ending is preferable to bad without an ending.</p> \n<p>Or a court case.</p> \n<p>Today, if a lawyer says, “Let’s take it to court,” you should get a new lawyer.</p> \n<p>Let me guess – you’re originally a lawyer.</p> \n<p>Yes, but I always knew I wouldn’t practice law. The practice of law is a profession that weakens people. The lawyer tells you, “You need protection.” I believe that if you give people the tools, strengthen them, and say, “You can do it” – they will live peacefully with the result and also won’t feel that someone has messed them up. That’s part of my job.</p> \n<p>Can you learn how to be an expert in negotiation?</p> \n<p>I’ve been arguing for 20 years about this with the academic world. Seven years ago, I opened a school called Shakla Vetarya [Aramaic for “give and take”]. The courses acquaint people with 70 different methodologies.</p> \n<p>Are your students mostly involved in business?</p> \n<p>Not at all. I make sure there is a broad spectrum of participants – diversity is important. The only thing they have in common is that most of them are age 40 and above. It’s a profession for people who’ve already coped with challenges. And with all due respect to methodologies, one learns more from the group meetings. I come from the practical world, and in negotiation there is no such thing as “theoretically, she agreed to marry me.”</p> \n<p>Even so, negotiation sounds like married life.</p> \n<p>Everything in life is negotiation – the “good morning,” the kiss I give my partner in the morning. As long as we need to breathe and eat, we also need to talk. I teach people to talk the difficulty. To say, “You worried me, it was unpleasant for me” – not to play the macho.</p> \n<p>What about people looking for a way to kick ass?</p> \n<p>You have to understand that every expression embodying force is a sign of weakness. So I’m not a big fan of manipulation – not because it’s not fun, but because you can only do it once. Every negotiation is actually about the next deal; the important thing is what happens the next day. That’s the fifth rule for conducting negotiations.</p> \n<p>What are the four previous ones?</p> \n<p>1. Make no assumptions; 2. The goal is always constructive communication, even if the answer is negative; 3. Negotiation takes place in the mind of your partner. In other words, until you understand how [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah’s mind works, you won’t know what to do; 4. Whoever controls the process, controls the result.</p> \n<p>And if we’re dealing with Nasrallah?</p> \n<p>It doesn’t matter how dangerous I am perceived to be in your eyes. First of all make your request nicely, in a way that respects the addressee. For example, at [West Bank] border crossings I’ve been imploring soldiers for years not to say, in Arabic, “Hand over your ID card.” Why not say, “Give me your ID card, please”?</p> \n<p>Would that approach at least move us toward peace negotiations?</p> \n<p>I want to say that under the right leadership, it would take half a year, and we would have coexistence here. I won’t say peace, because that’s a terribly dangerous word, almost like love.</p> \n<p>Shahar Bat Shlomo, 22, from Ramat Gan, and Yuval Gomme, 22, from Be’er Sheva; Shahar is flying to Hanoi</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask if you’re siblings?</p> \n<p>Together: Twins!</p> \n<p>So why don’t you have the same surname?</p> \n<p>Yuval: Whenever I said my name was Yuval Bat Shlomo [Yuval, daughter of Shlomo], everyone split a gut laughing. I changed it.</p> \n<p>So, who’s flying and where to?</p> \n<p>Shahar: I will be traveling in Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Indonesia.</p> \n<p>Post-army trip?</p> \n<p>Shahar: Yes. I put if off because my boyfriend was a combat officer and he was wounded and had to undergo surgery. In the end, after a lot of agonizing, I decided to go.</p> \n<p>Alone?</p> \n<p>Shahar: Yes. To see whatever places I want, to eat whatever I want – without thinking about anyone else and without dealing with anyone except myself.</p> \n<p>Do you have plans for after the trip?</p> \n<p>Shahar: To come back to Israel and study social work.</p> \n<p>As opposed to the “me, me, me” you’re planning for your trip.</p> \n<p>Yuval: You’ll understand everything when she tells you what she did in the army.</p> \n<p>What did you do?</p> \n<p>Shahar: I worked in army prison as an evaluator in the Gahelet program: I interviewed inmates and offered them conditions that would help them complete their army service properly, if possible.</p> \n<p>Yuval: More accurately, she’d sit with someone for four hours and he’d tell her the most awful story about his life, and she would take it all in.</p> \n<p>What would happen in those conversations?</p> \n<p>Shahar: I would conduct a structured interview. In the course we took beforehand, there’s a 20-page notebook with all the questions you have to ask and need to memorize precisely.</p> \n<p>Why so many?</p> \n<p>Shahar: There is a lot of repetition of questions in an interview – for consistency, to see that the story is “holistic,” complete.</p> \n<p>Did they try to lie?</p> \n<p>Shahar: They would come into the interview with all kinds of strange ideas, like: “If she offers me water and I drink from the bottle, I bet I won’t get out of the army.” Or they would say, “We’ll pull a fast one on her.” But then I would ask, “What happened to you when you were 5?” Or “What was your homeroom teacher like in first grade?” That, they absolutely weren’t ready for. They were moved by it.</p> \n<p>Were they willing to answer such personal questions?</p> \n<p>Shahar: They had a vested interest in coming to the interviews, because I could help with furloughs or with more convenient conditions. But I had to find out for certain what the situation really was, because if we assume that the guy’s father is not in the picture and the mother is sick, you have to give that soldier an army job that allows him to live at home. But if he actually has a mother who’s abusing him, obviously that won’t help. Or if there’s a soldier who has “gray market” debts, because of his army service he can’t work and cover them, and that’s why he went AWOL – I could recommend an exemption, so the army would not be another link in the chain of his failures. It’s better for him to be discharged and save himself.</p> \n<p>Were there scary times?</p> \n<p>Shahar: There were some huge guys who looked as though they could really wallop you, but they were amazing people, and I connected with them. They called me Snow White.</p> \n<p>Suits you.</p> \n<p>Shahar: It’s the first time anyone had ever asked them about their lives. Think of a man, a macho, who couldn’t tell anyone that he wets his bed, that his father chokes his mother.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to function in any sort of framework, in that situation.</p> \n<p>Shahar: There are a great many people who shouldn’t have been drafted – the army doesn’t have the tools to deal with them.</p> \n<p>Yuval: I always say that Shahar served in the “sensitive warfare division.”</p> \n<p>Shahar: It’s important to say that Gahelet is a women’s unit, a feminine force.</p> \n<p>Hats off to you, maybe even to the Israel Defense Forces.</p> \n<p>Shahar: I went to Thelma Yellin High School, an arts school where it’s all individualism, “discover yourself,” and suddenly I found a different world, a world that’s more about being together, a world where I have my place.</p> \n<p>I don’t understand – why did you use the phrase “being together”?</p> \n<p>Shahar: Being together is the meaning of life, in my opinion – it’s all about when you help others and see how it’s possible to do good in the world.</p>",

        "text":["<p>LONDON – On December 2, 1938, a 13-year-old boy arrived in Britain on the first ever Kindertransport – the operation that would save 10,000 mainly Jewish children from the Nazis by bringing them to stay with volunteer families in the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>Leslie Brent grew up to become an exemplary British citizen. After school he served as a British infantry captain (born Lothar Baruch, he Anglicized his name when he enlisted), and after the war became a world-renowned immunologist and transplantation biologist.</p> \n<p>“I’ve had nothing but kindness in this country,” Brent, now 93, tells Haaretz. And it’s a kindness he would like to see extended to modern-day child refugees.</p> \n<p>In November 1938, following Kristallnacht, the British government agreed to amend visa requirements in order to allow children at risk in Nazi Europe to be brought to the United Kingdom. For several years now, Brent has argued that the British government should follow this example to help address the crisis of children fleeing war-torn countries across the world.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know a single Kinder who has not worked well, and often with distinction, for his or her newly adopted country,” Brent says. “I have seen absolutely no reason why modern child refugees wouldn’t do exactly the same.”</p> \n<p>Events marking the 80th anniversary of the start of the rescue mission (November 15, 1938) have focused on parallels with the current child refugee situation, with many of the leading advocates for a more humane policy coming from within the ranks of the Kinder themselves.</p> \n<p>The biggest event is a ceremony in central London on Thursday, organized by former Kinder and Labour Party peer Lord Alf Dubs and Barbara Winton. Her father, Sir Nicholas Winton, saved 669 children from Czechoslovakia, including Dubs.</p> \n<p>More than 60 Kinder will be feted by 1,000 guests at the Quakers’ Friends House event, with speakers including Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, the Archbishop of Canterbury, government ministers, Sir David Attenborough and Vanessa Redgrave.</p> \n<p>Considerable sum</p> \n<p>London’s Jewish Museum is also commemorating the anniversary with “Remembering the Kindertransport: 80 Years On.” The exhibition runs through February 10 and features video testimony from six Kinder, alongside personal objects and photographs they brought with them from Europe.</p> \n<p>“The effort by Jewish organizations, Quakers, charitable organizations and local committees was incredible,” explains co-curator Dr. Kathrin Pieren. “The first transport took place less than a month after Kristallnacht. It was difficult; the [British] government made it clear it would not cover any of the costs, so the various groups had to fund and organize it themselves,” she says.</p> \n<p>The Kindertransports ran for nearly 18 months, with the last transport from Nazi Germany leaving Berlin on September 1, 1939, just before the start of World War II. The final Kindertransport came from the Netherlands and reached Britain on May 14, 1940.</p> \n<p>Each child had to have a guarantee of 50 English pounds – a considerable sum in those days&nbsp;(and worth about $3,400 today) – and the expectation was that they would leave for another country after the war. However, the majority stayed and became British citizens. “The idea was that they would only be here temporarily,” Pieren says. “No one knew what was going to happen.”</p> \n<p>The exhibition is accompanied by a panoply of events, including many that tie the experiences of Jewish refugees from Europe to more recent arrivals.</p> \n<p>It’s a link made explicit by some of the stars of the exhibition themselves. Elsa Shamash, now 91, laments the current situation in Hungary and Austria, not to mention the rise of the far-right in Germany.</p> \n<p>“I don’t feel very happy about the situation in England either,” she says in her video testimony, decrying U.K. government policy toward both refugees and migrants from former British colonies.</p> \n<p>The Kindertransport and modern-day child refugees are firmly linked in the public imagination thanks to the efforts of Dubs – one of Britain’s best-known former Kinder. He arrived in Britain alone, age 6, from Prague.</p> \n<p>A leading advocate for refugee children throughout his political career, in 2016 Dubs sponsored an eponymous amendment to allow unaccompanied children with no direct family link to the country to come to the United Kingdom. The consensus was that Britain had the capacity to absorb some 3,000 children before the amendment concluded in 2020. However, the British government has now made it clear that it will be accepting fewer than 500.</p> \n<p>To coincide with the 80th anniversary, Dubs has also launched It’s Our Turn – a campaign calling on the U.K. government to echo the experience of 1938-39 by resettling 10,000 children over the next 10 years.</p> \n<p>Campaigners say United Kingdom has a far from exemplary record when it comes to providing sanctuary for children fleeing war and persecution.</p> \n<p>According to the child refugee charity Safe Passage, it has resettled just 20 unaccompanied children from conflict zones in the past two years. A further 400 minors have been accepted together with their families. (United Nations data show that more than 20,000 unaccompanied child refugees arrived in Europe in 2017 alone.)</p> \n<p>“There are hundreds of children waiting in Calais, thousands in Greece – some in circumstances so bad that they have attempted suicide,” says Safe Passage spokeswoman Rosie Rooney. “The government contention that once a child makes it to Europe they are safe doesn’t hold up.</p> \n<p>“We’re so lucky to have so many Kinder supporting us,” Rooney continues. “They are presenting an alternative to the argument that there is no space, we can’t help. The same argument was made in 1938, and now we see the Kindertransport as a proud British achievement. So just as campaigners countered that narrative in 1938, we need to counter it now.”</p> \n<p>Rooney believes the parallels resonate. “Most people agree that vulnerable children have the right to grow up in safety, and Britain has always seen itself as a humane country that helps others in need,” she says. “This is a tangible way we can demonstrate that that’s true.”</p> \n<p>Brent agrees wholeheartedly. In a world experiencing ongoing conflict, the richer countries cannot expect to sequester themselves from the consequences, he says.</p> \n<p>“I think we have to prepare to accept more refugees; it’s inevitable,” he says. “But Brexit has unleashed a wave of hatred of foreigners which is quite frightening – one of the many negative aspects of Brexit,” he says, referring to the U.K. public’s decision to leave the European Union.</p> \n<p>“People say the situation is very different” than in the ’30s, Brent says. “But these are parentless children, exploited, destitute. It may be unworthy of me, but I can’t help thinking there is an underlying racism here. I wonder if these refugees had been European, would the attitude have been the same?”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman’s announcement Wednesday that he is resigning and his&nbsp;Yisrael Beiteinu&nbsp;party is leaving Israel's ruling coalition, in the wake of the cease-fire agreements with Hamas, will almost certainly spell elections in early 2019&nbsp;– at least six months earlier than their scheduled date.</p> \n<p>It will force Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;to defend his unpopular decisions on Gaza during the election campaign, which is exactly what the prime minister had hoped to avoid. In his surprise press conference in the Knesset, Lieberman avoided blaming the prime minister directly as part of his long list of disagreements with the government’s defense policies, but it was clear who Lieberman was gunning for. Nonetheless, his statements were a blanket accusation against all the other cabinet minsters – his political rivals in the looming election.</p> \n<p>Lieberman’s timing is brilliant. But with hindsight, this was his one move – a golden opportunity to fight the upcoming election under much more favorable terms.</p> \n<p>He is facing three major political challenges:</p> \n<p>1. His Yisrael Beiteinu&nbsp;party has for a long time – practically since the last Knesset election in 2015 – been hovering perilously close to the electoral threshold, beneath which lies political extinction.</p> \n<p>2. In the fight for the hearts of right-wing voters, he faces the rampant Benjamin Netanyahu and the popular Habayit Hayehudi leader Naftali Bennett.</p> \n<p>3. His two-and-a-half years as defense minister have been far from glorious. Also, his unfortunate threat – back in the days when he still was in the opposition – to kill Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh “in 48 hours” if the bodies of Israel Defense Forces soldiers held in Gaza were not returned, has hung around his neck.</p> \n<p>By resigning now, Lieberman is stealing a march on his rival Bennett and sticking the failure of Gaza on Netanyahu. He hopes this can boost his standing with the right going into the election – an election he now plans to fight as the selfless defense minister who resigned when he was not listened to by a weak prime minister.</p> \n<p>One of Netanyahu’s motives in doing all he could to finalize a cease-fire with Hamas was to push the toxic issue of the Gaza Strip off the national agenda before the election campaign begins.</p> \n<p>His plan was to take some short-term damage from the right and rely on the swift Israeli amnesia that sets in over Gaza the moment rockets stop flying over the border.</p> \n<p>After a few news cycles and when the anger over Gaza recedes, he could get around to planning his campaign – presenting himself as the only responsible grown-up in the room.</p> \n<p>Lieberman has now preempted the prime minister by firing the starting shot for the election, which will be fought over the Gaza debacle and Netanyahu’s “weakness.” With Yisrael Beiteinu out of the governing coalition, the government can still survive theoretically with 61 Knesset members, but it won’t last for long with the slenderest of majorities.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu needs a new defense minister – Bennett plans to demand the post, and there are of course other ministerial hopefuls.</p> \n<p>Whoever he decides to appoint, or if he keeps the portfolio for himself, it will mean more coalition turmoil.

        "text":["<p>Over the past few months, Avigdor Lieberman has plied good friends with his woes as defense minister under Benjamin Netanyahu. The troubles multiplied, the distress and frustration intensified; the prime minister rejected all his recommendations and proposals about the Gaza Strip. The army treated him respectfully, even somewhat fondly, but didn’t really take him into account. Like you treat the kindly uncle or the nag who bombards you with advice and insights at Sabbath-eve meals.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu stood aside and kept mum when Education Minister Naftali Bennett, his own irritating nemesis, insulted and humiliated Lieberman on a daily basis over policy for which the chief and exclusive responsibility devolves on the prime minister. Bibi took the credit for the successes and achievements, mainly in the north. He passed on the simmering situation in Gaza to the defense minister by simply excluding himself – physically and publicly – the hostility between the premier and Lieberman that when they were at odds over who would be the next Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Lieberman was afraid that Netanyahu would fire him. The friction extended to almost every acute security issue that came up for discussion between them, but also to political issues, such as the fate of the legislation mandating the death penalty for terrorists, which Netanyahu put into deep freeze and forgot about, despite his written promise to Lieberman.</p> \n<p>Lieberman’s Knesset resignation speech was sincere and frank, up to a point – as much as a politician is capable of. He described how he had tried unsuccessfully to persuade the system to adopt his plan for the Gaza problem. He related that he had to compromise time and again and to pass up on his positions, until the cup of poison overflowed and he could take no more. It’s important to him that his resignation be seen as having been prompted by conscience and ideology, as having national motives and not being motivated by extraneous considerations.</p> \n<p>He didn’t talk about politics, poor showings in the polls, about heading an immigrants party that’s left with a shrinking base of aging Russian war veterans. He left that for the political commentators.</p> \n<p>During his two-and-a-half years as defense minister, Lieberman’s party has plummeted in the public opinion surveys. It’s now showing the equivalent of an average of five Knesset seats in the polls. The security stardust that covered him by dint of the fact that he hobnobbed with generals appears not to have translated into an electoral big bang. The whole defense minister experience wasn’t good for him. He was caught between the rock of a bulldozing army and the hard place of an authoritative, controlling prime minister.</p> \n<p>Even after its chairman landed the coveted defense portfolio his party, Yisrael Beiteinu, continued to hover on the brink of the electoral threshold. Politically, his situation was better when he roamed, bored, in the fields of the opposition, appeared at “Shabbat Culture” events around the country, and sniped wickedly at the prime minister and at his predecessor, Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon.</p> \n<p>The Defense Ministry, once considered an almost essential rung on the ladder leading to the prime ministership, threatened to topple him into a political open grave, albeit one replete with muscle and intoxicating emblems of power. With an election looming – possibly in March, possibly in May – Lieberman decided to jump off the ladder, in the hope of saving Yisrael Beiteinu from political extermination.</p> \n<p>As far as can be judged at present, while we’re still in the eye of the storm, Lieberman did the right thing by getting out. As long as he was in the Defense Ministry, he couldn’t create the differentiation from Likud that will be so absolutely necessary in an election. His resignation at this time recalls the resignation of then-Finance Minister Netanyahu from the government of Ariel Sharon in August 2005, a week before the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu left just before the 11th hour, after voting several times in favor of the “disengagement.” Years later, he was still trying to dissociate himself from his support and his yes vote in the Knesset. The past eight months of taking no real action in the face of the incendiary kites and balloons and the rounds of rocket fire are a stain on Lieberman. He’ll try to make people forget the period by means of militant gung-ho declarations in the election campaign, the next battle.</p> \n<p>For the second time in a decade, we find that Gaza defines one of the senior, longest-serving politicians in Israel, more than any ministerial post he’s held. In July 2014, after the kidnapping and murder of the three Israeli teens and against the background of Israel’s reaction to rocket fire from Gaza, Lieberman pulled his party out of its merger with Likud. On Wednesday, two-and-a-half years after entering the coalition in a surprise move – with him it’s always a surprise, always filled with drama and theatrics – and serving as defense minister, he’s resigned again. And once again, it’s Gaza.</p> \n<p>It’s said that Israel can leave the Gaza Strip, but the Gaza Strip will never leave Israel. It’s the same with Avigdor Lieberman – “Yvet,” to his friends – who even in the most influential position continues to be haunted by the curse of Gaza. At least he could take pleasure in the victory of his protege, Moshe Leon, in Jerusalem’s runoff mayoral election this week.</p> \n<p>Dog day afternoon</p> \n<p>Lieberman was on edge during Tuesday afternoon’s security cabinet meeting, at which a Gaza cease-fire was decided on. “We didn’t know why he was so restless, we thought it might be because of Leon,” one of the ministers said.</p> \n<p>“We all heard what was at stake, what was liable to happen if we didn’t agree to a cease-fire,” a second minister said. “We had to make that decision, even though we weren’t comfortable with it. It’s true that Lieberman and Bennett had reservations, but it was clear that they accepted the decision. In the end, it was [Interior Minister] Arye Dery who said, “Okay, guys, we decided what we decided, but how do we go public with it?”</p> \n<p>“We looked at one another,” the minister continued. “We knew that the blood out there was boiling, that our people in Ashkelon, in Sderot wanted us to lay into [Hamas].”</p> \n<p>According to the minister, the prime minister or one of his aides called a journalist and told him that the security cabinet had voted unanimously in favor of ending the fighting. “He wanted to shed the responsibility from himself, it cost him in his health to push Lieberman, Bennett and [Justice Minister Ayelet] Shaked into the tent. But he told a half-truth. There was no vote. That’s what infuriated Yvet. That’s what broke him, according to two of his colleagues. Bennett also went wild. They both issued press communiques effectively stating that the prime minister was lying. In other times, with other prime ministers, that would have been inconceivable. Today it’s routine. No one got upset. Another day at the office. We’ve become accustomed.”</p> \n<p>The ministers find it difficult to accept Netanyahu’s management style. “Let’s say he wanted to share responsibility with us, and to signal to the nation that the entire security cabinet made a tough decision. Unpopular. That’s his right. He could have invited a Government Press Office photographer into the room and made a leader-like declaration. Why throw Bennett and Lieberman under the bus when he’s aware of their political distress? Why does he have to jab them with a pin when he knows they’re bleeding?”</p> \n<p>Why, indeed? That’s Netanyahu. His inherent recoil from war led him to make a decision that’s a two-edged sword in terms of his most loyal electoral base. Even the most loyal Bibi fanatics were asking on the social networks: What happened to Bibi? For that he deserves credit. But he’s not capable of going all the way with what he calls leadership. He has to mix it with a dollop of party hackwork, with a pinch of meanness. Maybe, and this is just dime-store psychology, he was just alarmed by himself and by the praises heaped on him by the left after the cease-fire.</p> \n<p>His predecessors would have called a press conference after the security cabinet meeting about Gaza, and explained to the public the motivations behind the decision. But Netanyahu disappeared. He absolutely evaporated. He reemerged for the first time that night, when the partial results of the municipal runoff elections became known. He tweeted triple congratulations, to the mayors-elect in Eilat, Safed and Bat Yam (though in the latter he supported the other guy).</p> \n<p>What all three have in common is that they’re identified with Netanyahu’s archrival, former education minister Gideon Sa’ar. Sa’ar gave them a lot of help in the campaign. Netanyahu is well aware of this, but it was important for him to mark the territory, to appropriate to himself their achievements. In the minor matter of the developments in the south – over which the whole country was up in arms, tires were burned at highway junctions, and shouts of “Bibi go home!” were voiced – not so much as a twitter. The muse fell silent.</p> \n<p>Hours after Lieberman’s resignation, the prime minister began consultations with the leaders of the coalition parties “with the goal of stabilizing the coalition.” The person who wanted to move up the election more than once but was blocked by his political partners, now seems to be holding onto the premiership tooth and nail. He underwent what our leaders hate most: loss of control over the events. His loss extended to all the sectors: security (it’s clear to everyone that Hamas will decide when and under what conditions the next round will be launched); political (he’s in the hands of Naftali Bennett, heaven forbid); and legal (Case 4000 is on its way to the state prosecution and the attorney general).</p> \n<p>The Likud’s MKs, who had already rehearsed the litany of revilements they would hurl at the resigning minister, were instructed by the Prime Minister’s Bureau not to overdo it against Lieberman. Netanyahu has his eyes on the next coalition. Without Yisrael Beiteinu he won’t have one.</p> \n<p>Bibi is the mirror image of Yvet: The prime minister wants to distance himself as far as possible from the event. The anger being aimed at him by Likud’s most significant base of support, in Sderot and Ashkelon, is too potent to die down any time soon. It’s not foam on the water, it’s the foam of rage on the lips. It needs time to dry.</p> \n<p>The majority opinion in the political arena is that the premier will have a hard time maintaining the coalition above water beyond the next three or four weeks. Even if he yields to Bennett’s ultimatum – the defense portfolio or an election now – a coalition of 61 MKs that’s dependent on a hooligan and borderline figure like MK Oren Hazan is unsustainable.</p> \n<p>This is particularly true because the last thing Netanyahu wants is to be seen as having capitulated to the brutal pressure of the person he (and above all, she, the Missus) abominates. Psychologically, it’s easier for him to accede to Hamas dictates. If you know what’s good for you, you’ll stay well away from the Balfour Street residence when the prime minister has to tell his wife that Bennett has been appointed defense minister. The Lady still hasn’t been able to calm down after Ayelet Shaked’s appointment as justice minister and as a permanent member of the security cabinet.</p> \n<p>According to tradition, from the 2013 coalition negotiations through the talks that followed the 2015 election, Bennett is the last one to be invited to meet with the prime minister during a crisis/establishment of a coalition. It’s one of Netanyahu’s small pleasures. The education minister no longer allows himself to take offense. Thursday, Bennett was also the last one to be called for a consultation. As expected, he made it clear that from his point of view, there was nothing to discuss – he wasn’t interested in being foreign minister or anything else. Defense minister, and nothing but defense minister. As far as the head of Habayit Hayehudi is concerned, if Netanyahu says no to him, it will be because he is concerned that Bennett, despite all the forecasts and precedents, will fly where Lieberman crashed. For Bennett, this is not a caprice, and it’s not mere ambition, it’s the essence of the essential.</p> \n<p>Habayit Hayehudi is ready to base its election campaign on the demand that Bennett be named defense minister in the next government and that Shaked retain the justice portfolio. To that end, the two will tell their supporters to shower them with votes: If we get 14 seats, what we want will materialize.</p> \n<p>It’s in that light that we should treat the first public condition conveyed by Habayit Hayehudi to the media, even as the defense minister was still explaining his reasons for resigning from the Knesset, as the first shot in the campaign.</p> \n<p>Waiting in the wings</p> \n<p>Early in the week coalition leaders were whispering that Netanyahu was no longer talking about a March 2019 election but rather about May – after Independence Day and after the echoes of the attorney general’s decisions in the three cases for which the premier is under investigation (which are expected in the first quarter of the new year) die down.</p> \n<p>An alert Hamas member at a checkpoint in Khan Yunis who was suspicious of a vehicle, forced an Israel Defense Forces soldier to open fire. That set off a violent and extensive chain reaction that led this week to the firing of some 500 rockets at Israeli communities, the resignation of the defense minister and, very probably, an early election. That’s a strategic Hamasnik in the full sense of the word.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Netanyahu met with leaders of the coalition parties. Either he really wanted to consult with them or the ritual was just for the record. As far as is known, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon (Kulanu) is pushing for dissolution of the Knesset and a March election.</p> \n<p>Interior Minister Dery (Shas), formerly against advancing the election, is now inclined to be in favor. The achievements of Shas in the municipal elections in several places, and above all, the jewel in the crown – Moshe Leon’s election in Jerusalem – has breathed new life into Dery and the Shas grass roots. Dery showed that he still has it.</p> \n<p>The political-parliamentary game that precedes every decision about an election is the reserve of the right-wing coalition. The opposition plays no part in it. After the Knesset is dissolved and a date is set, it will be the turn of the center-left camp to provide the political dramas. A great many politicians, official and others who are in their infancy or their dotage, will have to make some decisions.</p> \n<p>Three former IDF chiefs of staff – Benny Gantz, Moshe Ya’alon and Ehud Barak (possibly also Gabi Ashkenazi, though that’s unlikely) – are on the starting line. Gantz is working to establish a new party. Rightly so. Without political clout, he’ll be ground into the dust by whoever guarantees him a place on an existing slate – be it Yair Lapid, Kahlon or Netanyahu. Ya’alon lacks independent political weight, but his co-option to a group that will challenge Netanyahu’s rule is important. He brings experience, a fine record and integrity.</p> \n<p>Barak is the most aggressive and effective opposition voice against Netanyahu. He wants to be part of any such group. He believes that the center-left bloc will be hopeless without the creation of one slate that is cobbled together from several existing parties and leading figures: Barak himself, and also Gantz, Ya’alon, Dan Meridor – plus, of course, Tzipi Livni, Avi Gabbay and Yair Lapid. Any alternative option that doesn’t involve unification of the ranks will be suicidal.</p> \n<p>In every election campaign, Barak says, the center-left camp tends to cannibalize itself. In this case, Lapid will be strengthened only if he takes seats from Zionist Union; Avi Gabbay will recover only if he gets back voters who defected to Lapid’s Yesh Atid party. It’s a sure recipe for the rise of the right to power. When all of them are together, there is no infighting, no cannibalizing. There is one common goal: to topple the existing government.</p> \n<p>Only one small decision is needed: Who No. 1 on the list is going to be. Who our candidate for prime minister will be. Easy.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In ancient times, Arab tribesmen dug diversion tunnels to protect their low-lying trading post of Petra against desert flash floods. More than two millennia later, an alarm system warns visitors if flood water rushes toward what has become Jordan’s main tourist attraction.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month, the alarms were activated for the first time, said Hussein al-Hasanat of the Petra Development &amp; Tourism Region Authority. Sirens blared minutes before a torrent fed by heavy rains approached the UNESCO World Heritage site carved into rose-hued rock face.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of tourists were able to seek higher ground and were later evacuated, he said.</p> \n<p>Amateur video posted online at the time showed visitors running through a steep, narrow canyon leading to the Treasury, Petra’s main draw, as guides urged them to hurry. Later, visitors were seen standing on a higher patch near the Treasury as knee-high water poured through the canyon.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in Jordan, such alarms are still missing. Thirty-four people were killed in flash floods in late September and early November.</p> \n<p>The last fatal flash flood struck Petra in 1963 when 22 French tourists and a local guide were killed by rapidly rising waters. In response, Jordan’s Department of Antiquities built a dam to keep water from entering the canyon leading to the Treasury.</p> \n<p>In 2014, the alarm system was installed as added protection, with sirens set to go off when flood water rises above a certain level.</p> \n<p>On Nov. 9, the system was triggered for the first time, through a computer in the Petra Authority’s control room. The computer is connected to eight rain forecast systems and two water detection stations placed in the area, within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of Petra.</p> \n<p>The network generates instant data allowing officials to measure possible danger and warn people by the time the water reaches Petra.</p> \n<p>Omar Dajani, a meteorologist at the Arabia Weather company, said alarms should be installed in all vulnerable areas in Jordan.</p> \n<p>He said urban sprawl has exacerbated the flood risk, which is particularly high in dry areas.</p> \n<p>“Now towns have spread so much and many of them were not built with respect for the geography of the region, such as valleys for example, where the water has naturally caused floods for millions of years,” Dajani said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>House Democrats unveiled a draft rules package Thursday for how they would govern the chamber when they take over the majority in the new Congress next year.</p> \n<p>The changes are large and small, from a requirement to post legislation at least 72 hours before action is taken to restoring some floor rights for the resident commissioner from Puerto Rico and other nonvoting delegates.</p> \n<p>One change, proposed by Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who is Muslim, clarifies the 180-year-old rule against wearing hats on the House floor to allow for religious headwear, including headscarves.</p> \n<p>The rules package is traditionally the first vote of the new Congress. It is considered a reflection of a party’s priorities and influences legislation.</p> \n<p>The draft from incoming Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., and backed by Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, was presented Thursday as Democrats met privately to prepare for the new year.</p> \n<p>The topics touch on several areas — budgeting, oversight, diversity and the legislative process, among others.</p> \n<p>It ensures that the first bill of the new Congress, H.R. 1, will be a sweeping package of good-government reforms, with provisions on voting rights and campaign finance. It is being crafted by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md.</p> \n<p>Many of the rules being proposed sweep away those Republicans had put in place when they took over the majority after the 2010 elections.</p> \n<p>For example, Democrats would end the GOP’s practice of using so-called dynamic scoring to count the revenue that would come from expected economic growth to help offset the costs of a bill. Republicans used dynamic scoring last year to help pass tax cuts.</p> \n<p>The Democrats would also revert back to the Gephardt Rule, named after former Democratic leader Dick Gephardt, which automatically allows for increases in the nation’s debt limit as part of passing the annual budget. It’s a way to reduce the political showdowns that have become common over the vote to raise the government’s borrowing authority.</p> \n<p>Other proposed rules, in the case of the 72-hour posting, amplify what the GOP majority had set out to do with their own three-day rule, which sometimes resulted in a Republican bill being posted minutes before midnight to allow for a vote as quickly as possible.</p> \n<p>The package would stand up Pelosi’s new office of diversity, which is expected to help hire and promote minorities to jobs on Capitol Hill, an effort that Democrats started right before they lost the majority in 2010. And it would change the name of the Education and Workforce Committee back to Education and Labor, in a nod to unions.</p> \n<p>As Congress struggles to update its sexual harassment laws, it would clarify that nondisclosure agreements “cannot prohibit a staffer from speaking” to the compliance or ethics offices.</p> \n<p>The package remains a work in progress, aides said. McGovern has been convening lawmakers for weeks to gather input, and the 12-page document is stamped throughout with invitations — “Your Idea Here” — for more input.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the coalition crisis in a statement to the nation Sunday evening, saying that in a period of unstable security, early elections are the wrong move.</p> \n<p>&quot;We are in a particularly complex security situation...In times like these, you do not overthrow a government. It's irresponsible. We have another full year until elections,&quot; Netanyahu said in a press conference in Tel Aviv after meeting Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon.</p> \n<p>&quot;We are in an intensifying battle, and in the middle of a battle we don't abandon our posts. In the middle of a battle we do not play politics. The security of the nation is beyond politics, and the security of the nation is also beyond personal concerns,&quot; Netanyahu added.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: Netanyahu's non-election election speech&nbsp;■ Top 12 reasons Netanyahu will lose the upcoming early elections</p> \n<p>Netanyahu said he warned the coalition party heads against dissolving the government. &quot;I told them that we cannot repeat the mistakes that members of the government made in 1992 when they dissolved a Likud government, forming the government that gave us the disastrous&nbsp;Oslo Accords. I told them we cannot make the same mistakes as the government in 1999, when they dissolved and brought the Intifada upon us.&quot;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu also announced that he intends to keep the defense portfolio and said he understands the public's criticism of recent events in Gaza, but asserted he has a plan: &quot;I will not say when we will act and how. I have a clear plan. I know what to do and when to do it. And we will do it.&quot;</p> \n<p>Outgoing Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman&nbsp;resigned last Wednesday&nbsp;over the cease-fire in Gaza, firing the opening salvo of the election season. Lieberman's departure left Netanyahu with a razor-thin majority of 61 Knesset seats. Habayit Hayehudi threatened right after Lieberman's resignation that if Netanyahu does not appoint Bennett as defense minister, the party will leave the coalition.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu&nbsp;met with Finance Minister&nbsp;Moshe Kahlon, the head of Kulanu, Sunday evening in a last-ditch effort to avoid early elections. Kahlon's office said the meeting ended without results and the two will meet again later in the week.</p> \n<p>Sources in the Finance Minister's Office told Haaretz that the meeting was short and only lasted half an hour. According to the sources, Kahlon entered Netanyahu's office as IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot was leaving. The sources added that the prime minister did not offer any concrete suggestions for&nbsp;the appointment of a defense or foreign minister, or for strengthening the coalition.</p> \n<p>Earlier, sources close to Netanyahu said he plans to appoint a foreign minister. A senior Likud official told Haaretz that Netanyahu's decision was primarily technical in nature and was the result of concern that the High Court of Justice would not permit him to serve as both foreign minister and defense minister at the same time as prime minister.</p> \n<p>The appointment of a foreign minister is also relevant if elections are called and the current government becomes a transitional government, the source said, because ministers cannot be appointed once it becomes a transitional government in the run-up to elections.</p> \n<p>Responding to Netanyahu's speech, opposition leader Tzipi Livni (Zionist Union) said: &quot;With Bibi, security speeches are just election propoganda and Bennett has learned from the master. Every day, every speech, every political statement clarifies this&nbsp;–&nbsp;we cannot leave the country’s security in their hands... Those who mix politics with security cannot be responsible for the safety of Israeli citizens.&quot;</p> \n<p>Former IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz also responded to Netanyahu speech, saying, &quot;it is the obligation of policy makers to act responsibly, not to exploit our righteous and essential war of defense for personal or political gain.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>'All the way'</p> \n<p>Following Netanyahu's speech, a source close to Bennett said the education minister and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, who is also a member of Habayit Hayehudi, intend to resign on Monday over Netanyahu's refusal to hand Bennett the defense portfolio. Habayit Hayehudi will hold a special press conference on the coalition crisis on Monday.</p> \n<p>Bennett apparently told his aides that &quot;he intends to go all the way&quot; if Netanyahu will not give him the job. Other sources in Habayit Hayehudi, however, said that the party's upcoming press conference is an attempt to put pressure on Netanyahu to act, but it is still unclear at this stage if the process will end in resignation.</p> \n<p>Bennett and Shaked have yet to respond.</p> \n<p>The right-wing Habayit Hayehudi party, which is headed by Bennett, said that Netanyahu's appointment of a foreign minister &quot;doesn't matter one bit&quot; and that immediate elections must be held if Bennett is not handed the defense portfolio. The party also accused the right-wing government of behaving like a leftist government.</p> \n<p>The prime minister canceled his weekly meeting with coalition party heads in order to try and prevent his government's dissolution and delay the impending early elections. The weekly Likud minister's forum was also canceled. The cabinet meeting was held as scheduled.</p> \n<p>In their meeting Thursday, Kahlon told Netanyahu that the right thing for the citizens and the economy of Israel is to call elections as soon as possible. He said that the current political situation does not allow for the necessary economic stability, and therefore the responsible thing to do is to form a new, strong and stable government.

She is frightened, according to her, by the joining of hands between leftist and rightist anti-Semites and Muslims in Europe. Her fear, though, is the fear of the newly blind who is so helpless as to try to scare everyone around her. Only a politically blind and highly biased person can fail to see who are joining hands in Europe. Israel is joining hands with the worst of the so-called old anti-Semites in Europe, and Jews and Muslims are the intended victims of this hatred. She fears that even the United States is not immune to the spread of left-right anti-Semitism, yet she fails to see the warm-hearted embrace of Israel by wild, messianic evangelicals, who are supporters of Donald Trump and Jew-haters to the core. Ms Altshuler‘s Zionism poses a real danger to Jews everywhere. It is an ideology that celebrates anti-Semitism, since without it, it loses its raison d’etre.</p> \n<p>Isaac Cohen</p> \n<p>via Haaretz.com</p> \n<p>Whose statements are anti-Semitic, Corbyn’s or Sacks’?</p> \n<p>It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand that the essence of Zionism is exactly what Mor Altshuler is advocating, and this would relate to all Jews throughout the world no matter what country they’re in. It doesn’t seem to bother anyone that when she claims Jews have a “homeland” to go to, it actually means that all Jews who are defined as such are not in their homeland unless they’re in Israel. Since the author brings up former British Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks and his thoughts on Jeremy Corbyn, why not focus on Sacks’ remarks, which if spoken by Corbyn would be claimed to be most “anti-Semitic.”&nbsp;It was Rabbi Sacks who wrote the article “Israel: The Heart of Judaism.” which means that Israel has become the religion and we can throw Judaism out the window if there are Jews who don’t feel that way, which would include members of my own family. If Israel is indeed the “heart of Judaism,” as he wrote in his article, then it is Rabbi Sacks who has made a grave insult against the Jewish religion because what he’s saying is that being supreme and being the oppressor of other people is in accordance with Judaism. Tell me if that should not be considered “anti-Semitic” or, in its proper terminology, “anti-Jewish”? But the most damning anti-Jewish statements is when he wrote in his article, “The sages said, ‘Whoever lives outside Israel is as if he had no God,” “Without a land and state, Judaism is a shadow of itself,” “Israel is the only place where Jews have been able to live Judaism in anything other than an edited edition, continuing the story their ancestors began.” Outrageous statements because his message is that Jews collectively cannot be real Jews in Britain, or anywhere else except Israel. So in other words, if all the real Jews are in Israel, then all who are not in Israel are obviously “fake” Jews because their loyalties should be to Israel in order to have a God. Yet, Rabbi Sacks, like too many other people, have the audacity to condemn Jeremy Corbyn and nitpick at any statement he has made to accuse him of “anti-Semitism.” when his own statement would be “anti-Jewish” to the core if it were said by Corbyn. If there is any moral to the story, it is: If you don’t support Israel regardless of what it does, then you are “anti-Semitic” or a “self-hating Jew.” Otherwise, no problem.</p> \n<p>Marlene Newesri via Haaretz.com</p> \n<p>That’s Reform, not Conservative</p> \n<p>In response to ‘Nobody is going to tell me that I’m a traitor’ (Nov. 18).</p> \n<p>In the interesting and candid interview with Dr. David Myers, there is one statement that requires correction. He is quoted as saying, “For example, I am not thrilled with Conservative rabbis performing a Jewish wedding ceremony for interfaith couples.” As a prominent historian and new head of the New Israel Fund, surely Dr. Myers should know that Conservative rabbis are not permitted to perform interfaith marriages and, if they do, they are immediately subject to expulsion from the Rabbinical Assembly, the organization of Conservative rabbis. This policy has been in force for many years and was recently reviewed by a special commission of the Rabbinical Assembly. It was reaffirmed by the commission and by the Committee of Jewish Law and Standards of the R.A.&nbsp; As a former international president of the Rabbinical Assembly and a current member of its Law Committee, I can assure Dr. Meyers that the few rabbis who have not adhered to this ruling have either resigned or been expelled by the organization. Perhaps Dr. Myers intended to mention Reform rabbis since they are permitted to do that and do so.

        "text":["<p>MILAN, Italy – Hidden in the guts of Stazione Centrale, Milan’s impressive train station, which was inaugurated during the fascist era and now serves 120 million railway passengers per year, is the point where fascist Italy converges with Nazi Germany: Platform 21. This is the platform where postal items were loaded onto freight trains, heading to their destinations around Europe. This is also where Jews, and non-Jewish dissidents, were loaded onto cattle cars heading to their destinations around Europe: the camps of Fossoli, Bolzano, Mathausen, Bergen-Belsen, Ravensbruck, Flossenb&uuml;rg and Auschwitz-Birkenau. Twenty such transports that left for the concentration and death camps, from December 1943 to January 1945, while on the upper floor passenger trains continued to rush toward European cities.</p> \n<p>Platform 21 was transformed into a Holocaust memorial in 2013. In its heart, a few of the original cars are standing along a short track, which ends in an exposed space, from which the train cars with their human cargo were brought up to the station level. Out of sight. At the entrance to the memorial – above which the rumbling of trains coming in and out make one shiver– a huge inscription reading “Indifference” greets visitors.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“Indifference is worse than violence,” says Liliana Segre, an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor and a newly appointed senator, who insisted on inscribing that word on the huge stone.</p> \n<p>Segre was one of 25 Jewish children under the age of 14, out of a total of 776 deported children, who were deported from Italy to Auschwitz and survived. She was 13 when she boarded a train that departed from Platform 21 for Auschwitz on January 30, 1944 with her father. But for her and over 7,500 other Italian Jews deported to the death camps, the journey to hell had begun many years before, on November 17, 1938, when Benito Mussolini’s Racial Laws against Jews went into effect. Eighty years ago this week.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How a Jewish historian helped Benigni fend off Holocaust denial charges in ‘Life is Beautiful'</p> \n<p>The racist laws had been preceded by publication of the “Manifesto of Race,” which was signed by 10 senior scientists in July 1938, purporting to give it a scientific basis. Signed without hesitation by King Vittorio Emanuele III, the statutes were meant to ban Jews from society and humiliated them. They included a series of prohibitions that became increasingly rigid, up through the spring of 1945. They ranged from bans on intermarriage, schooling in public institutions, working in state entities, membership in the Fascist Party, and participation in the “free” professions, to prohibitions on ownership of real estate above a certain value, renting out rooms to non-Jews, peddling and trading in wool, to forbidding involvement in the realms of music, theater, acrobatics, management of dance studios, along with owning radios, being listed in the phone books, publishing death notices and raising carrier pigeons.</p> \n<p>The sky fell on about 50,000 Italian Jews, the oldest Jewish community in Europe, about 10 percent of whom were registered in 1933 with the Fascist Party. All of a sudden, well-established, patriotic families with deep roots in the country, who saw themselves as Italian in every respect – some of whom had even lived there for hundreds of years, like Segre’s forebears – were stripped of all civil rights. In the fall of 1943, along with the invasion&nbsp;of German forces and the establishment of the Italian Socialist Republic of Salo, came the physical persecution as well.</p> \n<p>Segre, who was born in Milan in September 1930 was 8 years old when the Laws were enacted. “A very happy, serene, slightly naughty little girl, upon whom my father and grandparents heaped endless love,” says Segre, who lost her mother at a tender age.</p> \n<p>“I grew up in a secular, you could say atheist family, in which there were no religious symbols and which did not celebrate (Jewish) holidays,” she recently told Haaretz during an interview in her Milan home, where a Hanukkah menorah stands out today, adding, “I wasn’t even aware that I was Jewish.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; ‘I will sue anyone offending Mussolini’: Granddaughter of Italian fascist sparks online war</p> \n<p>The revelation of her Jewish identity caught her by surprise: On the day her father informed her that she had been expelled from school – the very same school that her children and grandchildren would later attend.</p> \n<p>“This word, ‘expelled,’ was a terrible word in my eyes,” says Segre, a tall, elegant woman who speaks gently, with restrained intensity, devoid of pathos. “I didn’t understand why. I didn’t understand what I’d done wrong.”</p> \n<p>For the first time in her life, the mischievous and happy girl felt “different” from her friends, most of which faded slowly out of her life. Even her beloved teacher did not seek to comfort or embrace her when Segre was expelled, and made do with a comment about not having been the one that legislated the racist laws. A pervasive feeling of abandonment and loneliness grew in her family, which could not find comfort in the local Jewish community, with whom they did not have ties.</p> \n<p>“Some Jews understood what was happening and left Italy, some understood but lacked the means to leave, and others, like my family, didn’t want to leave because they didn’t believe what had happened could ever happen, and stayed until it was too late,” Segre recalls.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Soros comments to Haaretz get Italy's state media chief sued in political storm</p> \n<p>Indeed, when she and her father Alberto tried to escape to Switzerland on December, 1943 – after believing they had secured the grandparents’ safety – it was already too late. Swiss border police sent them back to Italy, whereupon they were arrested, sent to San Vittore prison in Milan and were then, after 40 days, loaded onto a cattle car destined for Auschwitz. Alberto and his own parents, who were subsequently arrested, were murdered in the death camp. Liliana, who looked older than her 13 years, was sent to forced labor in a weapons factory nearby, and survived.</p> \n<p>“You only survive by chance in Auschwitz, by luck, not because you are clever or smarter,” she says. “But you can never escape from Auschwitz, as Primo Levi said.”</p> \n<p>The persecution of Italian Jews increased gradually. Six years before the Racial Laws, Il Duce claimed in an interview with a Swiss Jewish journalist, Emil Ludwig, that there was no anti-Semitism in Italy, and even praised the Jews. “As citizens, Italian Jews have always behaved properly, and as soldiers they fought bravely,” he said.</p> \n<p>Until establishment of Mussolini’s Salo Republic and the Nazi invasion, in autumn 1943, the fascist racist laws did not threaten the lives of Italy’s Jews.</p> \n<p>Driven by love of power</p> \n<p>“Mussolini was an anti-Semite ‘inside,’ but not an unbridled one like Hitler,” Michele Sarfatti, an Italian historian who specializes in Jewish history under fascist rule, tells Haaretz in an interview in his home in Milano.</p> \n<p>“He was a pragmatic leader. On the one hand, he could write articles tinged with anti-Semitism and attack the ‘racist fraternity between Bolshevik Jews in Russia, liberal Jews in London and capitalist Jews in New York’ – a classic anti-Semitic speech. On the other hand, he had no problem conducting close relations with Jews like [journalist and socialist politician] Claudio Treves or Margherita Sarfatti,” Mussolini’s lover of 20 years, who shared his fascist ideology and wrote his first official biography, “Dux.”</p> \n<p>“It is true that until his regime was solidly established, Mussolini was not reluctant to use violence or to allow fascist bullies’ attacks on the streets, but after 1925 he wasn’t interested in street violence as was prevalent in Germany. With few exceptions, there was no burning books or Kristallnacht in Italy,” says Sarfatti. “Under the new fascist order, oppressing Jews and opponents of the regime was supposed to be done by the police, without killing, without establishing violent camps like Dachau.”</p> \n<p>The situation changed drastically on September 8, 1943, a month-and-a-half after Mussolini was deposed and incarcerated, on the very day the new government announced the signing of an armistice between Italy and the Allies, and the very day the Italians found out that their king and prime minister had deserted them and fled to territories held under Allied control. Within days, Nazi forces entered the beleaguered country, released Mussolini from jail, installed him as the head of a puppet state in northern Italy – the Socialist Republic of Salo – and embarked on implementing the Final Solution.</p> \n<p>According to Sarfatti, nearly 7,500 Jews out of some 50,000 were deported to death camps between September 1943 and Italy’s liberation in April 1945. Over 5,900 of them were exterminated, over 800 survived, and another 300 were murdered on Italian territory.</p> \n<p>“He exchanged the lives of Italy’s Jews for Nazi support for his regime. After his release from jail, he could have said ‘enough, I’m old and tired’ – without the Nazis executing him – but his hunger for power was so strong that he was ready to sacrifice not only Italy’s Jews, but also the regions of Trento and Trieste for it,” says Sarfatti.</p> \n<p>The historian adds that Mussolini “had known since 1942, perhaps without all the details, about the camps, about the acts of mass slaughter in the Soviet Union, about the use of gas. As one who used gas himself in the conquest of Ethiopia, he knew very well what the use of gas meant.”</p> \n<p>In the fall of 1945, at age 15, Segre returned home to Milano – after almost a year in Auschwitz, the death march to Germany, and four months in a DP camp where, she recalls, she ate “day and night” and gained 10 kilos every month. Upon her return, her maternal grandparents, who had found refuge in a convent in Rome, were granted custody of her.</p> \n<p>“They saw a fat, clumsy, ugly, difficult, wounded, grumbling girl,” she says. “It was hard for them, and I wanted them to accept me as I was …. They were good people, they loved me, and I loved them, but I wanted to live with Susanna, the maid who had lived in our home 47 years and loved all of us deeply. She had saved the family pictures and my grandmother’s jewelry for me. Upon her death, she left her money to a priest to pray for us for 10 years.”</p> \n<p>Slowly, Segre began to readjust to daily life, studies and love. In 1951 she married Alfredo Belli Paci, a Catholic who was sent, along with some 600,000 other Italians, to a concentration camp for refusing to serve the Republic of Salo.</p> \n<p>“He understood me when he saw the tattoo on my arm,” she once said in an interview. “He wasn’t shocked. He didn’t flee.”</p> \n<p>With him she raised their three children and was by his side until he died 10 years ago.</p> \n<p>“We met on the beach. We fell in love within days. It was a beautiful love,” she says softly.</p> \n<p>‘Too tragic’</p> \n<p>Like many Holocaust survivors, Segre kept silent for many years. “There were no words, it was too powerful, too tragic. We didn’t want to talk, and they didn’t want to listen.”</p> \n<p>At 60, after the birth of her grandchildren, she felt that she had to pass her personal testimony on to the next generations. Since then, she has visited schools across Italy telling her story and the story of Italian Jewry.</p> \n<p>“None of us will be left in 10 years, and the Holocaust will become a line in history books, and later not even that,” she says.</p> \n<p>Segre’s appointment last January by President Sergio Mattarella as senator for life (“I am aware of age limitations,” she says smiling) gave her immediate media exposure, and essentially turned her into a living, breathing symbol of a period that Italy has repressed for 80 years. A repression historian Anna Foa has called “collective amnesia.”</p> \n<p>“Italy never opened its closet of shame,” says Segre. “After the war, suddenly there were no fascists. Everyone suddenly became Christian Democrats, Communists … but Italy was fascist, just like Germany was Nazi. The people were deeply in love with these theories.”</p> \n<p>After the liberation of Italy in April 1945 by Allied troops and the subsequent introduction of a general amnesty, “the state acted like racism and anti-Semitism had never been here,” says historian Sarfatti. “Everything was forgotten.”</p> \n<p>“Besides a few senior leaders who were tried and executed, no one was forced to do soul-searching or to answer for his part in the fascist regime. Everyone returned to the fold, sometimes to the exact same role,” he adds.</p> \n<p>Gad Luzzatto Voghera, a historian and lecturer at Sapienza University of Rome, and director of the Foundation Jewish Contemporary Documentation Center, agrees that Italy hasn’t done any soul-searching about its fascist past. He attributes this mainly to the desire and need to unify and rebuild the defeated, destroyed and divided country, where fascists and communists continued their reciprocal campaigns of revenge and murder through mid-1945.</p> \n<p>“The rebuilding of Italy being the country’s top priority, all the anti-fascist groups decided to stop the civil war and to start a ‘soft’ transition to democracy,” Luzzatto Voghera tells Haaretz. “However, in order to do this they had to reactivate all state institutions – the civil service, the army, the police, the court system, the schools – that had been shaped and manned for 20 years by the fascist regime, most of whose members were diehards.”</p> \n<p>Under such conditions, he adds, “Italy was incapable of, nor did it want to engage in any profound reckoning. Even today, from a distance of 80 years, it remains very hard.”</p> \n<p>But it seems that in recent years something has started to change. In 2000 the parliament declared the date of the liberation of Auschwitz, January 27, as Holocaust Memorial Day. In 2003, it unanimously approved a law to establish a National Museum of Italian Judaism and the Shoah in Ferrara; it opened in 2017. In 2013, Platform 21, which was for years consigned to oblivion in the national consciousness together with the Racial Laws, was converted into a Holocaust memorial. In 2014, the City of Rome gave the green light to build a Holocaust museum in Il Duce’s official residence, Villa Torlonia.</p> \n<p>Last year, the laws were among the subjects included, for the first time, in matriculation exams. This year, which marks the 80th anniversary of the enactment of the anti-Semitic legislation, the media has been addressing the topic nonstop, drawing a direct correlation between the laws and the Holocaust. There is almost no newspaper or current events program that doesn’t discuss these subject, that don’t seek an interview with Senator Segre or one of the few remaining survivors.</p> \n<p>“I’ve already heard some complaints of an ‘overdose,’” Segre says. “People tell me, ‘Enough with the 80 years.’ On the one hand, it’s positive. On the other, many are sick of it by now. We are indeed a tiny minority. People think we are a million, or a million and a half, but we’re barely 40,000” out of a total population of more than 60 million.</p> \n<p>Besides the widespread media coverage, 90 universities around Italy this year issued a first-ever apology for their part in expelling thousands of Jewish students, lecturers and employees from their institutions in order to comply with the Racial Laws. Sarfatti does not applaud this initiative.</p> \n<p>“Apology creates pathos in society, and that’s okay, but it must be accompanied by practical steps, with research grants, relevant school curricula [studying the Racial Laws isn’t mandatory], restoration of Jewish names that were replaced by fascist names,” he says. “In the medical department of the University of Bari, for example, there is an auditorium named for Nicola Pende, one of the 10 signatories on the scientists’ manifesto. Let them remove his name before they apologize.”</p> \n<p>Sarfatti estimates that 10 to 15 percent of Italians are what he calls people “who don’t do anti-Semitism” – but he is worried by the racist winds blowing through the country, ruled by a government in which a far-right party sits.</p> \n<p>“There is an iron pact between racism and anti-Semitism,” he says. “Racism has already ‘gotten clearance,’ and I don’t know what will happen if anti-Semitism does as well”</p> \n<p>This year, after her senatorial appointment, Segre warned against the plan by Interior Minister Matteo Salvini to conduct a census of the Roma and Sinti in Italy, noting that a similar move was the first step in implementing the racist laws against the Jews and their deportation to camps, eight decades ago. She says she is trying to advance two legislative initiatives in her new role – one against hate speech and another that would require high-school classes studying the 20th century to learn about all crimes of genocide crimes including, she notes, those involving “the Armenians, Stalin’s purges, the Holocaust, the Tutsi, Cambodia and Yugoslavia….”</p> \n<p>Segre is careful with her terminology. She speaks of “Italians of the Jewish faith,” not of “Italian Jews”; of “racist laws,” not “Racial Laws.” She says she doesn’t really see the parallels between the fascist era and the situation existing in her country today, “even if we have one guy who says things belonging to the realm of fascism.” It’s a different period, she observes: “People already have their idols – singers, soccer players, bloggers. Who among the young people would be willing to die for Italy?”</p> \n<p>Despite the racist laws, despite the murder of her family, despite Auschwitz, Liliana Segre, who lives not far from Platform 21 and the jail where she was held for 40 days at age 13, says today that she doesn’t feel betrayed by Italy and the Italians.</p> \n<p>“Were the French (Jews) betrayed by France? The Germans by Germany? The Poles by Poland?” she says. “Who can we exonerate of this inborn anti-Semitism?”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Everyone knows that “It’s sad to be / the mayor of Jerusalem,” as Yehuda Amichai’s famous poem “The Mayor” says. “It’s terrible. / How can a man be the mayor of such a city? / What will he do with it? / He’ll build and build and build. / And at night the stones of the mountains crawl down and surround the stone houses / Like wolves coming to howl at the dogs / Who have become the slaves of men.”</p> \n<p>And Amichai’s description is true – it is a treacherous and unbearably difficult job. The pressures on the occupant of the office are incredible. It is not just the stones of the surrounding hills that want a part of the city, but also every one of the many communities that comprise it. It would seem that because of this, Moshe Leon actually has a chance of being a good mayor. He is a talented manager, he is endowed with excellent negotiating skills and is a man of patience, a sense of humor and level-headedness.</p> \n<p>But Leon is carrying many heavy burdens that could trip him up. First of all is his complete and total dependence on the ultra-Orthodox parties, Degel Hatorah and Shas, and his political patrons ‒ Arye Dery and Avigdor Lieberman.</p> \n<p>Another sneaky suspicion is that Leon is not “sad” enough about the burden of the job. In other words, he does not understand the full weight of the task imposed on him. The evidence lies in a collection of ridiculous promises he made during the campaign including a 200,000-shekel ($54,000) loan for every young couple and free parking, along with other actions like ignoring entire communities in the city and the launching of a cynical fake news campaign by his activists during the last few days before the election.</p> \n<p>To succeed in his new job, Leon will have to devote attention to the big problems in Jerusalem and, at the same time, to give the feeling that everyone — including the Hasidim of Agudat Yisrael, the nonreligious, the leftists and the Palestinians – all have a place in the city, too.</p> \n<p>The first of the big problems is East Jerusalem. The capital cannot become a normal city benefitting its residents without a deep improvement in the situation in the Arab neighborhoods of the city. Forty percent of the city’s residents live in the east part of the city, even if they are not Israeli citizens. A change for the better began in some of the neighborhoods during Nir Barkat’s term as mayor, and Leon must continue this trend and accelerate it. So far, it does not look like this issue is on his agenda.</p> \n<p>The second serious problem is public transportation. Nothing affects the daily life of Jerusalemites more than the clogged traffic arteries of the capital and the poor service provided by public transit operators.</p> \n<p>The third major issue is the city’s image, both among its own residents and all Israelis. If Jerusalem wraps itself in an image of a dark city of zealots controlled by reactionary forces – it will distance itself from the creative and business sectors. This is why Leon needs to rein in his Haredi partners, who will want to change the status quo regarding Shabbat, exclude women from municipal ceremonies and notice boards and even place limitations on the Gay Pride march.</p> \n<p>The fourth major challenge is the mixed neighborhoods. Knesset member Rachel Azaria (Kulanu), who ran for mayor but withdrew her candidacy, forecast years ago that Jerusalem would have two types of Jewish neighborhoods: Haredi and mixed. This was a precise diagnosis. The challenge is not in finding a way to preserve the borders of the secular space, but in the ability to learn to live together in the same neighborhood without the nonreligious community feeling it is not welcome in its home and streets any more. This may be an impossible mission and the game in these neighborhoods is a zero-sum game – but at the very least, the mayor needs to give nonreligious residents the feeling that he cares about them.</p> \n<p>In addition to all these problems, Leon must realize that he does not just stand at the helm of the &quot;rock of our existence,&quot; a historic and holy city, but also at the head of a modern city of the 21st century. Jerusalem needs to develop as a city of pedestrians and cyclists, with a strong and diversified business center, flourishing cultural institutions and a healthy urban environment – and with proper dog parks. The capital must be a city with excellent services, free of corruption, and a good educational system. Most importantly, it must be a city whose mayor is proud of its cultural, religious and human diversity and views all this as a resource and not an obstacle.</p> \n<p>Over 100,000 Jerusalemites voted for Ofer Berkovitch and many of them feel today that this vision is completely absurd in the face of the Leon era. They think Leon’s Jerusalem is everything but a city that is green, cultured, diverse and free of corruption. Leon has rightfully earned all these suspicions but fairness requires us to give him a chance to prove they are wrong.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; What Israel's local election results mean for Jerusalem, Israel and Jews everywhere | Analysis</p> \n<p>We can always come back to Amichai: “What does Jerusalem need?

        "text":["<p>The residents of the &quot;Gaza envelope&quot; (Otef Aza), the Israeli towns and agricultural settlements bordering Gaza, have been demonstrating&nbsp; against &nbsp;Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu – and they have good reason to do so.</p> \n<p>His &quot;crisis management&quot; approach has failed to deliver the basic prerequisite that every citizen is due – a peaceful existence. For Netanyahu, crisis management means dodging both war and peace negotiations.</p> \n<p>His efforts to maneuver between outright war and long-term peace negotiations have led to cycles of violence between Israel and Hamas, pushing the lives of the inhabitants of the Gaza envelope into a constantly deteriorating nightmare.</p> \n<p>To his credit, Netanyahu has come to understand what many opportunistic right-wing politicians are not willing to admit: War is not the solution to the confrontation with Hamas.</p> \n<p>This is abundantly clear in light of the fact that Israeli forces controlled the Gaza Strip for decades (1967-2005) and were not able to eradicate terror. In fact, prior to the evacuation of Gaza in 2005, around 25 Israelis were killed there every single year.</p> \n<p>Once we realize, like Netanyahu, that the gains from military confrontations are limited, we have to choose between one of two options: The first, mass deportation of Palestinians; the second, a diplomatic solution. After the first option is disqualified, we are left with the second, diplomacy. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, Netanyahu refuses to negotiate with Hamas, arguing that it is as extreme as ISIS, when in fact it is innately different from ISIS, al-Qaeda and other Islamist militants.</p> \n<p>The differences between the Hamas and ISIS are manifested in their worldview and actions. There is a profound ideological chasm between them, which leads to mutual denigration, and in some instances, to violence.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What is more, their relations with Israel are distinctly different. For example, Hamas held indirect negotiations with Israel several times, be it the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange, or after every round of violence in Gaza. ISIS, which threatens Israel from the Sinai, is nowhere near even indirect speaking terms with Israel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The Enemy Just Blinked: Why Hamas's New Charter Is a Big Deal&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;ISIS Wants to Build a Base in Palestine. Trump's Just Helped it Recruit</p> \n<p>A quick comparison between the ideologies of Hamas and Islamist militants, such as ISIS and al-Qaeda, demonstrates that Netanyahu’s comparison is completely unfounded.</p> \n<p>They profoundly disagree over a whole host of matters.</p> \n<p>Whereas Hamas grudgingly and indirectly accepted Israel’s existence in its new charter of 2017, ISIS and al-Qaeda consider such a compromise to be betrayal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whereas Hamas recognizes the international political order based on states, ISIS and al-Qaeda reject the notion of states and aspires to substitute them with a Caliphate; whereas Hamas participated in the democratic elections of 2006, ISIS and al-Qaeda view democracy as apostasy; whereas Hamas is closely attuned to Gazans' wishes and views, ISIS ignores the opinions of the people over which they rule and even justifies mass killings of ordinary Muslims.</p> \n<p>Due to these differences, and primarily Hamas’s tacit acquiescing to the existence of the State of Israel, Hamas is indeed a potential partner for diplomatic negotiations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In order to move beyond Netanyahu’s &quot;no war and no negotiations&quot; gridlock for Gaza and the Israelis living next door, we need to think critically about the underlying assumptions of Israel’s ruling right-wing parties, which reject peace negotiations, yet fail to eliminate terror.</p> \n<p>The first assumption to dispute is that it is impossible to negotiate with Hamas because it is as extreme as ISIS. &nbsp;It is not. Rather, it is a tough and lethal enemy that has come to understand, like Netanyahu, the limits of its own power.</p> \n<p>It's time to talk to all Palestinians about all topics – and include Hamas in the conversation.</p> \n<p>Professor Nimrod Hurvitz is a co-founder of the Forum for Regional Thinking and teaches at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev</p>",

Contrary to his public disavowals, he was a full partner (“a responsible policy is needed”) in the policy of permissiveness being carried out, for quite some time now, by Benjamin Netanyahu and the defense establishment.</p> \n<p>As defense minister, Lieberman did not put up a real fight against the prime minister, who declined to task the IDF with destroying the terror infrastructure and capacities in Gaza. In his meetings with the military chiefs, Lieberman did not ask them to come up with creative ways to destroy the weapons factories and take the leaders of the armed terror forces out of action.</p> \n<p>He did not say to them: You’re against conquering Gaza?

Get to work.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Avigdor Lieberman: The Israeli defense minister who never was | Analysis ■&nbsp;Farewell to Avigdor Lieberman, a cartoon defense minister | Analysis</p> \n<p>Many have heard Gadi Eisenkot say that if Hezbollah were to fire even a fraction of its 150,000 rockets, the results would be catastrophic. But the IDF chief of staff has also reassured his audiences that the army has trained and is prepared to confront such a danger, and that the enemy will be very sorry if it dares fire rockets at Israel. For many years now, the IDF has been contending rather continuously with the danger of the Hamas rockets, and fierce warnings have been issued to that terrorist group as well. In these years, Eisenkot could have proven in the south – to Iran, Hezbollah and the Israeli public – that his warnings regarding rockets in the north are credible.</p> \n<p>Has he proven this? Do Hamas and Islamic Jihad have reason to be “very sorry,” or sorry at all, for the thousands of rockets they’ve fired? The air force may bomb “quality targets,” but how could 470 rockets have fallen on southern Israel this past week? If Eisenkot can’t prevent rocket barrages on this front, where the resistance is much less potent that what would be expected in the north, then why should Hamas (or we) believe him when the day comes – and it surely will come – that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s fate will be any different than that of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar?</p> \n<p>In an ongoing failure that could cost us thousands of casualties and damage to the most vital infrastructure, we’ve allowed Hezbollah to arm itself with a huge trove of missiles, including strategic ones, without any real effort to prevent it. Hamas has learned from this and armed itself with thousands of rockets too. While Hezbollah restrains itself for the time being, Hamas goes on firing them at civilian targets in Israel.</p> \n<p>In Iran, Syria, Lebanon and beyond, they’re watching, listening and drawing conclusions from all this. Whenever Iran decides, it could instruct Hezbollah to fire rockets at Israel, and not just at the north.</p> \n<p>The IDF is also studying the situation and drawing conclusions, we’re told. Maybe. But when it comes to Hezbollah and Hamas, we can plainly see that such statements don’t mean much.</p> \n<p>Residents near the Gaza border, already anticipating the coming rounds of rocket attacks, are venting their fury. Opposition leaders say Netanyahu should be ashamed. Yet they refrain from directing the same criticism at the ones backing – and some say leading – the policy of permissiveness: the defense establishment.</p> \n<p>This is the truth, and it is known to all, particularly to the enemy.

        "text":["<p>Could it be that Yair Netanyahu’s tweets are part of an attempt by him to escape his fate? And perhaps the latest provocation, too – “Proportions! 24,000 fallen in Israel’s wars – one Memorial Day. Six million Holocaust victims – one Remembrance Day. Rabin assassination – 10 days of commemoration” – should be understood as part of the realization of the tragic prophecy of the Oracle at Delphi? Perhaps his tweets – the cartoon captioned “food chain” featuring George Soros (in which the billionaire philanthropist is seen at the head of an anti-Semitic series of images) and, more recently, the “crude beast” post about Israeli television host Ofira Asayag – should be taken as deep stabs in the flesh of his father? In other words, is it possible that, contrary to appearances, Yair Netanyahu is the worst nightmare of Benjamin Netanyahu?</p> \n<p>“Sara talks about him as though he’s the next prime minister.” That quote, from a “senior Likud figure,” appeared two years ago in an article in this paper that tried to divine the character of the prime minister’s elder son (“The Rise of Yair Netanyahu, the 25-year-old who has the Prime Minister’s Ear,” Dec. 5, 2016). Here’s a quote from the full Hebrew version of that article, by Shuki Sadeh: “One avenue for understanding the son’s influence on his father is his mother, Sara Netanyahu. Likud activists call Yair ‘Sara’s son,’ as opposed to [his brother] Avner, whom they describe as ‘Bibi’s son.’ Sources we spoke to mentioned the special relationship Yair has with his mother. Sara Netanyahu is ready to forgo somewhat her influence and her place by the side of the prime minister, only for Yair’s benefit … Yair draws his strength from his mother … Over the years the two have maintained symbiotic relations.”</p> \n<p>“Sara’s son”; “special relations”; “only for Yair’s benefit”; “draws his strength from his mother”; “symbiotic relations.” Could it be that, as with the classic Oedipus complex, Yair is in love with mother? And as in the Oedipus complex, he is meant to murder his father? And perhaps as part of an attempt to escape the painful fantasy, the son is summoning up all his strength for the sake of his father? And perhaps, as part of the exaggerated use of force that is meant to prove to his father that he’s the loyal son, Yair is unintentionally, but in actuality, destroying him?</p> \n<p>In another article, published more recently in Haaretz, Noa Landau and Chaim Levinson profiled “Netanyahu’s millennials” (March 6, 2018). In it, they write: “Three of the new young advisers from what is known as Netanyahu’s ‘hive’ met during their military service in the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson’s Office: Netanyahu’s new spokeswoman, Shir Cohen, 26; his office’s digital and new-media adviser, Topaz Luk, 25; and Likud’s new media adviser, Jonatan Urich, 29. All three served in the army spokesperson’s office at the same time as Yair Netanyahu, the prime minister’s son, but were not thought to be his close friends at the time.”</p> \n<p>The last two individuals mentioned, at least – and particularly Urich – have become the prime minister’s keyboard goons. Their role in practice is to monitor enemies, sow incitement, project virtual terror and accompany Netanyahu’s every move like a dark, vengeful shadow.</p> \n<p>On the surface, they would seem to be having enormous success: The juicy, cruel, viral tweets seem to accord the elder Netanyahu a defensive shield.</p> \n<p>But it’s possible that this black noise, which may appear to be a success, will in the future turn out to be a deep abyss; that the militant, wicked, unrestrained culture that seeks to eradicate anyone who speaks out against the Leader, is being internalized in the collective unconscious as a ruinous subversion of the delicate fabric of our shared existence. This ugly language has been imported from all the “young” and “up-to-date” realms: realms similar to those of “the new media coordinator in the Shurat HaDin organization” – i.e., Yair Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>Moreover, as noted, all three “served in the army spokesperson’s office at the same time as Yair Netanyahu.” They’re sort of “Yair’s kids.” Is it possible that the assistance the son is giving the father is actually a poison pill? A Trojan horse offered as a gift that turns out to be a calamity?</p> \n<p>The sensible Israeli citizen asks himself or herself two questions about Yair Netanyahu:</p> \n<p>– Where in the world did he hear all these abominations?</p> \n<p>– Why doesn’t Dad rein in the obstreperous lad?</p> \n<p>The two answers to those questions are effectively the basis on which parricide is perpetrated:</p> \n<p>– He heard them at home.</p> \n<p>– Dad apparently agrees with the spirit of his son’s remarks.</p> \n<p>To the sensible Israeli citizen, Yair Netanyahu appears to be a toxic, malicious, inciting, divisive, wicked figure. The more time that passes, the more sewage he foists itself upon the Israeli landscape. While the loyal son is certain he’s dropping stink bombs on the enemies, is he also distancing those who are not enemies – Asayag, for example? Is Oedipus the son inadvertently murdering his father in an attempt to protect him? Will the mission be accomplished soon, and he will be able to be united at last with his mother?</p>",

The event — co-hosted by the ADL and the Israel Policy Forum — was held at the Temple Emanu-El Streicker Center in NYC.  Weiss:&nbsp;“I think what’s unique about this current moment is less [a] generational [divide on Israel], and more the fact that American Jews and Israeli Jews, it seems to me, are in a kind of collision course where we are threatening each others’ most basic values. For American Jews, the fact that this government has aligned itself so strongly with the Trump administration presents a huge problem, because most American Jews — for whatever they might like about Nikki Haley at the UN, or scuttling the Iran deal, or moving the embassy to Jerusalem — American Jews are overwhelmingly opposed to Trump. So what does it mean when the nation-state of the Jews is aligned with him? From the Israeli perspective, you have an American Jewish community that, for example, overwhelmingly supported the Iran deal, something they see as an existential threat.”  Unger-Sargon on Trump citing support for Israel in response to questions about anti-Semitism:&nbsp;“In a way, where did he get that from? He got that from us. For 50 years, the Jewish American community has outsourced its identity to Israel. It has not focused on what it means to be a Jew… It has focused on Israel. What does it mean to be a Jew? It means to be uncritical of Israel and to give unconditional support to Israel. So, in a way, I don’t really blame Trump. He was saying the messaging that we have been telegraphing for 50 years.”&nbsp;  Rosenberg:&nbsp;“Very few Jews, historically, have thought that supporting Israel meant doing it unconditionally. It’s mostly people who criticize Israel who accuse Jews of doing that. Even the right-wing Jews — remember when we had the disengagement from Gaza and tons of American Jews on the right came out and said this was a terrible idea… The right-wing and the left-wing of the Jewish community in America — and also people in the middle — have been critical of Israel for quite some time.” You can watch the full discussion here [Video]  DRIVING THE DAY —&nbsp;U.S. Plans to Change Vote to ‘No’ on UN’s Golan Heights Measure — by David Wainer:&nbsp;&quot;The U.S. plans for the first time to vote against a United Nations resolution that calls on Israel to end its occupation of the Golan Heights... Though the [annual] resolution is non-binding and will likely pass, the U.S. has previously abstained from voting against it.

But energy and water problems, which cross borders, need to be solved more immediately. “One of the lessons I learned was that we never focused enough on the ground up,” Mr. Ross said. “Any approach to peace that’s trying to create a horizon has no credibility if the day-to-day realities continue to deteriorate.” [NYTimes]   The Ceasefire in Gaza: A Turning Point for Hamas and Netanyahu — by&nbsp;Bernard Avishai:&nbsp;&quot;Netanyahu seems to be pivoting toward the army strategists who believe that the status quo in Gaza entails too high a price...&nbsp;Ordinarily, associating oneself with the Army’s position would do no harm to any Israeli politician.

I know the situation is not easy, but I'm in politics for a reason. I believe in a vision. It's 50/50. We need to work hard, but in the end I think that even now Netanyahu understands that he might lose the next election if some of the small parties on the right don’t cross the threshold.”  “I see myself as helping change the path that Israel has taken in the past years,” Livni said, when asked if she still has aspirations of one day becoming Israel’s leader. “The goal is to have a better prime minister and help him take Israel in the right direction. It’s not personal. And me being in any position that I could do so, this is what I will do.”  In the interview,&nbsp;Livni — who served under Netanyahu as Israel’s chief negotiator with the Palestinians in 2013-2015 — said she’s worried that Trump's anticipated Middle East peace plan would deal a final blow to the future of peace if it’s rejected by the Palestinians. “I'm not sure that we cannot afford another failure,” she said, pointing to previous unsuccessful attempts at Camp David and Annapolis to craft a peace treaty. “I am worried that this would lead us to more frustration, violence, and complete lack of hope.” Read the full interview here [JewishInsider]  TRANSITIONS —&nbsp;Jewish state appoints Christian envoy to Muslim country — by Herb Keinon:&nbsp;&quot;The Foreign Ministry announced the appointment of George Deek as Israel’s next Ambassador to Azerbaijan on Thursday, making him Israel’s first ever Christian Arab ambassador.&quot; [JPost]  Mary Kissel, a former&nbsp;Wall Street Journal editorial board member, has joined the State Department as a senior advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for policy and strategic messaging, State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert announced yesterday.&nbsp;  TRUMP DIPLOMACY — To ease Turkish pressure on Saudis over killing, White House weighs expelling Erdogan foe — By Carol Lee, Julia Ainsley and Courtney Kube:&nbsp;“The secret effort to resolve one of the leading tensions in U.S.-Turkey relations — [Fethullah] Gulen's residency in the U.S. — provides a window into how President Donald Trump is trying to navigate hostility between two key allies after Saudi officials murdered [Jamal] Khashoggi on Oct. 2 at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul. It suggests the White House could be looking for ways to contain Erdogan's ire over the murder while preserving Trump's close alliance with Saudi Arabia's controversial de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman… Erdogan has for years demanded the U.S. send Gulen back to Turkey.” [NBCNews]&nbsp;  Daniel Dale fact checks President Trump's recent comments on the trail&nbsp;on the cost of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem and U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal: At a campaign rally in Ohio on November 5th, Trump claimed to have saved over $1 billion in building the Jerusalem embassy. According to ABC News, however, “The renovations required by the move of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem will cost far more than $500,000… Documents filed with the official database of federal spending show that the State Department awarded the Maryland-based company Desbuild Limak D&amp;K a contract for $21.2 million to design and build an 'addition and compound security upgrades' at the embassy.”  Trump also took credit for deflating Iran’s regional ambitions with his administration’s tough policies. “It's a big difference since I've been in office. When I came to office, if you go a day before, it looked like Iran was going to take over the Middle East,” he said on November 4th. But according to Hussein Banai, a professor who studies Iran at the international studies school at Indiana University, &quot;The claim that Iran was on the verge of taking over the Middle East prior to Trump taking office is utterly false. In fact, quite the opposite was the case, as the Sunni-majority Arab states in the region... had already begun to curb Iran's influence in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.” [TorontoStar]  HEARD ON CABLE&nbsp;—&nbsp;Harry Enten,&nbsp;CNN senior political writer and analyst, on the delayed Democratic ‘blue wave’:&nbsp;&quot;Right now, we're already up to a net gain of 33 seats for the Democrats in the House.

Zuckerberg&nbsp;announced&nbsp;that Facebook would cut ties with Definers, claiming he and Sandberg hadn’t known about Facebook’s relationship with the firm.&nbsp;A senior Soros aide has called for an investigation into Facebook’s lobbying and PR work. Michael Vachon, an adviser to the chair at Soros Fund Management, wrote in a letter to friends and colleagues that it was “alarming that Facebook would engage in these unsavory tactics, apparently in response to George’s public criticism in Davos earlier this year of the company’s handling of hate speech and propaganda on its platform.”  Sandberg writes in a Facebook post:&nbsp;&quot;I did not know we hired them or about the work they were doing, but I should have. I have great respect for George Soros — and the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories against him are abhorrent.&quot;  PROFILE —&nbsp;Nas Daily’s Next Adventure — Building a Viral Video Empire:&nbsp;&quot;Three years ago, Nuseir Yassin decided to quit his high-paying tech job at PayPal to travel the world and create one-minute videos for 1,000 days. Nearing the end of the self-set challenge, the Israeli-born Arab Harvard graduate is now known as Nas Daily, his popular video persona. He sports over 10 million followers and his videos have garnered around 2.5 billion views. On day 1,001 he plans to start working on Nas Daily Co., a new video content agency to be based out of San Francisco. Yassin’s videos put a spotlight on local trends and persons of interest, documenting stories from around 70 countries... Some of the videos deal with his views on identity politics. He identifies with neither the Israeli nor the Palestinian flag.&nbsp;In and out of the videos, he wears a T-shirt showing a battery bar representing a rough estimate of his expected lifespan vs. years lived.&quot; [Calcalist]  When Lucy Met Tzachi — by Allison Kaplan Sommer:&nbsp;&quot;The Israeli celebrities Lucy Aharish and Tzachi Halevy kept their wedding a secret... But it wasn’t just a matter of keeping the paparazzi away. Aharish, a popular television anchor, is Muslim. Halevy, an actor on the mega-hit Netflix series&nbsp;Fauda, is Jewish... Their [wedding]&nbsp;last month came at a particularly fraught moment for co-existence between the two sides, just months after Israel enacted a controversial law which seemed to enshrine the idea that Arab citizens could not be equal to Jews...&nbsp; Such romances, particularly between high-profile couples like Halevy and Aharish, take on a&nbsp;Romeo and Juliet&nbsp;quality because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&quot; [ForeignPolicy]  ACROSS THE OCEAN —&nbsp;Australia's Treasurer Josh Frydenberg attacks Malaysian PM Mahathir for 'anti-Semitic' comments —&nbsp;Paul Karp:&nbsp;&quot;Australia’s treasurer has hit back at&nbsp;Mahathir Mohamad’s warning&nbsp;that Australia moving its embassy in Israel could encourage terrorism by citing a history of anti-Semitic remarks by the Malaysian prime minister. The deputy Liberal leader,&nbsp;Josh Frydenberg, accused Mahatir of making “derogatory comments” about Jews in the past, including calling them “hook-nosed,” questioning the number of people killed in the Holocaust and banning the classic Holocaust film Schindler’s List. Frydenberg made the comments at a press conference... as he maintained the pressure on the prime minister,&nbsp;Scott Morrison, to make a decision on the embassy.&quot; [TheGuardian]&nbsp;  TALK OF THE TOWN —&nbsp;Man shouts 'Heil Hitler, Heil Trump,' does Nazi salute during Baltimore performance of 'Fiddler on the Roof' — by Christina Tkacik, Sarah Meehan and Lillian Reed:&nbsp;“Audience member Rich Scherr said the outburst, during intermission at the Hippodrome Theatre on Wednesday, prompted fears that it was the beginning of a shooting. The man, who had been seated in the balcony, began shouting “Heil Hitler, Heil Trump.” Immediately after that, “People started running,” Scherr said. “I’ll be honest, I was waiting to hear a gunshot. I thought, ‘Here we go.’” … The outburst occurred immediately following a scene that depicts a wedding interrupted by a pogrom — an attack on Jewish people which can range from destruction of homes or property to outright massacre… &nbsp;“As reprehensible as those words are, they are considered protected free speech because nobody was directly threatened,” police spokesman Matt Jablow said in an email.” [BaltimoreSun]  Neo-Nazis Have No First Amendment Right to Harassment, Judge Rules — by&nbsp;Karen Zraick:&nbsp;&quot;A lawsuit accusing the publisher of the neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer of coordinating a “terror campaign” of online harassment against a Jewish real estate agent cannot be dismissed on First Amendment grounds, a federal judge in Montana ruled this week. In his ruling&nbsp;denying a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Dana L. Christensen... wrote that the real estate agent, Tanya Gersh, was a private citizen, not a public figure, and that the publisher, Andrew Anglin, incited his followers to harass her as part of a personal campaign.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  REMEMBERING — H. Peter Stern, 90, Co-Founder of Storm King Art Center, Dies — by Richard Sandomir:&nbsp;“H. Peter Stern, who co-founded the Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, N.Y., and developed it into a prestigious outdoor sculpture museum with modern and contemporary works arrayed over a vast pastoral landscape, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 90… Harold Peter Stern was born on June 12, 1928, in Hamburg, Germany, and moved with his family to Bucharest, Romania, when he was an infant... In 1939, Otto Stern was warned by a German officer of the perils his family would face — the Sterns were Jewish — if they stayed in Romania, which was turning increasingly anti-Semitic and leaning politically toward Hitler. Peter, his mother and his sister, Ellen, fled to Geneva, where they stayed for about a year, before boarding a ship in Genoa, Italy, for the United States.” [NYTimes]  WEEKEND BIRTHDAYS — FRIDAY:&nbsp;Retired Justice on the Supreme Court of Canada (2003-2013), Morris Fish turns 80...

        "text":["<p>The social media profile of American synagogue shooter Robert Bowers is a disturbing window into the distorted reality produced by anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, and anti-refugee hysteria.</p> \n<p>In the days before inflicting mass carnage at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Bowers shared posts warning that &quot;it’s the filthy EVIL Jews bringing the filthy EVIL Muslims into the country!!&quot; and asserting that ISIS executions are actually a form of &quot;jewish Ritual Murder...also known as Blood Libel.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Muslims and Christians Join Jews to Mourn Pittsburgh Shooting Victims and Resist Trump&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Are U.S. Jews Still More Safe Than the Jews of Europe?</p> \n<p>He also posted an image of 15th-century anti-Ottoman campaigner Vlad the Impaler, with the epithet &quot;make impaling great again&quot; – fusing Donald Trump’s promise to restore American greatness through racism, with the white supremacist valorization of the notoriously brutal Vlad as a heroic defender of European Christendom against Muslims and Jews.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bowers’ fever-dream of nefarious Jewish-Muslim collusion continues a long tradition of intertwining anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim animus. Centuries of European Christian polemic depicted the Jew as &quot;the theological (and internal) enemy&quot; and &quot;the Muslim [as] the political (and external) enemy,&quot; as Columbia University professor Gil Anidjar explicates in his book &quot;The Jew, the Arab: A History of the Enemy.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some medieval European authors&nbsp;portrayed&nbsp;Islam as a perverse reincarnation of the &quot;law of Moses,&quot; and there are clear&nbsp;parallels between the classic Christian notion of &quot;the Old Testament God&quot; as a vengeful, unloving, &quot;obscene Father,&quot; and similar Christian representations of the Muslim &quot;Allah.&quot;</p> \n<p>The ruthless authoritarianism of this dual trope of Jehovah/Allah was reflected in western Christian visions of the typical Muslim ruler, described as an almighty oppressor. This &quot;oriental despot&quot; figure still underlies some of the current Islamophobic portrayal of Islam as the enemy of secular democracy.</p> \n<p>Conspiracy theories of anti-Christian collaboration between Muslims and Jews were&nbsp;recurrent in medieval Europe. Jewish communities were accused, for example, of aiding Muslim troops against the Christian Visigoths in Spain in the 8th century, working with the Fatimid Empire to destroy the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem in the 11th century, and plotting with the Muslim king of Granada in the 14th century to infect Christendom with leprosy.</p> \n<p>The accusation that Jews or Muslims wish to dominate the world is, of course, ironic, since it was&nbsp;Christianity&nbsp;that first used the worship of the One God as the justification for building a world-wide empire.</p> \n<p>A common stock of stereotypes was applied to dehumanize and demonize Jewish and Muslim populations. Both Muslims and Jews were&nbsp;represented as monstrous cannibals, who literally eat away at humanity – even though it was Christian soldiers who were&nbsp;revealed to have consumed the flesh of their adversaries during the Crusades.</p> \n<p>Popular calumnies denigrating Jews as well-poisoners and Christ-killers were also&nbsp;transferred to Muslims. Medieval and Renaissance paintings of the crucifixion of Christ&nbsp;anachronistically featured Muslim characters wearing turbans and waving the crescent flag alongside Jewish figures, while medieval English mystery plays described Jesus’s natal enemy King Herod as a &quot;Mahumetan.&quot;</p> \n<p>Due to the conflation of Jew and Muslim, calls for Crusades on Muslim-held lands frequently led to pogroms against Jewish communities within Europe. In 1215, the Catholic Church’s Fourth Lateran Council imposed the same clothing restrictions on Jews and Muslims, &quot;as if the two infidel races were halves of a single body of Semitic aliens,&quot; in the words of medieval literature specialist Geraldine Heng.</p> \n<p>Contemporary right-wing extremist movements in North America and Europe are fond of&nbsp;evoking medieval history to advance current racist agendas. White supremacist activists don Crusader costumes at rallies, employ Crusader slogans like &quot;Deus Vult&quot; (&quot;God wills it&quot;), and circulate memes picturing Donald Trump as a Crusading knight.</p> \n<p>President Trump’s lamentation in the wake of the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting – that &quot;We just don’t seem to learn from the past&quot; – rings hypocritically cheap, when it is he and his supporters who are trying to mold the present into their vicious and exclusionary vision of the past. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At a 2014&nbsp;conference hosted at the Vatican, future Trump White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon cited medieval history to bolster his narrative of an &quot;outright war&quot; between the &quot;Judeo-Christian West&quot; and &quot;jihadist Islamic fascism&quot;:&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;If you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours [the sites of two well-known medieval battles], or other places. It bequeathed to us the great institution that is the church of the West.&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Like the call to Make American Great Again (MAGA), what could be labelled the Make America Medieval Again (MAMA) fantasy aims to recreate an imagined past that never existed. The image of a uniformly White Judeo-Christian Europe united against Islam is a figment of modern supremacist ideology, not an accurate rendition of medieval reality. Historically, it was not Judaism and Christianity that were inextricably connected, but Jews and Muslims as the targets of animosity.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump Says 'Islam Hates the U.S.', but Why Do Americans Hate Islam?&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Does Europe's Far Right Hate Muslims the Same Way They Hate Jews?&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Where Is Steve Bannon on the Fascism-nationalism Spectrum?</p> \n<p>While modern-day overt white supremacists like Robert Bowers continue to openly proclaim their loathing for both Muslims and Jews, Trump and co purport to renounce anti-Semitism with revisionist&nbsp;references to &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; civilization and uncritical support for Israel’s policies against Palestinians.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But despite this disavowal, Trump’s anti-Semitic dog-whistles come through loud and clear. During his presidential campaign, for example, Trump ran ads vilifying philanthropist George Soros and several other Jewish figures as representatives of predatory &quot;global special interests.&quot;</p> \n<p>This is a common theme in coded anti-Jewish discourse, going back to the infamous forgery, the&nbsp;Protocols of the Elders of Zions,&nbsp;which at the beginning of the twentieth century blamed Jews for plotting to destroy Christian civilization, through controlling both global finance and the political left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bannon’s&nbsp;Breitbart News Network and other right-wing publications regularly smear Soros for funding projects to address Islamophobia and support Muslim (as well as non-Muslim) refugees. FrontPage Magazine – edited by David Horowitz, whose &quot;Freedom Center&quot; groomed some of the most powerful and influential figures in the Trump administration, according to the Washington Post –&nbsp;described Soros as an &quot;enabler of Islam which has been expanding by conquest and deception for 1,400 years.&quot;</p> \n<p>According to our research, the &quot;charge&quot; that Soros supports Muslims was&nbsp;first raised by a Russian propaganda site, which blamed him for financing the huge migration of Muslims to Europe in 2015, in the wake of the Syrian civil war. It was immediately&nbsp;repeated in the Polish edition of the&nbsp;Prison Planet site run by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theory-peddling dean of the American far right.</p> \n<p>The Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orb&aacute;n, then made it a centerpiece of his government’s domestic propaganda, placing Soros at the head of forces supporting a mainly Muslim migrant wave that will deal a &quot;final blow to Christian culture.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Trump-propagated canard that Soros financed the caravan of Central American migrants heading for the United States is thus a mutation of what was originally an Islamophobic as well as an anti-Semitic charge. As if to drive the point home, Trump felt the need to say, falsely, that&nbsp;the caravan included people from the Middle East.</p> \n<p>Soros was the first to receive a pipe bomb from fanatical Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc, and was&nbsp;maligned by Robert Bowers on social media. In the post immediately preceding his deadly rampage, Bowers attacked another Jewish target,&nbsp;accused, like Soros, of facilitating infiltration by Muslims and other supposedly dangerous migrants: HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, an organization that actually aids immigrants of all faiths. (It happens to have helped one of us, Ivan Kalmar, to immigrate to the U.S.)</p> \n<p>It is easy to see in the context that the immigration that was, according to Bowers, causing &quot;my people&quot; getting &quot;slaughtered,&quot; was part of the same threat to white supremacy as the Muslim migrants “invading” Europe.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In this uncertain world, the Judeo-Muslim enemy reappears as the alleged culprit to those who feverishly seek to protect their privileges they see as precarious against all sorts of enemies: the black and the brown, the unemployed, environmentalists, LGBT people, women organizing against sexual harassment and violence.</p> \n<p>One way to explain it all is to resurrect as the cosmic origin of all evil the medieval spectre of the Judeo-Muslim enemy: the dehumanized object of Pittsburgh murderer Bowers’ unholy hate.</p> \n<p>Ivan Kalmar is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Toronto. He co-edited, with Derek J. Penslar, the book &quot;Orientalism and the Jews,&quot; and wrote &quot;Early Orientalism: Imagined Islam and the Notion of Sublime Power.&quot; Twitter:&nbsp;@ramlaknavi</p> \n<p>Azeezah&nbsp;Kanji is a legal academic and journalist based in Toronto.

        "text":["<p>Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said Tuesday she would bar Deputy Attorney General Dina Zilber from representing the ministry in the Knesset and elsewhere, over her criticism of a bill that aims to deny state funds to cultural institutions deemed disloyal to the state.</p> \n<p>Shaked said Zilber had committed a disciplinary violation by expressing a personal view that contradicted the ministry’s position.</p> \n<p>In a debate preparing the bill for a second and final vote in the full Knesset, Zilber told the legislature's Education, Culture and Sports Committee on Tuesday that the bill poses some “real difficulties.”</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“Let’s have nothing but obedient attorney generals, artists who are eunuchs, a reined-in media, and people disciplined and educated to all think alike,” Zilber said.</p> \n<p>She said Israelis were seeing “not only new legislation but new words: governability, loyalty and overriding” – referring to a bill now shelved that would have let the Knesset override the Supreme Court’s rulings on asylum seekers.</p> \n<p>Zilber cautioned against a “they’re-all-against-me” dialogue that “offends and scars our common culture and assigns labels. Who’s on our side, who’s not? If someone can be loyal, does that make others traitors? A fifth column?”</p> \n<p>The legislation in play was introduced by Culture Minister Miri Regev with Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon’s support. The measure, which made it through a first vote in the Knesset this week, would let the Culture Ministry cut the budgets of cultural institutions; the Finance Ministry would not be the only ministry that could do so.</p> \n<p>Zilber said the authority sought by the bill would have a “chilling effect and lead to self-censorship” in cultural life.</p> \n<p>“Culture means a free imagination and beauty, and a plethora of voices of courage and honest and open challenges that don’t simply adapt to the government,” Zilber said.</p> \n<p>In a letter to Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit, Shaked wrote that Zilber admitted that the views she voiced were her personal opinions. Shaked said this contravened the civil service’s regulations requiring employees “to loyally represent the ministry and government's political decisions.”</p> \n<p>Shaked said Zilber had made similarly critical comments a month ago, and called them “extreme and divisive remarks against lawmakers and cabinet members.”</p> \n<p>Mendelblit’s office said he would closely examine these claims and decide how to respond.</p> \n<p>Shaked alleged that Zilber’s “repeated” actions showed that “she doesn’t want to act as a professional and honest legal adviser.”</p> \n<p>“There is no choice but to determine that her political views should be expressed by running for political office in one of the parties in the Knesset,” Shaked wrote.</p> \n<p>MK Itzik Shmuli (Zionist Union) said in response to Shaked’s letter: “We can always count on our justice minister to be the first to lead an offensive against the gatekeepers trying to protect law and the truth, and the first to be silent and hide when we must face those who try to crush these principles.”</p> \n<p>MK Amir Ohana (Likud) urged Shaked to support his bill to make the appointing of the attorney general and legal advisers political appointments.</p> \n<p>“Someone like Zilber gets to sit and mock the public and its elected officials, while all we can do is tweet back at her,” Ohana wrote on Twitter.</p> \n<p>In the committee meeting where Zilber spoke, the Knesset’s legal adviser, Eyal Yinon, called the “cultural-loyalty bill” an oxymoron that he doubted could “pass the test of constitutionality.”</p> \n<p>“An artist and a creator in a democratic country has to be loyal to himself and his work. Loyalty to the country isn’t something that should guide them,” Yinon said.</p> \n<p>“By nature, art in a democracy challenges; it’s critical and caustic, sometimes subversive and provocative, and sometimes not amenable to the consensus view, which the artist is trying to challenge.”</p> \n<p>Lawmakers advanced the bill in a first vote Monday 55 to 44.

        "text":["<p>Unusual photographs from the Gaza Strip have been surfacing on social media in recent days. Palestinian residents report, to their surprise, about a change in daily living brought on by an increase in the supply of electricity to as much as 12 to 16 hours a day.</p> \n<p>It’s the longest daily power supply for Gazans since 2014’s Operation Protective Edge, and more than double the daily average for the past year, ever since the Palestinian Authority imposed sanctions against Hamas.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Following reports of a Gaza deal, Hamas says it will pay officials' salaries&nbsp;■&nbsp;Gazans are bending Israel and Hamas to their will – all the way toward a deal&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;Why Netanyahu is willing to pay a political price for keeping Gaza talks alive&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>The change was achieved thanks to a steady supply of fuel to Gaza paid for by Qatar. The supply had been delayed a few times by negotiating difficulties and Israeli responses to the violent protests along the border fence. The relative calm along that border in the past week permits fuel trucks to enter Gaza on a daily basis through Kerem Shalom.</p> \n<p>The security cabinet debated the situation in Gaza on Sunday. Headlines from that discussion went to the routine disputes among Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman and some of his colleagues. Education Minister Naftali Bennett has initiated another attack on Lieberman, accusing him of being weak against terrorism and demanding he step down. But Bennett, for reasons of political expediency, ignores the real process taking place, which was reinforced by the security cabinet: Israel, under a clear policy led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is seeking long-term compromise with Hamas. It intends to allow further steps by Qatar and Egypt to transfer large sums of money to Gaza to pay civil servants’ wages. The person responsible for this is Netanyahu, not Lieberman, who has already voiced his objections to it (yet still remains at his job).</p> \n<p>Despite the leaks from the Palestinian Authority, which claim the opposite, the Israeli defense establishment anticipates that Egypt will approve the plan to transfer the money for the salaries. The momentum for achieving a deal has returned – and it’s bringing a certain degree of optimism in terms of preparedness. The danger, as always, is that a local violent incident could overshadow efforts to achieve a deal and lead to another round of bloodshed, despite Israel and Hamas’ desire to achieve a long-term ceasefire.</p> \n<p>The indirect talks between the sides continue apace through all channels, with the in-depth involvement of United Nations Secretary General’s envoy Nikolay Mladenov. In Israel, the head of the National Security Council, Meir Ben-Shabbat, holds the “Gaza portfolio” on the prime minister’s behalf, and is leading the search for a deal, to Lieberman and Bennett’s chagrin (and irrespective of the political infighting between them).</p> \n<p>Shin Bet head Nadav Argaman told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Tuesday that the situation in the Palestinian arena is unstable, and that Gaza fluctuates between the possibility of military conflict erupting and the chance of finding a solution to ease the humanitarian crisis. Argaman devoted most of his remarks at the start of the meeting, which was open to media coverage, to issuing warnings against a “misleading calm” in the West Bank and the possibility of seeing an outbreak there, rather than in Gaza.</p> \n<p>Traditionally the Shin Bet is the most conservative agency in the security establishment regarding the easing of conditions for the Palestinians, due to its focus on preventing terrorism and the fear that any leniency can be exploited to launch attacks. But recently, against the backdrop of contacts aimed at achieving a solution for Gaza, the Shin Bet is also showing signs of softening its position, after rejecting the possibility of letting any Palestinians from Gaza work in Israeli border communities. Perhaps if a deal is reached, the Shin Bet will agree to take another look at the issue by running a “pilot” program to allow a small group of Palestinians in for work.</p> \n<p>Despite the leaks by the Palestinian Authority, which claim the opposite, the Israeli defense establishment believes that Egypt will approve the plan to transfer the salaries.</p> \n<p>Hamas sources said the sides are close to an agreement. The risk, as in the past, is that a local incident could overshadow the efforts toward a deal and renew the cycle of bloodshed, despite the signs of a desire on the part of Israel and Hamas to achieve a long-term ceasefire.</p>",

The only question is when.</p> \n<p>The threat of an early election, sparked by Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman’s surprise resignation from the government last week, was seemingly lifted Monday when key coalition members announced they would not be stepping down, citing security concerns.</p> \n<p>That leaves Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a super-slim Knesset majority of one. It also puts the fate of his governing coalition at the mercy of his partners, namley Habayit Hayehudi Chairman Naftali Bennett who is competing with the prime minister’s Likud party for right-wing voters, and has spoken in favor of harsh Israeli military action against Hamas, increasing the risk of a renewed conflict preceding any future election.</p> \n<p>Although the government has until the fall of 2019 before its term officially ends, Netanyahu could decide to call an early election anytime before that. He has done so in the past. In fact, no Israeli government has finished a full four-year term since 1988.</p> \n<p>Omer Benjakob explains why the structure of the Israeli government makes it so prone to early elections, granting the prime minister near-absolute discretion when to comes to disbanding the coalition:&nbsp;Why is Israel always having elections</p> \n<p>Like comedy, the secret to calling an early election is timing. According to Anshel Pfeffer, the only question remaining concerns when the election will take place. &quot;The battle for the timing of the 2019 Knesset election” is everything, he writes. On the surface, the difference in the possible dates – anything from late February to early November – doesn’t seem major: just nine months. But for all of the parties and candidates, those nine months could make all the difference:&nbsp;Why the timing of the Israeli election matters so much to Netanyahu and his rivals</p> \n<p>Haaretz Editor-in-Chief Aluf Benn says Netanyahu is now lurching hard toward the center, casting himself as a present-day David Ben-Gurion – a calm, collected and responsible statesman who can stand up to those beating the war drum.</p> \n<p>If Netanyahu continues to move toward the center, Benn writes, he would prefer to rely on his friend U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace plan. One can assume that the plan will be presented in accordance with the election schedule in Israel, to help Netanyahu and reinforce the message that he, and only he, can recruit world leaders to his side:&nbsp;Netanyahu launches his election campaign, lurching toward the center</p> \n<p>The assumption is that no matter when the election is held, Netanyahu will almost certainly come out on top. Yet “Bibi” is far from invincible: He lost badly to Ehud Barak in 1999, was trounced by Ariel Sharon in the Likud primaries in 2002, and drubbed by Ehud Olmert and Kadima in the 2006 elections, in which his Likud mustered a measly 12 Knesset seats.

Instead, they vote for parties that together can form coalitions, which can then become a government.</p> \n<p>If you’re confused, here’s a guide to Israel’s complex political system.

I have waited, hoping they would right the ship. But they have not. In opposition to our Unity Principles, they have allowed anti-Semitism, anti-LBGTQIA sentiment and hateful, racist rhetoric to become a part of the platform by their refusal to separate themselves from groups that espouse these racist, hateful beliefs,” Shook wrote in a Facebook post on Monday.</p> \n<p>In an interview with Haaretz last week, Shook, whose Facebook post following the election of Donald Trump set the Women’s March movement in motion, expressed her misgivings over the controversies inside the March movement, saying that the “rift is too big to heal.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The Women's March anti-Semitism controversy threatening the movement's future | Explained</p> \n<p>The Women’s March criticized Shook’s call in a statement minimizing the Hawaii resident’s role in the movement, charging that she has “weighed in, irresponsibly, as have other organizations attempting in this moment to take advantage of our growing pains to try and fracture our network.”</p> \n<p>Shook’s call Monday was applauded by Mercy Morningfield, a regional leader of the Women’s March in Washington, DC. In her comment on Shook’s post, Morganfield, who is African-American, said that she had, in the past, repeatedly criticized Mallory’s ties to Farrakhan, but “was shushed” by leaders who “protected Tamika.” She also charged the leaders of the group with financial irresponsibility and said that not only do they give moral support to the Nation of Islam, but subsidize them by using the group as their security detail.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Controversy over the ties by leaders of the Women’s March to Farrakhan has intensified over the past eight months, after Mallory attended and applauded the Nation of Islam’s annual “Savior’s Day” even in February, where he made anti-Semitic pronouncements.&nbsp; &nbsp; On October 8, Farrakhan tweeted a video of a speech he delivered, emphasizing the line, “I’m not an anti-Semite. I’m anti-termite.”&nbsp; &nbsp; On October 30, three days after a gunman killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue, Hollywood actress Alyssa Milano was quoted in LGBT magazine The Advocate saying she was “disappointed” in the Women’s March leadership’s continued support of Farrakhan and said without a renunciation of the leaders, she would not address the upcoming march next January. Fellow actress Debra Messing&nbsp; tweeted support of that position.&nbsp; &nbsp; On the same week, a German NGO, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, suspended plans to give a human rights award to the Women’s March. The award was postponed until after it could “have the matter investigated by an independent party.”</p> \n<p>In response to the ongoing criticism, the Women’s March has released a series of statements, most recently on November 8, in which it has declared that while it the group “rejects anti-Semitism and all its forms” and “recognizes the danger of hate rhetoric by public figures” and that “we want to say emphatically that we do not support or endorse statements made by Minister Louis Farrakhan about women, Jewish and LGBTQ communities.”</p> \n<p>At the same time, it has said that that it stands by Sarsour and Mallory, who have refused to distance themselves from Farrakhan.&nbsp; &nbsp; Last week, Sarsour came under fire for invoking dual loyalty&nbsp;over a Facebook post defending&nbsp; Muslim Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar, in which Sarsour slammed “folks who masquerade as progressives but always choose their allegiance to Israel over their commitment to democracy and free speech.”</p> \n<p>Jewish advocacy groups and activists who have been publicly criticizing the march cheered Shook’s decision.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Some college students who think about becoming rabbis aren’t sure whether they will want to work in a synagogue or school. Others get hung up on which seminary to attend or denomination to join.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Lior Gross had a different dilemma: How to speak Hebrew in the first person.</p> \n<p>Gross, a student at the University of Colorado Boulder, identifies as non-binary — neither male nor female — and uses the pronouns “they” and “them.” That means Hebrew presents a challenge: Many verbs, and all nouns and adjectives, are either grammatically male or female. Talmid, for example, means a male student, while talmida is the female form.</p> \n<p>For non-binary Jews, including some transgender people, speaking Hebrew — or praying or participating in services — can be fraught. It can mean being forced to identify with one of the genders they have eschewed.</p> \n<p>“I was really feeling out of place in terms of, I go to synagogue every week and I go to minyan twice a week, how do I get called up for an aliyah?” Gross said, referring to being called up to bless the Torah during weekday prayers. “How do I talk about myself in conversation? If I go to Israel, how do I engage there while respecting myself?”</p> \n<p>So instead of misrepresenting their gender, Gross decided to change Hebrew. Along with Eyal Rivlin, a Hebrew professor at C.U. Boulder, Gross created what is essentially a third gender in Hebrew grammar — a way for non-binary Jews to speak the language without compromising their identity.</p> \n<p>“In Hebrew, the verbs, adjectives, pronouns — before this, you’d have to choose masculine or feminine, and it didn’t feel authentic,” Rivlin said. “We tried to really hone to existing Hebrew grammatical rules so it doesn’t feel foreign, so it fits in the system.”</p> \n<p>The core rule of the system is simple: Instead of leaving the ends of most words bare, which by default would signify a masculine word, or adding the feminine “ah,” “ut” or “et”sounds, most of Gross and Rivlin’s forms take the ending “eh.”</p> \n<p>So a student would be a “talmideh.” And if they were a student studying, for example, they would be a “talmideh lomdeh” — as opposed to a “talmidah lomedet” (female) or a “talmid lomed” (male). Plurals combine the traditional masculine and feminine suffixes. So students would be “talmidimot.”</p> \n<p>Hebrew is based on root words — three-letter combinations that are conjugated in a range of ways — so it’s relatively straightforward for Hebrew speakers to apply the non-binary system to a range of verb forms. And irregular conjugations in Hebrew have corollaries in Gross and Rivlin’s system. “Moreh” is the masculine form of teacher, for example, and “morah” is feminine. So in non-binary Hebrew, the word is “more’ah.”</p> \n<p>“If Dr. Seuss were writing a non-binary book in Hebrew, this is what he would use,” Rivlin said. “And it would make sense to everybody.”</p> \n<p>Gross and Rivlin aren’t the first to create a Hebrew grammar for non-binary people. Habonim Dror, the labor Zionist youth movement, innovated a non-binary Hebrew that takes the suffix -ol for singular words and the -imot suffix for plurals. Rivlin said that in Israel, some transgender people choose to speak in the gender they now identify with. Others switch off sentence to sentence.</p> \n<p>And Gross said there’s a parallel to the “eh” ending in Spanish, where the suffix “e,” which has a similar sound, can serve as a neutral alternative to the feminine “a” and masculine “o.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; War on Hebrew: For some ultra-Orthodox, there can be only one language</p> \n<p>“There’s this convergence evolving that the ‘e’ sound works very well for Hebrew and Spanish,” Gross said. “In any sort of case where you’re implementing new language, where you say something and it might not be heard, it’s just something to have a conversation about.”</p> \n<p>Gross and Rivlin’s non-binary Hebrew is one more step in efforts by non-binary Jews to create space for themselves in what traditionally is a very gendered religion. Until the middle of the 20th century, nearly all public Jewish prayer was gender-segregated, with leadership roles restricted to men. As liberal Jewish movements have become gender-egalitarian, LGBT Jews are aiming to make them more comfortable for Jews who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.</p> \n<p>For transgender Jews, this has meant changing some of the language core to Jewish ritual. An adolescent in York, England, had a b’nei mitzvah this year using the plural form to avoid identifying as a bar (male) or bat (female) mitzvah.</p> \n<p>The Fort Tryon Jewish Center, a traditional-egalitarian congregation in New York City, created a guide last year to Torah-service ritual for all genders. When Jews are called up to the Torah, they are generally announced with their Hebrew first name followed by “ben” or “bat” (son or daughter) and their parent’s or parents’ names.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Drawing on a custom transgender Jews had already innovated, the guide says non-binary people who are called up to the Torah should be referred to in gender-neutral language that announces them with their Hebrew name, followed by “mi’beit,” or “from the house of,” their parents. Similar alternatives are presented throughout the ritual surrounding Torah reading.</p> \n<p>(Full disclosure: This reporter is a member of the Fort Tryon Jewish Center.)</p> \n<p>Kehillat Hadar, an independent prayer group in Manhattan, has a similar guide.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Benay Lappe, founder and head of Svara, a Chicago yeshiva that teaches Torah “through the lens of queer experiences,” says that creating ritual language for non-binary Jews can create space for them in what might have previously been an unwelcoming setting. Lappe taught Gross at Svara’s Queer Talmud Camp in 2017 and 2018 and called Gross and their peers “nothing short of prophets.”</p> \n<p>“The gendered nature of Hebrew, and teachers who are not able to maneuver in a binaried language, present significant barriers to trans folks feeling included in traditional learning settings,” Lappe said. “I have trans students who have left rabbinical school because their teachers can’t figure out a way, in a binaried language system, to recognize them and to honor their presence.”</p> \n<p>As untraditional as the new Hebrew grammar might seem, Gross said there’s precedent in foundational Jewish texts for a multiplicity of gender. The Talmud, for example, refers to people who are neither male nor female, people who are both, and those of one gender who later develop the characteristics of another.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Who's talking about gender equality | Opinion</p> \n<p>Rivlin also said that because modern Hebrew is only about a century old, it’s still in the process of being formed. And some Israelis chafe at the language’s gendered forms. Some women resist referring to their husbands by the traditional word “baal,” which means “master,” opting instead for the word “ish,” which means “man,” or “ben-zug,” which connotes a romantic partner. And Meirav Michaeli, a Knesset member for the Labor Party, often refers to mixed groups of people using feminine language as opposed to the traditional masculine.</p> \n<p>“Hebrew is an evolving language,” Rivlin said. “There’s new words and they make sense.

        "text":["<p>Amid international uproar over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, some members of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia's ruling family are agitating to prevent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from becoming king, three sources close to the royal court said.</p> \n<p>Dozens of princes and cousins from powerful branches of the Al Saud family want to see a change in the line of succession but would not act while King Salman - the crown prince’s 82-year-old father - is still alive, the sources said. They recognise that the king is unlikely to turn against his favourite son, known in the West as MbS.</p> \n<p>Rather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that after the king's death, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, a younger full brother of King Salman and uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.</p> \n<p>Prince Ahmed, King Salman’s only surviving full brother, would have the support of family members, the security apparatus and some Western powers, one of theSaudi&nbsp;sources said.</p> \n<p>Read more:&nbsp;Will the Khashoggi 'Murder' Bring Down Saudi’s Crown Prince?&nbsp;|&nbsp;Saudi Arabia and U.S. on Collision Course as Mohammed Bin Salman's Standing Ebbs</p> \n<p>Prince Ahmed returned to Riyadh in October after 2-1/2 months abroad. During the trip, he appeared to criticise the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty. He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family's senior members, who opposed MbS becoming crown prince in 2017, two&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;sources said at the time.</p> \n<p>Neither Prince Ahmed nor his representatives could be reached for comment. Officials in Riyadh did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on succession issues.</p> \n<p>The House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes. Unlike typical European monarchies, there is no automatic succession from father to eldest son. Instead the kingdom’s tribal traditions dictate that the king and senior family members from each branch select the heir they consider fittest to lead.</p> \n<p>Senior U.S. officials have indicated to&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;advisers in recent weeks that they would support Prince Ahmed, who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years, as a potential successor, according to&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.</p> \n<p>These&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;sources said they were confident that Prince Ahmed would not change or reverse any of the social or economic reforms enacted by MbS, would honour existing military procurement contracts and would restore the unity of the family.</p> \n<p>One senior U.S. official said the White House is in no hurry to distance itself from the crown prince despite pressure from lawmakers and the CIA’s assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi’s murder, though that could change once Trump gets a definitive report on the killing from the intelligence community.</p> \n<p>The official also said the White House saw it as noteworthy that King Salman seemed to stand by his son in a speech in Riyadh on Monday and made no direct reference to Khashoggi’s killing, except to praise the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;public prosecutor.</p> \n<p>President Donald Trump on Saturday called the CIA assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi's killing &quot;very premature&quot; but &quot;possible&quot;, and said he would receive a complete report on the case on Tuesday. A White House official referred Reuters to those comments and had &quot;nothing else to add at this time&quot;.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;sources said U.S. officials had cooled on MbS not only because of his suspected role in the murder of Khashoggi. They are also rankled because the crown prince recently urged the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;defence ministry to explore alternative weapons supplies from Russia, the sources said.</p> \n<p>In a letter dated May 15, seen by Reuters, the crown prince requested that the defence ministry &quot;focus on purchasing weapon systems and equipment in the most pressing fields&quot; and get training on them, including the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system.</p> \n<p>Neither the Russian defence ministry nor officials in Riyadh immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.</p> \n<p>U.S. ROLE KEY</p> \n<p>The brutal killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;ally. The CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing, according to U.S. sources familiar with the assessment.</p> \n<p>Saudi&nbsp;Arabia’s public prosecutor has said the crown prince knew nothing of the killing.</p> \n<p>The international uproar has piled pressure on a royal court already divided over 33-year-old Prince Mohammed's rapid rise to power. Since his ascension, the prince has gained popular support with high-profile social and economic reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.</p> \n<p>His reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.</p> \n<p>He has also marginalized senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over&nbsp;Saudi’s security and intelligence agencies.</p> \n<p>He first ousted then-powerful crown prince and interior minister Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN), 59, in June 2017. Then he removed Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, 65, son of the late King Abdullah, as head of the National Guard and detained him as part of an anti-corruption campaign.</p> \n<p>Some 30 other princes were also arrested, mistreated, humiliated and stripped of their wealth, even as MbS splashed out on palaces, a $500 million yacht, and set a new record in the international art market with the purchase of a painting by Italian Renaissance engineer and painter Leonardo Da Vinci.</p> \n<p>The entire House of Saud has emerged weakened as a result.</p> \n<p>According to one well-placed&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;source, many princes from senior circles in the family believe a change in the line of succession &quot;would not provoke any resistance from the security or intelligence bodies he controls&quot; because of their loyalty to the wider family.</p> \n<p>&quot;They (the security apparatus) will follow any consensus reached by the family.&quot;</p> \n<p>Officials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>The United States, a key ally in economic and security terms, is likely to be a determining factor in how matters unfold in&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia, the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;sources and diplomats say.</p> \n<p>Trump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner have cultivated deep personal relationships with the crown prince. One&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;insider said MbS feels he still has their support and is willing to &quot;roll some heads to appease the U.S.&quot;</p> \n<p>But Trump and top administration officials have said&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;officials should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi’s death and have imposed sanctions on 17&nbsp;Saudis for their alleged role – including one of MbS's closest aides.</p> \n<p>U.S. lawmakers are meanwhile pushing legislation to punish Riyadh for the killing, and both Republican and Democratic senators have urged Trump to get tough on the crown prince.</p> \n<p>King Salman, 82, is aware of the consequences of a major clash with the United States and the possibility that Congress could try to freeze&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;assets.</p> \n<p>Those who have met the king recently say he appeared to be in denial about the role of MbS in what happened, believing there to be a conspiracy against the kingdom. But they added that he looked burdened and worried.</p> \n<p>ALLEGIANCE COUNCIL</p> \n<p>When the king dies or is no longer be able to rule, the 34-member Allegiance Council, a body representing each line of the ruling family to lend legitimacy to succession decisions, would not automatically declare MbS the new king.</p> \n<p>Even as crown prince, MbS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;sources said. While the council accepted King Salman's wish to make MbS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MbS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalise council members.</p> \n<p>Officials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;sources say MbS has destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families. They say this is seen inside the family as destabilising.</p> \n<p>Despite the controversy over Khashoggi's killing, MbS is continuing to pursue his agenda.</p> \n<p>Some insiders believe he built his father a new but remote Red Sea palace in Sharma, at the Neom City development site -- thrown up in a record one year at a cost of $2 billion -- as a gilded cage for his retirement.</p> \n<p>The site is isolated, the closest city of Tabouk more than 100 km (60 miles) away. Residence there would keep the king out of the loop on most affairs of state, one of the sources close to the royal family said.</p> \n<p>Officials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Compared to his previous work, Shlomo Sand’s recent op-ed in Haaretz was relatively restrained.</p> \n<p>&quot;I don’t understand why all cats have to be called cats and all the dogs, dogs – and only one cat has to be called a dog...The ‘exile’ [of the Jews] is a formative event that never took place...[It doesn’t confer] on the Jews some sort of imagined ‘historic right’ to the Holy Land.&quot;</p> \n<p>This was low-energy Sand compared to the usual standards of the Tel Aviv University emeritus professor of history, whose writing has proved ripe for weaponizing by anti-Semites from Damascus to the Daily Stormer.</p> \n<p>That Sand has declared that Jewish continuity and identity is a great deception, that most Jews hail from the medieval (and perhaps legendary) Turkic empire of Khazaria, not the Holy Land, that we have &quot;a moral obligation to break definitively&quot; with the identity of a &quot;race-people such as the Jews,&quot; AKA&nbsp;the &quot;exclusive club of the elect and their acolytes,&quot; and decried the Jews’ profiteering exploitation of the &quot;Holocaust industry&quot; that seeks to &quot;maximize&quot; its political and financial &quot;capital.&quot;</p> \n<p>He has publicly declared he wished “to resign and cease considering [him]self a Jew&quot; because ethnocentrism and racism are a function of Jewishness.</p> \n<p>Shlomo Sand’s fame, or notoriety, has lasted decades, and shows no sign of ebbing. His piece in Haaretz was shared over 11,000 times on Facebook; his books are routinely translated in 20-plus languages. The only problem is one of his keenest fan bases is constituted by those with a marked distaste for, if not violent hatred of, Jews.</p> \n<p>Indeed, Sand is considered a &quot;first-rate authority on Jews by lots of first-rate Jew-haters.&quot;</p> \n<p>Sand has the unique distinction of attracting an incredibly broad spectrum of anti-Semites who follow different schools of anti-Semitism, from theological to political to racial to cultural. Sand functions as the symbolic destination for an &quot;ingathering of the anti-Semites,&quot; as it were.</p> \n<p>But does it matter who adopts his theses with such alacrity? Is he really responsible for where his work is received, and by whom?</p> \n<p>Let’s take one of the stranger claims the historian (not ethnologist) Sand has made: That the real origins of most European Jews are the Khazar tribe (&quot;ignoring,&quot;&nbsp;as a historian peer commented, &quot;the overwhelming historical consensus that they had never existed&quot;).</p> \n<p>The &quot;Khazar origin&quot; theory for Ashkenazi Jews was first popularized by Arthur Koestler in his 1976 book &quot;The Thirteenth Tribe.&quot; That swiftly became &quot;an article of faith among anti-Semites and anti-Israel Arab politicians. … The neo-Nazi National States Rights Party in the U.S. declared [it] to be ‘the political bombshell of the century’ because ‘it destroys all claims of the present-day Jew-Khazars to any historic right to occupy Palestine.’&quot;</p> \n<p>That dovetails neatly into two directions: First, theological – such as the literal replacement theology of Louis Farrakhan.</p> \n<p>According to a fellow Nation of Islam leader, Farrakhan has &quot;boldly&quot; declared that &quot;the Jewish people who currently hold sway in Israel and throughout the world...[have] no biological, anthropological, historical, scientific or scriptural evidence to support the assertion that...[they] are the Hebrews of the Bible.&quot; No wonder Farrakhan is a Sand fan.</p> \n<p>The second direction is political. As Syrian state TV reported several years ago, &quot;Jewish nationalism is invalid...[Jews] invented legends...to cover for this new Zionist imperialist project against the Arab nation.&quot; That was taken from the blurb of a Damascus University symposium dedicated to Sand’s &quot;Invention of the Jewish People,&quot;&nbsp;and organized by The Syrian Arab Popular Committee for Supporting the Palestinian People and Resisting the Zionist Project.</p> \n<p>For the anti-Zionist far left, Sand is a godsend.</p> \n<p>Corbynista and co-founder of a far-left media outlet, Aaron Bastani, enthusiastically interviewed him on &quot;The Invention of the Land of Israel,&quot; and Sand’s books have come up constantly as required reading on Israel-Palestine&nbsp;in Facebook groups for the Corbyn left, mired in accusations of anti-Semitism. Avowedly anti-Zionist site Mondoweiss gave copies of the &quot;Invention of the Jewish People&quot;&nbsp;as a gift to new subscribers in 2012. Self-declared anti-Semite, ex-Israeli, Holocaust denier and pro-Palestinian activist Gilad Atzmon called it a &quot;must read.&quot;</p> \n<p>Similarly, where the far left and the Iranian regime media meet, Sand can be sure of a delightful reception. Back in 2009, he was interviewed on Press TV by none other than friend-of-Hamas-and-Hezbollah George Galloway, and again in 2013 on the occasion of the second book’s publication.</p> \n<p>So far, so revolting, or so thrillingly taboo-breaking, depending on your view.</p> \n<p>But it’s surely unavoidable for Sand to take a pause when his work is endorsed by the neo-Nazi far right – after all, his own parents were Holocaust survivors. So what about when ex-KKK head David Duke plugged his discussion of &quot;the amazing recent pronouncements of Israeli Shlomo Sand who reveals the truth about hyper Jewish racism in Israel and all over the world&quot;?</p> \n<p>Duke has also remarked that Sand’s &quot;observations about the true nature of Jewish racist tribalism are accurate,&quot; and has engaged at great length with Sand’s Khazar theory, which he once backed before realizing it wasn’t reductive enough of Jewish history – it wasn’t anti-Semitic enough: &quot;The problem we face is not a ‘Khazar’ problem, it is a Jewish problem, it is a problem of extremist Jewish racism and supremacism which continually plunges our world into war, hatred, tyranny and degradation.&quot;</p> \n<p>When Sand declared through the pages of The Guardian that he no longer wanted to be considered a Jew, his erstwhile far-right fans were scathing: “Shlomo Sand Resigns from Being a Jew as if It will Magically Turn Him Into a Human Being” was the Daily Stormer headline. The article elaborated further: “There is no getting away from it, Shlomo, the blood of Christ is upon you and your children for ever, whether you go to the synagogue or not is immaterial.”</p> \n<p>Sand has been asked whether he’s concerned by the unappetizing characters who flock to his work. In one 2009 interview in the Wall Street Journal, he countered: &quot;I don’t care if crazy anti-Semites in the United States use my book.&quot; (I’m sure he wouldn’t mind including a crazy Brit in that – the conspiracist and anti-Semite David Icke.)</p> \n<p>Sand added: “Anti-Semitism in the West, for the moment, is not a problem.”</p> \n<p>Ah. Perhaps this is where the issue of responsibility gets more complicated. Is Sand suggesting that if anti-Semitism in the West becomes a problem (and right now, we’re talking after Pittsburgh and a decade of particularly ferocious terrorist attacks against Jews in Europe), he would reconsider his language?</p> \n<p>When it comes to how words can be weaponized for hate and hate crimes, there must clearly be a question of intent. The most current example is clearly Donald Trump. For some, his racist incitement has obvious real-world consequences, a conclusion rejected by others.</p> \n<p>Another, perhaps closer, example is the Italian-Israeli academic Ariel Toaff, scion of a community in Rome with thousands of years’ experience of Catholic theological anti-Semitism, who decided to write a book entitled “Bloody Passover: The Jews of Europe and Ritual Murders.”</p> \n<p>A member of the Italian-Jewish community in Jerusalem noted that despite Toaff’s subsequent attempt to clarify – no, he didn’t think 15th-century Jews ritually murdered a 2-year-old boy – the damage was already done: &quot;The simple people don’t read professors’ articles. The simple people will only remember that Toaff’s son said that Jews murdered Simonino.&quot;</p> \n<p>Toaff eventually withdrew the book from circulation. But there's a guerrilla translation available to buy on Amazon which amps up the title towards its intended audience: &quot;The Bloody Satanic Sacrifice Rituals of the Jewish Race: Blood Passover, English Version,&quot; whose blurb announces that Jews didn’t want the Gentiles to know about the &quot;murders they had committed&quot; and enjoins readers to &quot;Come out of the darkness and strike a blow for the light. READ AND PASS ON.&quot;</p> \n<p>The defense of naivety is no defense, as Sand is entirely aware how his language has been applied, and of the rise of anti-Semitism in the past decade. This is not to suggest silencing him, but it seems reasonable to reassess what platforms should be volunteered – and for Sand himself to reassess the language in which his theses are couched.</p> \n<p>There’s a lesson here for a wide range of people legitimately opposed to Israel’s policies and the occupation about whether the language they use strays into anti-Semitism – and provides sustenance for violent anti-Semites.</p> \n<p>There is one final irony to Sand’s Haaretz piece, and not one he intended. The photo illustrating his op-ed is a Jew entering a synagogue in Sarcelles, a Paris suburb that is 25 percent Jewish and which was, as Anshel Pfeffer reported, “the [2014] scene ... of the first pogrom in Europe in the 21st century” – an anti-Jewish riot that took violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza as a trigger for a rampage.</p> \n<p>That seems to indicate that, despite Sand’s contention that &quot;the Jewish people&quot; is a damaging imaginary fiction, there are plenty of Jews whose lives pivot around just that identity. And plenty of anti-Semites who target that collective identity, too.</p> \n<p>Esther Solomon is the Opinion Editor of Haaretz English. Twitter:&nbsp;@EstherSolomon</p>",

        "text":["<p>Like a bowl of grandma’s chicken soup with kneidlach, this eight-part Netflix sitcom is infused throughout with warmth and affection. It might not be the funniest show on television right now, and it might rely heavily on well-tested narrative formulae, but “The Kominsky Method” is poignant and moving.</p> \n<p>The show stars Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin, two Hollywood stalwarts who can be relied upon to deliver exactly the kind of curmudgeonly performance required. Douglas plays Sandy Kominsky, a revered acting coach who is bitter about never having made the transition from stage to screen. Arkin is Norman Newlander, Kominsky’s longtime and long-suffering agent and friend.</p> \n<p>Their friendship, which is tested over the course of eight episodes by Sandy’s selfishness and bitterness, is the heart of “The Kominsky Method” – and whatever else you can say about the show, it’s got a lot of heart.</p> \n<p>The plot is very much secondary in “The Kominsky Method.” I could tell you, for example, that Norman’s wife (played by Susan Sullivan, who also appeared in Lorre’s “Dharma &amp; Greg”) dies in the first episode, safe in the knowledge that your enjoyment would not be diminished. Instead, the relationship between two aging characters is what gives the show its charm: they bicker with affection and they lovingly torture each other.</p> \n<p>When Sandy needs a hefty loan from his friend to cover a tax bill, Norman – after initially balking, but relenting after “consulting” his late wife – agrees, but only on the condition that the money is a gift. He knows that his “no strings attached” condition is the one caveat that Sandy’s pride will not allow him to accept. And he delights in his old friend’s anguish.</p> \n<p>The Midas touch</p> \n<p>A harsher critic would find much to disparage in “The Kominsky Method.” Some of the tropes employed are as old as the main characters: Sandy’s idiosyncratic drink-of-choice (Jack Daniels and diet Dr. Pepper: “The Jack keeps me from killing myself, and the Pepper keeps me regular,” he explains), the generational misunderstandings and the kvetching over physical ailments.</p> \n<p>But Chuck Lorre has a Midas touch, and the ‘King of Sitcoms’ manages to inject a healthy dose of humor into what might have been a thoroughly depressing journey through the physical deterioration that comes to us all. The jokes about mortality are as predictable as death itself, but that doesn’t matter.</p> \n<p>Lorre has also recruited some heavy-hitting stars for cameo appearances. Danny DeVito gives a typically madcap performance as Sandy’s urologist – an almost obligatory character in any show about aging – and there are brief appearances from Elliot Gould, Jay Leno and Patti LaBelle.</p> \n<p>In interviews, Lorre insists that “The Kominsky Method” is not autobiographical, but it is clearly inspired and shaped by his own experiences of three and a half decades working in the television industry. The show is stuffed with inside jokes: Gould – who, in real life, has endorsed such products as Jim Beam bourbon and Boston Beer – ends up accepting a gig for a dodgy finance company, which Sandy rejects.</p> \n<p>Lorre clearly sees himself not just as a provider of entertainment, but as a dispenser of wisdom. In previous shows, he shared his thoughts with viewers via the medium of vanity cards – those on-screen quotes or images that appear after the final credits. During the course of his career, Lorre used these cards to address such issues as his alcohol problem, his tempestuous relationships with television networks and even rumors about the disappearance of Charlie Sheen from “Two and a Half Men.”</p> \n<p>These cards, more often than not, read like computer-generated self-help aphorisms. “You’re not a noun, you’re a verb,” for example, is the opening sentence of the vanity card that appears after Episode 6 of “The Kominsky Method.”</p> \n<p>It’s easy to forgive “The Kominsky Method” its flaws. Yes, it’s derivative. Yes, it relies on jokes that others have carried off with greater aplomb; indeed, some scenes are reminiscent of Jerry Seinfeld’s “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.” And, yes, its gentle pace can verge on dawdling. But, on the back of strong performances from Douglas and Arkin – both Oscar winners, of course – it works.</p>",

        "text":["<p>They say great minds think alike. Now a paper in Nature suggests that very early humans, or possibly even hominins predating modern humans, may have invented advanced stone-tool manufacturing technology more than once, in different places around the world.</p> \n<p>The thinking has been that the Levallois technique of knapping stones into tools was born in Africa and/or Europe, and spread to Asia. But the sophisticated method may have developed independently in each continent, postulates Prof. Ben Marwick of the University of Washington, writing with Bo Li and Hu Yue of the University of Wollongong, after discovering Levallois-type tools in China from a period way earlier than had been expected.</p> \n<p>Pre-hominins were making stone tools over 3.3 million years ago, but their products and technique were crude. Simple hand axes were made by banging a suitable flint rock using another flint rock, until one of them acquired the desired shape.</p> \n<p>Levallois (pronounced Le-val-wa) takes brains and finesse. This type of implement – “the Swiss Army knife of prehistoric tools,” Marwick calls them – required planning. The first stage involved gingerly banging at a flint core around its edges, carefully sculpting it into a specific shape. The second stage was to give the shaped rock one great, skillfully aimed whack that would knock off a flake, already roughly in the desired form and size.</p> \n<p>Thusly, much sharper and finer tools could be made. “Featuring a distinctive faceted surface, created through a sequence of steps, Levallois flakes were versatile ‘blanks,’ used to spear, slice, scrape or dig,” the researchers explain.</p> \n<p>Made in Israel</p> \n<p>However, is it possible that the germ of the Levallois concept goes back as much as 800,000 years, before Homo sapiens was even a gleam in some Homo heidelbergensis' eye? Prof. Naama Goren-Inbar of Hebrew University believes she has identified &quot;incipient&quot; Levallois cores at Gesher Benot Yaakov in Israel&nbsp;–&nbsp;a prehistoric site that predates modern humans by hundreds of thousands of years.</p> \n<p>Another Israeli researcher, Prof. Ran Barkai of Tel Aviv University, has identified Levallois tools (or incipients) going back half a million years in two other sites in Israel, Jaljulya and Revadim. Both sites have ample evidence of advanced stone-tool techniques.</p> \n<p>Barkai cautions that dating these two sites is extremely challenging – both could be somewhat younger, “only” 300,000 years old. There is also evidence from Armenia, where a team headed by Daniel Adler found evidence of Levallois technology that dates between 400,000 to 200,000 years ago. In his paper in NCBI, Adler calls the technology “the most important conceptual shift in stone tool production strategies since the advent of bifacial technology more than one million years earlier.” Similar finds were made in India, Marwick adds.</p> \n<p>As sites going back hundreds of thousands of years are extremely hard to date, we can roughly say that Levallois is apparently –&nbsp;at the very, very least –&nbsp;300,000 years old. Which is when, according to the latest theories, modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, was emerging from among his hominin brethren all over Africa.</p> \n<p>Levallois technology had been thought to have reached Asia much later, around the Paleolithic period, 30,000 to 40,000 years ago, brought there by migrating modern humans. Evidently, not so: Marwick and the team report on dating Levallois tools found (decades ago) in Guanyindong Cave in Guizhou Province, China. Using newfangled technology that analyzed the sediments where the tools were found, they reached an age between 80,000 and 170,000 years.</p> \n<p>Analysis of 2,200 artifacts found in Guanyindong Cave led to 45 Levallois-style stone cores and flakes, they elaborate.</p> \n<p>Even the earlier date in the range, 80,000 years, is before the human-evolution models have modern humans migrating to China (though that could be wrong).</p> \n<p>And if Goren-Inbar's diagnosis of the stone cores in Gesher Benot Yaakov is accurate, at least the germ of Levallois might even predate the split between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals.</p> \n<p>&quot;It seems plausible because we have a well documented case in Armenia,&quot; notes Marwick, who agrees that, theoretically, Homo erectus could have been the ancient inventor. &quot;But we would need to see the artifacts combined with some hominin bones, fossils, before we can be confident. Until then, all we can do is speculate,&quot; he tells Haaretz.</p> \n<p>To err is to be Neanderthal</p> \n<p>The name “Levallois technique” received its name from the Parisian neighborhood where it was first unearthed, Levallois-Perret, in the 19th century.</p> \n<p>If Levallois technology was being used over 300,000 years ago or before we existed at al), who exactly was using it?</p> \n<p>At least in Morocco, it was apparently being used by some kind of Homo sapiens, since we see the tools and human bones together at&nbsp;Jebel Irhoud, Marwick tells Haaretz. “Later, they are also used by Neanderthals in Europe.”</p> \n<p>One possibility, Barkai suggests, that humans evolved rather earlier than we have been thinking. (Neanderthals are “Homo neanderthalensis,” by the way; nobody thinks they were dull as bricks anymore, though their capabilities are still hotly debated.)</p> \n<p>Barkai agrees that Levallois was associated with Neanderthals. But in contrast to Marwick, and based on the evidence in Israel, Barkai is confident that Homo erectus was capable of either Levallois itself, or the precursor to that technique. Erectus was probably the one who started stone tool making down that road, he thinks. And again, if the technology goes back over half a million years, it definitely wasn't invented by a human.</p> \n<p>So, could Levallois have originated once, for the sake of argument, in Africa or the Levant, and “migrated” with early humans as they spread? Sure.</p> \n<p>But the discovery of Levallois technology in so many places, from so many times, leads to thoughts that it originated independently in more than one spot, which is the point of the new paper. “The evidence is accumulating in support of that scenario,” says Marwick.</p> \n<p>No human fossils have been found linking the Levallois tools to migrating human populations. But then, hardly any hominin fossils have been found in Asia, period.</p> \n<p>Another question mark hovers over the Neanderthals. OK, there are dozens of question marks about Neanderthals, but one is whether they were ever in Africa. They definitely thronged the Levant, where modern Israel is now, and mated with Homo sapiens here too.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to say things more categorically – partly because the dating of Levallois sites involves elephantine margins of error; partly because of the sheer scarcity of fossil remains from human evolution anywhere, let alone in Asia; and partly because, due to that paucity, we are still unclear who our direct ancestors were. Archaeologists are still arguing over whether we humans stem from Homo ergaster or Homo erectus, not to mention whether ergaster and erectus were actually the same species.</p> \n<p>It is entirely possible that discoveries now being made in Asia will change our understanding of human evolution, Marwick says.</p> \n<p>“East Asia is an exciting and challenging area to study human evolution. So much of the world’s current population live there, but we know so little about how they got there,” he says. “Compared to Africa and Europe, we have not had as much time or resources to find evidence in Asia. But we’re catching up, because the evidence is increasingly showing that this region is an important and unique part of the story of how we became human.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s the morning of October 29. In the evening, Abie, the new restaurant owned by brothers Yotam and Asaf Doktor (proprietors of two other Tel Aviv eateries, Haachim and Dok) was to open its doors to clients for a trial run. Chef Asaf was worried, not only because of the grand occasion and the pressure of managing service and staff in a new location, but also because an unfortunate incident had occurred the morning before. “The chefs broke the last bottle of garum we’d prepared,” he said glumly. “I didn’t explode in a fit of anger – but I almost blew up inside. We’re making another batch of garum, but it won’t be ready for a few weeks.”</p> \n<p>Garum, a basic element of the Mediterranean diet until the Middle Ages, is a sauce derived from salted, fermented fish, notable for its complex salinity and umami taste. In ancient times it was prepared by drying and fermenting small fish such as anchovies and sardines, together with their innards, in straw baskets or clay barrels that were placed out in the sun. In the past few months, Asaf Doktor, known to all as Dok or Doktor, experimented with the preparation of traditional garum, intended as a cooking ingredient and condiment for some of the dishes on the new menu.</p> \n<p>“Some people want to go forward with progress, but my interest is to go back, to the traditions and the roots,” he says. “I have no problem using modern technology. I have a sous-vide cooker in the kitchen, and it cuts down the time to prepare garum from 6 months to 11 weeks. To accelerate the fermentation process, caused by enzymes originating in the fish guts, we used barley koji that we got thanks to the Dok restaurant. Because [the menu] is based exclusively on local ingredients produced in Israel, and because we invited the public to share interesting raw ingredients with us, almost every day someone knocks on the door and brings something. In this case, it’s a young man from a kibbutz in the north who’s interested in fermentation processes and who makes barley koji and miso.”</p> \n<p>Curiosity about the past and the tendency to treat the restaurant’s kitchen as an experimental research laboratory is manifested in Abie’s most prominent feature: an immense wood-fired grill – 3.5 meters long, half a meter deep – that dominates the narrow, elongated space. Abie is named “a little for Abe Lincoln, like the street, and a lot for Abie Nathan, a restaurateur and person of peace who understood long before all of us that there’s a shared Mediterranean space,” says Asaf. It’s the next stage in the development of the restaurant business for the Doktor brothers and their partners.</p> \n<p>Haachim, opened in 2011 on Ibn Gabirol Street in Tel Aviv, is a modern skewers restaurant based on a charcoal-fired grill. Dok is a small, intimate bar-and-restaurant adjacent to it, which opened in 2015. “Abie is something of a combination of the two,” Asaf Doktor says, “but a wood grill takes the place of the charcoal grill. For the local ingredients we’ll go with a less rigid version than in Dok – here you can have a coffee and eat tahini – but we will still work with small manufacturers who supply most of the products – the primary one being local fish. There’s no meat, only fish and vegetables.</p> \n<p>“We work with four different fishmongers to try and acquire the best catch: fish imported only from the Mediterranean – Cyprus and Egypt – and hopefully importation of mussels and fish from Greece will also develop; and fish [raised in] local sweet-water ponds, mostly St. Peter’s fish and trout, which in my view have achieved excellent quality. When fishing in the Mediterranean stops during the reproduction period, we’ll serve a more pared-down menu, which will include fish from breeding ponds and pickled and preserved fish that we prepare ourselves.”</p> \n<p>Cooking at the primal level</p> \n<p>It’s enthralling to watch the big grill, in which two or three fires at different stages are always burning, and the work of the cooks, who incessantly need to feed the fire or shift a burning ember. “It’s cooking at the most primal level,” a cook who visited the restaurant early in the trial run said in amazement. “To throw logs on the fire, like in the past, and over them to grill animals, vegetables and fruits. In the modern age, cooking processes are hidden behind sophisticated instruments and techniques, but here you’re reminded anew of how the controlled use of fire was a driving force in human development.”</p> \n<p>“Charcoal is also made of wood,” Dok says, explaining the choice of a wood-fired oven that entailed installation of a complex, costly system of chimneys and smoke filters to meet environmental standards. “But the burn and emission of charcoal are different,” he adds. “In a way, as with the challenge of local raw ingredients that we set at Dok, we’re making it hard on ourselves. With charcoal you skip the combustion stage and get a stable, long-lasting fire. With a wood stove, we have to start by igniting the fires, created from twigs with logs atop them, hours before the service; and because wood is more dynamic, we need to ensure a fire nonstop.</p> \n<p>“It’s a headache,” he continues, “but it makes the work more interesting, with the goal of making the aromas and flavors more interesting, too. Working with wood also allows us to place the foods above the fire – at different levels of proximity to the flames or to the glowing coals – on thin nets, instead of the thick nets that a coal-fired grill requires.”</p> \n<p>Wood for the fire comes from agricultural refuse provided by farmers who cut down trees, old groves and orchards; the main types at the moment are pomegranate, citrus and olive trees. The wood-fired oven is used simultaneously for grilling, for slow or fast cooking of fish, shellfish and vegetables, and for smoking fish heads and bones to produce stock. (The sight of fish hanging on a steel hook above the source of the fire makes you think of still lifes by Chaim Soutine or larder paintings by Juan Sanchez Cotan; the image will surely become an icon readily identified with the restaurant.)</p> \n<p>The wood oven, covered with red bricks, also includes a hot smoker. The range of fish and cooking techniques made possible by this oven prompts thoughts about the use of the sea creatures’ less familiar parts, which usually get thrown out. One day in the restaurant’s trial run, an excellent stew of turnips cooked on the grill and then smoked together with the flesh of triggerfish heads was served. The next day came triggerfish stock and heads of little tunny with saffron and fennel.</p> \n<p>In the first two weeks of the trial run – the restaurant opened in the season when fishermen return to the sea (between summer and winter, or what optimists call the “Israeli autumn”) – the first diners enjoyed excellent dishes based on blue crabs, striped sea bream, anchovies, Spanish mackarel, greater amberjack, chub mackerel and other local fish. The grilled trout, from local ponds, is also very good; and even better is the St. Peter’s fish, also raised in local ponds, served deep fried as is the custom here. “Frying enhances St. Peter’s fish,” Dok says. “I’ve noticed that wherever I go in the world people respect it and present it as the crowning glory of the local kitchen. Maybe the time has come for a renaissance of St. Peter’s fish in the Israeli consciousness, too.” Served with the fish is a selection of Mediterranean mezze, such as homemade ikra, labaneh and a spread made from fava beans and grilled vegetables.</p> \n<p>Abie is located in a strange-looking concrete building that used to be a telephone exchange and had been abandoned in recent years. The nearest neighbor in the small, neglected commercial center, opposite excavations for the light train project, is a local supermarket. Like the brothers’ other two restaurants, which appear to have successfully captured the elusive essence of Israeliness, the design and atmosphere of the new establishment create a relaxed feeling free of formality and luxury elements.</p> \n<p>Abie, Lincoln 16, Tel Aviv, 03-777-5161</p>",

Kennedy Airport at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, took off more than five hours late.</p> \n<p>Bad weather had delayed the arrival of the crew by at least a couple of hours, and then prevented the take-off of hundreds of planes. The plane required deicing more than once as it waited in line to take off.</p> \n<p>By 11:30 p.m. dozens of passengers on the plane demanded to be allowed to disembark in New York, fearing they would still be airborne once Shabbat began. After being told to take their seats so that the plane could return to the gate and allow them to disembark, the plane instead took off.</p> \n<p>Here is where the stories diverge.</p> \n<p>Some passengers in social media posts accused the religious Jewish passengers of going too far, saying they became physically and verbally abusive during the flight when they realized that they would not land in Israel in time for Shabbat.</p> \n<p>Others say that the El Al flight attendants withheld information and then service to the religious passengers during the flight, and did not tell them until several hours later that the plane would land in Athens.</p> \n<p>Ben Chafetz, director of Client Services for 121eCommerce.com, said that he was one of the people who asked to leave the plane, even if it meant losing his ticket. Chafetz wrote: “Four hours into the flight the Captain announced that because of the “haredim” the plane would stop in Athens. At which point, all the people who want to get off for Shabbos can get off the plane first, and then, (and here is the kicker), all the people who want to continue to Israel will also have to get off the plane and go on a different plane from IsraAir to go to Israel.</p> \n<p>“What a shame… I wish El Al had announced the truth. We were stopping in Athens because El-Al made a series of bad calls, and once they landed they could not depart on Shabbos which is why they needed an non El-Al plane to continue to Israel on Shabbos,” he&nbsp;wrote.</p> \n<p>The decision to land in Athens angered both Orthodox and non-Orthodox passengers alike, for different reasons.</p> \n<p>“To be very clear, no one was angry at the stewardesses; everyone understood that they did not make the decisions. We were requesting to speak to the pilot or someone who can speak for the pilot. Again, there was no attempts to break into the cockpit, there were no physical altercations. Yes, there were some raised voices, but most of the time (I have the videos to prove it), it was secular Israeli passengers who came to yell at the passengers who were concerned about Shabbos that we were ruining their weekend,” Chafetz wrote.</p> \n<p>Passenger Roni Meital told a different story in a&nbsp;post on Facebook.</p> \n<p>“After 24 hours to reach Israel, I am broken, broken mainly because of the lack of respect of people who are observant, who observe tradition and Shabbat, who took this issue a step too far,” Meital wrote in her post.</p> \n<p>Meital thanked the flight crew for their patience and tolerance despite the aggressiveness of some of the passengers.&nbsp; She wrote that “after six hours of flying, I suddenly heard screaming and saw a flight attendant crying after she was hit, pushed, amid threats they would break open the door to the cockpit.” She also wrote: “I found myself standing and [physically] protecting flight attendants who were crying and who just wanted to catch their breath after the [violent] behavior toward them.”</p> \n<p>She called on others to share her post.</p> \n<p>Yehuda Shlezinger, religious affairs reporter for the Yisrael Hayom newspaper, was on the flight and&nbsp;saidreports of the behavior of the religious passengers was exaggerated.</p> \n<p>“I, like hundreds of other Israelis, was on the flight that departed from New York on Thursday night. I must confess, when I opened the news sites Saturday night and saw the crazy headlines about ‘bad’ haredim who ‘pushed flight attendants and threatened to break into the cockpit,’ I was livid. Thousands of likes, hundreds of shares, tons of venom on social media, and the news was completely fake. I double-checked the boarding pass in my pocket, to make sure we were talking about the same flight,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>Chafetz went on to describe the beauty of the Shabbat spent in the hotel literally across the street from the airport with meals provided by the local Chabad. “Hasidim sat and schmoozed with Zionists, Modox sat with black hats… I only use these labels so you can visualize the seating, but there were no labels at this seuda (meal); we sat in true achdus (unity).”</p> \n<p>El Al issued a statement saying, “Extreme weather in New York caused numerous cancellations and delays for hundreds of flights, including El Al flights that departed for Israel Thursday evening. Despite the cancellation of many flights, we succeeded in releasing Flight 002 from New York for our passengers, including an intermediate stop in Athens. El Al arranged onward flights to Israel that day for all passengers. Passengers who preferred to remain in Athens for Shabbat were cared for by company representatives, and El Al will return them to Israel after Shabbat is over.</p> \n<p>“We apologize for any discomfort caused to our customers, but as said we preferred to have the flight leave New York the same day.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The reactions to last month’s massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue have reflected the political tribalism of the United States.</p> \n<p>Liberals accused President Donald Trump of creating a political climate that encourages racism and anti-Semitism. The right argued that Trump’s support for Israel makes it ridiculous to accuse him of anti-Semitism and said the focus of concern should be on the anti-Israel trends among the left.</p> \n<p>Israelis speculated that spreading anti-Semitism will cause Jews to move to Israel, and perhaps the aliyah of hundreds of thousands of liberals could tilt the political balance of power in Israel in the left’s favor.</p> \n<p>But even the biggest pessimists don’t think a wave of anti-Semitism is about to sweep through America. The attitude toward Jews among both the elites and the general public continues to be extremely positive. Moreover, politicians and other public figures harshly condemn any display of anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>Contrary to the impression created by the statistics Jewish organizations have published about the rise in the number of anti-Semitic incidents and the extensive media coverage given to “alt-right” groups (which attract teens who pound computer keyboards from their parents’ homes) – membership in racist organizations in the United States has declined sharply in recent decades.</p> \n<p>The Ku Klux Klan had some six million members at its peak in the 20th century; today, it has about 8,000. Leaders of the coalition of white nationalists that had planned to hold a rally in Washington postponed it after realizing that the number of policemen guarding them would be greater than the number of demonstrators.</p> \n<p>On one hand, we should be skeptical of the claim by right-wing Jewish activists that Louis Farrakhan – the black Muslim nationalist who voices hatred for Jews – reflects a rise in anti-Semitism, antipathy for Israel and criticism of it on the left, especially among millennials, blacks, Hispanics and people who define themselves as progressives. These activists argue that the distancing of the American left from Israel verges on anti-Israelism and has a connection to anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>However, the other side of this right-wing narrative is that the enthusiastic support for Israel by Trump and Republicans in general is proof that their policies align with the interests of American Jews – which raises the question of why the great majority of those Jews don’t support Trump, and even see him as an existential threat.</p> \n<p>But what seems like a paradox turns out to be nothing of the sort when you examine the demographic changes in the United States. The generation whose worldview was formed in the aftermath of World War II – when the trauma of the Holocaust and Israel’s war for existence played a central role in the political and media agenda, and political establishments were controlled by white Christians – is beginning to leave the stage. It is being replaced by a generation whose ties with the Jewish community and attitude toward Israel are more ambivalent.</p> \n<p>The aging Democratic Party establishment, which has been American Jews’ political home since the early 20th century, supported liberal values that enabled Jews to reach positions of power and influence in the political system. The Republican Party, in contrast, sought to protect the interests of businessmen both large and small, and never won more than 40 percent of the Jewish vote in any presidential election. But the foreign policies of both parties were still based on America’s active involvement in global affairs, and therefore also in ensuring Israel’s existence.</p> \n<p>From this standpoint, it isn’t the danger of a wave of anti-Semitism that ought to worry American Jews, but a new reality in which they could become political orphans and their ties with Israel could become problematic.</p> \n<p>The Republican Party is acquiring a more nationalist and theocratic tint. The irony is that the most pro-Israel voters – evangelical Christians, who also constitute that party’s electoral base – challenge the principle, sacred to most American Jews, of separation between church and state.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the Democratic Party is becoming the home of black, Hispanic and Muslim activists: They are gradually becoming the electoral base of the party, making it less dependent on support from Jews, whose numbers are shrinking. These and other groups see Israel as a Western outpost in the Third World and are suspicious of it based on the view that it oppresses native-born populations and is supported by the remnants of the white establishment in both U.S. parties.</p> \n<p>And here’s another irony: Many young liberal Jews feel at home in the new Democratic Party. And when they have to choose between their commitment to progressive and universal values and their support for Israel, they will probably prefer their black and Hispanic allies to Jews who are ostensibly becoming more nationalist and theocratic.</p> \n<p>It’s important to remember that until World War II and the Holocaust involving European Jewry, most American Jews opposed Zionism. Such a process may recur. The Orthodox Jewish minority could continue to place its faith in Israel and support the Republican Party in cooperation with evangelical Christians, while liberal Jews like Bernie Sanders are liable to turn the Democratic Party into a political spearhead of criticism of Israel.</p> \n<p>Dr. Leon Hadar is a journalist and commentator on global affairs and a former research fellow at the Cato Institute who teaches political science at American University</p>",

Others say flight attendants withheld information and service to religious passengers, and did not tell them until much later that the plane would land in Athens to let them off.</p> \n<p>Usishkin said that throughout the flight, El Al management was working to ensure that passengers who wanted to would get to Israel as quickly as possible while ensuring that Sabbath observers would not find themselves flying after sundown.</p> \n<p>“Other foreign flights that were supposed to fly to Israel close to the time of the El Al flight cancelled due to bad weather. We could have cancelled as well, but we chose to make an effort to get into the air in the interest of our passengers and to bring them back home as soon as possible,” Usishkin said. “No other consideration influenced us.”</p> \n<p>El Al, which had earlier apologized for the inconvenience caused passengers, is estimated to have spent 1 million shekels ($270,000) to make the Athens stop. The airline, which as a policy doesn’t fly on the Jewish Sabbath or major holidays, has acted similarly in the past year to avoid desecrating the Sabbath.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Archaeologists digging in Pompeii have unearthed a rare fresco depicting the mythological sexual encounter between the Spartan queen Leda and the god Zeus in the form of a swan. The wall painting adds to the already rich catalogue of erotica found among the ruins of the ancient Roman city.</p> \n<p>The fresco, whose discovery was announced Monday, emerged on the wall of a lavish Roman house that had become blanketed in ash and debris along with the rest of Pompeii and nearby settlements when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 C.E.</p> \n<p>The explicit painting shows a semi-naked Leda sensually draped over a chair with the swan sitting in her lap while nuzzling her neck. The woman’s eyes are painted to look straight at the observer, as if catching any onlookers in a voyeuristic act.</p> \n<p>Erotic art is legion in Pompeii, and depictions of people having sex (sometimes with animals) and/or men sporting enormous phalluses abound. In the summer, archaeologists digging in the same villa where the Leda fresco was found uncovered an image, decorating the building’s entrance, of the god Priapus weighing his penis, a fairly common motif in the city.</p> \n<p>Still, the new find is “exceptional and unique for its decisively sensual iconography,” says Massimo Osanna, the director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park.</p> \n<p>The image is very different from other more common portrayals of the story that were found in Pompeii and elsewhere, which don’t often depict the sexual act and tend to show Leda standing while being pursued by the swan, Osanna said.</p> \n<p>Masquerading as a sexy beast</p> \n<p>There are many versions of Leda’s myth, but most identify her as a queen of Sparta who struck Zeus (or Jupiter for the Romans) with her beauty.</p> \n<p>On the same night she lay with her husband, King Tyndareus, she was also seduced (or raped, depending on the interpretation) by the leader of the Greco-Roman pantheon in the guise of a swan.</p> \n<p>This was reportedly a common ploy for Zeus, who frequently masqueraded as an animal to have affairs behind the back of his wife Hera. In another myth, the god abducts the princess Europa while in the form of a bull.</p> \n<p>In this case, Zeus’ lust set in motion the events of an even more famous myth: the Trojan War. The most common version of the story says that Leda’s night of sex with her husband and the swan resulted in two eggs, from which were hatched a son and a daughter each, two from Tyndareus and two from Zeus.</p> \n<p>The boys were Castor and Pollux, the semi-divine heroic twins of other Greek myths, while the girls were Helen and Clytemnestra. The former would go on to seal Troy’s fate with her doomed love affair with the Trojan prince Paris, while the latter married (and later murdered) the Mycenaean king Agamemnon.</p> \n<p>The myth of Leda and the Swan-cum-Zeus is one of the most popular and enduring in Western art and literature. It has been depicted by artists ranging from Michelangelo to Cezanne and retold as a violent rape in a 20th century poem by W.B. Yeats.</p> \n<p>The story was also very popular with ancient Romans, and was most commonly depicted as a variation of a 4th century B.C.E. statue attributed to the Greek sculptor Timotheos.</p> \n<p>Multiple copies of this statue have been unearthed across the Roman world, and the iconography may have also inspired the newly-uncovered fresco in Pompeii, says Osanna.</p> \n<p>While the fresco was found in one of the house’s bedrooms, it is not certain that its purpose was to inflame the passions of those spending the night there, the Italian official says. It could have been erotic art for erotic art's sake.</p> \n<p>While we do not know for sure who owned the large 1st century house, the most likely theory is that it belonged to a rich merchant, possibly a former slave, he says.</p> \n<p>In this case, the image of Leda and the swan could have been a way for this newly-moneyed man to pander to the local aristocracy, showing off his knowledge to “try to elevate his social status by referencing the myths of high culture.”</p> \n<p>Because the ruins of the ancient house are unstable, it is unlikely that visitors will be granted access to it, Osanna told Italy’s ANSA news agency. However, he reassured: experts are studying the possibility of removing the Leda fresco, and the previously discovered image of Priapus, and putting them on display in a museum.</p>",

        "text":["<p>&gt;&gt; Elections in Israel - Explained</p> \n<p>The first half of Naftali Bennett’s statement on Monday morning read exactly like a resignation speech. Because that was what it had been meant to be. He gave all the reasons from his perspective why he and his colleagues from Habayit Hayehudi could no longer sit in Benjamin Netanyahu’s government - “Israel is in a security confidence crisis” he said, and the source of the crisis is not its external enemies, but that “during the last decade in Netanyahu's governments - Israel stopped winning.”</p> \n<p>Bennett wanted to resign, as he made clear in the first half of his prepared speech. He then went on, in the second half, to give all the reasons why he was staying in the government after all. You could see it on his face and hear it in the tone of his voice. In Netanyahu’s long political career, there has been no other politician he humiliated more than Bennett. Sometimes it was major – like his unsuccessful attempts to keep Bennett out of his cabinet and to entice Habayit Hayehudi voters to jump ship in the 2015 election. Other times it was petty – such as his insistence on always putting Bennett last in meetings with coalition leaders and refusing to include him on prime ministerial flights abroad (sometimes even forcing him to take a separate flight).</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Netanyahu lays trap for Bennett, who might make a colossal political mistake&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;'Israel stopped winning':&nbsp;Bennett slams Netanyahu, but won't quit government</p> \n<p>The source of Netanyahu’s animosity towards Bennett is less important (starts with an S, four letters). The deeper implication for Israeli politics is that one of its rising stars, who should have naturally joined Likud, instead took over Habayit Hayehudi and turned it into a true right-wing competitor, forever forcing Likud to up the ultra-nationalist stakes.</p> \n<p>Bennett has little patience with the demands of running a religious party. He doesn’t believe politicians should take directions from rabbis. He knows that as Habayit Hayehudi leader he can never become prime minister. But the path back to Likud is blocked as long as Netanyahu is there.</p> \n<p>But on Monday morning, he backed down. He can’t be the one to topple Netanyahu. Avigdor Lieberman, like Bennett – both former chiefs of staff to Netanyahu – tried to do just that; but Lieberman, leader of a shrinking “Russian” party, had less to lose and no one to give any accounting to. As leader of Habayit Hayehudi, Bennett has much more baggage.</p> \n<p>The religious-right still carries around the trauma of 1992 - when extreme splinter parties brought down Yitzhak Shamir’s Likud government for the sin of going to the Madrid Conference (which was a futile event anyway). Those parties then failed to cross the electoral threshold, clearing the way to Yitzhak Rabin’s government and the Oslo Process – even though the right-wing and religious parties got more votes than the center-left bloc.</p> \n<p>Bennett is of the generation of right-wing Israelis who still remember that trauma and believe in the narrative of how right-wing extremism and infighting toppled what was the most right-wing government in Israeli history and ushered in “the Oslo disaster.” But he is too young to feel responsible for it. Many of the influential figures who form Habayit Hayehudi's ideological backbone, rabbis and settler leaders, were already politically active then and see it as their historical duty to prevent a similar chain of events. That’s why the religious-right has largely remained silent over the corruption allegations against Netanyahu and that’s why Bennett was under tremendous pressure until Monday morning, swamped by hundreds of telephone calls and text-messages, not to resign.</p> \n<p>In his statement, he chose to mention only one such conversation he had - with Nobel Prize-winner Professor Yisrael Aumann, who in a friendly manner explained why he thought that “for the good of the state” Bennett should remain in the government. But there were many less pleasant conversations.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t only twenty-six-year-old traumas that made Bennett change his mind. Netanyahu’s statement the previous evening at the Defense Ministry, where he warned of an “irresponsible” early election at such a “complex security period,” citing classified intelligence he can’t share with the public, sounded risible to most seasoned listeners. Bennett himself mocked it in his statement, when he mentioned all the times Netanyahu himself tried to call early elections during periods no less fraught in terms of security. But while Netanyahu’s fear-mongering may be transparent to many, Bennett knows full well that for many right-wing voters, it is devastatingly efficient.</p> \n<p>The twin fears - of being portrayed by Netanyahu’s media machine as the man who brought down the right-wing government and the one who jeopardized Israel’s security - was too much for Bennett. In his statement, he gave an account of his own Special Forces service (just like Netanyahu did the night earlier), but all his experience behind enemy lines isn’t enough to fortify him against being on the receiving end of the Bibi slime-gun.</p>",

        "text":["<p>J.K. Rowling is the author of the most successful book series in history – if we don’t count the trilogy attributed to God, Jesus and Allah – but her attempt to embark on a new career as a screenwriter hasn’t been as smooth as she may have thought it would be.</p> \n<p>“Basically, I learned how to write a screenplay as I went along… which is, to say the least, atypical,” she told fans two years ago in London ahead of the release of “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” whose plot unfolds decades before Harry Potter. The sequel, “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,” shows that even the most successful author in the world is in need of checks and balances when making the transition to cinema.</p> \n<p>Twenty-one years after her breakthrough, and following the sale of half a billion copies of the Harry Potter series, Rowling is working industriously to extend and enrich the mythology she created around the child wizard. In contrast to the eight Harry Potter movies, which were based on the seven books and most of which were written by veteran screenwriter Steve Kloves (“The Fabulous Baker Boys”), the “Fantastic Beasts” series is scripted solely by Rowling. This time she skipped the bookstores and went straight to the movie theater. No longer an author, now a screenwriter.</p> \n<p>The “Fantastic Beasts” series, which is scheduled to run to five movies, takes its title from one of Harry Potter’s textbooks. The leap backward in time, a new set of adult heroes and a globe-spanning background show that Rowling is in tune with her fans and the zeitgeist. Harry Potter and his friends started out as a salient product of 1990s naivety, but since then the loyal veteran audience has experienced the jolts of the 21st century and grown mature and disillusioned. In some cases, they’ve also brought a new generation of fans into the world, who were born pessimistic. The “Fantastic Beasts” series feel less like children’s fare; they deal with adults and appalling events that occurred in Europe at the end of the 1920s.</p> \n<p>It’s 1927, and the criminal Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) has escaped from prison to Europe. The 1920s are still roaring, but not swinging so much. The protagonist, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a zoologist of fantastic beasts, prefers to distance himself from politics; he is trying to maintain his improvised nature reserve in London. But the young Prof. Dumbledore, played by Jude Law, reminds him that neutrality is not an option in hard times. Dumbledore urges him to cross the channel to Paris and stop Grindelwald, who is trying to foment a war to ensure the purity of the wizard race.</p> \n<p>That’s a rough outline of the plot, but it constitutes only part of the movie. There’s another big parade of characters who enter and depart enveloped in mystery. I won’t list them all, but I will mention the boy Credence (Ezra Miller), who continues to have a central role in the struggle between the hero and the villain, even as his background remains a mystery. Similarly, Newt’s brother and partner, the snake-woman Nagini, and other new and old characters hint at an obscure past and future. All told, with the exception of one major revelation, the film lays strong foundations of mystery, but forgets to build any sort of structure above them. It’s like a construction site where the budget ran out too fast.</p> \n<p>With movie screens filled to the brim with superheroes and fantasy films, and every studio trying to float a fictional universe, Rowling is today’s most creative builder of cinema worlds. In contrast to her friends in the exclusive club of successful cinematic universes – Marvel and Star Wars – the author is not a Disney-owned limited company. She is a one-woman enterprise with a turnover of billions, but there’s still a difference between her and a mega-corporation like Disney. Diving into the world she created, she’s filling it with a sharp eye for the small details. Every character and beast is there because Rowling said so, not because the marketing division thought it would promote sales of merchandise. Rowling clearly has a true passion to create a mythology, and just as clearly she hasn’t yet finished creating it.</p> \n<p>Hogwarts can’t compete</p> \n<p>The “Fantastic Beasts” series offers a world even fuller than that of Harry Potter, crammed with details and colorful beasts and adorned with spectacular landscapes. Once more she collaborates with David Yates, who directed the four last Harry Potter movies and now the two “Fantastic Beasts” pictures. The spread of the wizards’ universe from Hogwarts and England to New York, London and Paris brings with it a collection of gorgeous images. Rowling’s world, which places a magical, hidden layer over familiar reality, is even more impressive when transposed to urban spaces. The cinematographer Philippe Rousselot and the delightful wizards conceived by screenwriter Rowling provide the loveliest – and also the most threatening and impressive – moments. Paris enveloped in wizardry is a sight that rural Hogwarts can’t compete with.</p> \n<p>Still, the world she’s created would be even more wondrous if Rowling had only filled it out with a crystallized or at least coherent plot. The forest is so well planned that you can’t see the trees. With a narrative that treads water at best and swirls about aimlessly at worst, “Fantastic Beasts 2” sacrifices narrative to the foundation work of the universe. Rowling tries to tailor the films to Harry Potter, but forgets that the second episode deserves to be treated as an autonomous entity. In the Harry Potter series she mostly succeeded in making the films into independent works. But in the absence of screenwriters to mediate between her imagination and the screen, the two “Fantastic Beasts” episodes are more like a chess game in which the creator moves characters from A to B as part of a broader strategy – which remains unclear.</p> \n<p>Even if the narrative is fragmented, “Fantastic Beasts 2” provides two and a quarter hours packed with details, and not a dull moment. Rowling populates her world with characters large and small, odd beasts and of course a host of bows to her veteran fans. The expansion of the world was not intended only to deepen the mythology but also to connect it clearly to the Potter annals. Now that the founding son has become nostalgia, the level of references to the world of the boy has risen accordingly, chiefly guest appearances of young versions of the Hogwarts old folks. They also help Rowling to forge systematically the time axis she has built ahead of the big confrontation that’s mentioned in the books.</p> \n<p>The disparity between the rich world and the meager story is disadvantageous for interesting characters with potential. The bewildered, insular and sensitive Newt is a proper hero for the world of wizardry, and Redmayne is well cast by virtue of his proven ability – perhaps excessively so – to play eccentric characters. In fact, since his excellent portrayal of Stephen Hawking in “The Theory of Everything” (for which he won an Oscar), Redmayne has been stuck in a niche he has carved for himself, with a slight tendency to recycle gestures, to the point where it’s by now hard to imagine him standing erect.</p> \n<p>His great adversary, Grindelwald, is even more of a missed opportunity, precisely because he’s a more interesting character than Voldemort. Not another murderous dictator with a disgusting nose, but a murderous populist with an appalling haircut who fires up his supporters with demagogic speeches. The connection between Trumpism and European fascism is crude, and would be less irksome were it not for Depp’s performance: his character is supposed to arouse fear and trembling, but instead unwittingly generates compassion. But the greatest miss is the relationship between Newt and the American agent Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), which falls victim to a flood of characters and unresolved, unsatisfying plot lines.</p> \n<p>“Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” is a film made for existing fans and doesn’t bother to appeal to a new audience. Not by chance does it offers a more mature world for fans who have grown up at least as much as Daniel Radcliffe, who played the boy Harry Potter. For them, the movie delivers the goods, but like many relationships of 21 years, little of the magic remains. There’s nothing of the adventure, tension and drama of Harry Potter. The second movie in the second series only connects, elucidates and clarifies the characters we’ve met, with a view to characters we’ll meet in the future for an obscure purpose. If Rowling continues to put out films without a beginning and an end, her world will implode, leaving only the middle. It may be entertainment with captivating characters and effects, but it’s not a movie.</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON – For U.S. evangelical supporters of Israel, 2018 has been one of the best years in recent memory.</p> \n<p>More than 75 percent of evangelical Christians voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and for many of them, his policies on Israel were proof that their support had paid off. Over the past 11 months, they cheered as Trump moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal and provided the Netanyahu government with unlimited support at the United Nations.</p> \n<p>Now, though, as the Trump administration finalizes its long-expected Middle East peace plan, the bond between Trump and the evangelical community could face a serious test.</p> \n<p>Trump’s Mideast team has been working on the peace plan for more than 18 months. Last week, a White House official told Haaretz that the administration is aiming to release it within the next two months. On Sunday, Israel’s Channel 10 News reported about a “crucial” meeting in the White House that will determine when and how exactly the plan will be presented.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian leadership has frequently accused Trump’s son-in-law and special adviser Jared Kushner, and special envoy to the Middle East Jason Greenblatt, of being biased toward Israel. However, the administration has insisted for months that its plan will be fair toward the Palestinians, and that both sides will be required to make tough decisions once the plan becomes public.</p> \n<p>If the plan does indeed include certain Israeli concessions, it could also create a dilemma for many in the U.S. evangelical community.</p> \n<p>“It’s too early to say how evangelicals will respond to the plan, because we have no idea what will be the contents,” says Prof. Darrell Bock, a New Testament scholar who has also conducted research on evangelical public opinion in recent years. “However, it could definitely be uncomfortable to some evangelicals if there are territorial concessions included in it.”</p> \n<p>Bock told Haaretz this week that the evangelical community can be “generally divided” into two main groups regarding Israel: “There is a clear majority, between 70 to 80 percent, who strongly support Israel; and there is a sizable minority, perhaps between 20 to 30 percent, who are more critical of Israel.”</p> \n<p>Evangelicals, it should be noted, comprise some 25 percent of the total U.S. population, which means that even small shifts in evangelical public opinion could influence millions of people.</p> \n<p>There are also differing views on Israel and its ongoing conflict with the Palestinians among those Bock refers to as “the pro-Israeli majority.” “There are some who oppose any form of Israeli territorial concessions, and they believe Israel has a right to all the land and should never give it up,” Bock explains. “And then there are others who strongly support Israel, but also think something should be done to address the needs and concerns of the Palestinians.”</p> \n<p>Bock also notes that America’s tens of millions of evangelical Christians have different levels of knowledge and understanding when it comes to Israel’s political and security circumstances.</p> \n<p>“You have a lot of people who love and support Israel, but they don’t necessarily have a very detailed knowledge of what’s happening in the country,” he says, adding that issues such as the settlements in the West Bank, the pre-1967 borders and the boundaries of Jerusalem aren’t necessarily part of how many evangelicals view the subject.</p> \n<p>“There is enormous trust among most evangelical Christians in President Trump’s love and support for Israel,” says Joel Rosenberg, an evangelical author-activist who lives in Jerusalem. Rosenberg has participated in a number of headline-making meetings over the past year between evangelical leaders and Arab heads of state, including Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi and, more recently, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p> \n<p>Rosenberg told Haaretz this week that if the Trump peace plan can bring Israel closer to the broader Arab world, that would make many evangelicals more eager to support it.</p> \n<p>“If this leads Arab countries to get closer to Israel, most American evangelicals will give Trump enormous credit for that,” Rosenberg explains. “It would be huge inside our community. Evangelicals overwhelmingly support peace. We pray for the peace of Jerusalem.”</p> \n<p>However, he concedes there are “different shades” within the evangelical world, and that “there are some evangelicals who think that if you support Israel, you should be against the Arabs and the Palestinians. But that’s not representative of all evangelicals. Most of us do care for the Palestinians and truly want to see peace and prosperity in the region,” he says.</p> \n<p>It should be noted, though, that in the past certain evangelical leaders have strongly opposed attempts to promote a two-state solution, even when those attempts were supported or initiated by elected Israeli governments.</p> \n<p>Giving peace plan a chance</p> \n<p>Evangelical leaders such as Pastor John Hagee fought bitterly against the Oslo process in the early 1990s and Israel’s disengagement from Gaza in 2005, as well as against President Barack Obama’s efforts to renew negotiations. During his time in the White House, President Bill Clinton believed that Hagee and other evangelical leaders were coordinating their fight against his peace policies with Prime Minister Benjamin&nbsp;Netanyahu and the Israeli right.</p> \n<p>Could such opposition from within the evangelical world take place under President Trump? “Trump has a real track record of pro-Israeli policy, and everyone can see that – it’s real,” says Rosenberg. “Obviously, if the Israeli government will strongly come out against his plan, that will give many evangelicals pause. But I think President Trump will have more leeway with his peace plan than some of his predecessors.”</p> \n<p>Rosenberg believes that if Trump’s plan “has a chance to bring peace and security, many will give it a chance.”</p> \n<p>Robert Stearns, an evangelical pastor who has led hundreds of groups on visits to Israel over the years, also believes Trump could get evangelical support for policies that other presidents would have had a hard time selling to the community.</p> \n<p>But he also notes that evangelicals will have some clear “red lines” in any peace plan. The most glaring one, in his view: Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>“There is no way evangelicals will support a division of Jerusalem in a peace plan,” Stearns says. “It would be viewed as duplicitous. Why move the embassy if you then try to break the city in half?”</p> \n<p>When asked to clarify if his view of a “United Jerusalem” includes not only the Old City and the neighborhoods around it but also more remote Palestinian neighborhoods in the eastern part of the city, Stearns chooses his words carefully.</p> \n<p>“If we’re talking about outlying areas in East Jerusalem that don’t affect the character of the city, that don’t include the main religious sites, that aren’t part of the security considerations – and they would potentially become some kind of Palestinian capital – perhaps that can be discussed. It’s up to the government of Israel to decide, not to us. But I think for most evangelicals, the integrity of the Old City and the areas around it, the religious sites, the areas people think of when they think of Jerusalem – those have to remain intact, accessible to all religions, and under Israeli sovereignty.”</p> \n<p>Stearns stresses he has some personal views on how the conflict could be solved. He believes, for example, that even if Israel left some parts of the West Bank, Israeli settlers living there should be allowed to remain in their homes, “just like you have Arab citizens living in Israel.” But at the end of the day, he says, “most evangelicals will support the decisions of the Israeli government.”</p> \n<p>The pastor notes that most evangelicals have the utmost respect for Netanyahu. If he were to come out against the Trump peace plan, that would have a strong impact, Stearns says. “I believe a majority of evangelicals will not support a plan if Netanyahu comes out against it. He is wildly popular among the majority of evangelicals. We have seen him lead Israel through difficult times. We appreciate his opinion when it comes to the security of the State of Israel,” Stearns adds.</p> \n<p>So far, the Trump-Netanyahu relationship has been – at least publicly – a positive one. But if the peace plan were to trigger a confrontation between them, evangelicals could be forced to choose between two leaders who are both overwhelmingly popular among the community.</p> \n<p>Bock says that while a plan that includes Israeli concessions “is not the default position of many evangelicals,” Trump could be uniquely situated to “lobby for it in the evangelical community,” building on his high level of support.</p> \n<p>“Trump could make it more acceptable to some people,” he says. “We can’t say anything definitive – all of this is speculation at this point. But my gut feeling is, unless there is a really heated confrontation, Trump will remain popular among most evangelicals, who like his internal policies even more than his foreign policy,” Bock adds.</p> \n<p>Both Bock and Stearns seemingly agree with Rosenberg’s analysis about the importance of broader Arab support for the peace plan.</p> \n<p>“Many evangelicals would support a plan if they saw that it enhances the stability of Israel and its acceptance by other countries in the region,” Bock says. Stearns adds that “those of us who visit Israel more frequently, and are aware of the complexity of the region and the nuances of the conflict, are very encouraged to see Israel get closer to some of its neighbors in recent years. So if there is an opportunity to make genuine peace between Israel and some of these countries in the region, we’d be in favor of that.”</p> \n<p>‘Fair and serious’ solutions required</p> \n<p>Mae Elise Cannon, executive director of Churches for Middle East Peace, is part of the evangelical minority that Bock described as “more critical of Israel.” Her group opposes Israeli settlements in the West Bank and has spoken out against some of Trump’s policies that were celebrated by the majority of the evangelical community.</p> \n<p>She says her main concern is that Trump’s peace plan will be “one-sided” and would therefore “fail at getting the support of the Palestinians, and also the Arab world.”</p> \n<p>Cannon adds that “we’ve heard from Egyptian, Jordanian and other Arab diplomats in recent months that their countries aren’t being consulted on this plan. I will be very surprised if this doesn’t end up as a plan that clearly favors one side over the other. You can’t make one-sided peace.”</p> \n<p>If, however, the peace plan will turn out to be “fair and serious,” Cannon believes most evangelicals – whether they are supporters or critics of Trump – will endorse it.</p> \n<p>“I hope to be surprised. If Trump will call for a two-state solution and offer fair solutions to the other core issues of the conflict, people in my camp would be incredibly supportive – and so will most evangelicals” she says.</p> \n<p>Some experts think the real question is not whether evangelicals will support the plan, but if Trump would even publish it unless he knew for sure that they would give it their backing.</p> \n<p>“American administrations always give some consideration to domestic politics when they are dealing with Israel,” says Aaron David Miller, a former State Department official who worked on Middle East policy under Republican and Democratic presidents. “But this administration has taken that to a whole new level. You really can’t compare their obsession with domestic politics on Israel to anything we’ve seen from any administration in the past.”</p> \n<p>Miller believes domestic politics – especially with regards to evangelical support – was the key consideration behind Trump’s decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem. “Henry Kissinger famously said that Israel has no foreign policy, only domestic politics. That also seems to be true for the Trump administration when it comes to Israel,” he says.</p> \n<p>Miller describes Trump’s dilemma in the following terms: Any peace plan that will include Israeli concessions could disappoint many of his evangelical supporters. Yet only a plan that will include significant Israeli concessions will have any chance of succeeding.</p> \n<p>“American administrations will only take the risk of alienating supporters of Israel if they believe that risk will lead to a major diplomatic success,” Miller says, citing as examples the Ford administration’s “reassessment,” which led to Israeli flexibility in peace talks with Egypt, and the Carter administration’s hand-wringing with Prime Minister Menachem Begin in the lead-up to the Camp David Accords.</p> \n<p>“If this administration thinks it truly has a chance for resuming serious negotiations and getting a deal, then I’d say this is worth the risk for them,” Miller says. “But even then, would Jared Kushner really be willing to put forward a plan that creates a tough choice for Bibi? I don’t know the answer – but that’s the only question that matters.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Benny Gantz must surely regret his “anemone speech,&quot; as it came to be known, in early August 2014. Seeking to cheer up a beleaguered Israeli public after a full month of fighting in Gaza during Operation Protective Edge, the then-IDF chief of staff made a rookie’s mistake. Against the backdrop of a temporary 72-hour cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, Gantz waxed poetic about a “red south” that will soon be blessed with “anemones, flowers and stability” for many years to come. Less than 48 hours later, the fighting resumed, ferocious as before.</p> \n<p>“The final chord of his tenure as chief of staff was ‘go pick anemones’ and little four-year old Daniel Tragerman was killed,” Culture Minister Miri Regev said Monday, in a blatant logical fallacy. By the same token she could have said “Benjamin Netanyahu promised Hamas would suffer and the boy is dead”, or “Avigdor Lieberman left Likud because Netanyahu wouldn’t destroy Hamas [he did so during the 2014 campaign as well], and little Daniel.” or even “The Press Council rejected complaints against Haaretz columnist Gideon Levy and three days later the boy was dead,” etc. There is no causal connection between Gantz’s speech and Tragerman’s tragic death, of course, but Regev knows her rabid right-wing audience: Their thirst to be titillated by hate far exceeds their yearning to be moved by logic.</p> \n<p>Regev was roundly and rightly slammed for her obnoxious linkage.&nbsp; She cynically exploited the killing of a young boy to smear the name of the man who seems to pose the greatest electoral threat to Netanyahu, the Likud and her own prospects of continuing to serve as a cabinet minister. In her defense, however, Regev is only emulating true masters.&nbsp; She belongs to a political party whose head habitually blames George Soros/The New Israel Fund/leftist NGOs for all the country’s woes, from international criticism to the plight of African asylum seekers. She lives in a country that admires Donald Trump, grand wizard of diversion and incitement, who specializes in similarly distorted attacks against his rivals and critics, including, and even especially, if they happen to be former generals or senior security officials.</p> \n<p>By sheer coincidence - the concept is apparently alien for Regev - at the same time that she was assaulting Gantz, Trump was waging a war of words with the highly-decorated and widely-respected former U.S. Admiral William McRaven, who oversaw the 2011 assassination of Osama Bin Laden. In Trump’s eyes, McRaven’s long years as a Navy SEAL and commander of U.S. Special Operations pale in comparison with his post-retirement criticism of Trump’s presidency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Just as Trump, who never served his country, tried to diminish the bravery of John McCain during his captivity in Vietnam because he dared confront him, and compared U.S. intelligence services to Nazi Germany for reporting on Russia’s efforts to get him elected, so he tried to discredit McRaven this week by claiming, with no basis in reality, that Bin Laden could have been apprehended much sooner.&nbsp;Trump, after all, claims to be a better military strategist than all his generals. Regev, by the same token, is telling Likud stalwarts that Gantz-Shmantz, only Netanyahu and the Likud know how to safeguard Israel’s security.</p> \n<p>High on the long list of the long-lasting damage inflicted by Trump, he has proven to like-minded politicians throughout the world that personal attacks, odious and preposterous as they may be, get the job done. In a hyper-polarized political arena, as it exists today in both Israel and the U.S., decades of volunteering, serving one’s country and even risking one’s life are rendered meaningless. The only criterion is - are you with me or are you against me, do you silently salute no matter what inanity the President happens to produce or do you speak your mind and protest his wanton misrepresentations.</p> \n<p>In the world according to Regev and the rest of the Israeli right, which increasingly wallows in its cesspool of loathing, even senior and highly-decorated military officers must be “in the same head as us”, as Lieberman once said of senior government officials. Otherwise, it’s open season, they’re fair game, and their detractors, from Trump to Regev, are coming to the hunt with a license to kill.</p>",

        "text":["<p>I.</p> \n<p>In his new book, “21 Lessons for the 21st Century,” Yuval Noah Harari rides the wave of success of his two bestsellers – “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind” (Hebrew, 2011; English, 2014), which made him an international superstar; and “Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow” (Hebrew, 2015; English, 2016). The first two books dealt with the past and the future, and now Harari wants “to zoom in on the here and now,” particularly the here and now that includes the rise of populism, support for Brexit and Donald Trump’s election victory. Readers already familiar with Harari’s ideas won’t find much that is new in “Lessons,” as large portions of the book are a recycling of his earlier works. However, the focus on the present makes it possible – more than in his previous books – to uncover Harari’s guiding political logic, which is chiefly to restore the rule of the “liberal elites.”</p> \n<p>In “Sapiens,” Harari depicted this rule as the realization of a utopian vision, of a global empire ruled by an international elite that ensures peace within its borders – world peace, in other words. It’s no wonder, then, that the liberal elites hastened to embrace Harari. The business magazine Fast Company called him “Silicon Valley’s favorite historian”; Mark Zuckerberg boosted his fame when he included “Sapiens” in the Facebook book club; and blurbs from President Barack Obama and Bill Gates graced the book’s cover. Gates also did his bit to promote Harari’s subsequent books: “Homo Deus” appeared on his recommended summer reading list for 2017, and this year he wrote a rave review of “Lessons” in The New York Times.</p> \n<p>Why did Obama, Zuckerberg, Gates and Silicon Valley as a whole adopt Harari as their pet historian? One possible explanation for their efforts to spread his gospel could be the political benefit they hoped to extract from the close connection between Harari’s view that there is currently no serious alternative to the neoliberal package and the metanarrative he’s been weaving since “Sapiens” – which will be referred to here as the “Sapiens mythology.”</p> \n<p>II.</p> \n<p>The organizing fulcrum of “Lessons” is an attempt to address the crisis of liberal democracy, which Harari considers the optimal type of regime for confronting the challenges of the modern world. He finds the origins of the crisis in the ideological plane. Populism triumphed because the “liberal story” lost its credibility in wake of the 2008 financial crisis, after having already failed to provide “obvious answers” to the global dangers posed by the nuclear threat, global warming and technological innovation. For the liberal elites to regain power, Harari argues, they must create “an updated story for the world.” As they are unable to do so, he is assuming the role of their ideologue and in “Lessons” proposing an updated version of the liberal story based on “Sapiens mythology.”</p> \n<p>Populism poses a danger to the world’s future because it encourages “nostalgic fantasies,” ignites nationalist separatism and adversely affects international cooperation, which is vital for meeting global challenges of the 21st century. Harari believes, therefore, that “At the end of the day, humankind won’t abandon the liberal story, because it doesn’t have any alternative. People may give the system an angry kick in the stomach but, having nowhere else to go, they will eventually come back.”</p> \n<p>To fight populism, the anger must be assuaged, and this requires a new liberal story, one that has yet to be offered. Responsibility for this devolves on the “liberal elites.”</p> \n<p>A bit like the Soviet elite in the 1980s, liberals don’t understand how history deviated from its preordained course, and they lack an alternative prism through which to interpret reality. “Disorientation causes them to think in apocalyptic terms, as if the failure of history to come to its envisioned happy ending can only mean that it is hurtling towards Armageddon,” Harari writes. This panic leads to political paralysis, which allows populism to spread more easily, which exacerbates the panic, and so on in an endless cycle.</p> \n<p>III.</p> \n<p>The new liberal story woven by Harari is characterized by a blurring of the social reality and its political alternatives. He discusses the factors behind the crisis of liberal democracy and concludes each discussion with uncertainty and puzzlement, leading to a discussion of another, more abstract and spiritual factor. In the chapter on war, for example, he adopts historian Barbara Tuchman’s “March of Folly” approach and says that human foolishness is one of the most powerful forces in history, that “both on the personal and the collective level, humans are prone to engage in self-destructive activities.” Having reduced political analysis to pop-psychology diagnoses, Harari asserts, like an oracle, that World War III is not inevitable, but also not impossible. This rather pointless forecast leads him to a conclusion that is more theological than political – that the way to prevent war is through “a dose of humility.”</p> \n<p>After the chapter devoted to war, Harari discusses, on a rising scale of abstraction, the concepts of humility, God, secularism, truth, justice and more, each of which adds to the fogginess of his take on the social reality and the blurring of its political dimensions. Finally, in the book’s closing chapter, “Meditation,” Harari explains how to deal with the difficulty of seeing things with “greater clarity.” He says the “glasses” through which he examines the world are the “focus and clarity” he attains through Vipassana meditation – a term that means “introspection,” he says. Hence he believes we all should observe ourselves and, especially, get to know our consciousness – by practicing Vipassana or another technique.</p> \n<p>Instead of a political discussion of the crisis of liberal democracy, Harari proposes introspection. In so doing, he only obscures the causes of the “current crisis” and stymies the effort to find solutions to it – without which the crisis continues to deepen.</p> \n<p>IV.</p> \n<p>The analytical failures on the basis of which Harari arrives at his political suggestions are blatant in his discussion of two of the urgent issues that define the international agenda: the immigration crisis and the terrorist threat. In the “Immigration” chapter, Harari maintains that the migration to the European Union arouses “mixed reactions” from its citizens, and this nourishes a fierce dispute that the public debate cannot easily resolve. “To clarify matters,” he resorts to market logic and suggests “view[ing] immigration as a deal” between the host countries and the immigrants; accordingly, he presents the dispute between immigration supporters and opponents as if it were a quasi-legal argument about whether the parties are upholding the conditions of this imagined deal.</p> \n<p>However, at the end of a lengthy discussion that blurs the lines of the dispute, he declares that it’s impossible to say who is right. Later, Harari examines attitudes toward immigrants using arguments that echo the multicultural discourse, substituting the term “racism” for “culturism.” But this also doesn’t really help him clarify the immigration dispute. At the end of the chapter, he states, “It is a discussion between two legitimate political positions, which should be decided through standard democratic procedures.” In other words, Harari recommends sticking to the political dead end that stirred up the debate from the outset, and the purported attempt to clarify the picture effectively serves as a cover for obscuring it.</p> \n<p>Harari’s obfuscation reaches a peak in the “Terrorism” chapter. He minimizes the danger of terrorism, calling it “theater,” a strategy of “very weak parties” seeking to undermine the pubic sense of security in order to generate political change. He therefore scolds governments and the media, saying that their response magnifies the fear that terror seeks to instill, thereby abetting its efforts to achieve its goals. The state should “respond to the theater of terror with its own theater of security” and fight terror “quietly and efficiently.” The media should “avoid hysteria” and stop the over-reporting that gives terrorism publicity and intensifies the fear.</p> \n<p>But Harari’s urgent pleading is oddly out of date. He refers mainly to the September 9, 2001 attacks, but does not discuss subsequent patterns of terrorist operations – terrorist organizations run by states or possessing a semi-state character – which undermine his premises and conclusions. In addition, Harari’s analysis of the reciprocal relationship between terrorism and the media is limited to the era before the advent of the social networks that make it possible to address the public directly, without mediation by the established media.</p> \n<p>Rather than the promised insights regarding the question of how to cope with today’s terrorism, Harari offers a moralistic rebuke: “It is the responsibility of every citizen to liberate his or her imagination from the terrorists.” It is our own “inner terror” that is the cause of the inept response by governments and the media. Conclusion: “The success or failure of terrorism thus depends on us.”</p> \n<p>This privatizing of the war on terror by means of slogans taken from the world of personal coaching flies in the face of the most up-to-date ways of dealing with it. For example, political scientist Dafna Canetti argues that intervention by governmental and societal mechanisms can mitigate the psychological effects of terror on the individual and reduce the sense of fear that it arouses.</p> \n<p>Harari’s musings on war, immigration and terror reveal the logic of his method: He takes these issues out of their social context, portrays them as politically unresolvable and makes dealing with them an individual matter. The establishment of this state of confusion, for which Harari seems to be striving, is accomplished by privatizing the public space, which in this writer’s view is a prerequisite for the rule of the liberal elites.</p> \n<p>V.</p> \n<p>Harari’s contribution to restoration of the rule of the liberal elites is manifested in the chapter titled “Equality.” He warns that the present century is liable to see the emergence of the most non-egalitarian societies in history, for technological breakthroughs will allow the rich to translate their economic advantage into a biological advantage, and class differences will atomize humankind into biological castes. That development, he notes, will be in contrast to the 20th century, “which revolved to a large extent around the reduction of inequality between classes, races and genders.” Thus, the world of 2000 “was nevertheless a far more equal place than the world of 1900” – a trend that began to change only in the first years of the 21st century.</p> \n<p>However, the discussion of “the world” blurs the rapid rise in social-economic inequality that occurred in the core countries of the West during the final decades of the 20th century, fomented by what the economist Thomas Piketty called the “conservative revolution,” which was spearheaded by Milton Friedman, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Its aim was to “roll back the welfare state,” and it increased inequality by privatizing social infrastructures and services, infringing on progressive taxation and liberalizing and deregulating the capital and commodities markets.</p> \n<p>It follows, then, that Harari’s contention that the technological revolution threatens to undo the welfare state in the very near future is mistaken and misleading; in practice, that process began four decades ago as part of the neoliberal revolution. By this means, Harari adjusts the picture of the past to his political needs in the present. In order not to set back rehabilitation of the rule of the liberal elites in the 21st century, he blurs the route they took to building themselves up by heightening social-economic inequality in the last quarter of the 20th century.</p> \n<p>VI.</p> \n<p>Harari also mobilizes on behalf of restoring the image of the liberal elites in the chapter titled “Community,” which deals with Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. To assuage the public anger caused by Facebook’s growing monopoly, Harari sets out to divert criticism from the corporation’s abusive economic behavior to its harmful influences on the lives of its users as individuals. Immersion in screens causes human beings, he says, to grow remote from their body and to lose “the tools to connect to their own experiences.” Accordingly, he calls on Facebook to develop a business model that will reduce its users’ exposure to the web and allow them to devote greater attention to their physical surroundings and their bodily sensations. Similarly, Harari diverted the discussion from Facebook’s comportment as a company to a discussion of the limits of the social networks as media, thereby eradicating the political content of the critique.</p> \n<p>Criticism of Facebook was translated into public demands to subject its roughshod activity into strict governmental regulation. Though Harari adds his voice to the critics, once again he does so apparently only in order to annul the political implications of their demands and to thwart as far as possible governmental action that will limit the company’s operations. Thus he suggests that Facebook itself, out of sheer good will, should improve its behavior and ensure its users’ privacy and stop evading tax payments, for example. Along with rejecting political intervention, Harari suggests coping with Facebook’s might through market methods; he proposes that incentives will be offered to corporations, institutions and governments to compete with Facebook and suggest social projects of their own.</p> \n<p>The chapter on Facebook was originally published in the Financial Times in March 2017, and it’s reasonable to think that Zuckerberg read it then. But even if he didn’t, he would subsequently behave as though he had internalized Harari’s critique concerning Facebook’s need to acknowledge its mistakes and agree to compromises in order to protect its vital interests.</p> \n<p>Last April, in the wake of a number of scandals in which Facebook was involved, Zuckerberg was summoned to a hearing by the U.S. Senate, where he admitted, “it’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm.” He expressed regret and contrition, assumed personal responsibility for mistakes that were made and explained that their origin lay in an overly narrow perception of Facebook’s social role. The limits of Zuckerberg’s remorse are shown by what he said before the hearing, in support of regulation of publication of political ads on the internet, provided this is imposed on all platforms, not just Facebook. Zuckerberg’s retreat thus had a clear business purpose. He promised the senators that Facebook would take the criticism to heart and change its ways, in order to obviate the possibility of new regulations being imposed, as commentators noted. Zuckerberg’s humility show was thus totally consistent with the strategy of compromise suggested by Harari.</p> \n<p>Alongside support for liberal elites, Harari’s new liberal story blatantly ignores the protest movements and the left-wing parties that have challenged neoliberal hegemony in the past decade. The liberal elites are part of a political bloc that the philosopher Nancy Fraser labels “progressive neoliberalism.” Pursued by Presidents Clinton and Obama, this policy harmed the material well-being of members of the seven lowest socioeconomic levels in the U.S. In reaction, some of them switched to support of Donald Trump. Fraser, who in contrast to Harari sees the liberal elites as the problem and not the solution, maintains that the true alternative to Trump is a “rejuvenated left” in the form of Bernie Sanders’ “democratic socialism.” To win the trust of the “working people,” Fraser emphasizes, the rejuvenated left will need to breach the false dichotomy between “emancipation” and “social protection” – in other words, to disconnect from progressive neoliberalism and uncover the conceptual and political divide between the two schools.</p> \n<p>The same political logic that impels Fraser to call for a renewed left and to hone the differences between it and progressive neoliberalism, leads Harari to blur those differences. In fact, the obfuscation of social-economic inequality and the erasure of socialism is creating the illusory notion that the political struggle is being waged only between populism and liberalism, and therefore it appears that opponents of populism should hook up with liberalism, even if they are victims of its social-economic policy. In fact, it’s progressive neoliberalism that is the other side of Trump’s populism. Thus, deleting the rejuvenated left from the new liberal story that Harari weaves in “Lessons” serves liberalism and populism alike.</p> \n<p>VII.</p> \n<p>In erasing politics from history and by confounding the causal explanations for its development, Harari draws on the “Sapiens mythology,” the metanarrative he has developed since “Sapiens” and which gained him his fame.</p> \n<p>The Sapiens mythology is based on two contradictory suppositions. One is that the brain and the mind we carry within us are those of hunter-gatherers and thus not suitable for our world, but for the world of the hunter-gatherers. The other is that, since the language revolution, there is no such thing as a “natural way of life.” There are only different cultural choices from a vast range of possibilities.</p> \n<p>This contradiction effectively reflects the market logic that underlies the Sapiens mythology. According to Harari, “Most of the injustices in the world result from large-scale structural biases rather than from individual prejudices, and our hunter-gatherer brains did not evolve to detect structural biases.”</p> \n<p>Harari’s contention that the individual is incapable of spotting “biases” within the systemic “structure” reveals the Sapiens mythology to be one more metaphor of the conception that views the market as a natural condition. It’s in this light that we should read his warning in “Lessons” – that if humankind will not know what to do with the power vested in it by biotech and infotech, “market forces will not wait a thousand years for you to come up with an answer. The invisible hand of the market will force on you its own blind reply.” However, in accordance with Harari’s assumption that “our hunter-gatherer brains did not evolve to detect structural biases,” it appears that humankind cannot breach the hidden hand of market forces – all it can do is recognize them and act within their framework.</p> \n<p>The Sapiens mythology is thus another version of the conflict between political action and introspection, which is at the heart of Harari’s analysis. In the spirit of progressive neoliberalism he affirms with anthropological explanations the limits of the influence of democratic politics on the market and reduces the interest of the individual to his cultural choices within its framework.</p> \n<p>The Sapiens mythology replaces the conventional mechanisms of interpretation in historical research – including those that focus on processes and not on events – and proposes randomness instead of causality. Thus in “Lessons,” instead of explanations for the crisis of liberal democracy, Harari offers only more and more cases and examples, and more and more arguments for and against and from one side and the other side, all of which only further shroud history in the contradictions of the Sapiens mythology.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the reason why Harari’s books have become huge bestsellers is definitely amenable to historical explanation. Since the 1990s, the processes of dispossession wrought by neoliberalism have generated increasing resistance to corporate globalism and social inequality. This has been accompanied by an interest in the policy of neoliberalism and the way its mechanisms of suppression work. A wave of books, such as Naomi Klein’s “No Logo” and “The Shock Doctrine,” and films such as Michael Moore’s documentary “Sicko” have addressed these phenomena. The economic crisis of 2008 and the protest movements of 2011 transmuted the failures of neoliberalism and its injustices into a political struggle for their reform, which could have threatened the rule of the liberal elites. This is apparently the background against which the success of Harari’s books – which began to be published in 2011 – should be understood.</p> \n<p>The Sapiens mythology created the illusion of an explanation for the economic and political crisis; further, it supplied an anthropological rationalization for the impotence that appeared in the face of the market forces, while depicting liberal elites as the prospect for rectifying the situation. Harari’s message competed successfully for readers’ attention and displaced from the public debate those interpretations that were liable to endanger neoliberalism. Indeed, while Klein’s social critique exposes the mechanisms of suppression and inequality and frames them as part of neoliberal policy, the Sapiens mythology focuses on behavior and on the individual, and sets our gatherer brain as an obstacle to systemic analyses and to the possibility of fomenting structural change. In “Lessons,” Harari adds another layer to the difference: whereas Klein and Moore describe the failures generated by inequality in the present, Harari diverts attention to their dangers in the future.</p> \n<p>Harari’s Sapiens mythology is thus one more cultural mechanism that aims to consolidate the neoliberal hegemony and normalize the rule of the liberal elites. In this respect, it resembles reality programs, which instill neoliberal standards in their viewers through entertainment, or the various New Age manifestations, which do it by presenting ostensibly different laws of conduct, which effectively replicate the assumptions of the market.</p> \n<p>The description of the liberal elites in “Sapiens” as bringing about world peace, made Harari their preferred historian, and in “Lessons,” also their preferred ideologue. In “Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,” Harari portrays liberal ideals as universally accepted, but in practice the liberal elites need the Sapiens mythology – in addition to other economic, social, political and cultural means – in order to make them accepted by all. Accordingly, breaching neoliberal logic and waging a struggle against economic inequality, social insecurity and the human suffering it entails, also obliges breaching the limits of Harari’s mythology and its illusions, in order to expose their underlying historiographic flaws.</p> \n<p>&quot;21 Lessons for the 21st Century,&quot; by Yuval Noah Harari,&nbsp;372 pages, published by Spiegel &amp; Grau</p>",

        "text":["<p>Without question, the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement scored its biggest victory ever on Monday when Airbnb announced it would stop running lists in West Bank settlements.</p> \n<p>Not that it’s a blow to the Israeli economy. It isn't even a blow tothe economy of the settlements. By Airbnb’s own count, there are just 200 listings involved, making the entire business the size of a single smallish hotel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Why Airbnb will have a hard time enforcing its Israeli settlement ban</p> \n<p>But Airbnb is a global brand name, and if it doesn’t have any moral authority, it certainly has buzz power. People will pay attention, at least for 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>Like everything else about BDS, you learn very little about what is really going on by listening to activists on either side, to politicians, or even the company itself. Airbnb’s move is being framed as either a step forward in the good fight for human rights and national liberation, or a victory for anti-Semites. But it’s really neither.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Business with Jews</p> \n<p>Let’s start with the anti-Semitism accusations, which are absurd but trotted out so often in the context of BDS that you would think that it is really an issue.</p> \n<p>Eugene Kontorovich, director of international law at the right-wing, Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum, makes the anti-Semitism case like this: &nbsp;“It is only Jewish properties in the Jewish homeland that are banned. Airbnb’s approach of singling out Jews from all the disputes in the world will put it at odds with U.S. state BDS laws and principles of discrimination.”</p> \n<p>Unlike many others are on the right, he is gentlemanly enough not to use the A-S word, but he employs the same logic: The BDS movement is out to get Jews and now Airbnb is complicit.</p> \n<p>The truth is that the BDS movement does attract anti-Semites, but BDS itself doesn’t engage in anti-Semitic behavior by calling to boycott Israel any more than Donald Trump is anti-Persian for imposing sanctions on Iran.</p> \n<p>In adhering to BDS’ call, Airbnb made a political/business decision, which is that (if you look at its waffly official statement) it won’t offer listings that have a “direct connection” to a political dispute or contribute “to existing human suffering.”</p> \n<p>Airbnb didn’t say it wouldn't do business with Jews. In fact, it does a lively business in Israel and as of this writing, even in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights (which Israel has formally annexed).</p> \n<p>The distinction Airbnb is making is between occupier and occupied, not between Jew and gentile.</p> \n<p>Renting a room in occupied Tibet</p> \n<p>But isn’t Israel being singled out for it’s supposed bad behavior? If so, that could be seen as anti-Semitic.</p> \n<p>On one level, that’s true. As settlement defenders frequently note, there are other occupied territories around the world that haven’t come into Airbnb’s crosshairs. In fact, if you want to rent a room in the Turkish-occupied bit of Syria or Northern Cyprus, Airbnb has some good deals. Likewise there are listings in Tibet, although China officially speaking doesn’t occupy it.</p> \n<p>Israel’s problem is that the Palestinians have become a cause celebre to Western leftists all out of proportion to the size of the problem. The cause attracts anti-Semites, but it is animated by an existential disgust at the European legacy of colonialism and claims of white supremacy.</p> \n<p>For many on the left, this disgust is embodied in the settlements and even the existence of Israel itself.</p> \n<p>The underlying sin of colonialism and racism from the point of view of the left doesn’t apply to Turkey or China even when they are occupiers because they are part of the historic victim class of colonialism by Europeans. Israel on the other hand is considered to be a Western country: we are, goes the perception, Europeans who colonialized Palestine. The oppression of Jews in Europe, for centuries on end, is irrelevant to this point.</p> \n<p>With that kind of historical baggage, it’s natural that a group like Human Rights Watch would see the settlements as so deeply tainted that it would tweet: “Every time somebody clicked to book, Airbnb got its commission. Airbnb contributed to, and benefitted from, human rights violations.”</p> \n<p>Strictly speaking, it has a point, but how far should the moral stain spread? By those high standards, Airbnb and, for that matter no business, should be doing business in large parts of the world, but that would be an impossible demand.</p> \n<p>The reality is that the world’s moral interests aren’t dictated by consistent or even logical standards, but by the power of one group to get its cause at the top of the world’s agenda. Cyprus doesn’t have the political resources and, even with a celebrity boost from the Dalai Lama, neither does Tibet.</p> \n<p>In all events, the Airbnb boycott of the settlements isn’t likely to be first in any string of wins for BDS. Airbnb was in a particularly vulnerable position because its business dealt directly with settlements. Other travel sites like Booking.com may follow Airbnb’s example, but the list of businesses that answer the BDS call pretty much ends there.</p> \n<p>Needless to say, the Israeli government’s reaction is all out of proportion. Threatening lawsuits and other, unspecified harm to Airbnb’s business elsewhere in Israel will hurt Israeli renters and the tourism industry more than it will punish the company. But it’s always been the case with this government, that it is ready to pursue the narrowest interests of the settlers, no matter the cost it imposes on the rest of Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Salima Mourad takes the stage with her head slightly bowed and a big smile, wearing a sleeveless dress. She always looks stylish; she doesn’t shout it out, it’s simply part of her. She’s hypnotic. You can’t take your eyes off her, in the old film clips. She has a virtuosic voice that she uses in any way she sees fit, spanning a broad vocal range, singing softly and forte. She seems to know exactly what she’s doing. There’s a reason why Mourad, who passed away in 1974, is still considered one of the most famous and admired singers in Iraq.</p> \n<p>Last week, a unique tribute was paid to Mourad within the framework of the Jerusalem International Oud Festival. Called “The Voice of Baghdad,” the event took place under the auspices of the city’s Confederation House and featured an impressive group of singers and instrumentalists, as part of a collaboration involving veteran producer and musician Yair Dalal, with artistic direction by Effie Benaya.</p> \n<p>The life of Salima Mourad, who was born in 1900, sounds like something out of a Hollywood film: A young Jewish Iraqi woman begins to sing and turns out to be one of the greatest talents in the country and in the entire Arab world. She performs in the most prestigious venues, in cafes, at nightclubs and family parties, and becomes a famous and admired figure, as great as Egyptian singers Umm Kulthum and Laila Mourad – who was also Jewish.</p> \n<p>Mourad, dubbed “the voice of Iraq,” recorded a huge number of songs (between 800 and 1,200), mainly in the 1920s and ‘30s, when the Jews dominated the music industry in Iraq. Although during the rule of Saddam Hussein it was forbidden even to mention the names of Jews, after his downfall there was renewed interest in the history and the music of that period, which had brought about a genuine artistic revolution in Iraq.</p> \n<p>Today Mourad and other local Jewish musical talents are studied in Iraqi academic institutions, articles are written about them, new musical arrangements are made for their songs, and they are even the topics of television shows. A few years ago Iraqi television broadcast a 14-episode drama series called “Salima,” about Mourad’s life.</p> \n<p>In the 1920s and ‘30s, Baghdad was home to an acclaimed music industry, which played a central role in Iraqi culture and Arab culture in general, and was almost entirely dominated by Jews.</p> \n<p>“Until about 1920 most of the songs there belonged to the ataba genre, [traditional Iraqi] love songs and dirges, along with Bedouin songs and the traditional Iraqi maqam,” says Dalal, in an interview before the concert, referring to a popular system of melodic modes in Arabic music.</p> \n<p>No one was composing modern songs in the country, adds Dalal, 63, who himself has roots in Iraq, “until [Jewish] brothers Saleh and Daoud al-Kuwaiti began to write such songs, and Salima Mourad sang them. And suddenly there was an orchestra of 20 players instead of four – something more powerful, with violins for the first time, with more orchestration.”</p> \n<p>At the Congress of Arab Music in Cairo in 1932, Jewish performers showcased modern Iraqi maqam, and in 1936 the Al-Kuwaiti brothers, the most successful composers and instrumentalists in the country at the time, created the Radio Baghdad orchestra, to which they added for the first time instruments such as the ney, a type of flute, and the cello.</p> \n<p>“The maqam was sung in cafes, at family celebrations, they would play and sing until morning,” Dalal says.</p> \n<p>Until the early 1950s, members of the Chalrey Baghdad ensembles who played modern Iraqi maqam, and eventually expanded into larger orchestras, were exclusively Jewish.</p> \n<p>In 2008 the Iraqi maqam was declared by UNESCO as one of its “New Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.”</p> \n<p>Iraq comes to Israel</p> \n<p>One of the best-known stories in the history of the Iraqi Jewish community is the one about the Iraqi prime minister who turned on the radio one day and didn’t hear any music. When he realized that the reason was that it was Yom Kippur, he asked the station manager: “Don’t you have Arab musicians?” “No,” was the simple answer.</p> \n<p>One reason why Jews dominated the music scene in Iraq in the early and mid-20th century was the Jewish music school for blind children in Baghdad, which was founded by Yusuf Za’arur, a famous player of the qanun, a string instrument resembling a zither. Many of the students there became successful musicians; some of them immigrated to Israel beginning in the early 1950s, as did Za’arur, and established the Arab Kol Israel (Voice of Israel) Orchestra there.</p> \n<p>In general, a substantial number of noted Iraqi Jewish composers, instrumentalists and singers – among them the Al-Kuwaiti brothers and Za’arur, plus Filfel Gourgy, Ezra Aharon, Yusuf Za’arur, Yaakov al-Ammari, Yosef Shem Tov, Elias Shasha, Salim Shabbat, Yechezkel Katzav and others, considered masters of the maqam – followed the Zionist dream. However upon arrival in Israel, in many cases, they found themselves overwhelmed by the burden of survival and the struggle for basic dignity.</p> \n<p>“The Kuwaitis, the greatest musicians in Iraq, sold eggs at the Hatikva market,” says Dalal, referring to the poor Tel Aviv neighborhood. “I remember their store – I grew up with those people. It’s true, they performed in the Noah Caf&eacute;, with the Israel Broadcasting Authority Orchestra. But it was closed down and they were sent home on early retirement.”</p> \n<p>Returning to the subject of Salima Mourad, Dalal notes that unlike many of her fellow Jewish musicians at the time, she decided to remain in Iraq, where “every song she released became a hit. She contributed a great deal to Iraq’s musical culture and to this day one can hear new renditions of her songs – in Iraq and elsewhere.”</p> \n<p>Adds Dalal, “She was an Iraqi first, and then a Jew. She loved her homeland and didn’t want to leave. She felt it was a betrayal: Who would sing in Iraq if not she? The son of Saleh al-Kuwaiti tried to convince her to come to Israel, and told her there was no place for Jews in Iraq. And she asked him: ‘But what will I do there? My audience is here. Here I have millions.’ And the truth is she wouldn’t have had anything to do here.”</p> \n<p>Mourad’s career continued to flourish in Baghdad, from the 1930s onward. She received honor and admiration and to this day her influence on Iraqi culture is evident. During her career she also made sure to nurture many young artists.</p> \n<p>“Yosef Shem Tov, who played with her from the age of 12, was also in her orchestra,” says Dalal, referring to a well-known Iraqi Israeli talent. “She heard him play and wanted him with her. She was a very generous woman, was nice to everyone around her and always helped people in need.”</p> \n<p>One of the singers nurtured by Mourad became her husband, and one of the most famous singers in Iraq, Nazem al-Ghazali. He was a Muslim and she was a Jew, which didn’t seem to matter to her; she was always proud of her heritage.</p> \n<p>Dalal: “He was 15 years younger than she, and they fell in love and married. She stayed there together with him and had a glorious career in Iraq and throughout the Arab world, as well as in Paris and London. In 1963 Al-Ghazali died suddenly of cardiac arrest. From that moment she refused to sing and didn’t leave the house. When she died, in 1974, they buried her alongside him in a Muslim cemetery.”</p> \n<p>“We lost out,” says Dalal. “The older generation that lived her lost out, but at least the intermediate generation will get to hear these songs on a stage with an orchestra, and not at some party at home.”</p> \n<p>The salute to Mourad last week featured experts in Iraqi music, vocalists and instrumentalists alike, starring the Hiba Orchestra, brainchild of Elad Gabai, a singer who plays the qanun and oud. Dalal says he wanted to make the performance as authentic as possible, without using new arrangements of the music, as if the performance were taking place in an auditorium in Baghdad decades ago.</p> \n<p>“All this love is coming out of my chest,” he says. “I can’t even define it. I hear and play a lot of music, but suddenly when I hear an Iraqi song I melt. It’s stronger than me.”</p>",

They also believe that Jews should be encouraged to share their reservations about Israel and its policies.</p> \n<p>The latest findings show that Jewish community leaders in Europe continue to view anti-Semitism as a major threat to the future of Jewish life on the Continent.</p> \n<p>Two-thirds of respondents said they anticipated anti-Semitism would increase “significantly” or “somewhat” over the next five to 10 years – compared with 54 percent a decade ago.</p> \n<p>Asked how safe they felt living as Jews in their cities of residence, only 20 percent said “very safe” – down from 36 percent 10 years ago. By contrast, 13 percent said they felt “rather unsafe,” compared with 6 percent a decade ago. Those living in Eastern European countries were more likely to feel safe than their counterparts in Western Europe.</p> \n<p>Still, a large majority – 73 percent of respondents – said they felt their governments were adequately addressing the security needs of the Jewish community.</p> \n<p>The online survey, which took place in April and May, polled 893 Jewish community leaders and professionals in 29 European countries (not including the former Soviet Union). First launched 10 years ago, the European Jewish Community Leaders' Survey is conducted every three to four years.</p> \n<p>The respondents were asked to rank the most serious threats they perceived to the future of Jewish life in Europe. Although anti-Semitism was not viewed as the top threat, it nonetheless registered the biggest jump in the ranking.</p> \n<p>Among the respondents, 56 percent said they perceived anti-Semitism as a serious threat, compared with only 23 percent in the 2008 survey.</p> \n<p>Yet when asked whether they had personally considered emigrating from their respective countries in the last five years, the vast majority of respondents – 76 percent – said they had not. The rate was even higher among younger respondents.</p> \n<p>Among those who said they were considering emigrating, two-thirds said their destination of choice was Israel, while the remainder were split between other European countries and North America. Older respondents were more likely to choose Israel as their destination of choice.</p> \n<p>Asked whether they expected an increase in emigration within their respective Jewish communities, almost half – 48 percent – said they did not. Another 43 percent said they expected a “limited” increase, while only 9 percent said they expected a “significant” increase. Anti-Semitism was cited as the primary factor behind the desire to emigrate.</p> \n<p>The report indicates that support for Israel among Jewish leaders in Europe is not only high, but in fact growing. Among respondents, 68 percent said they supported Israel fully “regardless of how its government behaves.” That compares with 55 percent in 2015 and 61 percent a decade ago.</p> \n<p>Some 43 percent said, however, that they were “sometimes ashamed” of the actions of the Israeli government, which was similar to previous surveys. The vast majority of respondents, 84 percent, said they believed Israel was critical to sustaining Jewish life. At the same time, 78 percent said it was just as easy to be a good Jew in Europe as it was in Israel.</p> \n<p>A consensus emerged among respondents (with 85 percent agreeing) that Jewish communities should provide opportunities for their members to share “different opinions and points of view” about Israel and its policies. A similar percentage said that events in Israel “sometimes lead to an increase in anti-Semitism in my country.”</p> \n<p>Topping the survey's list of serious threats to the future of Jewish life in Europe were alienation from Jewish communal life; demographic decline; lack of engagement of community members; and weakness of Jewish organizations. Anti-Semitism was placed fifth, tied with declining knowledge about Judaism.</p> \n<p>The increased rate of intermarriage is perceived as much less of a threat than it used to be, falling from first place 10 years ago to 11th place in the current survey.</p> \n<p>The respondents were split over the question of whether they believed the future of Jewish life in Europe is “vibrant and positive.”</p> \n<p>When asked about communal causes that need to be prioritized in the next five years, they listed strengthening Jewish education, supporting Jews in need and combating anti-Semitism as their top three. It was the first time anti-Semitism appeared that high on the list.</p> \n<p>The JDC-ICCD is the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee’s European research and evaluation unit.&nbsp;Founded in 2005, it provides in-depth perspectives on the European Jewish community, identity and social welfare.&nbsp;Among the respondents, 33 percent identified as Orthodox, 26 percent as traditional and 41 percent as nonreligious “cultural” Jews.</p>",

        "text":["<p>SAN FRANCISCO – Iran and Israel may not be sitting down for a diplomatic summit anytime soon. But Iranian-American and Israeli-British cooks? That’s a different story.</p> \n<p>Samin Nosrat is the current “It girl” of the culinary world with a hit Netflix series, best-selling debut cookbook and New York Times food column. Yotam Ottolenghi is an acclaimed London restaurateur, veteran cookbook author and Guardian columnist. Yet neither would ever let politics get in the way of good food.</p> \n<p>The two food pros – both prefer to be called cooks rather than chefs – oozed mutual admiration as they shared a stage at the San Francisco Jewish Community Center at the end of October. Nosrat interviewed Ottolenghi before an audience of starstruck local foodies as part of a tour celebrating the publication of his latest cookbook, “Ottolenghi Simple.”</p> \n<p>“I have looked up to you for so long,” confessed Nosrat to the Israeli, who has authored no fewer than six cookbooks. “My family is from Iran. I came up in very Western and elite kitchens. You were a very bright light for me by using the ingredients and tastes of my childhood, and bringing them and elevating them to the world stage.”</p> \n<p>Before Ottolenghi came along, she noted, “Nobody knew what pomegranate molasses was – and it is a taste I grew up with. I am so appreciative of what you have done for the people of my culture and so many cultures,” she told him.</p> \n<p>Ottolenghi has indeed been a pioneer when it comes to helping make Middle Eastern and Asian ingredients staples of Western pantries. Thanks to his recipes, many more cooks in Europe and the United States are now comfortable using tahini, harissa, sumac, preserved lemons and za’atar (aka hyssop), and preparing dishes like shakshuka and siniya.</p> \n<p>Ottolenghi returned the compliment, praising Nosrat’s creative and unconventional food writing in “Salt Fat Acid Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking” – which has swept every cookbook award over the past year. Her book is based on the premise that “good cooking around the world is more similar than it is different. We humans seek the same things in our mouths, and deliciousness is defined universally.”</p> \n<p>The pair’s spirit of camaraderie and enthusiastic endorsement of international cross-pollination is refreshing in an era of “hummus wars” and seemingly endless food fights over cultural appropriation in the culinary realm.</p> \n<p>Ottolenghi is all too familiar with such controversy. The Jerusalem-born chef worked as a journalist and academic before deciding to abandon his books for kitchen tools. He attended the London branch of the Le Cordon Bleu cooking school and worked as a pastry chef, which led to the creation of his famous Notting Hill deli – the first of his six acclaimed London establishments.</p> \n<p>His best-known book is 2012’s “Jerusalem,” co-written with Palestinian chef Sami Tamimi, which sparked many a conversation regarding Israeli and Arab food traditions and the definition of cultural appropriation.</p> \n<p>While traveling the world in her research for “Salt Fat Acid Heat,” Nosrat – another writer/cook-turned-cookbook author – visited Ottolenghi’s test kitchen in London, which she described as a “peek” into “the magical Ottolenghi private world.” She marveled at the number of countries represented among those working to help develop his recipes, including North Africans, Asians, Italians and South Americans. “It’s a United Nations of food,” she said.</p> \n<p>“In this moment where everyone is talking about cultural appropriation, you have created a beautiful bubble world,” she told him. “It is kind of the opposite of appropriation, where you give others credit, you pay them and give them the opportunity to share their thing. It all becomes one big work you are making together.”</p> \n<p>A simple oxymoron</p> \n<p>Ottolenghi has built his career on collaboration. His restaurants and delis may bear his name, but they are the joint enterprise of a group of partners. “My name is the one that sounded the best,” he modestly told the audience. His debut book of recipes, “Plenty” (2010), was the first and last time he developed a cookbook by working solo in his home kitchen. Since then, all his cookbooks have been collaborations, recipes developed in his restaurants-delis and, now, his dedicated test kitchen.</p> \n<p>The book he was in town to promote, “Ottolenghi Simple,” was co-written with Tara Wigley and Esme Howarth. In it, Ottolenghi takes up the challenge presented by the most common criticism of his recipes: That they are intimidatingly long, complex and time-consuming, requiring a lengthy list of exotic ingredients that aren’t always easy to obtain in local markets.</p> \n<p>With a chuckle, he acknowledged that “for a lot of people, ‘Ottolenghi Simple’ is an oxymoron.”</p> \n<p>But he clearly bristles at the fact that people associate his name with the philosophy that “more is more.” He recounted how, when he and one of his collaborators came up with a “solid recipe” for a straightforward and delicious pea soup, others working in his test kitchen said, “It’s not very Ottolenghi.”</p> \n<p>Writing in The Guardian, he explained that his new book is based on his philosophy that “there’s more than one way to get a meal on the table, and that everyone has a different idea of which way is simple.”</p> \n<p>The 130-plus recipes are organized by a code he created based on the word “simple,” whose letters stand for: “Short on time”; “10 ingredients or less”; “Make ahead”; “Pantry”; “Lazy”; and “Easier than you think.” Each recipe displays the letters for which the principles apply.</p> \n<p>He described writing the book as being an exploration of what simple cooking is: “There are a lot of books with ‘simple’ or ‘easy’ in the title. But easy and simple is about personality and a state of mind.”</p> \n<p>When Nosrat asked how he managed to simplify recipes without losing that “Ottolenghi-ness,” he responded: “There needs to be something you haven’t expected, a surprise, a tension, a feeling of ‘I haven’t had that before.’ That is doable with fewer ingredients.”</p> \n<p>The book includes recipes the cook makes at home with his partner, Karl Allen, for their two young sons. These include fish fingers and baked potatoes – “things that nobody ever thought they would see in a Ottolenghi cookbook,” he said. Ottolenghi purists need not fear, though. The book still includes Middle Eastern fare like lamb siniya.</p> \n<p>Everything up front</p> \n<p>On stage in California, Nosrat and Ottolenghi bonded over their distaste of fussy presentations: Food, whether in restaurants or cookbook photographs, should not be “over-organized” or “over-manicured,” they believe.</p> \n<p>They also share a fondness for restaurants that put food on display wherever possible, so it can be seen and smelled by the diners before they dig in. “There is nothing better than a restaurant with everything out front – prepared next to you or stored next to you. That connection with the food is really, really important,” said Ottolenghi.</p> \n<p>An ideal meal in a restaurant, Nosrat concurred, “is a replication of a mythical home-dining experience, sitting at a table surrounded by food.”</p> \n<p>She recalled that her first exposure to his work “was the first Ottolenghi cookbook in Britain with the displays from the restaurant, and it was so striking to me to … see those huge, inviting platters of food. I always felt a kinship with you for that: I always insist on serving ‘family-style,’ because I like to bring people to the table and make them talk to each other – even if it’s just ‘Pass me the plate.’ That’s the way a conversation begins.”</p> \n<p>Regarding the problematic “cultural appropriation” conversation, Ottolenghi admitted being torn between wanting to acknowledge difficult realities and transcending them through food, which for him “first and foremost is about joy and fun.”</p> \n<p>He believes the debate over ethnic ownership of certain dishes has “gone mad,” and is not limited just to the Middle East. After visiting his late mother-in-law in Northern Ireland, for example, Ottolenghi dared publish his own unconventional take on Irish stew, which included orange zest, herbs “and maybe a cinnamon stick.” Angry comments ensued, in which Guardian readers “insisted that a real Irish stew should be just mutton and potatoes.”</p> \n<p>The irony? “The people writing the angry notes weren’t even Irish – they were Englishmen protecting the poor Irish from cultural appropriation,” said Ottolenghi.</p> \n<p>The other tension of the modern age – which both Ottolenghi and Nosrat confessed to struggling with – is social media’s influence on the cooking world. On the one hand, they worry that its proliferation acts as a stand-in for real-life contact – and video editing and Instagram filters can create unrealistic expectations when it comes to food preparation and presentation. On the other, it has also acted as a catalyst for the cross-cultural interaction that both of them have clearly benefited from.</p> \n<p>“It really enhances conversation and creates communities,” he observed. “The international community of cooks that has evolved over the last 10 years is incredible. Back when I went to culinary school, chefs didn’t talk to each other and they all kept their secrets in books. I remember so clearly how much of a secret the chef’s recipe book was. And now it’s the opposite; everything is open. People are talking to each other and interacting and having pop-ups in other people’s restaurants – and it’s all thanks to technology, because it’s so easy to be in contact with people.”</p> \n<p>The event took place between the Pittsburgh synagogue tragedy and the U.S. midterm elections. So although politics wasn’t explicitly mentioned, it still seemed inevitable when Nosrat asked Ottolenghi what he thought chefs could do to harness “the power of food to bring people together,” and help heal wounds in “times like this when the world feels so divided.”</p> \n<p>Echoing the title of his latest book, Ottolenghi’s reply was simple.</p> \n<p>“There’s one answer: you just cook. I remember when I started cooking professionally, what I found staggering was how easy it is to create a very good vibe with food,” he said. “It’s an eternal truth: A world without cooking would be one in which you really couldn’t heal any fracture. Without it, people wouldn’t have those moments of feeling that nothing else matters.</p> \n<p>“Food is an international language,” he concluded. “Nobody chooses not to eat, so that’s really the solution.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Atalla Fayoumi hobbles on crutches across the sunbaked plain near Israel’s perimeter fence in the Gaza Strip, gazing toward plumes of smoke that have begun rising from a clutch of burning tires in the distance.</p> \n<p>The 18-year-old Palestinian’s right leg was amputated after Israeli soldiers shot him here in April at one of the mass demonstrations against Israel’s long blockade of Gaza that are held every week. Yet he has kept returning to the protests — just like thousands of other desperate, unemployed men who feel they have nothing left to lose.</p> \n<p>Eight months after the demonstrations began, there appears to be no end to what has become a predictable routine that has killed dozens. Over the next few hours, Fayoumi knows the crowds will swell into the thousands. They’ll burn so many tires, the sky will turn black. They’ll attack the fence with stones and firebombs, Israeli gunfire will ring out, and Palestinian ambulance sirens will wail non-stop.</p> \n<p>By the time it is over, at least 80 Palestinians will be wounded and three will be dead.</p> \n<p>At sunset, Fayoumi and the others will abruptly turn around and walk home, while the Israelis will emerge from their positions and march the other way.</p> \n<p>In a week, like clockwork, they will be back, poised for the deadly ritual to start all over again.</p> \n<p>The Gaza Strip has been the front line of confrontations between Palestinians and Israel for generations. But the territory has been brought to its knees over the last decade by three punishing wars with Israel and an air, sea and land blockade.</p> \n<p>The 11-year blockade, imposed by Israel and Egypt, is aimed at weakening Hamas, the militant group that seized power in Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. But its impact is felt by all. Raw sewage flows directly onto once-scenic Mediterranean beaches, tap water is undrinkable, and electricity is available just a few hours a day. Over half the Gaza Strip’s 2 million people are unemployed, and most residents cannot leave what has become, in essence, a mass prison, even for medical reasons.</p> \n<p>The blockade and growing anger over the harsh living conditions have put enormous pressure on Hamas, which is trying to redirect it toward Israel with relentless protests, said Mkhaimar Abusada, an associate professor of political science at Gaza’s al-Azhar University.</p> \n<p>“But it’s a very slippery slope,” Abusada said. “Because they’re not going to stop until the siege is lifted — or there is another war.”</p> \n<p>That almost happened this month, when an Israeli raid into Gaza left seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli military officer dead. The raid prompted Hamas and other armed groups to fire hundreds of rockets and mortar shells into Israel, triggering a devastating wave of Israeli airstrikes in return — the heaviest fighting here since a 2014 war.</p> \n<p>Both parties pulled back from the brink with a truce, and Hamas kept last Friday’s protests restrained — though not enough to keep 40 Palestinians from being wounded.</p> \n<p>While most Gazans see the protests as the inevitable reaction to Israel’s siege, Israel has a different view altogether.</p> \n<p>“We don’t see them as protests ... we’re not seeing somebody exercising their democratic right to gather and voice their opinion,” said Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus. “We are confronting attacks, violent attacks along our security fence from an entity, Gaza, that is controlled by a terrorist organization, Hamas.”</p> \n<p>Since they began March 30, Israeli troops — using live ammunition against Palestinians mostly armed with rocks — have killed more than 170 people and shot nearly 6,000 others, among them scores of children. Thousands more have been wounded during the protests by tear gas or rubber-coated bullets. On the Israeli side, one soldier has been killed by a sniper and six others wounded.</p> \n<p>Every Friday, there are more.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It is 2:30 p.m. in Malaka, one of five protest sites along the border, and several boys are practicing for a fight.</p> \n<p>They are flinging large rocks onto a barren field with homemade slingshots. One of them, 17-year-old Ahmed al-Burdaini, shows off a bucket filled with fragments of steel rebar he says he spent the week collecting from the rubble of homes destroyed in past Israeli airstrikes.</p> \n<p>“We want to use it against them,” he says proudly.</p> \n<p>Another boy points across the frontier and writes in a reporter’s notebook: “This Is Our Land.” It is a reference to another demand of the protests, that Palestinians be allowed to return to lands lost during the 1948 war that created the Jewish state — a demand Israel rejects outright.</p> \n<p>The perimeter fence itself is a few hundred meters (yards) away. Israeli soldiers on the other side peer out from bunkers built atop pyramid-shaped berms along the fence.</p> \n<p>The protest site is still largely empty, but people are trickling in. Among them is the amputee, Fayoumi, who says he was throwing rocks near the fence and was shot as he rushed to help a wounded friend. A few days earlier, speaking at a clinic run by Doctors Without Borders, he swore he would keep participating in the protests despite his wounds. But why risk it?</p> \n<p>“Because I want to die,” he said.</p> \n<p>He would prefer for the blockade to be lifted so he could leave Gaza to get a new, prosthetic leg. But if that doesn’t happen, “what’s the point of living?”</p> \n<p>The sun is bearing down intensely when a couple dozen Palestinians roll a few tires toward the fence and set them on fire. The first gunshots ring out at 3:14 p.m., in the standard Israeli response to the start of the protests. An armored Israeli jeep at the edge of the fence fires a volley of tear gas canisters that leave white arcs trailing across the sky as they fall. The protesters are unfazed.</p> \n<p>Among the growing crowds is an incongruous sight: five street vendors pushing dilapidated food carts hawking seeds, nuts, and frozen slushies. One is affixed with a cheap wooden speaker blaring traditional Bedouin music. It gives the protest the atmosphere of a country fair.</p> \n<p>Vendor Adam Badwan, 17, has a simple explanation for coming: “Business is good here, much better than in town.”</p> \n<p>Plainclothes Hamas security agents appear. A local television crew arrives with flak jackets and helmets. A single ambulance pulls up.</p> \n<p>After Friday noon prayers, around 4 p.m., Hamas dispatches huge buses to many mosques to bring supporters to the border. But many more come on their own — on foot, in cars, motorcycles, bikes and wheelchairs. Within one hour, at least 13,000 people are gathered along the border.</p> \n<p>Dr. Khalil Siam is standing inside a medical triage tent about a kilometer (half a mile) from the border when the ambulance sirens begin to howl just after 5 p.m.</p> \n<p>The first one to arrive drops off a 22-year-old man who was shot in the left leg. The second brings an 18-year-old, blood streaming from his bandaged face, who was struck by shrapnel.</p> \n<p>When the third comes shortly after, bearing a 31-year-old shot in the chest, there is shouting and panic — and no doubt the most dangerous phase of the protests has begun. The bullet has punctured the man’s lung, and he is lowered gently onto a gurney as eight doctors and nurses gather round.</p> \n<p>One of the doctors inserts a clear tube into the man’s chest, and within seconds, blood and liquid is draining into a blue plastic bowl on the floor.</p> \n<p>“Keep breathing! Keep breathing!”</p> \n<p>“Every Friday we wait for the injuries, and every Friday it’s always the same,” says Siam. “They always come.”</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Outside, a convoy of vehicles passes. Young men are standing on them, thrusting fists in the air, their faces hidden with scarves and white Guy Fawkes masks. It is the “Burning Tire Unit” — and soon it will fill a vast section of the frontier with a wall of fire and billowing sheets of smoke.</p> \n<p>A few dozen meters (yards) away, five men in checkered, black and white headscarves are performing a traditional folk dance with their arms crossed for a captivated crowd under a massive tent. Behind them, in the distance, the border fence looks like a war zone; the sky is completely black, burning tires are shooting flames into the air, and gunfire is ringing out every few minutes.</p> \n<p>But nobody is looking toward the border, and few notice the steady stream of ambulances that are crisscrossing the adjacent road, non-stop. Here, vendors are selling corn on the cob and peanuts, and fathers are balancing children on their shoulders.</p> \n<p>In the sky behind the stage, four kites flutter in the wind, several with flaming, incendiary trails; such kites have burned thousands of acres of Israeli farmland and set vehicles alight.</p> \n<p>Colorful balloons also float overhead;&nbsp;Israel says they have found them on the other side of the fence, tied to small, homemade bombs.</p> \n<p>It is 5:45 p.m. now, and the air is growing cooler. The dancers are soon replaced by a poet, then a play featuring two actors dressed as Israeli guards who shove a Palestinian prisoner to the ground. At one point, the prisoner tells the guard: “Resistance is not terrorism.”</p> \n<p>The crowd applauds.</p> \n<p>By 6 p.m., at the border, all hell is breaking loose.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of hard-core protesters are swarming the 12-foot-high fence. The wall of smoke has allowed some, armed with wire cutters, to clip through the rolls of barbed wire. One man is hanging from the top of the fence, shaking it back and forth with the weight of his body. Another is hanging from the other side, and yet another is trying to melt the fence with a flaming tire.</p> \n<p>The noise here is constant, like a waterfall. Men are blowing whistles. Others are screaming at the top of their lungs.</p> \n<p>“Allahu akbar!” — God is great!</p> \n<p>Most are throwing rocks over the fence, thrusting their fists in the air, taking selfies, making the V sign for Victory. There are women too, wearing black and waving Palestinian flags. There is a man with a speaker on his back, playing Palestinian music to encourage them. Some boys pick up smoking tear gas canisters and smack them back over the fence with tennis rackets.</p> \n<p>Every time a gunshot rings out, the crowds duck, like a school of fish darting in unison. Sometimes a man falls, and within seconds he is surrounded by medics in orange uniforms, who bandage him on the spot and rush him on a stretcher to the ambulances waiting in the rear.</p> \n<p>Further back stands a vast sea of spectators. One, an older man named Khalil Ayesh, is sitting inside a light blue Subaru with his family, as if he has come to a drive-in movie. He was in the same spot last week, watching intently as an Israeli drone crisscrossed the sky like a black spider, dropping tear gas on the crowds from above.</p> \n<p>“I bring them every week,” Ayesh said of the three children in the back seat — his son and daughter, and his daughter’s neighbor, “so they can understand what this struggle is about.”</p> \n<p>After the sun sets, the crowds dissipate rapidly as two black drones circle overhead. At 6:52 p.m., a huge blast a kilometer (half a mile) from the frontier sends shards of concrete and debris hurling into the air. Eight minutes later, it happens again. Later, in a statement, the Israeli army will say that aircraft and a tank struck two Hamas watchtowers after one of their soldiers was wounded by a pipe bomb.</p> \n<p>It is time to go.</p> \n<p>At the medical tent, it is now pitch dark, and the last casualty arrives at 7:24 p.m. It is a man, bleeding from the head, who has been hit by a tear gas canister.</p> \n<p>Siam says his team treated 25 people on this Friday, mostly for gunshot wounds. Half were shot in the leg, the others in the chest, stomach, back, pelvis. One doctor had to take leave when his nephew arrived, shot in the head.</p> \n<p>Almost every Friday protest in Gaza is followed by at least one funeral on Saturday. This week, there are three.</p> \n<p>One, for an 11-year-old boy named Shady Abdel-al, is remarkable because it is quiet. Funeral processions here typically are accompanied by young men doing something they usually avoid at the border: firing Kalashnikov rifles into the sky.</p> \n<p>Though the Health Ministry initially reported Abdel-al was shot by Israeli fire, the Israeli army claimed he was accidentally struck by a rock thrown by protesters. Two Gaza rights groups say he died after being hit “with a solid object.”</p> \n<p>During his funeral, Gaza’s political complexity is laid bare. His body has been wrapped in a yellow flag with a grenade and automatic rifle on it; it belongs to Fatah, the party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and a bitter rival to Hamas.</p> \n<p>Abdel-al’s mother, Isma, says she told the boy not to go, but he boarded a bus to the border organized by Hamas, whose supporters were teaching him the Quran.</p> \n<p>As the boy’s body is carried through the neighborhood, it is surrounded by a sea of yellow flags. But when it reaches the mosque, there is another huge group of teenagers waiting with the green flag of Hamas. Hassan Walli, a Fatah official, is with the family as the distraught father stands over his son, kissing him on the forehead.</p> \n<p>“We will never break the siege this way,” Walli says, shaking his head. “The only way we can do it is with Palestinian unity.”</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It is Sunday in Gaza, and Atalla Fayoumi is sitting on the small bed in his small room, showing off pictures of himself at Friday’s protest.</p> \n<p>He is proud that he went. Proud that he stood up for the Palestinian cause. But when asked if having a job would have changed anything, his answer is clear: “I would never have gone.”</p> \n<p>After his injury, Fayoumi received a payment of US$200 from Hamas. It was spent long ago, he says, on medical bills.</p> \n<p>Now he has nothing. No work. No hope. And little else to lose.</p> \n<p>Next Friday, he says, he will return to the protests again.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The entire world was awaiting the results of the U.S. midterm elections, but interest was especially high in one Palestinian village in the West Bank. The small agricultural community of Beit Ur al-Fauqa, west of Ramallah, was eager to find out whether Rashida Tlaib had won her bid to represent Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p> \n<p>Tlaib, a&nbsp;Democrat, ran virtually unopposed in Michigan’s 13th congressional district, which encompasses southwest Detroit and its suburbs west to the city of Dearborn. She previously served in Michigan’s state legislature</p> \n<p>With her win, Tlaib, 44, will become the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in the U.S. Congress. Alongside incoming Minnesota Representative&nbsp;Ilhan Omar, she will also be one of the first Muslim women to join the congressional ranks.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;The era of total Trump control is over&nbsp;■&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu just lost the U.S. midterms&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Thank you, America's women. You may yet save the world – from Trump&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>“I’m going to speak truth to power,” Tlaib told the Detroit Free Press on election night on Tuesday. “I obviously have a set agenda that’s not going to be a priority for the current president but that doesn’t mean I’m not going to push back.”</p> \n<p>Tlaib’s district is home to one of the largest Arab-American populations in the United States. Her win highlights a wave of&nbsp;Palestinian diaspora&nbsp;candidates and activists who have embraced the Democratic Party’s progressive wing at a low point in U.S.-Palestinian relations under Republican President&nbsp;Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>Tlaib’s parents immigrated to the United States, and Tlaib keeps in touch with her relatives there. Her husband, Fayez Tlaib, is also from Beit Ur al-Fauqa, says Bassam Tlaib, a maternal uncle.</p> \n<p>Rashida Tlaib’s father, from the East Jerusalem village of Beit Hanina, moved to the United States in the late 1960s. He returned in the mid-1970s and married Bassam Tlaib’s sister Faiza. The couple returned to America and had a family.</p> \n<p>Because Rashida Tlaib married a relative of her mother’s, her married name is the same as her mother’s maiden name.</p> \n<p>Faiza Tlaib frequently visits her family in the West Bank, most recently four months ago.&nbsp; Rashida herself last visited the village in 2006, but her relatives hope she will visit again soon in her new role as a Congressional representative.</p> \n<p>“We followed the elections and the results with bated breath, but we were relatively certain she’d win,” Bassam Tlaib said. “All the polls said she’d win, and that there was no one who could compete with her.</p> \n<p>“We’re very proud of her and her achievement, and I hope she’ll serve her community while also bringing the Palestinian story more prominently into the U.S. House of Representatives,” he added.</p> \n<p>A festive atmosphere prevailed in the village. The new congresswoman’s aunts and uncles, and especially her grandmother, rejoiced in her achievement, and every visitor to her grandmother’s house was given sweets as a symbol of her delight.</p> \n<p>“We very much hope that Rashida will be a groundbreaker and exert a positive influence on the decision-making there, and that she’ll be supportive and explain about the Palestinian issue, about this nation that dreams of freedom and self-determination, to American and global public opinion,” Bassam Tlaib said..</p> \n<p>“The success of [Tlaib and Campa-Najjar’s] progressive messaging on a wide range of issues, including Palestine, is reflective of a shifting public discourse that Palestine activists have played a role in shaping,” said Omar Baddar, deputy director of the Washington-based Arab American Institute.</p> \n<p>Cautious optimism</p> \n<p>Under Trump, Washington has alienated Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the American embassy there, and by slashing U.S. funding of the UN body that aids Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Palestinians have broken off contact with his administration, which has promised to announce a peace plan soon for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> \n<p>In the West Bank city of Ramallah and throughout the territory, Palestinians took a cautious view of the election news.</p> \n<p>“Change is incremental, and Palestinians in Palestine are intimately aware of that,” said Salem Barahmeh, executive director of the Ramallah-based Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy.</p> \n<p>“That said, Tlaib’s election is seen as a glimmer of hope in a very dark chapter in the Palestinian people’s history,” Barahmeh added.</p> \n<p>Bassam Tlaib, the candidate’s uncle, said she had “stood against Trump” at a time when “even our Arab leaders are unwilling to face [him].”</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the middle of the Israeli desert wastes, surrounded by sand, stone and the odd lizard, somebody engraved the images of ships and animals on the walls of a lost Roman-era cistern. Though the site is in Be'er Sheva, in the Negev, based on the accuracy of the depictions, the artist knew how to build boats, surmise the archaeologists investigating the site.</p> \n<p>The cistern dates to the 1st or 2nd century C.E., based on the techniques involved in carving the cistern and staircase out of the bedrock, and the plastering, all of which are typical of the Roman era, says Dr. Davida Eisenberg-Degen, rock-art expert at the Israel Antiquities Authority.</p> \n<p>The cistern was probably created to store water for the Roman-period domiciles found 800 meters away, she suggests. And though not known to today’s city-dwellers, it wasn’t exactly long-lost. Built about 2,000 years ago, the evidence indicates that it had continued to function through World War I.</p> \n<p>Then memory of it was truly lost, until its rediscovery during archaeological surveys of ground earmarked for a new neighborhood in northern Be'er Sheva.</p> \n<p>It hardly ever rains in Be'er Sheva, though when it does, it pours. The city averages only 200 millimeters of rain a year. It is therefore befitting for the arid conditions that the cistern, built to store water, would be big: 12 meters deep and 5 by 5.5 meters in length and width. One would want to save every drop possible.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At first the Israel Antiquities Authority archaeologists didn’t think much of the site – it looked like a depression, they say. But after clearing away debris, they found an ancient carved, plastered staircase, which led down into the depths of the water-storage system. And that is where the archaeologists saw the graffiti.</p> \n<p>Ancient rock art comes in two basic types, Eisenberg-Degen explained to Haaretz. Images can be carved into natural rock, which is called petroglyphs; or engraved into plaster coating rocks or walls, which is graffiti.</p> \n<p>The art inside the Roman cistern in Be'er Sheva is graffiti. It shows 13 ships, one sailor, and several animals meticulously carved into the plaster covering the cistern walls, say the IAA excavators, Eisenberg-Degen and Avishay Levi-Hevroni.</p> \n<p>Memories of the briny</p> \n<p>Tel Be'er Sheva is some kilometers east of the modern city. Mentioned 33 times in the bible, settlement there goes back at least to the early Iron Age. While dating is arguable, it seems the city grew and was fortified in the later Iron Age, during the 10th or 9th century&nbsp;B.C.E., though it seems the city may have fallen in about 701 B.C.E to the marauding King Sennacherib of Assyria. In any case, somebody burned it to the ground around then.</p> \n<p>Fast-forward to the Roman period, when it seems Be'er Sheva had grown bigger than had been realized until now. Whoever they were - Jews or adherents of other faiths or a mixed community - seafarers they were not.</p> \n<p>Yet the ship pictures are technically appropriate and are in correct proportion, suggesting that the artist had actual knowledge of ship construction, says the archaeologist.</p> \n<p>“The details are strikingly accurate,” Eisenberg-Degen said. “For instance, the mast is drawn going to the floor of the boat, shows understanding of shipbuilding technique. Ropes are shown near the mast and further away, holding the mast in place, all technical details that show understanding. I wouldn’t have considered that the mast needs to go down to the ship’s base if I didn’t know boat construction.”</p> \n<p>Memories of animals</p> \n<p>The beasts carved into the cistern walls include a camel, somebody riding a horse, and a lot of horned animals, apparently gazelles.</p> \n<p>Note that in contrast to the popular wisdom, camels are not endemic to the Middle East. They came from Asia and reached Israel probably in the 9th century B.C.E., according to Tel Aviv University’s Erez Ben-Yosef&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lidar Sapir-Hen. The camel on the Be'er Sheva cistern wall would have been engraved there about a thousand years after the splay-hooved &quot;ships of the desert&quot; first arrived.</p> \n<p>The graffiti inside the cistern is radically different from the rock art strewn throughout the Negev, says Eisenberg-Degen. Negev rock art is mainly petroglyphs, made by hammering or pecking at the bare rock. There is also some graffiti, and some from the Roman period, she says, but the rock art in the Negev is further to the south, from Sde Boker downward. “We’re 80 kilometers from where that rock art begins,” she says.</p> \n<p>The age of the Negev petroglyphs is extremely hard to estimate, though some archaeologists surmise that at least certain ones go back to Paleolithic times. Others are tentatively dated to the Bronze Age, and yet others are much more modern, from the Islamic period and even the Bedouin phase of the last 200 years.</p> \n<p>Dating the cistern is more certain, though when it fell into dysfunction is less so. The archaeologists think it may have remained operational until World War I, since the sediment fill inside the cistern contained pottery bits, ammunition shells and weapon parts from that great struggle, the archaeologists explain.</p> \n<p>“We found a glass container which says it was made in Australia, tons of shells, probably from the Turkish side, and ammunition,” says Eisenberg-Degen.</p> \n<p>That’s how it goes in Israeli archaeology. Look for one thing, find another. Just last year archaeologists rooting about Lod, in central Israel, for remains of prehistoric man dating back 250,000 years, found another set of World War I memorabilia - a huge stash of liquor bottles, including of Dewar’s and Gordon’s gin. They had apparently been left behind by British soldiers housed in abandoned Ottoman barracks, who were alleviating the boredom between battles by getting smashed.</p>",

You made the difference in this election. You saved us.</p> \n<p>Not only the &quot;us&quot; that means America. We have already seen how a Trump regime, had it continued to control all branches of government - unchecked, unexamined, unrestrained, in many ways profoundly un-American –represented a threat to the world at large, the impulsive, incendiary Boltonism of its often ill-informed and ill-advised foreign policy constituting an array of ticking time bombs beyond the reach of sappers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Thank you, America's women, for choosing history over pre-history.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;The era of total Trump control is over&nbsp;■&nbsp;An election night of firsts: From Colorado’s gay and Jewish governor, to Native American and Muslim women heading to Congress&nbsp;■&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu just lost the U.S. midterms</p> \n<p>Thank you for taking the crucial role in beginning the reversal of momentum that, until this week, saw an American power structure which rewarded misogyny, derided diversity, questioned and eroded the most basic of minority rights, the most basic of Constitutional guarantees.</p> \n<p>Thank you for giving a fighting chance to a woman's right to her own body and her own future.</p> \n<p>As Trump's march toward the midterms advanced in ugliness and his own unique brand of toxic masculinity, it was clear that America's women would stand up to the president in record numbers.</p> \n<p>As white male Republicans on the campaign trail began throwing around the word &quot;Kavanaugh&quot; as a verb, pretending that men as a whole had become the innocent victims of out-of-control – in Trump's phrase, &quot;nasty&quot; - women, female voters showed they were undeterred.</p> \n<p>In one poll, taken during the confirmation hearings of the man who would become Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, while American men were more or less evenly divided over Trump's performance, American women disapproved of the president's conduct by a two to one margin, 63 percent disapproving while only 30 percent in approval.</p> \n<p>Thank you, women of America, for saying no, in huge numbers, to appeals to racism, Islamophobia, and hatred of women as a whole, LGBTQ people as a whole, Jews, immigrants, Hispanics as a whole, African-Americans as a whole, all journalists who do not work for Fox News and Breitbart, and Democrats of every stripe.</p> \n<p>This was not only an election which saw women running in record numbers. Thanks in no small part to you, the women of America, this was a vote which saw a stereotype-shattering series of historic firsts.</p> \n<p>Tuesday saw the election of the first Muslim women ever elected to Congress. Democratic-Socialist&nbsp;Rashida Tlaib of Michigan will also be the first Palestinian American woman in Congress. Former refugee Ilhan Omar of Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor will be the first Somali-American in Congress.</p> \n<p>Democrat Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland will become the first Native American congresswomen. Davids will be the first lesbian congresswoman elected in Kansas.</p> \n<p>The midterms also saw the youngest woman ever elected to Congress - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, Democratic-Socialist of New York. Also 29, but a bit older than Ocasio-Cortez, is Democrat Abby Finkenauer, the first woman elected to Congress from the state of Iowa.</p> \n<p>Democrat Ayanna Presley will become the first African-American from the state of Massachusetts. Democrat Janet Mills will become Maine's first woman governor, and Republican Marsha Blackburn will become the first female senator from Tennessee.</p> \n<p>In Colorado, Democrat Jared Polis will become the first openly gay man elected governor. In Nevada, Democrat Jacky Rosen, who held off a Republican challenger backed to the hilt by GOP and Trump mega-donors Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, became the first Jewish woman elected to the U.S. Senate outside of California.</p> \n<p>&quot;My heart has been restored,&quot; said former Obama White House adviser and civil rights and environmental activist Van Jones.</p> \n<p>&quot;It is the end of one-party rule in the United States, thank God, and the beginning of a new Democratic Party – younger, browner, cooler, more women, more veterans, [a party which] can win in Michigan, can win in Pennsylvania, can win Ohio.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;It may not be a blue wave,&quot; said Jones, now a CNN commentator, but &quot;it's a rainbow wave. There's something happening out there, and I'm happy about it.&quot;</p> \n<p>Thank you, women of America, for standing up to Trump policies which were designed to be as obviously and proudly abhorrent as possible, in particular separating thousands of migrants from their children for the stated purpose of its &quot;deterrent effect.&quot;</p> \n<p>Thank you for saying no to the vicious slander and incitement of Trump and his disciples.</p> \n<p>Thank you for setting a new and different example for the rest of us in the world, many of whom live in countries sorely tempted by the false promises of Trumpism, many of whom live in countries with no constitution, or a democracy in name only, or a democracy in mortal peril.</p> \n<p>Even those extraordinary candidates who fell short in this election, moved the needle, shoved a dark and retrograde momentum in a fresh direction.</p> \n<p>They included Democrats Christine Hallquist of Vermont, who sought to become the first transgender governor of an American state, and Stacey Abrams of Georgia, who narrowly lost her bid to become America's first black governor and her state's first non-white, non-male chief executive.</p> \n<p>Thank you, Stacey Abrams, for so clearly pointing the way forward for the rest of us.</p> \n<p>Abrams, who may now be headed for a runoff election facing Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, whose campaign was severely tainted with charges of voter suppression and last-minute official manipulations, was defiant as she addressed supporters election night, vowing to keep fighting.</p> \n<p>&quot;Georgia still has a decision to make. A decision between division and trickery, or a leadership that defends your rights, your kids, your career, your community, and your right to vote in America.</p> \n<p>&quot;That's what's on the ballot.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>A day before the opening of a Jewish-Arab cultural festival that opened Thursday in Haifa, a government ministry informed the municipality that it was withdrawing state funding for the event.</p> \n<p>The Ministry for the Development of the Periphery, the Negev and the Galilee argued that the Haifa Story Festival is open to the public at large and not only to people from marginalized communities, or the periphery, Haaretz has learned.</p> \n<p>Publicity materials promoting the event stated that it was directed at “residents of the peripheral neighborhoods of the city.”</p> \n<p>The term periphery in Israel is frequently applied to geographically outlying parts of the country but also sometimes refers to disadvantaged populations in the country’s urban centers. The ministry withdrew the funding although it had funded the festival in 2016 and in 2017 and despite the fact that plans for this year’s event were similar to previous years and directed toward the same audience.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; In Israel, it's 'loyalty,' or culture | Haaretz Editorial</p> \n<p>The ministry announced its decision on Wednesday, a day before the festival’s opening on Thursday. A source told Haaretz that the actual reason that the ministry pulled its funding commitment was over political disagreements, adding that funding was withdrawn even though the ministry’s sponsorship already appeared on promotional materials for the event.</p> \n<p>“What’s sad in this case is that extremists in Israeli society have managed to influence the thinking and decisions of government ministries in a way that is not on point,” the source said.</p> \n<p>The main theme of this year’s festival, which ran through Monday of this week, was “Haifa identity activism.” The programs included tours exploring the LGBTQ community in Haifa and the labor movement in the northern coastal city, as well as an event entitled “Who’s afraid of Palestinian identity?”</p> \n<p>During its first five years, the festival was entirely independent, but for the past three years, it has been sponsored by the Haifa Municipality and Haifa’s Beit Hagefen Arab-Jewish cultural center. Last year and the year before, as noted, it was also supported by the ministry.</p> \n<p>“After the Haifa Municipality got approval for the publicity and the festival from the ministry, we brought it to fruition,” Asaf Ron, the director of Beit Hagefen, told Haaretz. “The municipality will submit [its] report according to the rules, and we hope and believe that the funds will be transferred.”</p> \n<p>When asked by Haaretz what would happen if the ministry’s funding does not come through, Ron said he expects that the Haifa Municipality would take legal action.</p> \n<p>For its part, the Haifa Municipality issued a statement saying: “At the two festivals prior to this year as well as this year, the participants are from the Wadi Nisnas neighborhood and adjacent neighborhoods that are considered the social periphery. The Haifa Municipality is not able to stand and check the identity cards of those coming to the festival and bar admission to those who are not from those neighborhoods.”</p> \n<p>The municipality called it “inconceivable” that the municipality would announce a day before the event that it was withdrawing funding from a program that the municipality said was the same as the prior two years. The municipality said it would take steps to collect the 70,000 shekels ($19,400) in funding from the ministry if it is not paid.</p> \n<p>The Ministry for the Development of the Periphery, the Negev and the Galilee stated: “[The ministry] is constantly working to strengthen the culture in the social and geographic periphery, and in light of that, from time to time it invites requests for funding from local governments. The Haifa Municipality submitted a request to hold a Haifa Story Festival event for the residents of peripheral neighborhoods of the city. It should be made clear that the municipality knew that approval of advertising does not constitute confirmation that the other criteria in the request for proposals were met. In examining [the program] close to the time for the event, it transpired that the municipality’s request does not meet the conditions of the request for proposals and the event will therefore not be funded by the ministry.”</p> \n<p>This isn’t the first time that the government has sought to prevent funding for an event at Beit Hagefen, and has also sought to head off programming. In July, Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev approached Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit and Haifa Mayor Yona Yahav seeking to prevent a protest event against the controversial nation-state law from being held at Beit Hagefen.</p> \n<p>Regev said at the time that she opposed public cultural institutions receiving ministry funding from hosting political events and that such institutions that “grant a platform to incitement and harm to our [national] symbols, values and our very existence” should be denied funding.</p> \n<p>Mayor Yahav refused Regev’s request and the event went ahead as planned. Deputy Attorney General Dina Zilber responded by saying that municipal governments are not authorized to interfere with the content of public activities and must give equal access to any event that seeks to rent space from them.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Edward Snowden said on Tuesday that software from the Israeli firm NSO Group Technologies was used to help track the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed last month at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Snowden, a former U.S. intelligence contract worker, gained international prominence after leaking American intelligence files in 2013 to the media. He spoke on Tuesday at a conference in Tel Aviv via a live video link.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Revealed:&nbsp;Israel's cyber-spy industry helps world dictators hunt dissidents and gays</p> \n<p>The assertion that Israeli spyware has been used against Saudi dissidents was first reported by the Canadian research institute Citizen Lab in October. According to the report, NSO's Pegasus spyware had been installed on the phone of Omar Abdulaziz, another exiled Saudi dissident and a friend of Khashoggi's. Abdulaziz said that he used his cell phone to discuss Saudi politics and plan joint projects with Khashoggi in the months before the latter was killed. Abdulaziz claims that his phone was being monitored at the time.</p> \n<p>&quot;Some of you may have heard about the Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi,&quot; Snowden said. &quot;He went into the [Saudi] consulate and he was immediately strangled… how did this get planned, how did this come together…?”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Saudis, he continued, “knew he was going to come to the consulate because he had made an appointment… but how did they know what his plans and intentions were, how did they decide that he was someone they needed to ask against, who was worth the risk?&quot;</p> \n<p>Snowden then suggested that the Saudis were able to gain information on Khashoggi by spiying on &quot;his friend, who was also in exile in Canada.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;The reality is that they bugged one of his few friends and contacts using software created by an Israeli company. We don’t know the chain of consequence because this company will never comment on this, but it’s one of the major stories not being written about,&quot; Snowden added.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Israel-lovers bail out Saudi crown prince as Netanyahu's next stop on Gulf tour emerges</p> \n<p>As reported by the Hebrew website of the Globes business daily, NSO responded to the allegations as follows:&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Not only does the company work subject to military export laws. It is also the only company of its kind in the world that has an independent ethics committee that includes outside experts with a background in law and international relations, with the goal of preventing its products from being misused, and therefore, contrary to what has been reported in the press, the company does not sell them and does not make their use possible in a large number of countries. On a daily basis, NSO assists in saving lives of thousands of people from the hands of terrorists, drug barons, child-abductors, pedophiles and others.&quot;</p> \n<p>Pegasus makes it possible to carry out nearly limitless surveillance of individuals, including taking control of cell phones. Its capabilities include collecting information about the phone's location, wiretapping into it, recording conversations taking place near the phone and photographing those in the vicinity of the phone.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;The dark side of Israeli technology: Six takes on the sale of cyberattack firm NSO</p> \n<p>The spyware also allows those carrying out the surveillance to read and write text messages and emails on the phone, to download apps on it and use applications already on the phone. In addition, the software can access photos, video clips, calendar reminders and contact lists. Access is usually gained through an infected link that is sent via a text message to the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Snowden described NSO as a company that is &quot;developing digital burglary tools&quot; and called it &quot;the worst of the worst in selling these burglary tools that are being actively currently used to violate human rights.&quot;</p> \n<p>Snowden went on to criticize the Israeli high-tech industry, which he said fails to take responsibility for how Israeli-made surveillance systems are used around the world. The former American intelligence contractor also suggested that the companies are over-reliant on the explanation that they sell the software to governments and law enforcement agencies that should be able to be trusted. Too often the Israeli firms don't know what use their products are being put to, he said.</p> \n<p>&quot;This is not a cybersecurity industry. This is a cyber-insecurity industry,&quot; Snowden declared.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lawsuits were recently filed in Israel and Cyprus against NSO and another Israeli-led company called Circles by a number of Mexican citizens, including journalists and political activists, as well as a Qatari citizen. The plaintiffs claim they were targeted by the companies’ surveillance tools.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Setting aside their political differences for a few short hours, Israeli lawmakers came out in unusually large numbers on Wednesday to express their support for the non-Orthodox Jewish movements.</p> \n<p>The rare show of unity came a little more than a week after a Pittsburgh synagogue that housed both Conservative and Reconstructionist congregations was targeted in the deadliest attack ever carried out against Jews in the United States.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;American Jews may never forgive Israel for its reaction to the Pittsburgh massacre</p> \n<p>The Knesset members stopped short, however, of issuing a formal declaration calling on the government to recognize the non-Orthodox movements. Neither did they move to initiate legislation that would change the religious status quo in the country, as one opposition lawmaker in attendance proposed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lawmakers from parties as far right as Yisrael Beiteinu, which draws most of its support from Israel’s Russian-speaking community, and as far left as the Communist party (Hadash), which is now part of the Joint Arab list, participated in the emergency parliamentary session titled “It’s Time for Equality.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nearly 20 Knesset members, an impressive number for such an event, addressed the forum, among them leaders of two opposition parties: Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid) and Tamar Zandberg (Meretz). Two members of the ruling Likud were also in attendance. No representatives, however, of the Orthodox, settler-aligned Habayit Hayehudi or the ultra-Orthodox parties showed up.</p> \n<p>Lapid was one of several speakers to point out the irony that Israel is the one country in the Western world where Jews do not enjoy total freedom of religion. “So long as women can’t pray at the Western Wall as they see fit and so long as there is no change in the conversion law, we are doing an injustice to ourselves – not to the Conservative or Reform movements – but to us as a society,” he said. “In the name of my party, I promise that we will not rest until all the streams of Judaism are recognized for divorce, for marriage, and mainly for life.”</p> \n<p>Israel does not recognize marriages performed by Reform and Conservative rabbis, and individuals converted by Reform or Conservative rabbis cannot marry in the country. Institutions run by the Reform and Conservative movements in Israel receive only a tiny fraction of the funding allotted to those under Orthodox control.</p> \n<p>Amir Ohana, a member of Likud and the first openly gay lawmaker to represent the party, said that based on his experiences while living for a short period in the United States, “American Jews have had their share of disappointments with us.”</p> \n<p>“But we need to join forces now,” he added, “so that finally we will be worthy of the title of the state of the Jews – the state of all Jews.”</p> \n<p>The session was attended by dozens of Reform and Conservative rabbis, as well as lay leaders and members of youth movements affiliated with non-Orthodox Judaism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nachman Shai, chairman of the Knesset Caucus for Strengthening the Jewish People, said that the session was convened not only because a “terrible massacre” had been carried out in Pittburgh, but because of the “fundamental issues” it raised about Israel’s relations with the Diaspora, in particular its treatment of the non-Orthodox movements, which account for the majority of Jews in the United States.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Shai was one of six Knesset members signed on the invitation to the event. Michael Oren (Kulanu), a deputy minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, also signed the invitation but did not end up attending.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rabbi Gilad Kariv, executive director of the Reform movement in Israel, said that he and his cohorts did not intend to suffice with “venting” about the systematic discrimination their movements suffer in Israel. “In the coming months, we intend to draft legislation, launch campaigns in Israel and abroad and hold parlor meeting around the country,” he said, “and we hope that members of the Knesset join us in our demand for full equality and recognition.”</p> \n<p>Yizhar Hess, executive director of the Conservative movement in Israel, said he could not recall a gathering of this kind that had brought together so many members of both the coalition and the opposition in the Knesset. “This should be a wake-up call,” he said. “And we are tired, very tired of being treated like second-class citizens. We’re not a meaningless minority any more, and we will show the members of the Knesset that it makes political sense for them to wave our flag.”</p> \n<p>The leaders of the non-Orthodox movements were reassured by lawmakers who attended of their full backing. “The fact that Israel doesn’t recognize half the Jewish people prevents it from being what it is meant to be – the nation-state of the Jewish people and a safe haven for Jews around the world,” said Merav Michaeli (Zionist Union). “It’ll happen though. It’ll simply happen. Earlier than you think, rest assured.”</p> \n<p>“The awful thing that happened in Pittsburgh, it broke our hearts, but it didn’t break our spirit,” she added. “And all the fear and anger, we will now channel in our struggle for full equality for all Jews.”</p> \n<p>A proposal by Stav Shaffir (Zionist Union) that the attending lawmakers sign a draft bill that would grant official recognition to the Reform and Conservative movements was rejected, however. It was clear that members of Likud and their political partners did not have the liberty to sign such a bill because of coalition agreements with the ultra-Orthodox parties.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rachel Azaria (Kulanu) said she was confident the non-Orthodox movements would one day be recognized in Israel, but patience was required. “Israel will recognize the streams,” she said. “It has to. That’s the good news. The bad news is that it will take time. But ultimately, revolutions don’t happen here in the Knesset. They happen first among the people.”</p> \n<p>Zandberg lamented the fact that the Israeli government was alienating large swaths of American Jewry because of its alliances with regimes that “flirt” with anti-Semitism or have “anti-Semitism deeply embedded in them.”</p> \n<p>“This is unacceptable for us here in Israel and for Jews around the world,” she said. “And for what? Is moving another embassy to Jerusalem – which none of us doubts for one second is the capital of Israel – worth the price of legitimizing anti-Semitism?”</p>",

Likud ministers Yariv Levin and Tzachi Hanegbi also expressed support for Leon.</p> \n<p>The move by Habayit Hayehudi is a blow for the secular candidate, Ofer Berkovich, who had tried to win the party’s endorsement because he needs heavy support from the city’s religious-Zionist residents to win.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; No matter who is elected mayor, secular Jerusalem has already lost | Analysis ■ Jerusalem elections show once again: Netanyahu doesn't know what it means to be a friend | Analysis</p> \n<p>Habayit Hayehudi’s statement said, “Moshe Leon responded to all the demands on Habayit Hayehudi’s agenda, which are aimed at assuring the Zionist character of Israel’s capital.” It was also agreed that the chairman of Habayit Hayehudi’s Jerusalem faction would be a deputy mayor and get the education portfolio.</p> \n<p>Barkat’s statement said, “I believe that the choice of Moshe Leon in the second round is a choice for the benefit of Jerusalem, which is why I decided to support him. Moshe Leon has the ability to lead the city for the benefit of all its residents. From my familiarity with both candidates and my work with both of them, I have no doubt that Leon is the best choice for Jerusalem.”</p> \n<p>Barkat added, “After many conversations with Moshe, in which he presented his path and his plans to lead the city, I was convinced that he intends to lead Jerusalem through inclusion and dialogue with all sectors and that everyone will be equal to him, so there will be a continuation of the way I led Jerusalem over the past decade.”</p> \n<p>Five years ago Leon was a bitter rival of Barkat’s in the mayoral race and the latter attacked him harshly, accusing him of corruption and saying his candidacy was the result of a shady deal.

At this point, however, even a weak endorsement could tip the scales in Leon’s favor.</p> \n<p>During last week’s voting, Leon got more than 79,000 votes – 33 percent.

Langer was a strange type in the local topography: a Jewish Holocaust survivor with a Polish accent who adhered to European manners and believed in the ideology of communism.</p> \n<p>“Her engagement with Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip was perhaps the strangest thing in the Middle East,” wrote attorney Michael Sfard. Her acquaintances saw in her a pathfinder in legal battles that advanced the human rights of Palestinians. Her enemies saw in her a traitor and accessory of terrorists.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Holocaust survivor and Palestinians' rights lawyer Felicia Langer dies in exile at 87</p> \n<p>She was born in the city of Tarnov, Poland in 1930 as Felicia Amalia White. In World War II she fled with her family to the Soviet Union, where her father died. After the war, she returned to the land of her birth and married Holocaust survivor Moshe Langer. In 1950 they immigrated to Israel – “not because of Zionist ideology,” according to her, but to live near her mother.</p> \n<p>Archival documents attest to the tense relationships between her and the Israeli establishment. In 1968 an intelligence officer in the military government in Hebron testified before the Legal Attach&eacute; of the West Bank that she “held extreme left-wing opinions.” In 1975, the Foreign Ministry reported that the Shin Bet security service viewed her legal activities as being guided by political motivations to harm “the state and the image of the state.” She faced threats to her life throughout her career. Occasionally, she felt compelled to hire a bodyguard.</p> \n<p>Langer fought the expulsion of Palestinian leaders, housing demolitions of terror suspects, administrative detentions (imprisonment without charges), and torture. “She never hesitated to accuse the establishment of crimes and to represent her clients as victims of an evil regime,” wrote Sfard.</p> \n<p>When they called her “the defense attorney of terrorists,” she replied that her clients were not terrorists, but “resistance fighters.” “A people under occupation has the right to wage violent struggle,” she said. Among her famous clients was the mayor of Nablus, Bassam Shakaa, one of the leaders of resistance to the occupation, whose expulsion Langer succeeded in preventing. Other clients included the parents of the attackers of Bus 300, who sought to sue the state for killing their sons, and a young Dutch woman who was detained at Ben-Gurion International Airport after she gathered intelligence for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Langer maintained that she was just a “small cog.”</p> \n<p>In 1990, she immigrated to Germany, after handling what she estimated to have been 3,000 cases. “I could no longer help the Palestinian victims in the framework of the existing legal system and its flouting of international law, which is supposed to protect the people that I defended,” she said in an interview with Eran Torbiner. “It is forbidden to be silent; silence also can kill,” she said, in explaining her call for the boycott of Israeli goods. As a German citizen, she called on Germany to fight the occupation.</p> \n<p>Langer lived in T&uuml;bingen, teaching and writing books. Critics were angered by her comparison of Israel to the Nazis, and accused her of hypocrisy for ignoring the crimes of communist regimes. When she was asked once to describe her “love of homeland,” she answered: “Hatred of occupation.” In June, Langer died of cancer at age 87.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Decapitating the enemy and presenting their heads is an unpleasant habit, according to modern mores. But it is effective, if the aim is to terrify. In both the ancient and classical worlds it was common practice. Now a paper published Wednesday in the Journal of Archaeological Science reveals that the Gauls took things a step further: they were not only lopping off their enemies' heads but embalming them too, using a resin redolent of pine.</p> \n<p>The thing is, if you whack off the enemy's head and stick it on a pole at the city gates, in no time it becomes covered in flies, and decays. A bare skull with gristle just doesn't convey the same message. Maybe the Gauls just wanted to make sure the shock and awe would last longer.</p> \n<p>It is not clear whether the severed heads were put into a resin bath, if resin was poured on them, and/or if they underwent treatment more than once to keep the remains in decent condition, say the scientists.</p> \n<p>Archaeologists digging in Le Cailar, a lush spot by rivers in southern France, found numerous examples of this practice. Researchers from the Mediterranean Societies Archaeology lab and Biodiversity and Ecology Lab (both affiliated with CNRS) analyzed human and animal remains and detected, in some, treatment with heated conifer resin.</p> \n<p>&quot;This is the first time that chemical analysis has proven that the Gauls engaged in the practice of embalming certain heads during the Iron Age,&quot; the scientists wrote.</p> \n<p>Habits die hard</p> \n<p>The Celts didn't invent this wheel. Taking trophies from defeated warriors goes back into the dimmest reaches of human history, in every continent peopled by humans. While collecting severed penises or ears was one subset of this practice, heads are perhaps more convincing, because – obviously – the observer can identify who it was. It bears adding that severing ears isn't fatal, while beheading is.</p> \n<p>For Mesopotamians such decapitations were apparently de rigeur. Around 4,500 years ago the Sumerians engraved exquisite image of vultures enjoying enemy heads on the &quot;Stele of the Vultures&quot;, which was found a century ago in Iraq. The stele had been six feet tall when made to celebrate victory by the Sumerian city of Lagash over a rival city, Umma.</p> \n<p>The bible too is rife with examples, not least by the future King David, who is said to have relieved the Philistine giant Goliath of his head:</p> \n<p>&quot;David ran and stood over the Philistine; he grasped his sword, drew it out of its sheath, and killed him; then he cut off his head&quot; 1 Samuel 17:51</p> \n<p>But the peoples of the Middle East and Levant were not known to have mummified the severed heads for posterity to enjoy. That may have been the invention of the Celts.</p> \n<p>Fearful in Rome</p> \n<p>Moving onto the Celtic variation on the theme, the 3rd century B.C.E. was a violent time in western Europe. Archaeologists describe finding Iron Age sanctuaries and sacred places, not only Celtic and Gaulish ones, suddenly sporting weapons, bones from animal sacrifices. And human remains, the paper explains.</p> \n<p>A number of classical sources describe the Celtic practice of lopping off the heads of their enemies and callously dangling them over their steeds' necks to take home. Two such tales of them were Strabo and by Diodorus of Sicily, who lived in the 1st century B.C.E., though both were quoting the same source, a Greek named Poseidonios who had visited Gaul in around 100 B.C.E.</p> \n<p>Earlier historians Polybius and Livy also wrote about the habit, and there is archaeological testimony – including art of the time, and one specific statue found in southern France that depicts a warrior on horseback, a sword and a spear at his side, and a severed head hanging from the horse's neck.</p> \n<p>The Roman apprehension peaked as peeved Gauls stormed in and captured Rome itself in approximately 387 B.C.E., a traumatic turn of events described in laborious detail by the classic writers.</p> \n<p>The Roman historian Livy exquisitely details the fear of the Gauls (&quot;a strange and unknown race&quot; prone to &quot;violent temper&quot;) who had multiplied and waxed powerful and sought new territories to settle. Apparently Italy was appealing, if not exactly inviting, even then. As they approached Rome:</p> \n<p>&quot;…not only Fortune but tactics also were on the side of the barbarians. In the other army there was nothing to remind one of Romans either amongst the generals or the private soldiers. They were terrified, and all they thought about was flight, and so utterly had they lost their heads that a far greater number fled to Veii, a hostile city... than by the direct road to Rome, to their wives and children.&quot; Livy 5:38</p> \n<p>Oh well. But that doesn't mean that ancient Romans actually respected the foe. En route to Rome, the Gauls vanquished a citadel and were &quot;almost dumb with astonishment at so sudden and extraordinary a victory. At first they did not dare to move from the spot, as though puzzled by what had happened, then they began to fear a surprise, at last they began to despoil the dead&quot; Livy 5.39.</p> \n<p>A divine voice &quot;more powerful than any human voice&quot; had even warned the Romans of the Gauls' approach, but they heeded not, Livy reported, and managed to estrange Furius Camillus, a commander and the one man who could have saved them from the invasion, according to Livy.</p> \n<p>Though, note you, the Romans did not cavil at mutilating the dead either.</p> \n<p>&quot;Fabius rode forward at a Gaulish chieftain, who was impetuously charging right at the Etruscan standards, ran his spear through his side and slew him. Whilst he was in the act of despoiling the body the Gauls recognized him…&quot; ibid.</p> \n<p>The heyday of Gaul</p> \n<p>Gaul at its height was a vast territory controlled by a number of Celtic tribes. In its heyday during the Iron Age, from about 2,700 years ago Gaul encompassed much of central western Europe. France famously lay under their sway, as immortalized in the Asterix comic books, but so did all of Luxembourg and Belgium, as well as most of Switzerland, and bits of Germany, northern Italy, and the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>The Gauls gradually lost control of their lands to the Romans, and were finally crushed by Julius Caesar in the mid-1st century B.C.E. But they survived as a distinct people until around the 5th century C.E., when they finally became subsumed in local cultures.</p> \n<p>Don't think that was the end of beheading. While it isn't common to both decapitate and preserve the heads of the dead any more, it is done, and there is reason why ISIS resorted to the technique to sow terror. It worked.</p>",

But critics of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;believe&nbsp;the Democrats’ capture of the House of Representatives is the start of a process by which Israel will be made to pay dearly for its government’s decision to tie itself so closely to President Donald Trump and the Republicans.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The Biggest Loser of the U.S. Midterms? Benjamin Netanyahu</p> \n<p>Yet though the outcome will alter the political landscape in Washington, the notion that Netanyahu’s tilt to the GOP will come back to bite him anytime soon doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. Even under new management, politicians who are resolutely pro-Israel, and by no means unfriendly to the government in Jerusalem, will still lead the House. Nor will the Democrats be in any position to impede Trump’s Middle East policies that please Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Even more to the point, the assumption that the midterms are the beginning of the end for Trump, and the first step toward the election of a president who will be more hostile to Israel, aren’t necessarily bolstered by the results of the midterms.</p> \n<p>The idea that the Democrats are eager to use their new power to punish Netanyahu for his love affair with the American right rests on assumptions about the party that have been fostered by Jewish conservatives who have sought to paint the Democrats as hostile to Israel.</p> \n<p>What’s true is that the two American political parties have more or less exchanged identities on Israel in the last half-century. In the mid-20thcentury, the Democrats were predominantly a pro-Israel party while the Republicans were split on the Jewish state. That changed in the last 30 years, as Republicans became the lockstep pro-Israel party, and Democrats are now divided about support for it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Liberals wrongly accuse Jewish right-wingers and Netanyahu of disrupting what was once a bipartisan consensus about Israel by embracing conservative Christians. But this shift occurred with relatively little assistance from the Jews; evangelicals and their allies gained ascendance among Republicans, while the intersectional left, that is unfriendly to Israel, became a factor to be reckoned with among Democrats.</p> \n<p>The change among Democrats seemed to have accelerated this year with the victories of a crop of new left-wing candidates who are clearly uncomfortable with or hostile to Israel like the socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib (the first Palestinian-American elected to Congress) and Ilhan Omar (the first Somali-American elected to Congress).</p> \n<p>But as much as their presence in the House will provide a platform for radical critics of the U.S.-Israel alliance, and might be a harbinger of a shift to the left, the notion that Democrats are about to become the moral equivalent of the Jeremy Corbyn-led British Labour Party is a fantasy.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; One Day, Palestinians Will Thank Trump for His Years of Hostility</p> \n<p>While the left has gained strength, the leadership of the Democrats, especially in Congress, remains solidly pro-Israel, including presumptive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Whip Steny Hoyer. Those expecting the House to impede policies such as a cutoff of aid to the Palestinian Authority also forget that the ranking member and likely new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee is Elliot Engel of the Bronx, New York who is more or less a Likudnik on Middle East issues.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some in the new House majority will make noise about Netanyahu or sign letters Israel won’t like (such as those signed this past year by a minority of Democratic representatives and senators supporting the lifting of the blockade of Gaza). But they lack the power to hinder Trump’s ability to conduct foreign policy.</p> \n<p>Just as important as who won in the midterms is who lost. For all of the attention given to the victories of left-wingers, those critics of Israel running outside of deep blue urban districts tended to lose - such as Leslie Cockburn in Virginia and Scott Wallace in Pennsylvania. The icing on the pro-Israel cake is that among the Republicans’ House losses was Dana Rohrabacher, the California representative who was among the handful remaining in the GOP who are not ardent friends of Israel.</p> \n<p>An even more sobering thought for those fantasizing about the demise of Trump and Netanyahu’s comeuppance is that nothing in the midterm results makes it more likely that the president will fail to be re-elected.</p> \n<p>The victories of GOP candidates who were Trump clones over attractive liberal Democrats in the Florida and Georgia gubernatorial races, as well as other victories in red states that produced Republican gains in the Senate, should make it clear that the president’s path to re-election by an Electoral College majority may be steep - but by no means an impossible climb.</p> \n<p>The new Democratic House will harass Trump with investigations, and liberals are still counting on the probe into collusion with Russia being led by Robert Mueller to somehow make the bad dream of 2016 go away. That might happen, but Democrats shouldn’t count on it. If Democrats do their base’s bidding and concentrate on trying to impeach Trump, such overreach will - depending on the viability of the Democratic nominee - make a repeat of Trump’s 2016 victory possible.</p> \n<p>As their reaction to the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting showed, the Netanyahu government sees no reason to step back from a close relationship with Trump and the Republicans.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Netanyahu learned after 2012, when his preference for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama was obvious, or during the debate over the Iran nuclear deal, if he allows himself to be used as a pawn in American partisan battles, Democrats will resent it. But the costs of those gambles turned out to be minimal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>No matter what happens in the next two years, or who wins in 2020, there is no reason to believe that the U.S.-Israel alliance is in any real danger.</p> \n<p>Jonathan S.

        "text":["<p>Let’s face it, Trump got it right with Turkey.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A few weeks ago, Ankara relented and finally&nbsp;released U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson who had been detained for almost two years on flimsy charges. Following on, both countries&nbsp;lifted mutually imposed sanctions and resumed&nbsp;coordinating security cooperation in the Syrian city of Manbij. The handling of Turkey represents a significant victory for the Trump administration in its bilateral relations with a wayward ally.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Izmir-based Pastor Brunson, who had lived in Turkey for over 20 years, was arrested on trumped up charges of colluding with terrorists including the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the Gulen Movement, followers of Fetullah Gulen, a U.S. resident accused by Ankara of orchestrating the July 2016 attempted coup.</p> \n<p>In what some pundits correctly termed &quot;hostage diplomacy,&quot; Turkey, increasingly under the centralised and authoritarian control of its firebrand President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, demanded that the U.S. extradite Fetullah Gulen to Turkey.</p> \n<p>Frustrated by the American judicial system, which seeks solid evidence and due process for extradition requests, Turkish President Erdogan&nbsp;remarked that the U.S. and Turkey should exchange pastor for preacher. The offer did not sit well in Washington.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Already relations between Washington and Ankara were deteriorating over the issue of U.S. support for the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) militias fighting ISIS in Syria. Ankara claims that the group is affiliated to the outlawed PKK, which the Turkish state has been battling on-and-off for decades.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Turkey’s cosying up to Russia, symbolised by Ankara’s determination to purchase Russian S400 surface-to-air missiles, which are not only incompatible with NATO hardware but may even risk a western hardware security breach, has also not boded well for bilateral relations. Congress even passed legislation stipulating that Turkey’s inclusion in the F35 Joint Strike Fighter program be&nbsp;suspended until the Pentagon issues a report on the matter.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By the time President Erdogan visited the U.S. in May 2017, not only was he only given just&nbsp;22 minutes with the U.S. president, but he left a trail of ill feeling after his bodyguards beat the living daylights out of peaceful protesters right in the middle of Washington D.C.</p> \n<p>To make matters worse, in January 2018, an executive of a Turkish state-owned bank was&nbsp;found guilty of violating the Iran Sanctions Act. A New York court heard how oil for gold was exchanged between Turkey and the Islamic Republic. Reza Zarrab, the architect of the operation who had turned state witness,&nbsp;testified that this was sanctioned by the highest levels of the Turkish government including Mr Erdogan.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By summer 2018, the Trump Administration had had enough, and in an unprecedented move slapped&nbsp;Magnitsky Act sanctions on Turkey which targeted the Justice and Interior ministers specifically. To ratchet up the pressure, the&nbsp;U.S. doubled steel and aluminium tariffs.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Despite hot words and bluster by Turkish politicians, as well as meaningless reciprocal sanctions of its own, by the end of October, Turkey finally backed down and the Turkish courts ordered the release of Pastor Brunson. Within days mutual sanctions were lifted and U.S. and Turkish leaders were on the phone discussing security arrangements for Manbij, Syria.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Indeed, ties appear to be back on track. The U.S. named Turkey as one of the eight countries&nbsp;temporarily permitted to continue petroleum purchases from Iran, despite the additional sanctions being snapped back into action. And on 6 November, Washington announced&nbsp;U.S.$4-5 million rewards for any information on several leading PKK operatives. Assumedly, in return Washington expects Turkey to turn a (relatively) blind eye to U.S. and YPG security cooperation to the east of the Euphrates in Syria.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, and now Turkey’s Erdogan, perhaps it is the case that unlike his interactions with democratic allies in the West, when it comes to confrontations with belligerent authoritarian strongmen, President Trump knows how to deal with them. Indeed, were it not the constitutional checks and balances of the U.S. system, Trump’s inclinations might not be too far removed from such leaders. Put another way, it takes one to know one.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, one shouldn’t expect too much from the current trajectory of U.S.-Turkish relations in the short to middle term. Although ties are certainly now in a healthier condition, there are still significant issues outstanding between them.</p> \n<p>Not least of these is the actual implementation of the Manbij&nbsp;understanding where the U.S. agreed that YPG militias should vacate the city. Turkey’s shelling of YPG positions&nbsp;east of the Euphrates (the U.S conceded that there should not be YPG held areas to the West but not East) is bound to anger Washington which still sees YPG as critical to the final defeat of ISIS.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Turkey has shown no signs from backing away from the S400 deal with Russia, and some U.S. consular employees remain in jail. There’s a long way ahead before relations get back to normal, but Trump, for the timing being, has able to ensure that there was at least a start.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Dr Simon&nbsp;A.

        "text":["<p>More than a decade before the Nazis seized power in Germany, Albert Einstein was on the run and already fearful for his country's future, according to a newly revealed handwritten letter.</p> \n<p>His longtime friend and fellow Jew, German Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, had just been assassinated by right-wing extremists and police had warned the noted physicist that his life could be in danger too.</p> \n<p>So Einstein fled Berlin and went into hiding in northern Germany. During this hiatus he penned a handwritten letter to his beloved younger sister, Maja, warning of the dangers of growing nationalism and anti-Semitism years before the Nazis ultimately rose to power, forcing Einstein to flee his native Germany for good.</p> \n<p>&quot;Out here, nobody knows where I am, and I'm believed to be missing,&quot; he wrote in August 1922. &quot;Here are brewing economically and politically dark times, so I'm happy to be able to get away from everything.&quot;</p> \n<p>The previously unknown letter, brought forward by an anonymous collector, is set to go on auction next week in Jerusalem with an opening asking price of $12,000.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>As the most influential scientist of the 20th century, Einstein's life and writings have been thoroughly researched. The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which Einstein was a founder, houses the world's largest collection of Einstein material. Together with the California Institute of Technology it runs the Einstein Papers Project. Individual auctions of his personal letters have brought in substantial sums in recent years.</p> \n<p>The 1922 letter shows he was concerned about Germany's future a full year before the Nazis even attempted their first coup — the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch to seize power in Bavaria.</p> \n<p>&quot;This letter reveals to us the thoughts that were running through Einstein's mind and heart at a very preliminary stage of Nazi terror,&quot; said Meron Eren, co-owner of the Kedem Auction House in Jerusalem, which obtained the letter and offered The Associated Press a glimpse before the public sale. &quot;The relationship between Albert and Maja was very special and close, which adds another dimension to Einstein the man and greater authenticity to his writings.&quot;</p> \n<p>The letter, which bears no return address, is presumed to have been written while he was staying in the port city of Kiel before embarking on a lengthy speaking tour across Asia.</p> \n<p>&quot;I'm doing pretty well, despite all the anti-Semites among the German colleagues. I'm very reclusive here, without noise and without unpleasant feelings, and am earning my money mainly independent of the state, so that I'm really a free man,&quot; he wrote. &quot;You see, I am about to become some kind of itinerant preacher. That is, firstly, pleasant and, secondly, necessary.&quot;</p> \n<p>Addressing his sister's concerns, Einstein writes: &quot;Don't worry about me, I myself don't worry either, even if it's not quite kosher, people are very upset. In Italy, it seems to be at least as bad.&quot;</p> \n<p>Later in 1922, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.</p> \n<p>Ze'ev Rosenkrantz, the assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech, said the letter wasn't the first time Einstein warned about German anti-Semitism, but it captured his state of mind at this important junction after Rathenau's killing and the &quot;internal exile&quot; he imposed on himself shortly after it.</p> \n<p>&quot;Einstein's initial reaction was one of panic and a desire to leave Germany for good. Within a week, he had changed his mind,&quot; he said. &quot;The letter reveals a mindset rather typical of Einstein in which he claims to be impervious to external pressures. One reason may be to assuage his sister's concerns. Another is that he didn't like to admit that he was stressed about external factors.&quot;</p> \n<p>When the Nazis came to power and began enacting legislation against Jews, they also aimed to purge Jewish scientists. The Nazis dismissed Einstein's groundbreaking work, including his Law of Relativity, as &quot;Jewish Physics.&quot;</p> \n<p>Einstein renounced his German citizenship in 1933 after Hitler became chancellor. The physicist settled in the United States, where he would remain until his death in 1955.</p> \n<p>Einstein declined an invitation to serve as the first president of the newly established state of Israel but left behind his literary estate and personal papers to the Hebrew University.</p>",

        "text":["<p>To the secretary of the Tel Aviv municipality,</p> \n<p>In wake of the city’s announcement about welcoming Balfour, I propose to serve Balfour a torte decorated with the shape of a bible, the Cyrus Declaration and the letter containing the Balfour Declaration. A gold thread winding from the book to the letter, to symbolize the connection between the two announcements, and a path filled with stumbling blocks and brambles – This is the Jewish people’s path of exile. I request that the honored secretary inform me, with the utmost haste, about how the torte is to be served and the location of the meal… as I must prepare this torte so it will be fresh and good.</p> \n<p>Yours, </p> \n<p>Mr. Gedansky</p> \n<p>23 Adar 5685 (19 March 1925)</p> \n<p>October 2018, the David Laor Patisserie in Mevasseret Zion. The display at the front of the bakery and coffee shop offers tarts made with late summer fruits, apple strudel dusted with powdered sugar, braided chocolate and chestnut yeast cakes, and a tower of brioche pastries with Buche de Chevre goat cheese. In the kitchen in the back, a small group is gathered around one of the work surfaces: pastry chefs and co-owners Michal Ludriks and David Laor; pastry chef Roni Haimovich-Gal, the great-granddaughter of the founder of Tel Aviv’s legendary Gedansky Bakery; and Dr. Nirit Shalev-Khalifa, curator and manager of Visual Documentation and Exhibition at the Ben-Zvi Institute.</p> \n<p>The group has come together to attempt to recreate the great cake that the baker Avraham Eliezer Gedansky proposed to make in honor of Lord Arthur James Balfour’s visit to Palestine in 1925. “We have no written or photographic record from anyone who saw or ate the cake,” says Shalev-Khalifa. “And we believe that the proposal was not accepted and the cake was never baked. But Gedansky’s letter, preserved in the Tel Aviv municipal archives, attests to the tremendous excitement that gripped the public and to the type of imagery that was associated with the declaration and the man who authored it.</p> \n<p>“The Balfour Declaration, signifying the British government’s recognition of a Jewish right to sovereignty in Palestine, was presented on Friday morning, November 2, 1917, and from that moment on, symbols marking its importance continued to arise in the Jewish world. The portrait of Lord Balfour himself was one of these symbols. It was copied onto souvenir calendars, postcards, rugs and other decorative items. He was put on a par with the great Zionist figures, including Herzl. Many likened the day of the declaration to King Cyrus’ edict, and the Return to Zion [from the Babylonian exile]. November 2 became a kind of national holiday, with ceremonies and big gatherings and celebrations.”</p> \n<p>With all due respect to historical explanations, Laor is mainly concerned with the taste of the torte (a classic sponge cake), and that it be faithful to Gedansky’s culinary-artistic vision. “But what flavor did Gedansky give the torte?” he keeps asking. “When Nirit first told me about the old letter, I was sure it would also include directions about the flavors and the ingredients, but Gedansky mostly talks about the symbols and the way to decorate the cake. I found his excitement and the flowery rhetoric he used quite touching.”</p> \n<p>“My mother, who was 10 years old when her grandfather died, also remembers his unusual Hebrew,” says Haimovich-Gal, great-granddaughter of the baker who hoped to welcome Lord Balfour with a sculpted cake. “She describes him as a plump and jolly man who liked to get into deep discussions and wrote and self-published books on Jewish philosophy. On the wall in my parents’ home is the clock that hung on the wall of the bakery in Tel Aviv, but aside from a few black-and-white pictures, there are no family recipes or other mementos left. My choice of profession as a pastry chef also had nothing to do with the family history, though someone might argue that it’s in the blood.”</p> \n<p>Haimovich-Gal, who worked as a pastry chef in Meir Adoni’s restaurants and now teaches at Estella – Master Class in Pastry, Chocolate &amp; Bakery, a cooking school in Tel Aviv, attended the gathering as a curious observer. She knows very little about the history of her great-grandfather Gedansky, who came to Tel Aviv from Poland in 1923 and opened a bakery on Herzl Street. Descended from an eminent Hassidic family, he had decided to learn a trade before immigrating to the land of his forefathers. He later opened a branch of the bakery on Yavneh Street, which became a popular meeting place for poets, writers and members of the Lehi pre-state militia. It became one of Tel Aviv’s first hotels later on. The family eventually moved to Ramat Gan, and left the baking business behind.</p> \n<p>David Laor carefully blows gold powder into a warm lump of sugar that he then pulls into threads to create the gold ribbon that connects the Edict of Cyrus with the Balfour Declaration, as Gedansky envisioned. “I thought the cake that we’re making inspired by his verbal outline should first of all be very festive, in keeping with the magnitude of the event,” says Laor, who learned his craft in Paris. “Nowadays they’d probably print the whole design on a sugar paste, but I thought it would be fitting to recreate the cake the way the old school Austro-Hungarian professionals would have done, when you had to prepare and shape each part of the cake manually.” Ludriks and Laor made a cream-covered cherry and rum torte for the base of the cake, for a gallery talk held earlier this month at the Ben-Zvi Institute on the 101st anniversary of the Balfour Declaration. Upon it stood a white Bible made of a classic torte coated with butter cream, and upon that, the Balfour Declaration and Cyrus’ Edict, made of marzipan with chocolate lettering. The arduous path traversed by the Jewish people was created from streusel (a crumbly topping of flour, sugar and butter), representing boulders, and “brambles” made of caramel.</p> \n<p>Bread balls</p> \n<p>60-70 grams bread per person. Soak the bread in cold water, squeeze well. Pass through a meat grinder, add a little fried onion, parsley, salt, a little flour, 4-5 egg whites. Mix everything together. Shape into balls, when they rise to the top [of a pot of boiling water] remove and serve with onion juice (cooking time: 10-15 minutes).</p> \n<p>Onion juice:</p> \n<p>Place the sliced onion in boiling hot oil; when nicely browned sprinkle on a little salt and let it fry. Pour in a little cold water, salt, pepper, a bay leaf, a little diced tomato. Let the juice cook for about a quarter of an hour.</p> \n<p>- From a Kevutzat Hashomer Hatza’ir recipe book, 1930</p> \n<p>In 1925, eight years after the Balfour Declaration was issued, Lord Balfour was invited to deliver the keynote speech at the dedication of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. “The hero of the Zionist movement arrived here at the end of March,” says Shalev-Khalifa, “and everywhere he went – Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Deganya, Balfouria – he was given a royal welcome. They built gates out of palm fronds festooned with flags and held festive parades. Balfour was apparently quite a gastronome too, because wherever he visited, official meals had to be prepared. Most people who lived here in those years ate a very meager diet and everybody worried: How can we cook a meal befitting the palate of the British lord? They went to great lengths to prepare all kinds of elaborate delicacies for him, made with rare ingredients. The historic research into the meals that were served to Balfour can teach us a lot about daily life here in that era.”</p> \n<p>In Balfouria, a moshav, or cooperative farm, founded in 1922 and named for Balfour, the guest of honor dined on a half-grapefruit with a cherry on top, chicken liver for a first course, chicken soup with mandelach (soup nuts), chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans, and a compote of dried fruit. In Deganya, as one of the locals reported in the Davar newspaper, the members ate lentils on Monday, beans on Tuesday, rice on Wednesday and eggplant on Thursday. Eggs and meat were reserved for Shabbat and holidays, and to help heal the bodies and minds of ailing kibbutz members.</p> \n<p>When the request to host Lord Balfour arrived, the kibbutz members decided that their humble daily menu and the tin dishes on which it was served were not suitable for a nobleman, and hired a cook from one of the hotels in nearby Tiberias. Wearing a fancy tailcoat, the cook brought along a lavish meal that was served on silver and ceramic dishes, causing Lord Balfour to mistake him for the most important man in the settlement.</p> \n<p>Researchers from the Ben-Zvi Institute have yet to discover the menu for the meal that was served to Balfour at Deganya. But in the process of gathering the historical material (and it’s gratifying that academic research institutes are finally using food as a window to the past), a hidden treasure was discovered in the archives of Kibbutz Afikim. This is an anonymous handwritten journal, with recipes for the dishes members of Hatzer Hakinneret, a Hashomer Hatza’ir kibbutz, were eating in 1930-31. For guests at the gallery talk, Sassi Levy of Jerusalem’s Meuchas restaurant prepared bread balls in onion juice, prototype of the infamous bread-meat patties (80 percent bread, 20 percent meat, in the best of times) for which kibbutz dining halls were known.</p> \n<p>The gallery talk was held in conjunction with the launching of a catalog for a modest exhibition of documents and other historic artifacts connected to the Balfour Declaration, including an exact copy of the original declaration from the British Library and souvenirs emblazoned with the portrait of the British lord. The exhibition will be on view at the Ben Zvi Institute until Independence Day.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It was expected that Donald Trump’s political rivals would blame him for the Pittsburgh massacre, hard as it is to square this argument with plain common sense. No president has been more supportive of Israel than Trump. He has Jewish family members. Moreover, the murderer wasn’t one of his supporters.</p> \n<p>And despite all this, we’re asked to believe that a neo-Nazi, who hates Trump precisely because of his ties to Jews, somehow acted in something like Trump’s spirit. Why? Because Trump created a “climate of hatred” toward migrants, and because Jews, according to the killer, support immigration. This is more than a slight stretch, and it gives the impression that those who advance this narrative are less concerned about the welfare of Jews than they are for bashing Trump.</p> \n<p>The facts produced in support of this flimsy narrative were quickly shown to be just as flimsy. Jonathan Greenblatt, a former adviser to President Barack Obama and now the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, provided the golden piece of evidence that everyone rushed to quote: a 57 percent rise in the number of anti-Semitic “incidents” in 2017; that is, in Trump’s first year in office.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;American Jews may never forgive Israel for its reaction to the Pittsburgh massacre&nbsp;■&nbsp;Donald Trump, President of the United States of Hate?&nbsp;■&nbsp;Midterms were good for the U.S., the world, Trump (maybe) Netanyahu (possibly) and Jews (at least American)</p> \n<p>But this number, it turns out, conceals more than it reveals. In an article on the Jewish website Tablet, David Bernstein showed why. The increase was in the number of people who felt they were victimized, not in the number of attacks.</p> \n<p>The number of violent attacks actually dropped in 2017, even drastically; moreover, the places with a particularly sharp increase in the number of reported incidents were university campuses. Trump’s influence there is negligent, of course, in comparison to the impact of the academic left, which is growing increasingly hostile toward Israel. It’s no longer a secret that being a Jewish student at a contemporary American university isn’t easy, under the tyranny of political correctness.</p> \n<p>This is why it’s hard to shake off the unpleasant feeling that Robert Bowers has become something of a fig leaf. Here, in a flash of false clarity, the Nazis have returned to center stage, and the old sort of anti-Semitism could be used to hide the new sort.</p> \n<p>One need not forgive Trump for failing to clearly condemn neo-Nazis in the aftermath of Charlottesville, or underestimate the dangers lurking on the far right (mainly in Europe), to recognize what any sober observer of the contemporary climate would tell you: The risk of anti-Semitism posed by American neo-Nazis, as murderous and vile as it is, pales in comparison to the darkening clouds of Islamic anti-Semitism. The latter is backed by states, armies, nuclear-weapons programs, worldwide terror organizations and a vast network of anti-Semitic incitement in mosques all across the West.</p> \n<p>A substantial part of the left has opened its doors to this type of anti-Semitism, under the deceptive aegis of multiculturalism, tolerance and a concern for human rights. It has made Israel-hatred legitimate. If there is a “climate of hatred” it’s a result of this acceptance, and it's this that is making Jews flee Europe. This isn’t a climate created by Trump, but one he vehemently opposes.</p> \n<p>In this climate anti-Semitism on Britain’s left has moved from the margins to the Labour Party’s leaders. In this climate, Hezbollah and Hamas front organizations operate without interference in Europe (in the name of multiculturalism, of course). In this climate American Jewish organizations refuse to publish figures on anti-Semitic incitement in mosques, fearing that defenders of political correctness will call them Islamophobes.</p> \n<p>In this climate nongovernmental organizations such as Breaking the Silence can peddle groundless blood libels about settlers who have “poisoned all the water sources in a Palestinian village&quot; (the NRG website, June 2016). In this climate there’s a need for armed guards around synagogues in Western Europe. In this climate Berkeley offered a course where the final assignment was to suggest ways for “decolonizing” Palestine, a euphemism for the ethnic cleansing of Jews. In this climate New York City’s mayor offers financial support to an organization headed by an anti-Semite, Linda Sarsour.</p> \n<p>To portray Trump, who is determined to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, as if he were implicitly inciting people to anti-Semitism, and to portray Sarsour, who openly declares she wants to “dehumanize” the Jews of Israel and who advances sharia law, as a human rights activist is downright absurd.</p> \n<p>People who collaborate with all this, actively or even tacitly, don’t sound convincing when they suddenly blame a philo-Semitic president for creating an anti-Semitic climate. People who stoke hatred of Israel at international forums with a mixture of facts, deceptions and outright lies, people who demonize the Jewish state for a living, people who portray IDF soldiers as bloodthirsty storm troopers, or even as neo-Nazis, can’t now use the massacre in Pittsburgh to conceal their own contribution to legitimizing anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>I assume that inwardly, these agents of demonization and their supporters distinguish between good Jews (themselves in Israel, Hillary Clinton voters in the United States) and bad Jews (most Israelis, Trump voters in the United States). In fact, an entire chorus of columnists in this paper seems to base its journalistic endeavors on this distinction.</p> \n<p>But anti-Semitism doesn’t know such distinctions between Jews here and Jews there, between good Jews and bad Jews, between blood libels coming from the right and blood libels coming from the left. It would therefore be wise to remember Jeffrey Goldberg’s words: “When neo-Nazis email me links to Haaretz op-eds declaring Israel to be evil, I’m going to take a break, sorry.”</p> \n<p>I don’t doubt that those on the Israeli left who drifted incrementally from a concern for human rights to a systematic demonization of the Jewish state were truly shocked by Bowers’ action. This is clearly not what they ever bargained for. They were hoping that demonization would lead to international pressure on Israel, and that such pressure would in turn lead to the end of the occupation (based on an imaginary assumption that if we only willed it, we’d have a partner for peace on the Palestinian side). But this plan didn’t yield the expected result and Trump, more than anyone, symbolizes its failure.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, however, this strategy had other results: stoking anti-Semitism in all its forms and a particularly shameful surrender to its Islamic variants. Anyone who demonizes Israel day in and day out cannot at the same time blame others for creating “a climate of hate.” This is no longer a case of camels not seeing their humps. It’s a case of elephants refusing to see their trunks.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The increase in the number of cases of measles in Israel began in March, but until three months ago it seemed that the figures were just a bit higher than usual. Now the local health establishment&nbsp;believes the country is experiencing a serious outbreak of one of the world’s most infectious diseases – one that led to the death of an 18-month-old child last week.</p> \n<p>The local situation is related to a concurrent, sharp rise in the incidence of measles in Europe, but here the disease can take hold in “pockets” of unvaccinated people in certain towns and neighborhoods.</p> \n<p>What is measles?</p> \n<p>Measles is caused by a virus from the morbillivirus family, and it affects only humans and not animals, unlike many other infectious diseases. Although an effective vaccine against it has existed since the 1960s, measles is still common and it is one of the most contagious diseases of all, with a 90-percent risk of infection among unvaccinated people. The virus is highly infectious because it can survive a long time in the open air: When someone with the disease coughs, sneezes or talks, infected droplets are sprayed into the air, which are then inhaled by other people. After infection, the virus attacks the immune system; it usually incubates for a period of between eight to 12 days before symptoms occur.</p> \n<p>What are the symptoms?</p> \n<p>Signs and symptoms include high fever, runny nose, coughing, red eyes and sensitivity to light. Four or five days after the appearance of these symptoms (which are common to many conditions), a dark red rash appears on the skin. It generally starts on the neck and spreads to the face, the body and the extremities.</p> \n<p>The rash begins as individual spots, but these often converge into a rash that covers large areas of the body. On the third day after it appears, the rash starts to fade and begins to look like the small, dense flowers of the squill plant – hatzav in Hebrew, which is why the disease’s Hebrew name is hatzevet. At this point the patient will generally begin to feel better, although the progress of the disease varies in certain cases.</p> \n<p>What are the complications and risks?</p> \n<p>Aside from being extremely contagious, measles is dangerous because there is no remedy for it. The illness can damage the respiratory and nervous systems. One-third of sufferers will develop middle-ear infections, diarrhea or cornea inflammation. A rare complication, which can emerge up to 10 years after infection, is a degenerative brain condition that causes severe and irreversible damage to the central nervous system, including mental deterioration and seizures. One in 1,000 cases of measles is fatal.</p> \n<p>Why is there an outbreak now?</p> \n<p>Measles is passed on only among human beings and since there is an effective vaccine to prevent it, the outbreak is solely man-made. If the immunization rate in a population drops, however, the collective immunity provided to unvaccinated individuals by all the vaccinated people – known as &quot;herd immunity&quot; – is undermined. Larger parts of the population are then exposed to the disease and the risk of a flare-up increases.</p> \n<p>The source of the current outbreak in Israel is attributed to outbreaks last year in various European countries that have also seen a drop in inoculation rates – countries that Israelis often visit, like Italy, England, Ukraine and Romania. Since then the number of European cases has skyrocketed to 40,000, and more than 40 people have died.</p> \n<p>But the situation didn’t arise here because some unvaccinated person was infected abroad and brought the disease back home. The overall measles-inoculation rate in Israel surpasses 95 percent – but there are a few densely populated communities and neighborhoods with much lower vaccination rates. According to the Health Ministry, in some Jerusalem neighborhoods, for instance, the vaccination rate is only 55 percent. As a result, there has been an uptick in the number of cases of measles in the country as a whole: from 40 cases in all of 2017 to 1,334 cases so far this year.</p> \n<p>Is this the first time Israel is facing such a surge in cases of measles?</p> \n<p>In the 1950s, before there was a vaccine, there were thousands of cases reported annually. Since 1967, when the inoculation became part of the Health Ministry’s protocol, there has been a consistent drop in the number of cases to a few dozen a year. Still, there have been other outbreaks. In 2003, for example, 60 Israeli youngsters contracted measles within two weeks, and one of them died. The last large flare-up was in 2008, when within a few months there were 1,452 cases reported among unvaccinated people, most of them in the Jerusalem area.</p> \n<p>How effective is the measles vaccine?</p> \n<p>Like other vaccines, the measles shot has two purposes – to protect the person from being infected, and to prevent the spread of the disease and protect populations at risk who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. The two doses of the vaccine that are part of the protocol offer 97 percent protection from the disease. The shot is administered at the age of one year and again at age 6, as part of a quadruple vaccine that covers rubella (German measles), mumps and chicken pox.</p> \n<p>What does the Health Ministry do when a measles case is discovered?</p> \n<p>In recent months the health establishment has monitored every case of infection, whether the patient was discovered on a flight, in a hospital, at school or elsewhere. Once the symptoms appear and a case of the disease is suspected, a sample of the patient’s blood is sent to a laboratory to determine if measles is indeed present; at the same time, medical teams try to locate all those who have come in contact with the person and determine if he was vaccinated and what the condition is of his immune system. In many cases, Health Ministry or hospital doctors will summon those exposed for preventive treatment, i.e., to be inoculated.</p> \n<p>The race to identify each case has become more intense as the disease spreads. Doctors in Jerusalem, where so many instances of measles have been recorded, are finding it difficult to keep pace with the identification and treatment of patients. The Health Ministry is focusing its efforts on raising the immunization rate in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods by extending the reception hours at Tipat Halav well-baby clinics. A vehicle belonging to the Natali healthcare service has been also been making the rounds to allow easier access to vaccinations.</p> \n<p>What other steps are being taken?</p> \n<p>The Health Ministry has banned unvaccinated people from hospital departments that are considered particularly sensitive, such as neonatal units, intensive care, oncology, hemato-oncology, etc. In addition, the ministry is considering banning unvaccinated children from schools, and is checking whether the inoculation now given to children at one year can be routinely administered at 9 months.</p> \n<p>If someone unvaccinated is exposed to measles, can anything be done to lessen its intensity?</p> \n<p>Yes, but one must act immediately. Preventive care of first resort involves administering of the live-virus vaccine within 72 hours of exposure, but someone who cannot get the active vaccine can get a passive one that will produce antibodies against the disease within six days.</p> \n<p>When should one be vaccinated or update his vaccinations?</p> \n<p>The Health Ministry is calling on adults who have never had the measles and never got two shots of the vaccine to get vaccinated. The vaccine must be given in two doses of at least four weeks apart. This recommendation does not apply to those born before 1956.</p> \n<p>The ministry is also advising parents who received their first shot not to wait for the second dose until they reach school age, but to have the child inoculated immediately, as long as four weeks have passed since the first dose. The ministry is also advising that people traveling abroad who have doubts about their immunity get inoculated before they leave Israel, even though it takes two weeks for the vaccine to take full effect. If they are traveling with a baby between 6 and 11 months of age, the child should receive the first shot before leaving.</p> \n<p>People born in Israel between 1957 and 1977 are considered to be unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated, since during those years only one vaccination was administered and not everyone received it. Such people are advised to get inoculated now.</p> \n<p>Who should not be vaccinated?</p> \n<p>The Health Ministry says the following people should not be vaccinated: Pregnant women; a person with a high fever; a person who has had an allergic reaction to a previous vaccine; someone who has a sensitivity to one of the components of the vaccine; and people whose immune systems are seriously compromised.</p>",

As part of our tracking, we monitor markets where cyberattackers try to market their dubious goods, and that's how we found the data pool on American voters ahead of Election Day.

        "text":["<p>On Monday, during the closed-door part of the Likud legislative caucus, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the following: “Nations respect morality up to a known limit and they respect power much more. We reject the understanding of the occupation. If the occupation were the issue, there are a number of states that have occupied other states and no one says a word about them. Big, well-known states. No one said a word about Turkey and Northern Cyprus.” Of course these remarks drowned immediately in the shallows between the latest boorishness of Likud MK Oren Hazan and the sexism of Yesh Atid MK Elazar Stern.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Just 30 years into his political career, Netanyahu finally told the truth (whispered and behind closed doors, of course): The occupation isn’t the issue. Populations under occupation aren’t important. Millions of people whose rights are trampled day after day, whose lives are intolerable, are of no interest to Israel’s prime minister. He doesn’t bother with such things. Power is the only thing that matters. Jewish power. And on that score, Netanyahu is in fact satisfied. “It’s important to raise [these issues] because people have spoken of a tsunami, that the Palestinian issue must be solved,” he said at the meeting. “That shouldn’t stop us in face of the enormous diplomatic success that we are creating.”</p> \n<p>In last week’s local elections, residents of Kiryat Arba voted out Mayor Malachi Levinger, yet once again in Hebron there was no elections no election. In the south Hebron hills, human beings built settlement outposts on stolen land, while the population of Khan al-Ahmar is slated for eviction. Settlers have the right to build in order to accommodate “natural increase,” while the population of the territories is barred from planning construction, “in accordance with instructions from the political level,” as the head of the Civil Administration recently admitted. A “population” is devoid of humanity and can be trampled on or “exchanged,” the way you’d exchange a purchase in a store.</p> \n<p>Something should be said about that power to which Netanyahu aspires like some Hollywood villain. Power is more that the sum of a country’s economic and military strengths. Israel’s economy and its military strength depend on its alliances and these alliances depend, in part, on its values. The Israel of the Declaration of Independence is a state that acquired sufficient power to enter an alliance with the United States and European states. Netanyahu’s Israel crawls after any local tyrant willing to relocate an embassy.</p> \n<p>Strong states are not drawn to aid Hungary’s Viktor Orban, whose campaigns drip with anti-Semitism, or Brazil’s Jair Bosonaro, who talks about bringing back the military junta in his country. But apparently, the confluence of interests at the basis of such alliances also hides a confluence of values. Prime ministers here once flirted with an alliance of minorities; now we’ve progressed to an alliance of pariahs.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s remarks drew little attention. No one asked him to clarify and explain how they could be reconciled with the lies he spouted in the Bar-Ilan speech. Maybe because no one expects him to tell the truth.</p> \n<p>Elections in Israel rise and fall on the future of the territories, and the prime minister believes it’s legitimate to maintain ambiguity. It’s easy to understand this, considering the policy that he supports. It’s more difficult to understand why the public submissively accepts this kind of treatment.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu may have been talking about international relations, but he promotes the same immoral and power-drunk policy on the political level too. If we’re not careful, Israel will increasingly come to resemble Netanyahu: a paranoid state that talks about “loyalty” but longs for flattery, a state whose citizens are all potential enemies. We are standing on the edge of the abyss, and reflecting back at us from the bottom is Netanyahu’s face.</p>",

Macron has reason to be fearful, since his popularity at home is plummeting and his party was just overtaken in the polls by the National Rally – the recently rebranded National Front of Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate whom he had easily defeated in last year’s presidential election.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Italy’s League – the anti-immigrant and Euroskeptic party of Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini – is polling at nearly 35 percent, followed by Five Star Movement, its anti-establishment coalition partner, at just under 29 percent.</p> \n<p>Populists can look forward to similarly strong showings in other countries where they are already in power, such as Hungary and Austria. Add to that the uncertainty over the United Kingdom’s planned exit from the EU next March, since a particularly “hard Brexit” could damage the economy of both Britain and the remaining 27-country bloc, adding more fuel to the populist wave.</p> \n<p>Bannon, whose populist organization The Movement plans to offer support on polling and messaging to like-minded politicians, has said he doubts nationalists can gain a majority but hopes they can win a third of the assembly’s 705 seats.</p> \n<p>Such an outcome is “feasible,” says Jos&eacute; Ignacio Torreblanca, head of the Madrid office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank with branches across the EU.</p> \n<p>Controlling such a large group of delegates would allow populists to “change the conversation” and influence EU policy – either by forging alliances with moderate conservatives or tempting other parties to adopt their views simply to try to steal their voters, Torreblanca says.</p> \n<p>At a minimum, it would also secure national right-wing governments from the threat of sanctions by Brussels, which require a two-thirds majority, he adds.</p> \n<p>Most of the experts interviewed by Haaretz doubted that Bannon could play a key role, since several far-right leaders – including Le Pen – have been extremely lukewarm toward his efforts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“I doubt that Bannon has the ability to unite these forces, because nationalist movements have a natural tendency to avoid EU-wide alliances,” says Pirozzi. “Still, it is very significant that such an experiment is being conducted. And while it may not bear immediate fruits, it can certainly do so in the long term.”</p> \n<p>With or without Bannon, Europe’s populists will have a strong showing, she says, and moderate political forces seem unable to rise to the challenge. “The opposition to this wave of nationalism has been much weaker than you would expect,” says Pirozzi.</p> \n<p>Perhaps because mainstream parties have managed to stay in power in the heart of Europe – with Macron in France and Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany – “people don’t realize the danger,” says Frank Paul Weber, a journalist who worked as a spokesman for former German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble.</p> \n<p>This complacency can be deadly in EU elections, which have traditionally a low turnout, giving an automatic advantage to the highly motivated voters of extremist parties, warns Weber.</p> \n<p>Even though the EU’s legislative body has a hand in deciding everything from food safety issues to car emissions, “Most people don’t know what the EU Parliament does,” Weber says. “While in the United States it’s quite clear what is the difference between a Republican- or a Democrat-controlled Congress, here nobody understands what’s at stake.”</p> \n<p>For this election, the EU has launched a website that aims to gather activists who will work to get out the vote. But most experts agree that the bloc’s traditional political forces have been too slow to adopt the grassroots action and social media savviness that has helped propel the world’s populists.</p> \n<p>“Progressives in Europe should learn from the [U.S.] Democratic Party, which just regained control of the House largely thanks to grassroots mobilization and a host of young, diverse candidates,” says Jean-Pierre Darnis, a professor of international relations at the University of Nice. They should also be open to alliances with new movements and nontraditional parties that have already mastered the tools and messaging of today’s politics, he says. One example would be the resurgent Greens party, which has enjoyed strong results in local elections in Germany. A solid alliance between these forces should be able to maintain stability and block any moves by even a large contingent of far-right parties, Darnis says.</p> \n<p>But what policies would be favored by a European Parliament with a strong Euroskeptic bloc?</p> \n<p>Far-right parties would quickly try to tighten border controls – both within and without the EU – and move to deport immigrants, who are their unifying cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre, says Torreblanca.</p> \n<p>They would also move to remove sanctions on Russia and improve ties with Moscow, out of admiration for President Vladimir Putin’s strongman policies and his support for nationalist forces across Europe, Torreblanca says.</p> \n<p>Finally, there would be a strong push to halt the progress of – or even undo – the monetary union, while allowing each state more discretion on their economic policies, he says.</p> \n<p>“These right-wing groups are all different in background, but as nationalist groups they are united in wanting power to be restored to the state,” says Oded Eran, a former Israeli ambassador to the EU and now a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>On an international level, such an outcome is likely to be welcomed by Washington and Jerusalem, Eran notes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long been cozying up to Europe’s populist parties, such as Hungary’s Fidesz, Poland’s Law and Justice, and the Freedom Party of Austria, despite the anti-Semitic statements or neo-Nazi roots of some of their members.</p> \n<p>“If Brussels is weakened, this will certainly play into the hands of both Israel and Washington, who prefer to deal with individual states in conducting foreign relations, security arrangements and economic ties,” Eran explains.</p> \n<p>The reasons for Israeli and American indifference to Europe’s fate are different.</p> \n<p>For the United States, it’s the feeling that Europeans have long enjoyed unbalanced trade relations, and have not been contributing enough to their own defense and to NATO while benefiting from the U.S. military presence and the deterrence it creates, Eran says.</p> \n<p>“For Israel, Brussels is identified with pro-Palestinian policies; with imposing restrictions on cooperation with [Israeli] entities in the West Bank; and for not sufficiently standing up against various groups that Israel rightly identifies as terror organizations,” he says.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“Demand not that things should happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do happen, and you will go on well,” the first-century C.E. Greek philosopher Epictetus wrote in his book “The Manual.” That simple statement encapsulates the core of Stoicism, a philosophy that was espoused by the Greeks and Romans of antiquity. For centuries, the Stoic school, which was founded in Athens around 300 B.C.E. by the philosopher Zeno of Citium, was the most influential philosophy in the Greco-Roman world. A leading exponent was Marcus Aurelius, known as “the Philosopher,” who was emperor of Rome for two decades in the second century C.E.</p> \n<p>Stoics develop equanimity with respect to all external harm that is independent of them, and they try to abstain from all desire. They understand that only their opinions and impulses are under their control, whereas the body and the opinions of others are beyond their control. Accordingly, the Stoic carries out his moral obligations with restraint and reason, and accepts with tranquility all pain, sickness and even the death of dear ones.</p> \n<p>In recent years, the Stoic way of life has gained adherents in Europe and America. Publications on the subject are prominent in the philosophy and self-help sections of bookstores in the United States. The Stoic wave began at the end of the 1990s, with the publication of philosopher Martha Nussbaum’s book “The Therapy of Desire” and Lawrence Becker’s “A New Stoicism.” Since then, there has been a steady flow of neo-Stoic literature, but in the past few years the stream has overflowed the banks of the philosophy departments and become a full-fledged trend. The past two years alone have seen the publication of “How to Be a Stoic,” “The Daily Stoic,” “The Practicing Stoic,“ “Unshakable Freedom: Ancient Stoic Secrets Applied to Modern Life,” “Stoicism: A Stoic’s Journey” and “The Daily Stoic Philosophy: Approaching the Generation Z.” And there’s also the forthcoming “How to Think Like a Roman Emperor.”</p> \n<p>Unlike Buddhism, Stoicism does not promise liberation from suffering, but focuses on deeds. That’s why certain businessmen and CEOs recommend a Stoic way of life. The startup guru Tim Ferris has made Stoicism a hot item in Silicon Valley – right behind mindfulness and microdosing. There are online courses in Stoicism, Stoic psychotherapy and even an annual “Stoic Week,” in which participants are urged to “live like a Stoic for a week.”</p> \n<p>Actually, it’s not as simple as it sounds. Stoic practice rules out many types of behavior commonly considered humane. According to Epictetus, you must remain apathetic even if your child dies, and there is no justification for regretting the event. To attain this state, it’s necessary for you to imagine frequently that those close to you have passed away.</p> \n<p>This is a negative psychology, not a positive one. Epictetus’ recommendations for consoling the bereaved also sound tough. The Stoic should behave as though he shares the mourner’s grief but should not truly be regretful: There is no reason to be sorry about anything external. The Stoic should behave with composure, be sparing in speech, avoid laughing and also try not to speak about such subjects as sports or food.</p> \n<p>What accounts for the renewed popularity of this harsh philosophy? The explanation may well lie in the political and cultural confusion that the present era, and the feeling of uncertainty about many areas of life. In the 20th century, political ideologies such as socialism, fascism and liberalism mobilized the public and their adherents strove to change society and the world. Stoicism, in contrast, maintains that you cannot control what others do, only your own actions and desires. Only by accepting external vicissitudes serenely can one achieve happiness.</p> \n<p>In ancient Rome, Stoicism attained the height of its influence after the fall of the republic and the advent of the empire. At that point the citizens knew that they had been deprived of political freedom, and were subject to the whims of omnipotent rulers. All that remained for them was to act in a virtuous fashion and to accept their fate.</p> \n<p>Similarly, the contemporary antidemocratic trends and crises constitute a platform for the Stoic posture. American blogs promote texts such as “A Stoic’s Guide to Surviving Trump.” Last April, The New York Times ran an oped piece titled “How to Serve a Deranged Tyrant, Stoically.” The author was Ryan Holiday, a former leading media adviser and marketing director of American Apparel, who turned to writing books on Stoicism and is the editor of DailyStoic.com.</p> \n<p>Like many Americans, Holiday was appalled by Donald Trump’s election as president. But to his surprise, in early 2017 he was offered a job in the media unit of a department in the new administration in Washington. Though nothing came of the offer, for Holiday it was an opportunity to reflect on the Stoic’s attitude vis-&agrave;-vis political power. During the period of the Roman Empire, Stoics did not retire from the world, and in many cases held senior positions. “In the ancient world, as is true today, navigating political chaos was a pressing dilemma,” Holiday noted in the Times. “Philosophers were forced to decide whether to participate in, resist or simply endure the political rulers of their time.”</p> \n<p>Seneca’s dilemma</p> \n<p>The most salient example of that dilemma concerns the Roman philosopher Seneca, who lived in the 1st century C.E. and was a member of one of the most powerful patrician families in Rome. When the emperor Nero ascended to the throne, Seneca became his adviser. As a realistic Stoic, he understood that the republic was moribund and that in the present situation he could not achieve any political goal through active resistance to the emperors. For a few years, young Nero heeded the advice of the Stoic philosopher, who was thereby able to keep the ruler’s extreme caprices in check. Seneca’s behavior was compared by some observers, in September, to that of the senior official in the White House who wrote in an anonymous opinion piece in The New York Times that he and others in the administration were working to protect the state’s institutions from the impulsive president.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, Seneca provided the regime with legitimization, even when Nero began to display paranoid megalomania. When Nero murdered his mother, Seneca saw fit to assist in the cover-up of the crime. In those years he also became one of the richest people in Rome. Holiday, the former media strategist, could empathize. “I planned and carried out controversial publicity stunts, and used dishonest tactics with the public and the media [in the service of businesspeople],” he wrote.</p> \n<p>When relations between Nero and Seneca began to deteriorate after about five years, the philosopher wanted to retire but the way out of public life was barred to him. When Nero set fire to Rome in a fit of madness, Seneca made large donations to rehabilitate the city, but in the year 65 he was accused by the emperor of having been an accomplice in a plot to assassinate him. Nero commanded him to commit suicide.</p> \n<p>Seneca had no hesitation. “The wise man will live as long as he ought, not as long as he can,” he wrote in “Moral Letters to Lucilius.” “He always reflects concerning the quality, and not the quantity, of his life. As soon as there are many events in his life that give him trouble and disturb his peace of mind, he sets himself free.” After seeing to the dissemination of some of his writings, Seneca entered the bathtub and cut his veins. “You have had veins cut for the purpose of reducing your weight... tranquility can be purchased at the cost of a pin-prick,” he wrote. And acted on his advice.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The time has come to forget the stories about the Chosen People. The fairy tales about dashing young Jewish fighters in the War of Independence. The legends about the nation’s heroes. This is the time to stop thinking about Israel as an invincible power. The senior commanders of the Israel Defense Forces failed and humiliated themselves time and again, and their blunders run like a thread through Israel’s history from 1948 to the present day. In fact, it’s possibly due only to a miracle that Israel still exists.</p> \n<p>That, at any rate, is the impression one gets from perusing the vast project undertaken by Dr. Uri Milstein, one of Israel’s leading and most productive military historians. At 78, the angry prophet from Ramat Efal, in central Israel, is convinced that he deserves the Israel Prize and a military medal of valor, no less. He likens himself to Don Quixote, to Aristotle, to Einstein. Not only should academia sing the praises of his research, he believes: He should also be awarded the title of “professor-plus.” He’s certain that he’s being ignored by the establishment because of its glorification of and devotion to the legacy of Yitzhak Rabin.</p> \n<p>That last notion is not without foundation. Milstein has flayed any number of admired IDF officers, but it was his bashing of Rabin that made him anathema in the academic world and among the public as a whole. The straw that broke the camel’s back came a few months after the prime minister’s assassination in 1995, when Milstein praised his student, Yigal Amir, and claimed that he himself had played a part in various developments.</p> \n<p>Public denunciation of Milstein led him to develop more radicalized ideas and positions: From being an acclaimed historian, he was relegated to the fringes and accused of disseminating conspiracy theories. At present, though, as his 80th birthday approaches, Milstein is enjoying something of a comeback. Rabin is no longer considered to be a saint, and even his crassest critics are no longer execrated. Milstein of 2018 is slowly making his way back to the mainstream, with a growing fan base. He writes a weekly column for the newspaper Maariv, blogs on the News1 website, is a frequent guest on Kan public radio and sends a weekly newsletter to a mailing list that he says consists of 5,000 subscribers, “200 of them professors and Ph.Ds.”</p> \n<p>Milstein’s return after a protracted period of ostracism is an opportunity to reconsider his image and the circumstances that could pave his way back to the heart of the mainstream. His proponents view him as a brilliant, trailblazing researcher and treat him as a profound, serious historian of unbounded scholarly and personal integrity. At the same time, his many opponents and detractors in academic circles and beyond perceive him as a provocateur, claim he’s superficial and a charlatan, and even raise the possibility that he’s mentally deranged.</p> \n<p>Miraculous existence</p> \n<p>Half an hour with Milstein – “a philosopher who deals with the study of the military experience and war as a model for understanding human behavior and contemporary civilization,” as he describes himself – is enough to make even the last of the patriots squirm uncomfortably in his chair. Whereas most Israelis believe that the IDF is an exemplary army, Milstein immerses himself in the disgraces of each battle and campaign. The public at large is familiar with only a fraction of them. The details of most are filed away in the immense archive he maintains in his home – the fruit of a life enterprise that is as exceptional as it is controversial.</p> \n<p>“When you come to a doctor in the emergency room, he doesn’t interest himself in your health but in your diseases,” Milstein told me when we met in his home. “It’s the same with me. I have this character trait that homes in on people’s blunders, errors and mistakes.”</p> \n<p>Milstein has gained fame as a “myth buster” and “slaughterer of sacred cows.” He’s known as a historian who has focused on the failures of the legendary leaders and military commanders of the Yishuv – the pre-1948 Jewish community in Palestine – of the Haganah militia and of its successor, the IDF. A perusal of his books and articles could leave the reader thinking that it’s only by a miracle that we’re still here.</p> \n<p>One person who lapped up Milstein’s ideas was Yigal Amir, who took his course at Bar-Ilan University on the military and social aspects of Israel’s wars. Amir was also an ardent reader of Milstein’s book “The Rabin File: An Unauthorized Expos&eacute;” – as the English-language version of 1999 work is titled – which was published in Hebrew in April 1995, about seven months before Amir assassinated the prime minister.</p> \n<p>In that book, Milstein describes the dark side of “Mr. Security.” Forget Rabin’s positive image as the sabra from the pre-state Palmach strike force, who rose through the ranks to become general, chief of staff, defense minister and prime minister. The latter’s military and security-related history – as the author wrote and Amir, among others, read – “is a chain of disasters and failures,” and his personal file is replete with blunders whose results could even have prevented Israel’s establishment. Milstein’s Rabin is a coward who abandoned his troops on the field of battle, was removed from operational missions in the War of Independence and suffered a breakdown during the Six-Day War.</p> \n<p>Three months before the assassination, Amir, the student, invited Milstein, the lecturer, to give a talk at one of the programs he organized for a group that he had created, which met every Sabbath at different places around the country. In this case, the agenda included a tour of battle sites in Jerusalem. Milstein recounted his “theory,” as he calls it, according to which Rabin was responsible for the collapse of Israel’s security services “from the day he enlisted in the Palmach in 1941 until and including the time he took the positions of prime minister and defense minister,” as he writes in the Introduction to the English edition of “The Rabin File.” Rabin’s failures, the author concluded “endanger[ed] the very existence of the State of Israel.”</p> \n<p>According to reports published after the assassination, the police found a copy of “The Rabin File” in Amir’s room in his Herzliya home. A few months after the killing, Milstein praised Amir in an interview he gave the local weekly Tel Aviv. He said he was proud that Amir was “a product of my research and lectures,” and added, “I definitely believe that his operational performance was superb, and I believe that I was influential in getting people to function like him. When that influence succeeds, it’s a source of satisfaction, it consolidates my theory about flaws in the defense establishment. The Rabin assassination consolidated my theory.”</p> \n<p>He also said in the interview, “It’s amazing that a person under conditions of pressure performs ideally and optimally in order to achieve his goal. I of course oppose his goal, oppose murder, certainly the assassination of a prime minister, but I am talking about the operational aspect. In this Yigal was completely successful in the face of tremendous difficulties [such] that no one believed he would do it. I ask myself again where he drew the analytical mental strength –which I believe he got from me. I taught my students [how] to make decisions under conditions of pressure. I don’t think I have a part in his desire to assassinate.</p> \n<p>“I do have a part in the crystallization of his conception of who Rabin is. I gave them intellectual tools to analyze the security systems and how one should find the flaws in the security systems and how to function properly in the face of them, both in minor-tactics warfare, which he [Amir] did, and in regular warfare.”</p> \n<p>In the atmosphere that suffused Israel immediately after the assassination, Milstein was transformed overnight from being a controversial individual to someone who was boycotted and shunned across the entire political spectrum. Bar-Ilan University, the last academic venue in the country that had been willing to host him, ordered all its departments to stop inviting him to give lectures immediately. Subsequently, a senior source in the Israel Police was quoted as saying that the possibility had been examined of launching a criminal investigation against Milstein. A Labor MK demanded of the attorney general that he indict him, under suspicion of laying the ideological foundation for Rabin’s assassination. In reaction, Milstein did not retreat. On the contrary he embraced in full the image of the rebellious underdog who flaunts conventions, radicalizing his critique, his writing and his public statements.</p> \n<p>Leaving the battlefield</p> \n<p>It’s all but impossible to get a word in edgewise once Milstein gets started. He careens from one memory to the next, leaps between stories and treks across anecdotes. He turns out to be multifaceted: smart and very knowledgeable, funny enough to elicit tears of laughter, cynical and bitter and sometimes also conspiratorial and megalomaniacal. A glance at a select list of titles of his books and articles (in Hebrew) is enough to show why he’s never gained official recognition (for example, by winning the Israel Prize): “The Jews Flee,” “The Commanders Remained in the Rear,” “Abandoned to Death,” “The Palmach – Army of Amateurs” and “Chief of Staff in the Psychiatric Ward.”</p> \n<p>The latter title refers to Rabin during the 1967 Six-Day War. Rabin is undoubtedly one of Milstein’s greatest obsessions. His library is packed with books he’s written about the late premier, all of them hostile, vicious and bordering on character assassination. Asked what he has against Rabin, Milstein maintains that the question is misplaced. “My attitude to Rabin is like a zoologist’s attitude toward baboons. I don’t think that Rabin is a baboon. He’s a mediocre-minus person. I don’t have a negative or positive attitude toward him,” he says. “I don’t shed a tear for reality. Throughout history, everyone murders all the time. Take the Bible as an example. King David didn’t commit murder? For that I should shed a tear?”</p> \n<p>At this point, as at other junctures during my conversations with him, Milstein drops some serious names. “If Albert Einstein refuted Newton, that doesn’t mean he hated him. Same with me. If I showed that Rabin ran away from the field of battle, that doesn’t mean I hate him.”</p> \n<p>Milstein’s admirers don’t need elaboration about that last comment. They’re already familiar with his theories about what happened on April 20, 1948, when the so-called convoy of blood of the Harel Brigade, which was under Rabin’s command, was attacked by Arabs en route to Jerusalem. Milstein maintains that Rabin fled from the battle, abandoning his men. Other historians, including the late Dr. Meir Pa’il (the “Palmach’s propagandist,” according to Milstein), read the course of events differently. In a 1991 debate with Milstein, Pa’il said, “The expression ‘Rabin fled’ is garbage from Milstein. The facts are that Rabin, the brigade commander, rushed to [neighboring Kibbutz] Kiryat Anavim to get help. Thanks to his action, reinforcements arrived and rescued the convoy.”</p> \n<p>Milstein went further: After the assassination, he claimed that Rabin was responsible for his own murder. And he says the same today, 23 years later. “Every prime minister in the world is a candidate for assassination, because there’s always someone edgy who’s been hurt by him. I find Yigal Amir’s desire to assassinate Rabin natural. The role of the Shin Bet [security service], which is headed by the prime minister, is to guard the prime minister’s life. There was a failure here by Rabin.”</p> \n<p>The impression one gleans from talking to historians who are knowledgeable about Milstein’s research is that it is he who, in a very different sense, dug his own grave, because alongside his professional historical pursuits, which include detailed interviews with contemporaries and impressive archival activity, he veers deep into conspiracy theories and along the way loses many potential readers.</p> \n<p>His posts in the social networks, where he’s somewhat less restrained in his language, show, for example, that he’s an advocate of the theory according to which Amir was dispatched by certain associates with possible links to security elements to kill Rabin. “Yigal Amir should be happy over his good fate,” one of Milstein’s readers wrote on his Facebook page, apparently regarding his punishment. To which Milstein replied, “But he’s locked away tight so that he will not reveal the truth.”</p> \n<p>What is that truth? The exchange between the reader and Milstein dealt with a new publication by the latter relating to Avraham Stavsky, a member of the pre-state right-wing Irgun militia. The claim is that Stavsky – who was sentenced to death for the murder of Labor Zionist leader Chaim Arlosoroff in 1933, but was acquitted on appeal to the Supreme Court, and died from wounds aboard the Irgun’s Altalena gunship in 1948, when it came under fire from the then-nascent IDF – was actually a secret agent of the Haganah, the underground force that was the forerunner of the IDF. Milstein hypothesized that Stavsky’s death was a planned liquidation, to prevent him from exposing the secret, in the same way that Yigal Amir was put behind bars and silenced to ensure that he doesn’t open his mouth.</p> \n<p>“Altalena was a conspiracy. It is becoming increasingly clear that this is the left’s natural mode of operation. Not a one-time event but a way of life,” the loyal reader wrote to Milstein. “It’s the same format,” Milstein asserted.</p> \n<p>In Milstein’s mind, one thread connects the Arlosoroff assassination in 1933, the Deir Yassin massacre (which he says never happened and calls a blood libel) that Irgun forces perpetrated against the Arab village outside Jerusalem in April 1948, the shelling of the Altalena in June 1948 and the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. The connecting thread is that the left exploited these tragic events, or was even behind them, with the aim of tarnishing the right.</p> \n<p>Over the years it’s apparent that you have become enamored of the bad-boy position, the anti-establishment provocateur.</p> \n<p>“Not so. I am 78 and have no pension and no income. My only regular income is from the National Insurance Institute, together with freelance work, which is pennies. That’s all the great Dr. Uri Milstein has. I don’t complain that I have nothing to live on or that I don’t live well. But at 78, after devoting 60 years to Israel’s wars, and even though the country’s rulers say I am the most important historian that ever was – nothing. No prize, no job, no board of directors, no committee… This year there were gatherings to mark the country’s 70th birthday. I wasn’t invited to a single one of them. Why? What did I do that’s bad?”</p> \n<p>Early discoveries</p> \n<p>Uri Milstein was born in 1940 to Avraham and Sarah Milstein. Rachel Bluwstein – the poet “Rachel” – was the sister of his maternal grandmother, Batya (Bertha) Bluwstein.</p> \n<p>Milstein grew up in Tel Aviv’s lower-class Yad Eliahu neighborhood. A first formative experience occurred in his life in 1955, when he was 15. Milstein was chosen to give an Independence Day talk at school about the “Convoy of the 35” – a reference to an event in January 1948, four months before Israel’s establishment, in which 35 of 40 Haganah fighters were killed in battle when they were on the way to reinforce the besieged Etzion Bloc settlements south of Jerusalem. The event became a formative legend in the story of the war that followed.</p> \n<p>“And what do I discover?” Milstein recalls. “That everything that had been published until then was a lie. Already then I realized that the historians and the journalists and the elites were all lying.” The bereaved parents of those who fell in the 1948 battle – a mere seven years earlier – were invited to the school event. Milstein, the teenager, spoke about the “deficiencies and the mess-ups” of the 35. “I told them that the unit had been sent to the Etzion Bloc in vain, for no reason, and that their heroic stories had never happened.”</p> \n<p>What were the reactions?</p> \n<p>“Total shock. Instead of giving me a medal, they wanted to expel me because I disgraced the school. I didn’t expect the Nobel Prize, but I felt I deserved a commendation for arriving at the truth. Instead, I felt that I was being cast out. And I still have that feeling. But my approach was that the truth must be uttered, no matter whom is hurt by it. I learned that all writing is based on various considerations and that even the teachers and the educators and the intellectuals don’t always want the truth to be written.”</p> \n<p>Milstein was drafted into the Paratroops in 1958 and served as a combat medic in the 890th Battalion, “the Sayeret Matkal of the time,” he says, referring to today’s elite unit. In the Six-Day War, he fought in Sinai with the force commanded by Rafael Eitan, later the chief of staff. Six years later in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, he says, he was in charge of extricating wounded soldiers under fire. “No one else got up to lift up a wounded man and place him in a halftrack. Those who lifted up the wounded were myself, the driver and the radio man. Afterward I heard that people said Uri Milstein deserves a medal,” he says.</p> \n<p>He didn’t get a medal from the army, but subsequently obtained a Ph.D. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He entered the university in 1960, studying economics, philosophy and political science. As a student he was active in the League for the Prevention of Religious Coercion, which was headed by his brother. In 1962, he was injured in a major brawl that broke out in downtown Jerusalem when he tried to get passersby to sign a petition calling for the introduction of civil marriage in Israel.</p> \n<p>Milstein’s graduation project dealt with Plato’s aesthetics. His doctoral thesis, written in 1972, was titled “The Religious Argument in the Legislative Process in Israel.” However, he carved out his career as an autodidact military historian. He was already known for his unusual views by the time he completed his doctoral studies – despite his young age, he had already published dozens of articles and four books about Israel’s wars. They gained him publicity and in some cases notoriety.</p> \n<p>Chapters from his book “The Paratroops’ War,” which he wrote as a student, were published half a century ago in Haaretz Magazine and stirred a furor. The articles angered some members of Unit 101, the commando unit that was the forerunner of the Paratroops. In a 1968 press conference, they accused Milstein of “describing only the unit’s professional military actions, as though killing and destruction were our aim and part of our character.”</p> \n<p>Milstein fluctuated between journalism and literature at the time, and between academic studies and popular writing. Despite controversies generated by his publications, “they belonged to the mythic paradigm that the founders and the Palmach generation forced on all of us,” Milstein says today self-critically. “I was the greatest author of legends in the country. I have a share in [Ariel] Sharon and Raful [Rafael Eitan] achieving what they did. [Education Minister] Naftali Bennett was educated on these books, and in their wake he got to Sayeret Matkal. [Likud MK and former Shin Bet head] Avi Dichter also told me that my books prompted him to volunteer for the unit.”</p> \n<p>The irony of fate: In the past he had to cope with criticism to the effect that he was excessively fond of the army. “I am accused of militarism, but I am not a militarist, I have a relationship with the army but I am not a militarist and I’m not especially attracted to that,” he told Davar, the newspaper of the Labor Zionist movement, in 1973.</p> \n<p>The Yom Kippur War, in which Milstein served as a reservist in the Paratroops, was a watershed for him. It was only afterward that he understood that the emperor, whom had lauded until then, had no clothes.</p> \n<p>“I realized that the founders’ generation, whose political leaders were [David] Ben-Gurion, [Moshe] Sharett, [Levi] Eshkol and Golda Meir, and the generation of the sons, led by Maj. Gens. [Yigael] Yadin, [Moshe] Dayan, Rabin and [Yigal] Allon, had failed twice. The first time because they did not establish an efficient defense establishment, and the second because they cultivated a mythic culture, based on false reports, bogus commitments, and failure to uncover flaws or draw conclusions,” he wrote later.</p> \n<p>His anger was also aimed at the media and academia, which, he claimed, had been in league with the politicians and the military to blur the failures. “Treason of the intellectuals,” he called it. “I decided not to betray myself, come what may.”</p> \n<p>His subsequent books and articles were written in a different spirit. In 1978, Davar’s weekly magazine published an article titled “Conspiracy in Jerusalem,” in which he claimed that there had been a secret pact between Ben-Gurion and Jordan’s King Abdullah in the War of Independence for the division of Jerusalem. Its gist was that Israel would not oppose Jordan’s conquest of the area that was allotted to the Arab state by the partition plan of the United Nations, provided Jordan did not interfere with the establishment of the Jewish state according to that plan.</p> \n<p>The furious responses weren’t long in coming. “Rewriting history is in fashion. The events of the state’s creation and the War of Independence are a no-man’s land and many are manuring it in the hope that it will produce rotten fruit. It’s to this type of remaking history that Uri Milstein’s article belongs,” wrote Yitzhak Levy, who commanded the IDF’s Jerusalem District in the 1948 war.</p> \n<p>In the late 1980s and early ‘90s, Milstein published his four-volume “History of Israel’s War of Independence.” The books were part of a life project, prematurely aborted due to funding problems. If it were up to Milstein, he would have gone on to write dozens more volumes about the war and continued to describe how commander after commander botched battles or fled the field.</p> \n<p>Along with the criticism there were some compliments. In 1998, in an article in the books supplement of Haaretz, historian Benny Morris termed Milstein’s research on the War of Independence “the most important historiography written to date about the military aspect of the 1948 war… a broad, deep work, straightforward and immeasurably better grounded than what has previously been published in Israel and the world on the subject.”</p> \n<p>Morris doesn’t regret what he wrote, but would qualify it today. “Those were the good books, the most important and straightforward written about the war until that time,” he told me. However, in recent decades, “Milstein has got caught up in obsessions and perhaps also in conspiracy theories, starring Palmach and Haganah personnel.”</p> \n<p>Most of the responses to Milstein were negative. In 1992, historian Michael Bar-Zohar launched an anti-Milstein front, after Milstein published a series of articles claiming that Ben-Gurion had viewed Rabin in a negative light. Bar-Zohar shot back sarcastically in Haaretz: “I am very envious of Dr. Uri Milstein … Milstein apparently talks to Ben-Gurion every day, otherwise where does he get his revelations? I spent nine years with Ben-Gurion when I was writing his biography. I asked him a great many questions and I also got quite a few answers. I questioned him at length about his relations with Rabin, and I also perused documents of his that were published and some that weren’t published. And nowhere and at no time did I read or hear so much as a hint of the arrant nonsense that Milstein feeds us.”</p> \n<p>Three years later, when Milstein published the sensationalist “The Rabin File,” the editor of Haaretz’s book supplement, Michael Handelzalts, found himself on the horns of a dilemma. “The editorial board of this supplement asked several scholars of military history to review the book, but they sent it back with the comment that it didn’t deserve consideration. Because we thought we couldn’t leave these allegations without a response, we went on trying,” Handelzalts wrote at the time. Prof. Yagil Levy, who eventually reviewed the book, wrote that “Milstein failed in each of the tests of historical writing.”</p> \n<p>The criticism did not deter Milsrein. On the contrary: The more strident it became, the more he stepped up his pace, not hesitating to fire back at former friends. Thus, a paean he’d written to the Paratroops in the 1960s turned into trenchant criticism, which he voiced in a 1995 Haaretz interview. “To date, the Paratroops have failed in all their operations, and in my best judgment one of the reasons for this is their feeling that parachuting as such is already a guarantee of something. All told, it’s quite expectable for a myth to create an opening for sloppiness and a lack of professionalism,” he said.</p> \n<p>In response, Meir Pa’il, one of Milstein’s most vocal opponents, branded him a “yellow historian,” as in yellow journalism. Mordechai Gur, the commander of the Paratroops Brigade that captured the Old City of Jerusalem in 1967, threatened to hang up on a reporter who called him to elicit his response to Milstein’s comments. Another major general, Avigdor “Janusz” Ben-Gal, commander of the 7th Armored Brigade in the Yom Kippur War, accused the historian of “indulging in sweeping exaggerations, half-truths, taking things out of context and drawing false conclusions, and thereby losing his credibility.”</p> \n<p>Lunch with an assassin</p> \n<p>At 78, Milstein, well aware of what’s said about him, has no intention of changing. He’s convinced, for example, that he was denied the title of professor only because of the intervention of the academic establishment.</p> \n<p>“‘Professor’ is a title that friends give friends,” he says. “Once, at Bar-Ilan, two distinguished professors – the most distinguished – were given the task of examining whether I too deserved the title. Their publications amount to a quarter of mine. They told me there was no argument, that I was the world’s greatest researcher about the War of Independence and about Israel’s wars. But afterward, in a meeting with the rector and the dean, they said I didn’t deserve it. ‘Why do you need to be a professor? You’re already famous in Israel as a Ph.D.,’” they told me.</p> \n<p>On another occasion someone tried to liquidate him, he says – not academically, but physically. “One of the heads of the Shin Bet told me that I was a candidate for assassination. After some time, I had a visit from a [former] Palmach person who had later became a Shin Bet hit man,” Milstein relates. The tension peaks when the assassin and Milstein share a meal in Milstein’s home.</p> \n<p>“Were you a plant?” Milstein asks him. “Yes,” the other man replies. “What for?” Milstein asks. “Uri, drop it,” his interlocutor says. Asked why the hit didn’t happen, Milstein replies, “He told me that those who sent him had left the coalition, so they couldn’t keep their promise to give him a gas station [to manage] in return [for doing the deed], so there’s no way he was going to assassinate me.”</p> \n<p>At his advanced age and with decades of military research behind him, he doesn’t hesitate even to praise Hitler. “Someone who becomes chancellor of Germany, hate him though you will, is not dumb. Hitler reached the top thanks to brilliant and exceptional achievements until the outbreak of the war. He seized Austria and Czechoslovakia without going to war.”</p> \n<p>But even so…</p> \n<p>“All right, okay, he was a character of the type who caused the greatest damage to the Jewish people, but when you talk about massacres you have to remember that until 800 years ago everyone carried out massacres. The prophet Samuel removed Saul because he didn’t behead King Agag… The difference is that today technology exists that makes possible industrial massacre. But it wasn’t invented by Hitler. He went to the opera and he liked dogs. The Germans did it cleanly. They didn’t kill with their own hands like the Turks did with the Armenians. From many standpoints, the Turks were more bestial than the Germans. But today we’re in the humanistic age and we don’t do things like that.”</p> \n<p>Who in Israel’s history is praiseworthy, would you say?</p> \n<p>“At the strategic level there’s no one who was worth anything in the whole history of the IDF. I don’t say that there weren’t commanders at the squad or company level that didn’t have a tactical vision. The problem is that in war it’s the top ranks who are the key players, who decide on the war and prepare the system for it. In the IDF’s selection process, the worst reach the top and the better ones are ejected. There are exceptions, like Arik Sharon, who was the commander of the most successful operation in Israel’s wars: the attack on Um Katef [in the northern Sinai] in the Six-Day War. But when he became defense minister, he made a dreadful mistake in the Lebanon War, which proved that he didn’t have what it takes to manage a whole system.”</p> \n<p>Still, Israel has celebrated its 70th birthday, which is no small thing. There must be at least one person who deserves credit, even from Dr. Uri Milstein.</p> \n<p>“In the whole history of Zionism there was one person with the skills to manage a system successfully: Ben-Gurion. The man didn’t understand a thing at the military level, so he asked, examined, learned and took an interest.”</p> \n<p>Milstein terms his thought, which he views as a full-fledged philosophy, the “survival principle.” Its study is an almost impossible task even for a trained reader, due to the tiresome, unreadable and sometimes unclear nature of his writing – which is apparently why he is almost totally ignored by the academic world. “The defense establishment, whose mission is to ensure the state’s existence, is endangering the state’s survival and by the same token its own survival,” he believes. Israel’s current situation, he’s convinced, proves on a daily basis that his criticism, which he’s been publishing for the past 45 years, has been right on target all along.</p> \n<p>If you’ll just give him half an hour, he’ll persuade you that children of 7 equipped with nothing more than stones forced the Oslo Accords on Rabin, the acclaimed general, by chasing the IDF out of the territories during the first intifada. He will explain to you how 17-year-old youths in Hezbollah – “who never did an officers course, didn’t attend the National Security College and don’t have an undergraduate or graduate degree” – taught the IDF a lesson in south Lebanon from the latter half of the 1980s until the end of the 20th century, “when they made the IDF run for its life as though bitten by a snake.”</p> \n<p>And afterward, too, history proceeded according to Milstein’s gloomy analysis. In 2005, he says, “Hamas and other small organizations, using primitive means of combat, forced the person who fomented the revolution of Unit 101, the IDF’s greatest field commander, retired Maj. Gen. Ariel Sharon, to initiate and carry out a flight from Gush Katif [in the Gaza Strip] while uprooting settlements.”</p> \n<p>Milstein also takes aim at the Second Lebanon War, Operation Cast Lead, and in fact every IDF operation from then to now. “The IDF is afraid of wars, afraid to get entangled,” he says. That conclusion will likely be seconded by many readers who have lived in Israel in recent decades.</p> \n<p>But maybe it’s from the realization that if a military victory is impossible, it’s better to reach agreements with terrorist organizations so that no missiles will be fired at Israel?</p> \n<p>“But what are we afraid of? Of missiles? Missiles have never eradicated a nation. The Jewish people lost six million, and it still exists. Let’s say an atomic bomb is dropped here. And let’s say that 20,000 people are killed, or 40,000, or even 100,000. We number 8 million today, of whom 6.5 million are Jews. If we kept going after six million of our number were killed, won’t we cope with this? The problem is that the nation’s spirit will break. And in that we differ from North Korea or Iran, which aren’t afraid of being bombed.”</p> \n<p>At the age of 78, isn’t it time to let up a bit?</p> \n<p>“The difference between me and Don Quixote is that he returned to his hovel in the end, whereas I continue to fight. And there are cracks in the windmills. The fact that you are interviewing me for Haaretz is a crack. I will carry on with this until I collapse cognitively. There are 80-year-olds who run marathons. I want to complete my project of documenting the War of Independence by the country’s 75th jubilee.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>THE RETURN OF ROMNEY —&nbsp;Despite losing the House of Representatives,&nbsp;the President now has a safe majority in the Senate — pending a recount in Florida and the final&nbsp;results in Arizona — with which to approve his future judicial and cabinet appointees. With John McCain gone, along with Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, the outspoken chair of the Foreign Relations Committee — both of whom notably clashed with Trump —Trump&nbsp;faces diminished resistance from within his party, reducing the risk that a lone outlier could derail his legislation.  Less noticed in Tuesday’s election was the return of Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts and 2012 presidential nominee, to political office. Romney, Senator-elect for Utah, is qualified to fill the void for&nbsp;an independent voice of reason in the Trump era, say a number of his supporters and former aides.  Dov Zakheim, a former Pentagon official who also served as a foreign policy advisor on the Romney presidential campaign, tells us: &quot;Even if Trump is re-elected in 2020, he'll be up for re-election when Trump is leaving. So I don't feel that he's going to have any fear of Trump or any real need to bow down to him. He represents a very different kind of Republicanism. Most Mormons that I know are anti-Trump...&nbsp;I don't see that Romney has any particular loyalty, allegiance, or sense of obligation to Trump. I think he'll be a terrific senator. I think he's going to be a major voice for a sane Republican party. And in a sense, he could be the old kind of standard-bearer. So, you know, on foreign policy or on domestic policy. I just don't see him particularly concerned about what Trump cares about. He will go his own way and I think he will find that there are a lot of Republicans who follow him.&quot;  “I think, to the extent that his thoughts agree with President Trump's, you're going to see that President Trump would have no greater supporter in the U.S. Senate,” Fred Zeidman, a Houston-based Romney donor&nbsp;and board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition, told Jewish Insider. “And to the extent that he disagrees with him, I think that he will voice that and lead the opposition.”  Phil Rosen, a leading Romney bundler in 2012, anticipates that the Utah Senator will mostly toe the party line, primarily because he and Trump agree, fundamentally, on policy. “He has voiced his support for the administration with respect to the economy, Israel and Mideast policy and many other successful efforts,” Rosen noted. “And he will work with the Trump administration to push those policies forward.”  According to Ron Krongold, a Miami businessman, Romney could influence Trump in areas where they don't see eye to eye, like the U.S. relationship with China and Russia. Trump, Krongold suggested, will benefit from discussion with Romney and “take his intuitive outlook on these matters in consideration.”&nbsp;  Comparisons&nbsp;to Corker? — “I think very much so,” Zeidman said when asked if Romney would wear the Bob Corker hat in the Senate. “When Corker agreed with the president he led the parade. And when he disagreed with the President, he led the parade,” he explained. “Romney is so driven to get things done that he has a great sense of compromise and I think he will work very, very closely with the White House to try and reach compromise positions that will allow the administration to govern.”&nbsp;  Former Romney fundraiser and Jewish&nbsp;outreach director,&nbsp;Lisa Spies emails us:&nbsp;“I believe Senator-elect Romney has the credibility to stick to his own brand and not be easily categorized. He will support conservative reform just like he did as Governor, and work with whomever best helps enact an agenda consistent with Utah values.&quot;&nbsp;[JewishInsider]  IN IOWA&nbsp;— King of the Low Road: Iowa’s worst congressman ekes out a victory — by Adam Rubenstein: &quot;Steve King has said and done a lot of indecent things. In October, he endorsed Faith Goldy, a white nationalist running for mayor of Toronto. Both King and Goldy have publicly embraced the “great replacement” theory, which posits a coordinated global conspiracy to repopulate countries with immigrants. Usually it’s the Jews who are blamed for this—there were chants of “Jews will not replace us” during the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017. And in August, while on a foundation-funded trip to visit Holocaust sites in Poland, King took a side trip to Austria to have dinner with members of the far-right Freedom party, which has historical ties to the Nazis...&quot;  &quot;A local GOP insider told me just how much discord there is in the party when it comes to King. “We’re trying to put out a positive message, and he steps on it every day. He used to do a lot [for Iowa]. He’s MIA in D.C.,” he told me. “He’s on his crusade overseas, and he’s leaving Iowa voters behind. No one is comfortable with him anymore.”&nbsp;[WeeklyStandard]  How we got Ayanna Pressley wrong on Israel — by&nbsp;Ron Kampeas:&nbsp;&quot;Pressley’s views on Israel differ little from the long-serving Democrat she unseated in the primary, Michael Capuano... “The Jewish community in Boston has enjoyed a warm and productive relationship with congresswoman-elect Pressley during her nine years holding a Boston citywide elected position,” [Jeremy] Burton said in an email. “During that time and during this year’s campaign, Pressley has sought out the input and perspectives of our leaders and organizations on a range of issues, including the US-Israel partnership,” he said.&quot; [JTA]&nbsp;  Rep.

This makes it highly likely he will become its chairman when Congress resumes in January... Today, Yarmuth is at the forefront of Democratic disillusionment with Israel’s leadership. “Unfortunately, Israel has lost a lot of support,” he says. He has dubbed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “the Dick Cheney” of Israel – “willing to say or do anything to scare his crowd into supporting him.” “I once sat across from Netanyahu and looked at him and felt he was the most bold-faced liar I had ever heard,” he says.&quot;  “Yarmuth shakes his head when asked about Netanyahu, as well as Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett’s recent handling of the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh. “Trump has clearly made it more acceptable to surface your prejudices,” Yarmuth says...

        "text":["<p>In the territories, the Palestinians seem to be having difficulty reconciling themselves to Netanyahu’s absolute conviction that the conflict regarding the occupation is over and done. Appearing before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee earlier this week, the head of the Shin Bet security service, Nadav Argaman, warned about the possibility of a steep increase in terrorism in the West Bank. Within the past several days, two Israelis were lightly injured by gunfire in the West Bank, on a bus north of Ramallah, and two stabbing attempts were foiled.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Separate visits to two regional brigade commanders in the West Bank within a week paint a similar picture. The number of rock-throwing incidents has been on the rise, as have the number of attempted terrorist attacks and the number of intelligence warnings of attacks in the planning stages.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Particularly in the northern West Bank, a cycle of revenge has developed that is far from over. Two Israeli citizens were shot to death in the Barkan industrial zone last month and a Palestinian woman was killed by a rock thrown at her car, apparently by young Israelis, which prompt additional acts of revenge.</p> \n<p>The fact that the Barkan killer has not yet been apprehended is causing unease among extreme right-wing activists. The Shin Bet and the Israeli army have been investing tremendous resources in trying to catch the terrorist, but to no avail so far. The criticism in the media over the failure to apprehend him is presented rather strangely, suggesting that if only the top brass would only get up an hour earlier, as industrious reporters do, the whole thing would long have been resolved.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Hamas chief in Gaza denies progress: 'There is no deal or understandings' with Israel</p> \n<p>Brigade commanders report a combination of lone-wolf attackers, some motivated by serious personal problems and others inspired by terrorist attacks committed by others. There are also reports of independent cells and a growing trend of terrorist cells funded and directed from Hamas command centers in Lebanon and Gaza.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The army is preparing for more serious scenarios: clashes on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem along the lines of the rioting that followed the installation of metal detectors there in 2017; a series of clashes between Palestinians and West Bank settlers; or instability caused by an open leadership struggle within the Palestinian Authority.</p> \n<p>Hamas’ attempts to launch a terrorist campaign in the West Bank are divorced from efforts at coming to an arrangement with Israel over long-term calm on the Gaza border. The main obstacle that the Islamist movement faces in the West Bank is a dearth of engineers who can assemble explosives. Once they have built up adequate knowledge to produce deadly devices again, the threat of suicide attacks will resurface.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Palestinian breaches Gaza border fence, sets Israeli greenhouse on fire</p> \n<p>Surprisingly, a certain level of optimism is prevailing in Gaza. After the fuel funded by Qatar arrived in the Strip, a temporary arrangement was agreed upon that will make it possible to transfer tens of millions of dollars from Qatar for infrastructure projects and to pay salaries to government employees in Gaza. At present, Hamas is exerting control over the demonstrations along the border fence with Israel and is restraining other violence. If this positive momentum can be maintained for this Friday's border demonstrations, perhaps the prospect exists of putting the events of the past several months behind us.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Gaza authorities are paying the salaries of some 30,000 Hamas government bureaucrats in the Gaza Strip after a recent deal to transfer $15 million from Qatar. The payments began on Wednesday and are expected to continue through Saturday. Police forces, emergency rescue services and the security forces in Gaza are among those receiving payments.</p> \n<p>The staffing of government offices in Gaza has been a sticking point in the longstanding efforts to reconcile Hamas, which controls Gaza, and Fatah, the party that controls the Palestinian Authority. The government in Ramallah does not deem staffers hired by Hamas over the past decade in Gaza as employees of the Palestinian Authority and have therefore refused to pay their salaries.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;As Gaza deal comes within grasp, Israel looks for ways to pump money into the Strip&nbsp;■&nbsp;Gazans are bending Israel and Hamas to their will – all the way toward a deal&nbsp;■&nbsp;Emerging Israel-Hamas deal reportedly includes partial lifting of siege, end of violence</p> \n<p>Following Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 which Hamas won, in 2007, Hamas forcibly took control of the Gaza Strip from the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority. About 40,000 Palestinian Authority employees in Gaza, some of whom have not worked since the takeover, have been receiving only about 50 percent of their regular salaries from the seat of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah.</p> \n<p>This week’s payments follow Qatar's announcement that it would transfer about $90 million to Gaza. About $15 million of the sum reached Gaza on Thursday. A Hamas official told Haaretz that the money will continue to be used in the coming months to pay salaries.</p> \n<p>The funds will also be used in part to cover compensations that will be paid to the families of those killed in mass demonstrations along the Gaza border with Israel since the end of the March of Return. Those injured by Israeli weapons fire in clashes with Israeli security forces on the border will also receive compensation. Some of the demonstrators have tried to breach the border fence and in more recent months, incendiary devices in the form of kites and balloons have been launched from Gaza to the Israel side of the border.</p> \n<p>Hamas has also decided to use a portion of the Qatari money to make monthly payments of 1,200 shekels ($325) to create 10,000 jobs for unemployed Gaza residents, including doctors and teachers. Members of Hamas’ military wing will be paid from tax proceeds collected by Hamas in Gaza and not from the Qatari funds.</p> \n<p>One proposal that has been raised in the course of the reconciliation talks is to have a portion of the Palestinian Authority and Hamas employees in Gaza retire and combine the two sets of employees into a single workforce. But because the on-again, off-again reconciliation talks have faltered, the proposal has not been brought to fruition.</p> \n<p>Since the takeover of the Gaza Strip by Hamas, Israel has imposed tight restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of the Strip. Egypt, which also shares a border with Gaza, has imposed its own restrictions.</p> \n<p>According to sources in Gaza, the payments to government workers, sums that average 1,400 shekels per person, have boosted business in marketplaces in the coastal enclave and at restaurants and places of entertainment. “There is no doubt that the payment of the wages, in addition to extending the number of hours of electricity, has given people breathing space, but it’s localized treatment because without a strategic plan that also makes the export and import of goods and a resumption of manufacturing possible, this won’t lead to real recovery,” Dr. Omar Shaban, an economist, told reporters in Gaza.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency, which is closely associated with the office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, took the unusual step on Friday of publishing a column accusing Hamas of what it called the sale of Palestinian blood for $15 million. “Fifteen million dollars has been paid to Hamas at the expense of Palestinian blood, and the leadership of the organization is taking advantage of this money to continue with the Zionist-American plan to separate the Strip from the West Bank,” the column read.</p> \n<p>The article said that the Qatari money had entered the Strip with Israel’s consent through the Erez crossing on the Israel-Gaza border and alleged that the salaries are to be paid based on a list that Israel approved. “Hamas websites are glorifying the payment of the salaries as if it were an achievement and a victory, but in practice it proves that the organization’s leadership is prepared to forge an alliance with the devil to maintain power in the Gaza Strip,” the column declared.</p> \n<p>Hamas officials, it should be noted, claim that the payment of the salaries and the easing of the situation is the direct result of Palestinian pressure of the kind reflected in the mass demonstrations on the Israeli border since March 30. Health Ministry sources in Gaza have reported that over 250 Gazans have been killed in the clashes since March.</p> \n<p>Hamas, according to officials, is coordinating activity along the border with other Palestinian factions in the Strip and will hold non-violent protests until the siege of Gaza is completely lifted. In advance of Friday’s demonstrations, the organizing committee said the participants would not approach the border fence or try to break through the fence or launch incendiary devices, as occurred last week.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Palestinian-American activist Linda Sarsour released a statement apologizing on behalf of the Women’s March for causing harm to the movement’s Jewish members and for being too slow to show its commitment to fighting anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>“We should have been faster and clearer in helping people understand our values and our commitment to fighting anti-semitism. We regret that,” said the statement, issued Tuesday afternoon. “Every member of our movement matters to us — including our incredible Jewish and LGBTQ members. We are deeply sorry for the harm we have caused, but we see you, we love you, and we are fighting with you.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Linda Sarsour says Ilhan Omar backlash shows ‘allegiance to Israel’&nbsp;■&nbsp;Women’s March founder calls on leaders to resign, citing anti-Semitism and homophobia</p> \n<p>The Women’s March has come under renewed fire recently for co-chair Tamika Mallory’s associations with Louis Farrakhan, the virulently anti-Semitic leader of the Nation of Islam. The women’s group organized mass protests against President Donald Trump in January 2017 and has since been a leading liberal activist group working on behalf of women’s empowerment.</p> \n<p>In February, Mallory posted a photo of herself with Farrakhan after he gave a speech laced with anti-Semitic statements. After an outcry over that incident, the Women’s March released a statement saying “Minister Farrakhan’s statements about Jewish, queer, and trans people are not aligned with the Women’s March Unity Principles.”</p> \n<p>The controversy bubbled up again recently when actress Alyssa Milano said she would not speak at next year’s Women’s March because she felt that they had not adequately addressed anti-Semitism. On Monday, Women’s March co-founder Teresa Shook called on the movement’s current organizers to step down because they have “allowed anti-Semitism.”</p> \n<p>In her statement Tuesday, Sarsour said the group wants to have a better relationship with the Jewish community.</p> \n<p>“Trying to dismantle oppression, while working within systems of oppression, is hard,” Sarsour wrote. “We are deeply invested in building better and deeper relationships with the Jewish community. And we’re committed to deepening relationships with any community who has felt left out of this movement. We want to create space where all are welcome.”</p> \n<p>The statement strikes somewhat of a different tone from one Sarsour published Monday, in which she again distanced the group from Farrakhan, but also suggested that criticism of the Women’s March was a deflection from focusing on anti-Semitism from the far-right. She said that the underlying reason people criticize her is not because of associations with Farrakhan but because she is a Palestinian-American.</p> \n<p>“It’s very clear to me what the underlying issue is — I am a bold, outspoken BDS supporting Palestinian Muslim American woman and the opposition’s worst nightmare,” she wrote. “They have tried every tactic at their disposal to undermine me, discredit me, vilify me but my roots are too deep and my work is too clear and they have not succeeded so by proxy they began attacking my sister Tamika Mallory — knowing all too well that in this country the most discardable woman is a Black woman.”</p> \n<p>Sarsour has been a polarizing figure to American Jews. Some on the right and center point to her anti-Zionist activism. This week, the American Jewish Committee condemned her for criticizing “folks who masquerade as progressives but always choose their allegiance to Israel over their commitment to democracy and free speech,” saying it echoed the historical smear that Jews have dual loyalty.</p> \n<p>But some progressive Jews have worked with her and defended her from charges of anti-Semitism. They point to her fundraising for the funerals of victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, as well as her raising funds on behalf of a vandalized Jewish cemetery.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, soon after posting the apology, Sarsour posted a defiant statement praising the Women’s March on Facebook.</p> \n<p>“Don’t let people who have not contributed nor put their bodies on the line define this moment,” she wrote, referencing Shook and other critics. “[T]hose who understand that we are all vulnerable under a fascist Administration will define this moment. We will win together. We will write history together. It will be a messy history full of trials and tribulations, hurt and pain but with the consistent understanding that people are counting on us.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Michael Solomonov, chef and owner of the landmark Zahav restaurant in Philadelphia, made history when he won the James Beard Foundation’s Best Chef award in 2017, the American food “Oscar.” It was the first time a chef making Israeli food won the highest prize in American food-making. A year before, Solmonov won two other prizes. The James Beard Foundation awarded him first prize for best cookbook of the year and another award for the best international cookbook, saying he provided an experience that links the reader to Israeli food.</p> \n<p>Now Solomonov is publishing a new book, “Israeli Soul: Easy, Essential, Delicious,” which is basically about Israeli spirit and soul. If in his previous book Solmonov dealt with his own personal tastes and focused on his own life story, the new book deals with Israeli street food and the more popular restaurants.</p> \n<p>Solomonov is doing this at a time when the Israeli kitchen is winning international recognition and Israeli restaurants are gaining the esteem of world culinary experts. Solomonov takes the reader back to the roots of Israeli food, from the food stands featuring such items as falafel and sabich.</p> \n<p>Zahav, as Solomonov describes it, is a restaurant providing food inspired by the modern Israeli kitchen. The restaurant has been operating for 10 years, and it’s around the top of the American eateries list. As a result, it’s almost impossible to get a table there. Even if Israelis may say they don’t understand all the hoopla about Zahav, there’s still one thing you can’t take away from Solomonov: He has upgraded Israeli food and recognition as an elite cuisine, more than just street food.</p> \n<p>With seven crew members, Solmonov set out on a tour of Israel in order to write his book. They visited 82 restaurants. They were disappointed in two of them, which Solmonov doesn’t identify by name and which he doesn’t include in the book. Doing some impressive work for the book is Solomonov’s regular photographer Michael Persico. His photos simply whet your appetite.</p> \n<p>Via his book, Solomon seeks to stress the variety of food available in Israel, unlike most other places in the world. For example, in Givat Olga he found a falafel stand, a burekas shop and a kebab place next to one each other, and all were excellent.</p> \n<p>“I saw the beauty of Israeli street food, “ Solmonov says in an interview with Haaretz. “You get three different restaurants from three different worlds in a 100-meter stretch and all of them are authentic. Where else would you find this kind of diversity?” When I ask him the name of a restaurant he really liked, he quickly replies: “Without a doubt, Morris in Mahane Yehuda. Simply wonderful.”</p> \n<p>Solomonov is doing a book promotion tour in Boston, Seattle, Chicago, Milwaukee, Atlanta, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and that’s just a partial list. America is at his feet, he’s like a rock star on tour.</p> \n<p>Does his book have any value for Israelis? Solmonov believes it does. “You’d be amazed at how many Israelis don’t know the small places featuring great falafel and sabich. Even if they heard of this or that spot, most of them have never been there. These stands usually just serve people locally. I promise you that many Israelis may know of the falafel stand called Devorah in Karkur, but never ate there. So even Israelis have something to learn from this book, I’d say. I would suggest that Israelis tour around the country more and taste food at these places. They wouldn’t be wasting their time.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>New regulations issued by New York State’s education department on Tuesday will require education authorities to review the curricula of every Hasidic yeshiva in the state, along with those of all other private schools.</p> \n<p>The regulations come years into a growing controversy over whether New York’s Hasidic yeshivas are providing education that is substantially equivalent to that offered in public schools, as is required by state law. An investigation by the New York City Department of Education into the issue has made little progress over the past three years, according to an interim report published over the summer.</p> \n<p>The new guidelines say that the state will shut down schools that don’t meet the equivalency requirements if they fail to address the issue.</p> \n<p>Under the new guidelines, the state education department and local school boards will have until 2021 to determine whether all the private schools in the state, including Hasidic yeshivas, meet the equivalency standard. The guidelines are complex. As of Tuesday afternoon, neither the yeshiva reform group YAFFED nor the pro-yeshiva group PEARLS had issued a response.</p> \n<p>“Every child has a fundamental right to receive a quality education,” the chancellor of the state Board of Regents, Betty Rosa, said in a statement. “The process should be a collaborative effort that is a mutually beneficial learning process for leaders of both public and nonpublic schools resulting in appropriate educational opportunities for the children they serve.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel's Jewish religious fanaticism is infiltrating America | Opinion</p> \n<p>The new regulations come as power in Albany swings away from the Orthodox Jewish community. The November elections stripped the extraordinary power of State Sen. Simcha Felder, who represents heavily Orthodox neighborhoods in Brooklyn, and who controlled a key vote in the fractured Senate chamber. Voters delivered the Senate to the Democrats in November, a double blow to the Orthodox, who had close ties to Senate Republicans, and to Felder.</p> \n<p>The guidelines, however, are based on a controversial law passed as part of last summer’s budget deal. The law, which Felder demanded in order to sign on to the budget, limited state oversight over Hasidic yeshivas, but left significant leeway to the education department to determine substantial equivalency requirements.</p> \n<p>The new law says that the state education commissioner, rather than local school districts, will determine equivalency for schools that meet certain criteria that were drawn only to include Hasidic yeshivas.

        "text":["<p>Boycotting Jewish settlements in the West Bank may seem like an easy task. But Airbnb, the online home-rental service, may find it harder than expected to delist homes in the occupied territory that it described Monday as being “at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.”</p> \n<p>Like many internet giants, Airbnb doesn’t actually have its own map service. Instead, it uses Google Maps to allow users to search for an apartment or house geographically. The embedded-map functions allow potential renters to scan the places they plan to visit from a bird’s-eye view, surveying potential homes.</p> \n<p>But relying on Google Maps may also make any attempt at differentiating between Jewish and Palestinian communities that much harder – especially if the goal is not to ban Palestinians from renting out their homes as well.</p> \n<p>Google Maps data does not “recognize” Palestine as a sovereign territory in the same way it recognizes Israel. It also makes no clear distinction between Jewish settlements and Palestinian communities in the West Bank. As a result, drawing that distinction based on the information provided by Google Maps is nigh-on impossible.</p> \n<p>While Google Maps does try to steer clear of political issues, the inherently political nature of border drawing and national demarcations has already seen it dragged into the thorniest of issues. In Israel, it was previously accused of “deleting” Palestine from the map – a claim later found to be false, since Palestine as a sovereign territory was never on the map to begin with. Instead, Google’s map service offers an outline of the Green Line, the de facto internationally recognized pre-1967 border between Israel proper and the occupied West Bank.</p> \n<p>Using only Google Maps to define the border near Jerusalem makes the situation even more complex. Though Airbnb told Haaretz the ban will not affect East Jerusalem, it is unclear how this will work if Google Maps is employed, as the border it provides for dividing “Palestinian”&nbsp;East Jerusalem&nbsp;from “Israeli” West Jerusalem could in theory leave some&nbsp; Israeli communities outside Airbnb. This includes the&nbsp;Old City’s&nbsp;Jewish Quarter, the City of David area, as well as the French Hill neighborhood and both Hebrew University campuses, all inside the West Bank per Google's map service. </p> \n<p>Then there are mixed neighborhoods like Abu Tor, whose main road spans both parts of the city and is home to both Jews and Arabs. Will the Palestinian living on the Jewish side be allowed to continue renting out his home while his cousin down the street will not?</p> \n<p>Palestinian neighborhoods in East Jerusalem like Silwan, where Jewish settlers have increased their presence and at times even won legal ownership battles, pose a unique challenge of their own. But they also serve to highlight the futility of trying to use aggregated online data to solve political questions.</p> \n<p>In fact, there is no real way of using Google Maps data to discern which communities belong to Palestinians and which to Jewish Israelis. Clicking on a community’s name will reveal a short snippet of text describing it as either a “Palestinian community” or a “Jewish settlement.” But this too is a slippery slope – for just as Airbnb uses Google for its maps, Google uses Wikipedia for its information on the different communities.</p> \n<p>More than anything, this means that the question of what constitutes an Israeli settlement may actually fall to the unwitting volunteers editing Wikipedia – a platform that, despite all its benefits, does leave content exposed to manipulation. What’s to stop a settler who supplements their income by renting out their hilltop villa from changing the online encyclopedia’s article about their outpost?</p> \n<p>Google and Amazon make heavy use of Wikipedia’s content, and that has already backfired. Ahead of the midterms, for example, someone vandalized the Wikipedia page for California’s Republican Party, describing its ideological worldview as “Nazism.” This “fact” was aggregated by Amazon’s Alexa personal assistant bot and presented inside Google’s search “knowledge graph” – that informative little box that shows up every time you google something – until the mistake was picked up by national media and quickly fixed.</p> \n<p>For all intents and purposes, Airbnb has outsourced the political question at the heart of its ban. Unless it plans to start its own version of Peace Now’s Settlement Watch and maintain a blacklist of settlements and outposts, it may find itself barring Palestinians as well as Israeli settlers from its service.</p> \n<p>After this article's publication, Airbnb told Haaretz they have a &quot;framework&quot; in place to deal with the settlement issue and stressed the ban does not include East Jerusalem. Airbnb did not provide further detail regarding this framework. </p>",

        "text":["<p>On November 21, 1918, exactly 100 years ago, dignitaries of the first modern Hebrew city convened for a special session. The city’s widest street, the one “passing by the seaside,” as it was described then, would be named “from now on and for eternity” after Edmund Allenby, a British general.</p> \n<p>There was great excitement in the air; after all Allenby, who would later become a field marshal, had just liberated the Holy Land from the Ottoman Turks toward the end of World War I.</p> \n<p>The buzz can be seen in the official document put out that day and given as a memento to Allenby, who was present at the special session. The document called “Minister Allenby” the liberator of the country, the victor and savior who would put his name on the lips of Jews in the Holy Land for generations.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 1917: General Allenby shows how a ‘moral man’ conquers Jerusalem</p> \n<p>The document was signed by members of the neighborhood committee; Tel Aviv was nine years old but was yet to be recognized as a city. The committee was headed by the future first mayor, Meir Dizengoff. Allenby, who died in London in 1936, kept the document and left it to his heirs.</p> \n<p>As part of the preparations for an exhibition marking the centennial of Allenby’s entry into Jerusalem in December 1917, curator Nirit Shalev-Khalifa of the Ben-Zvi Institute met two of Allenby’s descendants, Lady Sarah Allenby and her son Lord Henry Allenby.</p> \n<p>Henry is the grandson of the general’s nephew. The two told the curator about their valuable possession: several original documents given to Allenby by Tel Aviv officials.</p> \n<p>Along with the document on the naming of the street, the Allenbys found another artifact in their attic; this document, which the general received on a visit to Tel Aviv in 1933, named him an honorary citizen.</p> \n<p>Ahead of the centennial of the street-naming, Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai asked Lord Henry Allenby to donate the historical documents to the city, where they would be publicly displayed. Lord Henry agreed.</p> \n<p>The name Allenby means much more in Israel than it does in England, where it’s a forgotten piece of history, Lord Henry wrote to Huldai. He said his family would be very happy if, instead of these documents being locked away, they would be displayed to the public.</p> \n<p>“These documents are of great importance to the history of Tel Aviv-Jaffa. They will be available to the public, offering a rare glimpse into the beginnings of the first Hebrew city,” Huldai told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>As Huldai put it, “Allenby Street has seen everything our eclectic city has to offer – culture, art, markets, the sacred and the profane. From the old Mugrabi Cinema to the filming of a famous movie, Ephraim Kishon’s ‘Blaumilch Canal,’ to the city’s Great Synagogue.”</p> \n<p>In addition to Allenby’s visits in 1918 and 1933, he also visited in 1925, when he came to British Mandatory Palestine for the inauguration of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. When he visited Tel Aviv, Mayor Dizengoff welcomed him warmly.</p> \n<p>“This street, at one end of which we’re standing now, was deserted when we gave it its glorious name, calling it Allenby Street,” Dizengoff said then. “Now it’s full of houses and traffic, the most bustling thoroughfare in our city. I suppose the name was a success.”</p> \n<p>It’s unclear if the Allenby family knows what has happened to the street named after their ancestor – it’s now dotted with neglected facades, strip clubs and other lowbrow places of entertainment. And they’re all polluted by the buses whizzing by.</p> \n<p>Only a keen eye can discern remnants of the gems scattered along the boulevard. Some of these are buildings designed by the city’s first engineer, architect Yehuda Magidovitch.</p> \n<p>But there are some bright spots. The municipality has committed to renovating the Great Synagogue at the corner of Ahad Ha’am Street. This could be the start of a renewal of the street ahead of a visit by the Allenby family next year, a visit agreed on with the municipality.</p>",

        "text":["<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Artifacts from the First Temple period are extremely rare, especially in Jerusalem. Yet now archaeologists report finding a second stone weight from that era that may well have been used in Solomon's Temple itself.</p> \n<p>These stone weights, called bekas (singular – beka) were used on scales to ascertain the value of worshippers’ donations.</p> \n<p>This second beka was found while sifting archaeological soil taken from the foundations of Robinson’s Arch at the Western Wall. This is the last remnant of the wall that had surrounded the Second Temple courtyard.</p> \n<p>Archaeologist Eli Shukron directed the previous excavations on behalf of the Antiquities Authority, and tells Haaretz he found the first beka a few years ago in much the same spot.</p> \n<p>Both the first and second wee weights are inscribed in ancient Hebrew script with the word beka, which pretty much decides what they were used for.</p> \n<p>Both the first and second beka weights found in Jerusalem have the word “beka” engraved on them in ancient Hebrew script. But while the first was carved into the stone properly, from right to left, this “new” one is written backwards.</p> \n<p>“Beka weights from the First Temple period are rare; however, this weight is even rarer because the inscription on it is written in mirror script. The letters are engraved from left to right instead of right to left,” says Shukron. “It can therefore be concluded that the artist who engraved the inscription on the weight specialized in engraving seals – since seals were always written in mirror script so that, once stamped, the inscription would appear in regular legible script.”</p> \n<p>Shukron’s theory is that the beka maker was guilty of human error: The craftsman was used to making seals and used to writing in mirror script, so he did that on the weight too. Given the time it takes to carve letters finely into stone, one wonders how nobody noticed, or whether the first one evinced an early example of dyslexia and this one was “correct.”</p> \n<p>Taxing for men</p> \n<p>Jews in the era of the First Temple, which was supposedly built by King Solomon around 3,000 years ago, didn’t have coins (David and Solomon ostensibly reigned between roughly 1050 B.C.E. and 930 B.C.E.) The Jews would pay their “temple tax” in precious silver, Shukron tells Haaretz. Coins would only reach Israel in the Persian era of the land, in the fifth century B.C.E., he added.</p> \n<p>Though women did make pilgrimages to the Temple in Jerusalem, they were exempt from this “tax,” adds linguist Elon Gilad.</p> \n<p>“When the half-shekel tax was brought to the temple during the First Temple period, there were no coins so they used silver slivers,” says Shukron. “In order to calculate the weight of these silver pieces, they would put them on one side of the scales, and on the other side they placed the beka weight.”</p> \n<p>The Temple would apparently use these donations for its maintenance, to buy animals for sacrifice, and so on.</p> \n<p>The word beka comes from the verb meaning “to split” – i.e., it represented a fraction of a larger measure, in this case the biblical shekel, explains Gilad.</p> \n<p>As explained in the Bible itself, beka weights were used in the First Temple to evaluate the half-shekel donation that Jews aged 20 years and up were expected to offer for the temple’s upkeep:</p> \n<p>&quot;This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary – the shekel is twenty gerahs – half a shekel for an offering to the Lord&quot; (Exodus 30:13).</p> \n<p>In case anybody remained unconvinced, the Bible continues:</p> \n<p>&quot;A beka a head, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that passed over to them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men&quot; (Exodus 38:26).</p> \n<p>To be clear, the biblical shekel weighed 11.33 grams. The half-shekel, and therefore this stone beka, weighed half of that, or just over 5.5 grams.</p> \n<p>The reason certifiable artifacts and remains from the First Temple period, in Jerusalem especially, are extremely rare is multiple. One issue is that stones from the homes and walls – and possibly the First Temple itself – were probably repurposed during the city’s many phases of destruction and rebuilding.</p> \n<p>And from that, Shukron postulates, it seems that the artisans who carved the stone weights during the First Temple period were the same ones who made seals.</p> \n<p>Among other momentous discoveries by the Emek Tzurim National Park sifting project is a seal mark that may well have been made by King Hezekiah (or on his behalf) 2,700 years ago. That had been discovered, in 2015, in excavations by the Temple Mount.</p> \n<p>Another seal impression from exactly the same time was found last January, which renowned Jerusalem archaeologist Eilat Mazar, of Hebrew University, believes is engraved with the letters Yeshayahu NBY – meaning Isaiah the Prophet, who was quite the bugbear to Hezekiah back when. The seal is damaged, so part of the lettering seems to be missing. Not everybody buys that it had belonged to Isaiah, partly because the ancient sage would have needed a seal calling himself “Prophet.”</p> \n<p>“This 3,000-year-old beka weight inscribed with ancient Hebrew was likely used in the First Temple, anchoring once again, the deep historical connection of the Jewish people to Jerusalem,&quot; said Doron Spielman, vice president of the City of David Foundation.</p> \n<p>The City of David Foundation notes that the beka weight will be on display to the general public in Emek Tzurim National Park during Hanukkah.</p> \n<p>The sifting was done in the national park under the auspices of the City of David Foundation.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Republican National Committee came under fire from prominent Republicans and former GOP members on Monday after it echoed comments made by U.S. President Donald Trump attacking retired Navy Admiral William McRaven.</p> \n<p>McRaven ran the famous 2011 Navy SEAL operation that resulted in the death of Al-Qaida leader and September 11th terrorist attacks mastermind Osama bin Laden.</p> \n<p>The RNC wrote on Twitter: “Worth noting after recent comments: Retired Adm. William McRaven was reportedly on Hillary Clinton’s short list for Vice President in 2016.  He’s been critical of President Trump - even dating back to the 2016 campaign.  He’s hardly a non-political figure.”</p> \n<p>Bill Kristol, an influential Jewish conservative commentator and leader of the so-called &quot;Never Trump&quot; movement, slammed the top Republican body for the tweet: “This is the Twitter account of the Republican National Committee. The Committee doesn't speak for, and unfortunately isn't really accountable to, tens of millions of Republicans across the country. But it might be a good idea for reasonable Republicans to stop supporting the RNC.”</p> \n<p>This controversy kicked off when Trump called the retired admiral a &quot;Hillary Clinton fan&quot; and an &quot;Obama backer&quot; during an interview with Chris Wallace on &quot;Fox News Sunday,” inisting McRaven could have killed bin Laden sooner.</p> \n<p>“Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn’t it have been nice?” Trump asked host Chris Wallace. &quot; ... Living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.&quot;</p> \n<p>Kristol's call “for reasonable Republicans” to stop supporting the RNC was quickly echoed by conservative California author and government professor Jack Pitney, who wrote, “As a former RNC staffer, I second that motion!” Pitney himself publicly broke with the GOP in a USA Today op-ed entitled, “I was a Republican until Donald Trump hijacked my party.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Kristol still identifies as a member of the GOP. Author and historian Max Boot, on the other hand has also publicly left the GOP, wrote, &quot;The entire Republican Party is now attacking a war hero battling leukemia. Have you no shame.&quot;</p> \n<p>Republican leaders joined in with rebukes of the RNC tweet, but did not publicly condemn the organization - which is the national political arm of the Republican Party and supports Republican candidates with financial support during election cycles.</p> \n<p>Florida Senator Marco Rubio wrote, “I don’t know if Adm. William McRaven shares my political views or not.</p> \n<p>&quot;But I do know that few Americans have sacrificed or risked more than he has to protect America and the freedoms we enjoy.

None of the parties to this dirty prank cared about security. They use security the way Scientologists use self-improvement slogans, as a marketing trick, an opiate of the masses.</p> \n<p>If we are indeed in “one of the most complex periods for Israeli security,” as Prime Minister&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu put it, the country should have been shaken to its core, because the previous defense minister didn’t hear about it, nor did any senior defense officials. Even Education Minister Naftali Bennett was less than persuasive: “The situation today is no more dangerous than it was a few months ago,” he said, “when the prime minister acted to bring down his government for political reasons, over the [new public broadcasting] corporation.”</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>This is a bluff. The only person who bought it was Rabbi Haim Drukman. The Israel Television News Company reported Monday that the head of the National Security Council, Meir Ben-Shabbat, was sent to Drukman, with whom he shared defense secrets in order to persuade him to pressure Bennett to stay in the government. Instead of resigning immediately, Ben-Shabbat became Netanyahu’s errand boy to the religious Zionist community. Drukman was persuaded that this “period” is a sensitive one. Does he know more about Israel’s security situation than a minister in the inner cabinet? It’s hard to know, but it’s clearly that in this drama, security is only a supporting role.</p> \n<p>Security doesn’t interest this government. The deliberations of the inner cabinet are a show. The first to admit this are its members. This is an ongoing failing. The deliberations in the previous government over Operation Protective Edge, in 2014, were described by Roni Bart, then a senior member of the NSC, as “a set of monologues.” “I never heard a cabinet minister say, ‘Please show us some alternatives,’” he said. Only the media asks for alternatives. There’s no point expecting anything from the inner cabinet, but it’s nauseating to see the NSC being dragged into the mire. Netanyahu has been toying with this important body for years now. We’ve heard about the heads of the NSC who believe their role is “provide quiet” to the prime minister, about deliberations that are “negligence squared” and about Netanyahu’s former nominee to head the NSC, Avriel Bar-Yosef, one of the suspects in the submarines affair whose indictment the police have recommend. Another security affair that bores them.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Read more:&nbsp;Pathetic u-turn proves Netanyahu's rivals are not in his league&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;Why Naftali Bennett couldn’t bring down Netanyahu | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“The submarines affair has gone into the deep,” said Netanyahu, whose confidants have been accused of corruption. In a government that cared about security, the inner cabinet would not have ignored bid-rigging amounting to billions by close associates, in concert with bending decisions affecting national security. A government that cared about security would have demanded an end to the prime minister’s direct involvement in the issue. It would also have demanded to know what was being done to guarantee that in the future, tens of millions of state funds will not go to machers and confidants. None of this happened.</p> \n<p>David Shimron came up with the idea of appointing Avigdor Lieberman defense minister, and it was Lieberman who approved the purchase of three submarines from Germany. The deal is still on the table. Netanyahu didn’t even bother to distance himself from Shimron and Isaac Molho. In any other country, this would be cause to dissolve the government. In Israel, Netanyahu preaches to the public about security.</p> \n<p>No government has ever prostituted Israel’s security like this. Netanyahu wants to conceal understandings with Hamas? Security.

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – The current measles outbreak in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods in the New York area is leading to threats, recriminations and lawsuits, and is also highlighting the lack of consensus among senior rabbis on the vaccination issue.</p> \n<p>However, it is also leading to new approaches from medical experts trying to reach those who, in the face of nearly 130 suspected cases of the highly contagious disease, remain determined not to vaccinate their children.</p> \n<p>There are now 113 confirmed cases of measles in ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) communities around New York City and Lakewood, New Jersey, with another 16 suspected and under investigation by public health authorities. Two measles-infected babies have been hospitalized in intensive care units. And while it is mostly infants who have been infected, some teenagers and a handful of adults have also fallen ill.</p> \n<p>Why has the anti-vaxxer perspective taken hold in pockets of the Haredi community? The answer, say longtime observers, has to do with long-held suspicions of government agencies, including health departments, prizing cultural isolation, reliance on their own communities for things like emergency services, and placing their trust in God to protect them.</p> \n<p>U.S. public health authorities say the current outbreak started when Haredi families visited Israel last Sukkot and brought the illness back to their communities. An 18-month-old infant in Jerusalem’s Haredi Mea She’arim neighborhood has died and nearly&nbsp;1,500 potential cases have been reported. Non-vaccination rates are high in Israeli areas with large Hasidic populations, including the city of Safed and the town of Kfar Chabad.</p> \n<p>Haredi immunization rates have dipped in recent years as a result of anti-immunization views taking root in the community. Now, as the number of infected Haredim grows, some within the religious Jewish community are initiating new efforts to reach Haredi anti-vaxxers.</p> \n<p>Growing backlash</p> \n<p>Tensions within the community are running high.</p> \n<p>A Crown Heights couple, Sholom and Esther Laine, is suing Yeshiva Oholei Torah – a Lubavitch boys’ school – for not allowing their unvaccinated son to start kindergarten. In the suit, Esther Laine says the school is infringing on her constitutionally protected religious right to claim exemption from the requirement of most schools, including Oholei Torah, that all students be immunized. Several attempts to contact the Laines were unsuccessful.</p> \n<p>“The battle is getting very fierce,” says a Haredi mother, speaking to Haaretz from her home in Lakewood. “People are getting threats if they question vaccinations,” says the mother of three, who asked that her name not be published for fear of being pressured or intimidated by neighbors.</p> \n<p>The ultra-Orthodox towns Monsey and New Square are part of Rockland County, about an hour north of New York City. There are currently 75 confirmed cases of measles and six more suspected.</p> \n<p>In New York City, there are now 24 confirmed measles cases – all in the Hasidic Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Borough Park – says Dr. Jane Zucker at the Department of Health. “This outbreak would not have occurred had the children been vaccinated,” she says.</p> \n<p>Although measles was officially declared eradicated in the United States in 2000, this is not the first outbreak of the disease in the ultra-Orthodox community. In 2013, there was a significant uptick in measles in Williamsburg and Borough Park, with 58 cases reported. There was also another minor outbreak in New York City earlier this year, which resulted in a miscarriage, pneumonia and hospitalizations, according to The New York Daily News.</p> \n<p>Now there is a growing backlash: Those known to be non-vaccinators are being ostracized by fellow Haredim, say members of the community. “People frown upon neighbors who aren’t vaccinating; there is animus toward them,” says Alexander Rapaport, a Hasidic Jew who lives in Borough Park and is founder and director of Masbia, a kosher soup kitchen and food pantry. “You hear there’s someone in that building that doesn’t vaccinate, and now the whole building is having tsuris with them,” he says, using the Yiddish word for trouble.</p> \n<p>Ultra-vaxxers and anti-vaxxers</p> \n<p>Unvaccinated measles carriers convey a significant risk to others who aren’t immunized – either because they are too young or have compromised immune systems. One person sick with measles can spread it to as many as 18 others, public health authorities warn. Children typically get two doses of the MMR vaccine: one between 12 and 15 months; and another between 4 and 6 years. A child who has gotten both shots is believed to be 97 percent protected from the disease, say health experts. Now, health department authorities are urging vaccinations for children as young as 6 months, and to hasten the second dose so as many people as possible are fully protected.</p> \n<p>Rabbis beyond the New York area are now taking steps to prevent the measles from reaching their communities. Last week, the heads of the two main Orthodox rabbinical courts in Chicago issued a letter stating that “nobody has a right to endanger others by not vaccinating their children.” An unvaccinated person exposing other people to measles during an outbreak puts the non-immunized person in the category of someone who actively poses a threat to life, they wrote, using the term rodef (lethal pursuer) – which is a serious violation of Torah law.</p> \n<p>The rabbis urged all schools, playgroups and shuls to ban any unvaccinated child, writing, “This is nothing less than a matter of pikuach nefesh,” referring to the religious law in which preservation of human life overrides virtually all other religious considerations.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, prominent Israeli Haredi rabbis recently issued a strongly worded decree that those who refuse to vaccinate “are causing bloodshed,” according to the ultra-Orthodox newspaper Kikar Hashabbat. Rabbi Moshe Sternbuch, head of Jerusalem’s stringent Edah HaChareidis rabbinical court, issued an order that every father “must ensure that his son and daughter are immunized immediately.”</p> \n<p>However, other influential Haredi rabbis view the issue differently.</p> \n<p>Well-known Jewish legal expert Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetsky and his wife, Temi, are often cited for their anti-immunization stance, which was expressed in a 2014 Baltimore Jewish Times article: “Vaccines are a hoax. It is just big business,” Rabbi Kamenetsky was quoted as saying.</p> \n<p>The rabbi’s status means his views carry weight beyond his own immediate circle. He is also a member of Agudath Israel of America’s Council of Torah Sages, which, along with the Haredi advocacy organization in general, “will not be taking a position on vaccinations or the measles outbreak,” says spokeswoman Leah Zagelbaum.</p> \n<p>Another member of the Council of Torah Sages, Lakewood’s Rabbi Malkiel Kotler, endorses the Lakewood Vaccine Coalition, which was created last March with the aim of advocating on behalf of those who do not want to immunize their children. The coalition’s website, in the meantime, has disappeared and its phone number is out of service. An email elicited no response.</p> \n<p>An anonymous group called PEACH (Parents Teaching and Advocating for our Children’s Health) has circulated an anti-immunization booklet throughout the religious community in the New York area and beyond. In it, an anonymous author claims that “hundreds of thousands of children’s lives have been ruined within hours of vaccines.” The idea that measles is a serious illness is “a fabrication,” it adds.</p> \n<p>There is no identifying information about PEACH in the booklet and, with no online presence or listed phone numbers, the group is untraceable.</p> \n<p>Changing things from the bottom up</p> \n<p>This anonymous spreading of misinformation is frustrating to those who want to see Haredi children fully protected from communicable diseases.</p> \n<p>Blima Marcus is an oncology nurse and president of the Orthodox Jewish Nurses Association. The OJNA is now trying to reach out to religious parents in a personal, informal way and has established an email address for those who want information.</p> \n<p>In just the first few days, “we’ve been contacted by a few people seeking reassurance or clarification on specific vaccines,” Marcus tells Haaretz. The OJNA is planning to hold living-room gatherings soon. These will involve “no physicians, no agendas, no judgment: just frum [religious] nurses coming to listen, talk, answer questions and educate,” she says, adding, “We have 30 nurses from around the states who already volunteered their time to do this in their communities.”</p> \n<p>Dr. Zackary Sholem Berger, an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, has written in Yiddish publications about medical issues in the Orthodox community. He just held a session at a Borough Park health clinic with the goal of hearing the concerns of Haredi doctors, nurses and other medical professionals.</p> \n<p>“To see any sector of my community not vaccinate is horrifying,” says Berger. However, “If you wag your finger at anti-vaccine people, it doesn’t work.” Persuading them “has to come from the bottom up,” adds Berger, who has a doctorate in epidemiology.</p> \n<p>Anti-vaccine views have seemingly become entrenched in some parts of Haredi communities because of aspects of ultra-Orthodox culture.</p> \n<p>There is a general distrust of government authorities that is likely rooted in the Jewish legal prohibition against one Jew turning another into the police, say knowledgeable observers. Hasidic communities were established in Eastern Europe at a time when government authorities themselves persecuted Jews – or at the very least, turned a blind eye to those who did. Historical memory in general is prized in Haredi communities and passed down from one generation to the next, almost like cherished silver Shabbat candlesticks.</p> \n<p>Dangerous influence</p> \n<p>There is also an insularity in Haredi communities – particularly among women, who frequently lack access to the internet – that is viewed as a negative and dangerous influence. As a result, WhatsApp and similar phone-based chat groups are popular among Haredi women, says the OJNA’s Marcus.</p> \n<p>Participants in one WhatsApp group Marcus belongs to said they don’t trust studies because they are funded by pharmaceutical companies, she says. Furthermore, they don’t trust the Food and Drug Administration, which must approve all medications, because they believe “the FDA is in the pocket of pharmaceutical companies,” Marcus adds.</p> \n<p>Haredi communities are also accustomed to relying on themselves rather than the outside world for many things, notes Borough Park’s Rapaport. “They have an off-the-grid mentality, so they don’t call 911” in case of emergency, but call the Orthodox volunteer ambulance corps Hatzalah instead. And instead of calling the police, they contact the volunteer patrol Shomrim – which arrives faster anyway, he says. “It’s a mind-set which allows something like anti-vaccination to spread,” says Rapaport.</p> \n<p>What’s more, he adds, there is a fondness for “old world wisdom” – like when people say: My bubbie [grandmother] and aunt had measles, and they lived to be 90.</p> \n<p>But Marcus cautions that a lot of people talk about the past “as if it was a healthier or safer time – but 100 years ago many people didn’t live past 8 years old.” In the ultra-Orthodox world, “there’s a lot of misinformation as to how things were different in the past,” she says.</p> \n<p>Marcus also notes that alternative medicine is popular among the Haredi community. “There are large pockets of homeopathy followers in Hasidic Williamsburg, in Monroe and in Lakewood,” she says.</p> \n<p>One popular Borough Park chiropractor is distributing pamphlets in his office about the dangers of vaccines. People travel from upstate Rockland County to see him, says Marcus. The chiropractor did not return several messages left for him at his home and office, but the woman answering his office phone acknowledged that they do distribute anti-immunization information.</p> \n<p>Finally, for some Haredi Jews, not immunizing their children is a reflection of their ultimate trust in God. “If we believe we are protected by the One above, we really have nothing to worry about,” the Lakewood mother tells Haaretz. “We try to keep restrengthening our absolute belief that nothing in the world can harm us unless it is the will of God.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by a leading activist in the fight over land rights in the unrecognized Bedouin village of Al-Araqib, leaving a 10-month jail sentence&nbsp;against 69-year-old Sheikh Sayekh Abu Madi'am for trespassing in place.</p> \n<p>The court rejected Abu Madi’am’s argument that the state was criminalizing protests over state policies on Bedouin land claims. He is to begin serving his sentence next month. Bedouin-rights activists claim the decision will have broader implications for residents of the Negev's unrecognized Bedouin villages, which the Israeli government does not recognize and therefore lack any infrastucture.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Abu Madi’am was convicted of 19 counts of trespassing for illegal entry on public land as well as for violating a legal order for resettling on land that had been cleared of residents. The court rejected his claim that legal proceedings on the ownership of land are pending and that he should be allowed to remain on it until a final decision is made.</p> \n<p>“One cannot accept Abu Madi’am’s attempt to couch his request as one of principle, arguing that his acts are part of an ongoing public battle on the part of the Bedouin population in the Negev to settle their status,” Justice Elron said. The judge added that he also could not accept the argument that “historical issues and disputes are not appropriate to be resolved through criminal proceedings.” The justice added: “Criminal activity, including repeated incursion onto land that had been cleared so that residential buildings could be constructed on it, while ignoring the court decisions on the matter exceed the bounds of legitimate protest.”</p> \n<p>Abu Madi’am’s lawyer, Shada Ibn Bari, said in response: “While the issue of the ownership of the land at Al-Araqib is still pending, the Supreme Court has decided to turn tens of thousands of people in the unrecognized villages, who are fighting for a dignified existence in the Negev, into criminals. The court ... has sent a dangerous message to the entire Bedouin community that anyone who dares protest the looting of lands and the demolition of homes and fight for the recognition of the villages will find themselves in detention.”</p> \n<p>The right-wing Regavim organization, which has been engaged in an effort against the unrecognized Bedouin communities, said in response to the ruling: “Al-Araqib has become a symbol of the illegal incursion of Bedouin onto state land, incursions aimed at exhausting the state and trying to seize lands that they never owned by force.”</p> \n<p>For his part, Michael Sfard, a lawyer representing Bedouin residents seeking to remain on the land, called the issue a social problem that goes beyond the case of a specific individual. Abu Madi’am’s case, he said, is one of tens or even hundreds of thousands of Bedouin living on their “historic land in an unrecognized manner.” If he violated the law, then so did the others, he said.</p> \n<p>The chairman of the largely Arab Joint List Knesset faction, Ayman Odeh, accused the authorities of demolishing homes in the village as part of a drive to have “as much land as possible with as few Arabs as possible.” He called Abu Madi’am “a symbol of the non-violent fight on behalf of the rights of the residents to maintain their homes and live on the land of their forefathers.”</p> \n<p>The villagers maintain that they own the bank on which the village is built and were forcible evicted from their land by the Israel Defense Forces in 1950.</p> \n<p>The state argues that the land was taken over by the state in the early 1950s because it had been abandoned and that the attempts to settle it that began in 1998 were illegal. Israeli courts have consistently upheld the state's position.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“After three months of uploading videos to YouTube in English, I went to Mom, excited, and told her I had 13 subscribers,” the Palestinian YouTube vlogger Hannah Ziad says. “My mother looked at me and asked me why I was uploading videos in English. She said that there were already a lot of people doing that in English, but that if I uploaded in Arabic, people would take an interest in my story.”</p> \n<p>Her mother was right on-target. Ziad, now 25, took her advice and today, three years later, she has 740,000 followers on YouTube and a total of 44 million views, as well as a flourishing Instagram page. The viewers, most of them young women, come from across the Arab world – from Qatar and Saudi Arabia to Palestine. By comparison, the YouTube channel of Israel’s commercial Television News Company has 80,000 followers. A Ziad clip in which she jokes about sisterly relations has chalked up two million views. She might soon become known outside the Arab community, too: She’s one of the stars, along with three other YouTubers, of “Upload,” a charming series by Israeli film producer and director Barak Heymann, which will soon start broadcasting on Kan public television.</p> \n<p>Why did you start off vlogging in English?</p> \n<p>Ziad: “I felt that my Arabic wasn’t good enough, that people would think I was a spy because of the way I look. I was afraid that people in my neighborhood would laugh at me and criticize me. I was really scared when I did my first video in Arabic. But by the end of that day, which was also my 22nd birthday, I already had 1,000 followers. Since then I realized that I need to listen to Mom.”</p> \n<p>That fear-driven moment was also the genesis of the greeting Ziad is identified with: She begins every clip with a cordial “Ahlan, ahlan” – “hello,” in Arabic – accompanied by a small hand gesture. “‘Ahlan, ahlan’ is a terrific motto,” she explains. “It’s how I open every video. The fact that I was scared helped me.”</p> \n<p>Ziad, who holds dual citizenship – her mother is American – lives in an affluent neighborhood across the Green Line. She doesn’t want to reveal its name, or even say what city it’s situated in, because in the past another female vlogger, from Jenin, was hassled by neighbors. In her clips, she states only that she’s broadcasting from “occupied Palestine.”</p> \n<p>Ziad has been uploading videos to YouTube for the past three years. Until a year ago, she made a reasonable living from the money Google, the owner of YouTube, paid her based on the number of views. The videos she produced with her home camera were watched by an audience of hundreds of thousands and earned her 6,000 shekels a month (about $1,400). But the good times have passed: Google has revised its algorithms, and these days she gets paid much less. The views generate only enough for pocket money, she says.</p> \n<p>The inspiration to become a web star came from the British vlogger Zoella, whose YouTube success made her a millionaire. “Zoella is always talking about the clothes she bought,” Ziad notes. “I thought that I could also make videos like that. I’ll shop during the day and at night I’ll video what I bought. I thought that what turns me on would do the same for others.”</p> \n<p>Others who have influenced her are “Two Sisters Tube,” mischievous sisters from Gaza who specialize in do-it-yourself videos and who have about 1.5 million followers. One of their classic clips sets out to examine what it’s like to eat spicy falafel with Nutella hazelnut spread. “They’re really exciting,” Ziad says enthusiastically about the sisters, “especially because people don’t expect videos like that from women who wear the hijab and live in the Gaza Strip.”</p> \n<p>Ziad has two YouTube channels. The primary one, with half-a-million followers, focuses on “tips, fashion and whatever I feel like doing.” The second one, called “Everything about Hannah,” with 240,000 followers, deals with “things I do, if you want to get to know me better.”</p> \n<p>In one video, Hannah asked viewers to tell her how old they are – most of them are apparently 10 to 15 years old. In general, the responses she gets are variations on “I love you,” followed by a slew of hearts. She vlogs on her first channel once a week, generally focusing on fashion and grooming – for example, how to comb one's hair quickly before school, how to make a crown of shells or how to apply makeup. The videos often slide into commercial content. Among her sponsors, Ziad says, is a Korean-style cosmetics company – and sure enough, in one of her clips, she demonstrates how to remove blackheads on the nose using one of the firm’s products, ponders whether to recommend it and in the end gives her okay.</p> \n<p>Sponsors also lurk in the list of accessories she recommends taking on a trip abroad. It includes glue for false eyelashes. I’m not among the target audience for false eyelashes, but I can attest that the secret of the videos’ allure lies in Ziad’s natural, heart-melting charm. It also comes across in the videos that don’t deal with grooming, like the one about an inclination to laziness. In it, we see Ziad lying in bed and trying to turn off the light without getting up, by throwing cushions at the light switch. Finally she shouts to her sister to save her.</p> \n<p>According to Ziad, her videos are not improvised but actually have scripts. The photographers are her mother and her sisters, although sometimes neighbors also volunteer to do the camera work. “People in my neighborhood like vloggers,” Ziad says. “They come and ask if they can be in the next video. Usually I ask my sisters to help, but they’re getting fed up with it. So these days the neighbors help even more.”</p> \n<p>Her second channel is a kind of video blog in which she talks about her life. For example, about a family trip to Jericho, focusing on the hotel and pool there, or about her attempt (which failed) to upload a daily photo to Instagram. A female commenter from Syria wrote, “I love you,” Ziad relates. “It’s madness. There’s a war going on there. How do they even have internet?” she asks, astonished. “And if they do, is this what they watch? I was glad she wrote me, but the whole thing was also weird. I responded by telling her that I love her.”</p> \n<p>Maybe they have fashion vloggers there, too?</p> \n<p>“I never thought of that. But how can they even upload a video? It’s a war zone.”</p> \n<p>Ahead of the annual Ramadan month-long dawn-to-dusk fast (this year, it fell during May-June), many of Ziad’s videos deal with the holiday, including an attempt to create a series of (cute) horror movies to help pass the time. In the wake of the “vlogmas” trend – Christmas-oriented video blogs – Ziad says she tried to create a “vlogdan” oriented toward Ramadan. “I photographed myself preparing things, what to eat ahead of the fast. There were good responses,” she says.</p> \n<p>A visit to Tel Aviv to meet with Israeli vloggers proved enjoyable. She had a cordial conversation with local YouTube star Shachar Soikis (180,000 followers), she recalls. She assumes that he thought she was an American when they met, because of her English, and was flabbergasted when he saw her channel afterward for the first time and realized she’s Palestinian. “I hope there will be more Palestinian vloggers,” she says.</p> \n<p>Ziad also has admirers off screen. During our meeting in a caf&eacute; – for which she arrives wearing false eyelashes and a pink hat – someone recognizes her and comes over. “In Arab cities, people sometimes don’t let me leave,” she relates. “In the Old City of Jerusalem, with those narrow alleys, they can really close me in. I can only pass unnoticed if I hide myself somehow. So it’s more convenient for me to meet in Israeli areas, where I’m not so well known. It’s mostly girls who come over and want a picture with me, but at parties I go to as part of my livelihood [her name appears on invitations to help sell tickets], it’s mostly boys.”</p> \n<p>Additional revenues come from sponsoring ads of Palestinian, Israeli and international companies, and from showing up as a YouTube celeb at the above-mentioned glittering parties – especially in sin city: Ramallah. For half a year Ziad hosted a television program about technology on the Musawa channel. Still, to pay the bills she also works as a secretary in an Israeli hotel that's part of an international chain.</p> \n<p>She won’t accept sponsorship from just any company, she says: “When a company approaches me to become a sponsor, I check to make sure they’re not connected to any political organization. If I find out that it’s something political – Palestinian or Jewish – I won’t work with them.”</p> \n<p>What do you mean?</p> \n<p>“For example, I didn’t accept Hoodies [sweatshirt manufacturer] as a sponsor, because of their ad with [Israeli supermodel] Bar Refaeli in a burka. I didn’t like that. They say that to take off the burka means freedom? They should have made clips of a woman with a burka and a woman without a burka shaking hands, because each chose what’s best for them. Or a guy with a kippa shaking hands with a guy who’s not wearing a kippa. If an Arab woman wants to wear a burka, that’s her right, just like I have the right to wear what I want. Should a Jewish woman tell me, a Muslim, what to wear?”</p> \n<p>Ziad says she is a YouTube devotee. “I like to express myself. Thanks to YouTube, I feel that I’ve built up my character. The girls in high school were abusive to me. I don’t wish on anyone what I went through. They spread lies about me, they tried to ruin my life. Today those same girls, who wouldn’t even say ‘Good morning’ to me before, brag that they went to school with me.”</p> \n<p>The ugly duckling story?</p> \n<p>“Something like that.”</p> \n<p>Intifada or eyeliner</p> \n<p>Hannah Ziad’s success story rests on a tragic foundation. Eight years ago, her father, the Palestinian entrepreneur Ziad Jilani, was killed by Israeli Border Police. Amira Hass published several articles in this newspaper about how Jilani died. What emerges is that after prayers on Friday, June 11, 2010, Jilani, who owned a successful business selling massage chairs, started to make his way home. On the way, he called his wife so she would get the girls ready for a trip to the beach. But stones thrown at police officers on a busy street in the Wadi Joz neighborhood of East Jerusalem struck his car. Frightened, Ziad tried to flee, lost control of his car and wounded four Border Policemen lightly. Thinking he was a terrorist, the Israeli forces started firing in all directions, even though the street was packed with people on a Friday afternoon. A 5-year-old girl in a car was shot and injured. Jilani turned into an alley where relatives lived, got out of the car and started to run. Policemen pursued him and shot him in the back, and he collapsed. Even though he no longer posed a threat, a Border Policeman shot him in the head twice at close range.</p> \n<p>The media reported that it had been a ramming attack. The Justice Ministry unit that investigates police officers decided to close the case, and three Supreme Court justices ruled that it was a reasonable decision. Moira, Jilani’s widow, received compensation, but never got an apology for her husband’s killing, which the family characterizes as “murder.”</p> \n<p>Thus, at 17, Hannah had to cope with her father’s death, with accusations of terrorism and with the results of the proceedings taken against the shooter. Her schoolwork suffered, she recalls, and her mother was devastated. But it was her father’s death that led her to become a fashion vlogger. Her professional name, too, comes from her father’s first name.</p> \n<p>“I was inconsolable after my father’s death,” she says. “The YouTube videos kept me going. I was already traumatized by the abuse I took in school, because my Arabic wasn’t good. And then came my father’s murder. I had to get it all out of my gut, and it was an opportunity to talk the way I wanted to.”</p> \n<p>Making fashion clips for the internet seems like an unusual way to mourn.</p> \n<p>“That was my way. That’s how I fight for the place of my happiness. I want to talk about good things, there’s no need to think about bad things. There are religious people and pro-Palestinians who want to use me like a playing card, but I don’t want to have anything to do with politics, only to talk about hairdos. There’s a minority who are angry at me, who wrote ‘You are not a Palestinian.’ Or, ‘Why don’t you tell people what’s being done to the Palestinians?’ But this isn’t a YouTube news channel. I don’t think that just because someone is a Palestinian, he has to be political and occupy himself with the intifada. A Palestinian can simply live, too.”</p> \n<p>The father’s tragic demise led to two decisions in the family that were opposites, to a certain degree: Ziad became a fashion star, while her mother, who wore a hijab during the days of mourning, decided to go on wearing it.</p> \n<p>Hannah recounts that, “My sisters and I were frightened when we saw Mother in the hijab. My father fasted during Ramadan, but none of us was actually religious. Mom always went around in short clothes, and we were angry at her over the change. In time, we started to get used to it. But since she started wearing the hijab, it’s been harder to be in Israeli areas, especially in Jerusalem. She feels more comfortable in Tel Aviv, which is less racist toward us.”</p> \n<p>“After the death I was against the whole world,” says Hannah’s mother, Moira, 53. “I fought to prove to everyone that Ziad was innocent. I lost touch with the girls somewhat. They thought I wanted to get them to wear the hijab, too. I said that Father wouldn’t have agreed to that. I’m a believer, but religion is less important to me – it’s people who are important to me. Even though I chose Islam [she converted before her husband was killed], I don’t agree with everything. I am a feminist, and I’m irritated by people who don’t shake my hand and don’t look me in the eyes. I don’t trust them. I pray, but I meditate more. It’s all the same thing, really.</p> \n<p>“From my point of view, to wear the hijab is activism,” she adds. “When I sit on a bus now, no one sits next to me, except for older Mizrahi [Jews], who saw Muslim women in their childhood. The Russians don’t care, either. One time I was on the light-rail train [in Jerusalem] and an American woman with six children and a stroller got on. I was sitting and there were four empty places next to me. They all stood and looked at me like I had a bomb. Are you stupid or something? If I had a bomb, you should have gotten off. I guess that’s how blacks in America probably feel.”</p> \n<p>Or ultra-Orthodox Jews in places with anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>Moira: “Exactly. I never felt hatred like that [directed at me] until I started wearing the hijab.”</p> \n<p>Before Jilani’s death, the family was thinking they might try their luck in the United States. “Dad wanted to go to America, and I thought about going to Tel Aviv University,” says Hannah Ziad, who speaks some Hebrew and prefers hanging out in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. “In western Jerusalem, everything is fine until they hear you speaking Arabic. I don’t like that. I prefer to go to Dizengoff [Street, in Tel Aviv] or to Jaffa.”</p> \n<p>Even though all members of the family have dual citizenship and could move to the United States, it’s more important for Moira to be part of Palestinian society and to continue to foster Ziad Jilani’s legacy. “Mom’s sister [in the United States] keeps saying we should leave. They think there are tanks in the streets here,” Ziad says.</p> \n<p>Where will you be in another five years?</p> \n<p>Ziad: “If there’s no war, I’m here. If there is, go look for me in Texas. But there’s no doubt that I will always want to live next to Mom. Even if I marry, I won’t leave and I will go on being with her.”</p> \n<p>What would you say to the person who killed your father if you met him?</p> \n<p>“I don’t care about him. Why give something to an evil person? I don’t want to think about him. I just think he’s not humane, to destroy the life of a person who never did anything to you. He took the life of someone who helped me so much and inspired me.”</p> \n<p>'Still a Muslim'</p> \n<p>Moira is very supportive of her daughter’s occupation. “I am very happy with anything that will allow my daughter to move ahead and makes her happy,” she says, adding, “I’m proud of her.” Still, she admits that she herself rarely watches the videos. “I don’t speak Arabic well enough to understand them,” she explains. “People call and say they like Hannah. On the street, people say to me, ‘You’re Hannah’s mother, give me an autograph, take a picture with me.’ I explain that I am not Hannah. It’s a bit awkward. I’m happy for her success but also worried. I also hear about cases of ‘honor’ murders in the Arab society. Women in certain areas here have to cope not only with the Israeli occupation but also with the male occupation.”</p> \n<p>Hannah Ziad doesn’t like to talk about the criticism she gets; Moira is more forthcoming: “Some of my husband’s family were against what Hannah does on YouTube,” she says. “They called and asked me to demand that she remove certain videos. I even thought about moving to Pisgat Ze’ev [a Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem], where it’s cheaper to live and where it would be more convenient for Hannah. But Hannah didn’t agree, she said there would be racists there, that there would be a problem with my hijab. I said I would wear a hat, and she said I must not take off the hijab for anyone. I was very proud, and also surprised. To those who don’t like the way she dresses, I say, 'Who cares what she wears?’ Look at how respectful she is of people. At least she’s still a Muslim. If people keep pressuring her, she will become an atheist. I told them, you’re not going through what I went through since my husband died. Don’t mess with me.”</p> \n<p>One of Ziad’s most interesting videos was shot in 2015, in both Arabic and English versions, and drew 900,000 views. In it she reveals 50 facts about herself. It starts off calmly. The first fact is that her feet are size 37 (U.S. size 7), though she buys size 38 shoes. Her favorite color, not surprisingly, is pink, but she also likes green. But when she gets to fact No. 11, she matter-of-factly relates how her father was killed and that the person who shot him is free. She then proceeds to inform viewers that she likes sushi and that her family is raising 10 dogs and 13 cats (now they have 17).</p> \n<p>This is characteristic of the fusion Ziad creates, which attaches importance to even the small things in life. Of her love for animals, she notes that in the past, Arabs didn’t raise dogs, but today it’s a trend. “Many young Arabs today are buying dogs,” she says. “But it’s more to show that you have money or that they can protect themselves. We in the family usually adopt from the street.”</p> \n<p>Ziad is currently working with a designer from Bethlehem on a fashion line for an online store. “I want tops and sweaters, merchandise branded for the channel.” She’s thinking about studying fashion and dreams of becoming a fashion designer. A year ago, she was flown to a Google YouTubers conference in London. Now she’s dreaming of organizing a Palestinian version of “Rewind Israel,” which sums up each year in the country in Hebrew via YouTube.</p> \n<p>“Why not do ‘Rewind Palestine’?” she asks. “We could also combine, and do Palestine vloggers versus Israel vloggers.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>When World War I ended, a hundred years ago this month, inhabitants of continental Europe confronted destruction on a vast scale. Some nine million soldiers and another six million civilians had been killed in a mass slaughter that dragged on for four years. Seven million POWs returned home. But the borders of the countries also changed unrecognizably. Four empires, which had dominated much of the Continent’s area, disappeared from the map almost in one fell swoop. The German kaiser, Wilhelm II, fled to Holland by train and devoted his remaining years to wood carving. At the same time, the Austro-Hungarian Empire also collapsed. Emperor Charles I left his country and settled in Switzerland. The last Ottoman sultan remained on the throne until 1922, but his empire disintegrated at the end of the war. Russia’s czar, deposed already in 1917, was executed about a year and a half later.</p> \n<p>These empires were multinational and multilingual. For those living in the post-imperial era, it’s hard to comprehend the shock generated by their sudden disappearance. The Habsburg Empire had existed for almost 500 years, and seemed to be eternal. “In this vast empire everything stood firmly and immovably in its appointed place, and at its head was the aged emperor; and were he to die, everyone knew (or believed) another would come to take his place, and nothing would change in the well-regulated order,” wrote Stefan Zweig, in “The World of Yesterday.”</p> \n<p>But that isn’t what happened. The map of Europe was redrawn. The Habsburg Empire broke up into a number of nation-states: Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the union of countries that would be called Yugoslavia all declared independence, and after them, Poland. Austria, and Germany also became nation-states, as did Turkey.</p> \n<p>For many of the citizens of postwar nation-states, the collapse of the empires was a positive development. The arrogant, corrupt royal houses left the stage of history, to be supplanted by fresh states with flag, anthem and soccer team. European peoples who had fought for independence for more than half a century were at least freed from foreign rule. Self-determination became the definitive principle in international relations. In the areas that had been under the control of the former Ottoman Empire, too, several national movements also began to move toward the goal of independence – among them the Zionist movement.</p> \n<p>Yet, was the victory of the nation-states over the empire really such a great achievement for the human spirit? These new entities were soon brawling with one another. But the national minorities who remained imprisoned in hostile nation-states – among them, Greeks in Turkey, Germans in Czechoslovakia – were especially bitter. Not one of the nation-states established after the war in Europe was ethnically homogeneous, and about one-third of their citizens, on average, were members of minority groups. Thus were planted the seeds that led to World War II.</p> \n<p>The Jews suffered acutely from the emergence of the nation-states, which effectively sealed their fate in Europe. It wasn’t the German character but the nation-states that gave rise to their calamity. Zweig emphasizes the great feeling of security the Jews felt in the multinational Habsburg Empire. “Having resided for more than two hundred years in the Imperial city [Vienna], the Jews encountered there an easygoing people, inclined to conciliation,” he wrote. The Jewish situation in the German and Ottoman Empires before the world wars could be described in similar terms. Only the empires facilitated their diaspora existence, within whose framework the Jews achieved some of the high points in their history.</p> \n<p>Between 1918 and 1945, the new nation-states went about getting rid of their minorities. The Greeks were evicted from Turkey, the Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia and the Jews were annihilated or immigrated to Palestine – whose indigenous Palestinian majority was soon also expelled.</p> \n<p>The attempt to create ethnically homogeneous states gave rise to some of the greatest disasters in the last century. The cultural diversity that existed in the imperial metropolises was erased and has never been restored. The national conflicts did not end after World War II. The disintegration of the multinational empires kicked off an endless series of wars, among them those in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>Studies in recent years have underscored more than in the past the positive aspects of the multinational empires, including that of the Ottomans. In his 2017 book, “Jerusalem 1900: The Holy City in the Age of Possibilities,” Vincent Lemire depicts the waning days of that empire as a time of prosperity. A fluid urban society existed in Jerusalem, and relative harmony prevailed among its various communities. In contrast to its usual image, the Ottoman Empire wasn’t all that backward. In fact, it was the last power that succeeded in ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>The empires were monarchies, but in some cases their governments were subject to a constitution. Furthermore, before the Great War, ideas had been put forward about how to preserve the multinational structure while also vesting them with a democratic, even socialist structure. Marxist thinker Otto Bauer, for example, for example, advocated the preservation of the multinational structure of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, while ensuring cultural autonomy for its various peoples.</p> \n<p>Curse of nationalism</p> \n<p>In the present era, we are witnessing renewed outbursts of nationalism in Europe and elsewhere. Poland and Hungary have become the leaders of this trend on the Continent, and a nationalist wave is washing over Austria, too. But it’s not only happening in Europe: The nation-state law in Israel is an expression of this outburst too. The curse of nationalism is still with us – although there are alternatives to it. As citizens of nation-states, it is easy for us to imagine history as though the current political structure is the most natural one for the human race. Yet, for most of history humankind has lived in political frameworks other than nation-states, such as coalitions of tribes, city-states, sultanates and above all, empires. At least since ancient Egypt, empires have offered the most stable form of political organization. The nation-state, in contrast, is a new experiment, and it is in large measure turning out to be unsuccessful.</p> \n<p>The nation-state is thus raising its head anew today, but behind the nationalist bluster lurks weakness. It’s not at all certain that contemporary political whirlwinds will lead to the strengthening of nation-states in the long run. It’s very possible that the future lies with multinational empires – which is not all that bad. The creation of almost 200 screeching nation-states has turned out to be a particularly poor way to cope with such global challenges as climate change, population movements and economic gaps. Maybe the empires knew how to do it better.</p>",

That would include marriages performed by Conservative rabbis as well as Orthodox rabbis who are not approved by the Rabbinate.

By contrast, couples who wed in ceremonies that are not halakhic are not considered by the Rabbinate to be married.</p> \n<p>The bill defeated on Wednesday was submitted by opposition lawmaker Aliza Lavie, who heads the religion and state caucus in the Knesset. It was just seven votes short of passing a first reading.

        "text":["<p>One single tourism company did more this week to end the occupation than anything the Zionist left has ever done. Airbnb is threatening to strike a blow at the illegal livelihood of 200 settler families. Another 200 companies like Airbnb and the settlement project will begin to feel it in the pocketbook, and then its participants will ask, together with other Israelis, whether it’s worth it. There is no better news than this. Thanks and blessings to this international accommodations network, which after inventing a successful tourism enterprise, was courageous enough to take part in a just political initiative. Airbnb explained that it doesn’t need to profit from land from which people have been uprooted. Is there a more just statement than this?</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>But that’s not all it did. It also revealed to the world, unintentionally, the best of the lies, the extortion, the demagoguery and the double standards of the settlers and their supporters in the government. When they yell “Holocaust,” because of bed and breakfasts, clearly they’ve run out of arguments. “Anti-Semitism,” “selection,” “persecution” – this time for a fistful of dollars going to the pockets of a handful of vacation profiteers on stolen land, trading in stolen goods. This is what the dispossession project is: It begins with a divine promise and ends with bed and breakfast. Jacuzzi on occupied land, vacation across from a refugee camp, relax with a view of roadblocks and have a glass of wine at an illegal outpost as the sun sets against the pastoral backdrop of nighttime Israeli army abductions – could there be a more galling project?</p> \n<p>Listen to the outcry: “Two years ago my wife Kalila and I established our bed and breakfast, “Ruth’s House,” in Sde Boaz, right across from Bethlehem,” Kalila Kelman’s husband told Israel Hayom in what could be read as a particularly amusing parody. “This is a bed and breakfast we built with our own hands and is intended just for couples, without children. Over the past two years people have come to us from all over the world, to forget the daily craziness and get connected to themselves. The bed and breakfast is a place of dialogue, conversation between people and connection between human beings, of for and not against, and this is what the boycott is trying to destroy,” he said.</p> \n<p>We choke back tears, our hearts break. Forget the daily craziness opposite imprisoned Bethlehem. Get up at dawn and head for roadblock 300, to see the day laborers crammed in like cattle – connections between people.</p> \n<p>The Kelmans remind the boycotters, those ingrates, that they have pacemakers made in Israel; that there are Palestinians who do their shopping at the main intersection of the Etzion Bloc in the West Bank, that boycotts for political reasons are not allowed. All the lying propaganda, which exhorts a boycott of Iran and Hamas, but not the settlements.</p> \n<p>In a spectacular show of obtuseness, the heads of the Yesha Council of settlements called for a boycott of Airbnb. The Kelmans, who live in the apartheid entity opposite the separation barrier, say that the boycott is racism. Locking up the Aida refugee camp across from them – that’s humaneness. Boycotting those who are the reason why the Aida refugee camp is a cage – that’s racism. The general in the war against the boycott, Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan, revealed that this is a “political decision,” and the head of the Beit El local council reminded us that “once again, selection is being perpetrated against Jews.” A settlement that causes terrible suffering to their neighbors in Jalazone, one of the most destitute refugee camps in the West Bank, dares to talk about selection. There’s no limit, no boundary; when it comes to the settlements there’s never any boundary.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Boycott Airbnb, Unless You're Good With anti-Semitism&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Netanyahu Is Partying Like It’s 1998 | Analysis</p> \n<p>Airbnb’s decision is a source of schadenfreude vis a vis the settlers. Any non-violent strike against them holds hope, because this is apparently the only way to end the occupation. But the feeling is short-lived, because the propaganda machines are sure to thwart the decision by various means, including the threat of boycott. Let’s hope that Airbnb doesn’t backtrack. It might show the way for other companies. Thanks to Airbnb, we’ve entered a new battleground: private vacation sites, completely lacking in legitimacy, as the new banner of the settlement project. Thank you, Airbnb, not only for the courage for which you’ll yet pay the price – but also for moving the conflict from our right to the land to our right to a bed and breakfast.</p>",

His Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, had been due to take part but stayed in Israel to deal with the crisis in his coalition government.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We fully embrace and support the [European Union's] uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism. The rise of anti-Semitism worries us. As we know from history, it has often signaled future disasters to all mankind,&quot; the letter states.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;However, the EU also stands for human rights and has to protect them as forcefully as it fights anti-Semitism. This fight against anti-Semitism should not be instrumentalized to suppress legitimate criticism of Israel’s occupation and severe violations of Palestinian human rights.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The signatories accuse Netanyahu of suggesting an equivalence between anti-Israel criticism and anti-Semitism.

        "text":["<p>Earlier this month, I toured Ramallah, East Jerusalem, and the Bethlehem area with a group of over 30 rabbis, educators, lay leaders, executives, and philanthropists from across the denominational and political spectrum.</p> \n<p>It was a powerful, intense experience facilitated by Encounter, an organization that brings American Jewish leaders into direct contact with Palestinians for an on-the-ground perspective of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> \n<p>Over the course of the four-day trip, our group asked many of the Palestinians with whom we met what they hoped to gain by speaking with us. Some thought we might be able to influence others on their behalf - whether it was the U.S. Jewish community, the American government, or even Israelis - whether at large, or in positions of power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Most of all, though, it seemed to us that they simply wanted the dignity that comes from being heard. Ironically, that is something we, American Jews, are increasingly looking for as well.</p> \n<p>We, the vast liberal majority of Jewish Americans, have been increasingly marginalized in the face of a rapidly developing realpolitik connecting the Netanyahu government and the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>To be clear: we certainly benefit from far more privilege in our lives than the Palestinians we met. Still, our conversations caused me to reflect on how we could begin to relate to their feeling of being left behind.</p> \n<p>The Saturday before our trip was the day Robert Bowers murdered 11 people at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue. In choosing a Jewish target, Bowers had repeatedly and explicitly expressed hostility towards HIAS, the Jewish immigrant and refugee advocacy organization that, since Trump emerged as a candidate, has forcefully opposed his anti-immigrant policy and rhetoric.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Pittsburgh Massacre: Netanyahu’s Diplomats Add Insult to Injury by Defending Trump and Implicating the Left</p> \n<p>From Bethlehem, we read reports of President Trump’s controversial visit to Pittsburgh, where most members of the local community and its Jewish organizations support HIAS’ values and programs and opposed his visit to their grieving community. The president was faced with Jewish demonstrators holding signs reading, &quot;You are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you cease your assault on immigrants and refugees.&quot;</p> \n<p>But Trump was welcomed by Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer. Neither Trump nor Dermer offered a reflection or critique of how the atmosphere promoted by Trump's own incendiary anti-immigrant rhetoric may have contributed to Bowers’ radicalization. Instead, they pointed to Trump’s friendship with the State of Israel.</p> \n<p>To many, this was implicit confirmation that Trump and Netanyahu prioritize that relationship over their relationship with the American Jewish community.</p> \n<p>Under Netanyahu's leadership, Israel clearly does share more common ground with the Trump administration than it does with most American Jews. Notable examples include the scuttling of the Iran deal, the relocation of the U.S.embassy to Jerusalem, and the shuttering of the Palestinian diplomatic offices in Washington, D.C. In contrast, most American Jews supported the Iran deal and continue to support an active American role in facilitating the negotiation of a two state solution.</p> \n<p>If anything, both Trump and Netanyahu share a sense that the concerns of the mainstream American Jewish community are more fictitious than real, ginned up by Jewish liberal elites for the sake of partisan politics.</p> \n<p>The day before Ambassador Dermer welcomed Trump to Pittsburgh, MK Naftali Bennett, Israel's Diaspora Affairs Minister, even expressed skepticism about the legitimacy of ADL statistics showing a spike in American anti-Semitic activity since Trump became president. Instead of listening to the alarm about basic safety expressed by a key U.S. Jewish organization, the Israeli government dismissed it as &quot;fake news.&quot;</p> \n<p>Ironically, our trip also highlighted how the realpolitik pushing American Jews to the margins is also further silencing Palestinians.</p> \n<p>That same week, reports emerged describing warming relations between Israel and the Arab Gulf states, backgrounded by shared concerns over Iran, with meetings between a range of high-ranking government representatives regarding joint water policy, security and economic cooperation, and even the construction of a transnational freight railway.</p> \n<p>These initiatives, part of building an anti-Iran coalition, are key to America’s Mideast foreign policy interests. And now, as President Trump has bluntly affirmed, he’s willing to work for those interests, along with lucrative arms deals with the Saudis, to the point of loudly standing with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite clear evidence that he directly ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump explicitly cited Israel’s wellbeing as part of his justification for doing so.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the past any Israeli-Gulf state cooperation would have been stymied by long-standing Arab insistence that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict be resolved before diplomatic overtures could proceed.</p> \n<p>It is, then, probably no coincidence that America freezing out Palestinian diplomats coincided with remarkable statements from Gulf leaders that closer ties to Israel should no longer depend on a final peace settlement, but should develop alongside an &quot;ongoing process.&quot;</p> \n<p>In reality, this means continuing the status quo indefinitely, as intolerable as it is for the Palestinians who live its reality on the ground, unrepresented in the far-off negotiations between international elites. And again, mainstream U.S. Jewish positions - deeply skeptical about unilateral moves not based on a two state solution - no longer have much traction in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>As we had expected, much of what we heard from the Palestinians with whom we met during our week in the West Bank was deeply challenging. We grappled with the possibility that some of the most fundamental disagreements that emerged are simply unbridgeable.</p> \n<p>At the same time, I am even more convinced of the critical need to maintain these points of contact.</p> \n<p>For one thing, despite whatever fundamental differences there may be, American Jews and the Palestinian people both know that the status quo is a broken vessel. It deprives Palestinians of their dignity and liberty, and, unchecked, is a danger to the long-term health of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.</p> \n<p>Perhaps even more essential, though, is the basic human need to have someone who listens. We need to recommit ourselves to that sort of listening, especially now that we know, on some level, what it feels like to go unheard.</p> \n<p>Avraham Bronstein is rabbi of&nbsp;The Hampton Synagogue&nbsp;in Westhampton Beach, NY.

That same day, it rejected an appeal by Sheikh&nbsp;Sayekh Abu Madi'am, who was sentenced to 10 months in jail for trespassing because he insisted on returning to the land in the Negev from which he had been forcibly evicted.</p> \n<p>And on Wednesday, the High Court of Justice rejected a petition by 104 residents of Jerusalem’s Silwan neighborhood, allowing the settler organization Ateret Cohanim to resume proceedings to evict some 700 Palestinians from their homes.</p> \n<p>This series of decisions from the past week alone shows that Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked has completed her revolution. The High Court decision in Silwan is at best a rubber stamp for injustice, endowed with legal and moral flexibility; at worst, the court is leading the conservative and reactionary charge, both legally and in Israeli society more generally.</p> \n<p>Wednesday’s ruling on the Silwan petition, written by Justice Daphne Barak-Erez, is quite thin. Its 22 pages summarize a legal and historical case that goes back 120 years.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Silwan, a model for oppression | Haaretz Editorial ■&nbsp;Israel to open Jewish heritage center in Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israel must explain how East Jerusalem land was transferred to right-wing NGO, top court rules&nbsp;■ The justice minister's anti-democratic revolution | Haaretz Editorial</p> \n<p>The petition challenged a 2002 decision by the Justice Ministry’s office of the administrator general to hand land that had been owned by Jews until 1948, but which is today home to 700 Palestinians, over to three members of Ateret Cohanim.</p> \n<p>After first rejecting a request by the settlers and the state to dismiss the petition out of hand, the ruling detailed a series of flaws in the administrator general’s conduct. For instance, Barak-Erez wrote, the administrator, formerly knows as the Custodian of Absentee Property, released the land to Ateret Cohanim without even bothering to inform the residents who had lived there for decades, some of whom had even purchased their homes.</p> \n<p>She also confirmed that the administrator never investigated whether the land’s legal classification under the laws of the Ottoman Empire – the ruling power at the time Jews purchased it – even allowed the land to be turned over. Only in the final stages of the legal process did the state start looking into this complex question, the justice bemoans, and there’s still no definitive answer to it.</p> \n<p>Yet despite all these problems, her bottom line was that the High Court is the wrong place to investigate these factual arguments, and that the problems didn’t stem from the way the administrator acted, but rather “lie in the statutory arrangement.” Therefore, she rejected the petition.</p> \n<p>As a result, the dozens of suits Ateret Cohanim has filed to evict the Palestinian residents will be resumed in the coming weeks.</p> \n<p>At the end of the ruling, Barak-Erez paid some lip service, writing, “Evicting people who have lived on this land for decades – some of them without even knowing that the land belongs to others – creates a human problem.” She then proposed that the state provide “a solution” for those evicted from their homes, perhaps hinting at the generous “solutions” – in the form of either financial compensation or alternative housing – that have been given to settlers who took over privately owned Palestinian land in the West Bank and were forced to move.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Barak-Erez doesn’t know this, but the Palestinian families evicted from Silwan will be required to pay hundreds of thousands of shekels to the settlers after their eviction, in compensation for the costs of the legal proceedings and in rent for all the years they lived there.</p> \n<p>Every brand-new intern in every court in Jerusalem known that when it comes to land laws, there are two classes of citizens. Palestinians, and only them, can be declared as absentees, whose land can be given to others. And only Jews can regain property that they owned before the 1948 War of Independence. This legal and moral injustice is evident in every case in which a Palestinian family is fighting eviction proceedings by a settler organization.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the judges, bureaucrats and attorneys will have to ask themselves how they operated within this warped system. Did they grease the wheels, or did they try here and there to put a spoke in them, to ask questions and prevent an injustice?</p> \n<p>With regard to the current Supreme Court justices, the answer seems clear.</p>",

In 1899, back when the Ottoman Empire still ruled the region, the land on which that neighborhood was built was registered with Jerusalem’s sharia court as belonging to a Jewish trust.</p> \n<p>In 2001, the Jerusalem District Court approved a decision by the government’s administrator general to appoint three members of Ateret Cohanim to run the trust. That effectively gave the organization control over the homes of 70 Palestinian families comprising about 700 people altogether.</p> \n<p>Ateret Cohanim, which works to move Jews into East Jerusalem, has so far evicted two families and wants to evict others. But the families have waged a lengthy legal battle against the process, arguing that the transfer of the land to Ateret Cohanim was flawed in numerous ways.</p> \n<p>The families argued that under Ottoman law, the land in question was classified as Miri land – a classification that would have enabled the original trust to own only the buildings, not the land. Since the original buildings were destroyed long ago, the trust no longer has any claim to the land, the petition argued.</p> \n<p>In their ruling, Justices Daphne Barak-Erez, Anat Baron and Yosef Elron accepted some of the petitioners’ arguments. For instance, it criticized the administrator general for transferring the land to Ateret Cohanim without notifying the residents or even bothering to find out who lived there.</p> \n<p>“We can’t continue without expressing surprise at the state’s assumption that a decision so significant to the lives of hundreds of people – ‘liberating’ the property on which they have lived for many years [and transferring it] to other hands – isn’t the kind of thing that ought to be publicized through reasonable means,” Barak-Erez wrote on behalf of the court. “Even the precise identity of the property’s residents wasn’t known, and that’s the interpretation kindest to the state.”</p> \n<p>“This is one of those cases in which considerations of efficiency and decency clash,” she added, noting that informing the residents would not only have been the decent thing to do, but could also have helped “clarify questions that were likely to arise” about the decision.</p> \n<p>The justices declined to rule on the question of whether the land had originally been classified as Miri land, saying it’s difficult to answer that question now, more than 100 years later, and noting that even the state had changed its mind on this question. The issue does require clarification and “may even require the appointment of experts” to investigate, they wrote. But they said the High Court isn’t the right venue for determining how the Ottomans classified the land.</p> \n<p>Despite the many problems they cited, the justices said they found no grounds for intervening in the administrator general’s decision, since the problems “lie in the statutory arrangement and are not the result of the administrator’s judgment.”</p> \n<p>But they stressed that should Ateret Cohanim launch eviction proceedings against the residents, the Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court, which will hear those proceedings, will have to rule on whether the land is in fact Miri land before approving the evictions.</p> \n<p>Barak-Erez closed her ruling by noting the hardship residents would suffer by being evicted from homes where they had lived for decades and which some had even purchased. She therefore urged the state to compensate anyone evicted.</p> \n<p>Though the evictions, assuming the trust indeed owns the land, are legal, she wrote, “Evicting people who have lived on this land for decades – some of them without even knowing that the land belongs to others – creates a human problem. Especially when it’s done without compensation or any other solution. It seems the state would do better to consider providing a solution, in appropriate cases, for those evicted from their homes. Property rights are important, but it’s also important to defend people’s homes.”</p>",

Now renewed exploration of the massive stone edifice in the northern Galilee, carried out by Prof. Adrian Boas, has found a previously unknown, massive Gothic hall decorated with grisaille-decorated stained glass that was possibly used by the Teutonic Order's Grand Chapter (the governing body of the Teutonic knights) for ceremonial meetings.</p> \n<p>&quot;This is further evidence of the wealth and the luxury of the Teutonic Order that resided in this isolated castle on the outskirts of Christianity,&quot; said Boas, president of the Society for the Study of the Crusaders and the Latin East.</p> \n<p>The original founders of the Teutonic Order were German knights from L&uuml;beck and Bremen who had joined the Crusader army that the Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa put together in 1188 for the Third Crusade, which he pursued in alliance with the French under King Philippe Auguste, and the English under King Richard the Lionheart.</p> \n<p>Barbarossa himself drowned in today's Turkey, after which most of his army dispersed. The two groups of German knights forged on and joined the forces of Guy of Lusignan in besieging Acre in 1190-91 C.E.</p> \n<p>The knights had sworn an oath to establish hospitals and protect pilgrims en route to Jerusalem. In 1190 or the following year, during Richard the Lionheart's siege of Acre, they set up a field hospital using sails from ships to make tents.</p> \n<p>When the Crusader army took the city on July 12, 1191, the lionhearted one rewarded them with land in Acre’s east, not far from were their camp had been, for the establishment of a permanent hospital and headquarters.</p> \n<p>Some 800 years later, the Teutonic Orders Headquarters was unearthed by Boas and George Philipp Meloni of Deutsche Ordern (the continuation of the Teutonic Order). In 1198 they were officially elevated to a military order of monastic knights, and adopted the rule and clothing of the Templars and Hospitallers.</p> \n<p>Within a few years, however, Teutonic Order found itself under pressure from the Templars and the Hospitallers in Acre, who had designs of taking it over.&nbsp;The Hospitallers for one felt they had special claims, having been charge of the German hospital in Jerusalem in the previous century.</p> \n<p>That may explain why they built Montfort so far from Acre, in a place where it protected exactly nothing. It was nestled within higher surrounding hills, enabling the Teutonic Order's knights to conduct their daily life out of sight and out of mind of the Templars and the Hospitallers.</p> \n<p>Montfort became the Teutonic knight order's principal castle and showpiece in the Holy Land. It was built on land that the order purchased in the 1220s, but construction only commenced in 1227 or 1228.</p> \n<p>Finding the Gothic Hall</p> \n<p>Excavations at Montfort have been carried out by the Zinman Institute of Archaeology at Haifa since 2011. At the castle's western end, the team excavated in a three-storey structure which had cellars at the lowest level, a Great Hall in the middle level and on the top level, highly decorated, luxurious domestic apartments featuring vaulted rooms, glided wood, stained glass and richly painted walls. It possibly served as residence of the Hochmeister (Grand Master), who was the Supreme Commander of the Teutonic Order.</p> \n<p>Then, during further exploration of the castle's western end, the archaeologists noticed, above a cistern, the outline of a barrel vault extending from the wall about 8 meters high.</p> \n<p>“We knew there was a structure extending out here but did not suspect it was a major building,&quot; Boas said. &quot;But when we excavated beyond it, we found in the debris evidence of a two-storey building with Gothic architecture and grisaille-decorated stained glass, obviously highly beautiful and decorated.&quot;</p> \n<p>They turned out to have discovered a Gothic hall with walls were about two meters thick that once stood above the barrel-vaulted basement and cistern. It was approximately half the size of the Great Hall, with two rib-vaulted bays supported by half-octagonal columns in the middle of its north and south walls. It had a plastered floor and elaborate grisaille-decorated stained glass windows.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The discovery further underscores the order's material wealth. In fact the entire upper level of the castle stands out among Crusader Castles in the Holy Land, featuring lavish Gothic architecture on par with or finer than other major crusader castles, Boas explains.</p> \n<p>However, all good things come to an end. In 1271 the castle fell to the Mamluk sultan al-Zahir Baibars.</p> \n<p>Although Baibars had something of a brutal reputation, after conquering Monfort, he spared its garrison. The knights were escorted safely back to Acre, with their archive and treasury. Shortly after, however, the sultan had the castle torn down.</p> \n<p>The newly discovered Gothic Hall predates the castles Great Hall, which had a&nbsp; similar architectural layout, but is half its size.</p> \n<p>“It may have been the original ceremonial hall, and as money poured into the order they built the grander Great Hall,” Boas suggests.</p> \n<p>The ceremonial hall would have been used for official business and as a reception hall for guests and for banqueting. It may also have served as a chapter house where the brothers in the castle assembled with the priests, held meetings and lessons, and discussed issues relating to the monastic life in the castle.</p> \n<p>The Grand Master gets expelled</p> \n<p>The hall could also have been used for the Grand Chapter, which was a worldwide meeting of the Teutonic Order in the Holy Land.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Although we know little of what actually took place in the Grand Chapter, we know that it convened several times. A memorable such Grand Chapter took place in 1244: the Grand Master was removed from office and expelled from the order.</p> \n<p>Gerhard von Malberg had served as Grand Master from 1240 or 1241 until his expulsion on July 7, 1244. No record survives of why, though possibly it involved discord over values and finances. The knights' core mission was to protect and care for pilgrims on route to Jerusalem, not to live like Oriental kings. Alternatively, his disgracing may have been because he was too close to papal policy at a time of rift between the Papacy and the Order, Boas explains.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In any case, von Malberg's removal from office was effected at the Grand chapter held at Montfort; he later joined the Knights Templar in Acre. Back at Montfort, a new Grand Master, Heinrich von Hehenlohe was elected in his place.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By 1271, Crusader rule over the Holy Land was drawing to an end. Much of the coast had been taken by Sultan Baibars, and the Crusaders no longer controlled most of the interior.</p> \n<p>&quot;Montfort was increasingly becoming an isolated island in Muslim territory,&quot; says Boas and adds, &quot;There was not really any point for the Teutonic garrison to remain, since there seem to have been no prospect of anyone coming to save them.&quot; The Crusades were, by then, past their peak.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When the castle fell on the 23rd of June 1271, after a mere 15 days' siege, Baibars personally escorted the brothers to Acre, then returned, and in keeping with his scorched-earth policy, destroyed the castle. He finished destroying it on the 4th of July. The castle was then abandoned and, left in glorious isolation, was never reoccupied.</p> \n<p>The Order's continued existence in the Holy Land would be short-lived.</p> \n<p>Before Acre fell into the hands of the Mamluk Sultan in 1291, the Grand Master withdrew to Venice along with the archive and treasure, from where he continued to direct the crusade against the Muslims. Only in 1309 did he abandon the war in the East and move to Prussia, bolstering the Teutonic kingdom in Europe. As the order grew in size and importance, estates and castles such as Ordensburg Marienburg was built near the town of Malbork in Poland. Malbork replaced Montfort as the principal castle of the Teutonic Order and is the largest castle measured by land area in the world.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Monday’s decision by Airbnb to stop listing rental properties in unlawful settlements in the West Bank is good news not only for Palestinian landowners whose land has been stolen but potentially also for Israeli tourism. Perhaps one day Tourism Minister Yariv Levin, who has threatened to restrict the activities of Airbnb in Israel, will realize that.</p> \n<p>Airbnb said it would stop listing rentals in the settlements as part of a new policy on doing business in occupied territory that evaluates, among other things, the effects of its business activity on human suffering. The decision will remove around 200 rental properties in Jewish settlements which contribute to serious human rights violations. These properties stain the thousands of other Israeli tourism offerings which a succession of governments has insisted on lumping together with them.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Why Airbnb will have a hard time enforcing its ban&nbsp;■ Settlement getaway? Here are the West Bank's weirdest Airbnbs</p> \n<p>The case against the settlements is strong. It is a war crime for the Israeli authorities to transfer Israeli civilians into the West Bank. The authorities operate a two-tiered system there — one that discriminates against Palestinians, and another that benefits Israelis. They seize Palestinian land and give it to Jewish settlers; they set up checkpoints and roadblocks and issue military orders that restrict Palestinians’ right to travel. They provide settlers with land, water, infrastructure and financial incentives, while forcibly displacing Palestinians and preventing them from building on 99 percent of the state land under Israeli administrative control.</p> \n<p>Global tourism companies like Airbnb and Booking.com, which earn revenue from listing homes in Israeli settlements, have contributed to making settlements economically viable. But that is contrary to the companies’ responsibilities under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The guiding principles require companies to avoid contributing to serious abuses of human rights and the laws of war, as a report published Tuesday by Human Rights Watch and the Israeli civil society organization Kerem Navot makes clear.</p> \n<p>Airbnb’s decision will benefit Israeli tourism, unless Levin is foolish to enough to carry out his threat to retaliate against the company. Airbnb has been a boon for the industry, advertising thousands of rentals throughout the country and listing Tel Aviv as one of its 23 featured cities, together with New York, Paris, Buenos Aires and Tokyo. A survey by the Tel Aviv municipality found that 51 percent of tourists staying in the city booked their rentals via Airbnb.</p> \n<p>Yet Airbnb’s listings in Israel are tainted by those in illegal settlements in occupied territory. Nearly half of the properties in settlement that were listed on Airbnb were falsely listed as being inside Israel. In other words, tourists wanting to stay in Israel could inadvertently find themselves in accommodations built on land that is stolen, off-limits to Palestinians and therefore inherently discriminatory. That prospect is becoming increasingly unsavory to the global audience of Airbnb, including the 150,000 signatories to a petition demanding that it stop listing settlement properties. Foreign investors in other industries with whom I have spoken have expressed concern that they can’t distinguish between settlement activities, which they don’t want to fund, and activities within Israel, leading them to consider divesting from Israel entirely.</p> \n<p>The deliberate blurring of lines means that even some Airbnb hosts don’t realize they live in settlements. That confusion is the product of decades of Israeli moves to extend Israeli law to the West Bank and to separate many Israeli settlements from the rest of the West Bank with fences and walls.</p> \n<p>This summer, I emailed the host of an Airbnb property in Hashmonaim, an Israeli settlement near Modi’in Ilit. I asked him why his rental was listed as being inside Israel, and he told me that Hashmonaim was not a settlement, that it is inside Israel. I clarified that Hashmonaim is part of what the Israeli government calls Judea and Samaria, in the Binyamin Regional Council, on land that was captured in 1967. He responded that Hashmonaim was not on territory captured won in the Six-Day War, that it was located inside Israel, about 5 kilometers from the West Bank. He was not the first settler I’ve run into who doesn’t know that he is one. He will realize his mistake when Airbnb stops listing his property.</p> \n<p>While the current government may try to reinvent history, erasing the distinction between Israeli businesses and settlement businesses puts the entire Israeli economy at risk, by associating it with serious human rights abuses in the settlements.</p> \n<p>Airbnb made the right decision to stop contributing to settlement abuses. Levin’s empty threats notwithstanding, delisting settlement properties from Airbnb will only bring economic benefit to the majority of Israeli users of the platform who host their guests inside Israel.</p> \n<p>Sari Bashi is a Robina Foundation visiting human rights fellow at Yale Law School and a former researcher at Human Rights Watch.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It is difficult to pinpoint the exact date when the Holocaust began, but Kristallnacht (“the Night of Broken Glass”) is by all accounts a key milestone leading up to the destruction of European Jewry.</p> \n<p>Eighty years ago this weekend – on November 9-10, 1938 – a wave of anti-Jewish pogroms engulfed Germany, Austria and the areas of Czechoslovakia under German rule. Nazi storm troopers and Hitler Youth members destroyed 267 synagogues and plundered an estimated 7,500 Jewish-owned businesses. Roughly 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps, and the Nazis said 91 Jews were killed in the course of those two days (though the actual figure was much higher).</p> \n<p>It was the first act of organized violence against Jews to be carried out under the Nazis.</p> \n<p>Emanuel Marx, Susan Warsinger, Yossi Kohn and Lore Mayerfeld were all living in Germany at the time, and watched as their homes were invaded and their fathers dragged away. Marx and Warsinger have vivid recollection of the events of those days, while Kohn and Mayerfeld&nbsp;– too young to remember on their own – have been able to reconstruct what happened based on testimonies shared by their parents.</p> \n<p>All of them had the good fortune of escaping Germany before it was too late. They share their stories with Haaretz here...</p> \n<p>‘No shouting, no screaming, no violence’</p> \n<p>Age 11 at the time, Emanuel Marx was old enough to remember the events of Kristallnacht very clearly. At about 7 A.M., two Nazi storm troopers knocked on the door of his family’s rented apartment in the center of Munich. His father, who opened the door, was ordered to leave the family and accompany them.</p> \n<p>“He was still not dressed,” recalls Marx, “so he asked them for a few minutes to wash up and get ready. They accompanied him to the bathroom and toilet, and then took him away. There was no shouting, no screaming, no violence. Nothing. My younger brother and I were very frightened but didn’t say a word, and when my father disappeared behind the door, my mother told us to go get dressed and go to school – as if nothing had happened.”</p> \n<p>Marx and his younger brother obeyed their mother. But on their way to school, a 10-minute walk from their home, they noticed that the synagogue next door was engulfed in flames and smoke. “A stranger came up to us and said we should turn around and go home, and that’s exactly what we did,” says Marx.</p> \n<p>He remembers that the area around the school and synagogue was cordoned off, with policemen and firemen hovering around. “Apparently the firemen were told not to extinguish the flames, but just to make sure they didn’t spread to other properties,” he recounts.</p> \n<p>The Jewish school Marx attended was not destroyed, but it was vandalized and temporarily closed for two months. While he and his brother stayed at home waiting for their school to reopen, their father was incarcerated at Dachau.</p> \n<p>“He showed up one day another person, a broken man, and he never fully recovered,” Marx says. Initially, his father wanted nothing more than to share with his family stories of the suffering he had endured in the concentration camp, but, as Marx admits, “We were children and lost interest.” After that, his father never spoke of Dachau again.</p> \n<p>About six months after Kristallnacht, Marx and his younger brother were put on a train to England as part of the Kindertransport – an operation aimed at rescuing Jewish children in Nazi-occupied Europe. His father, meanwhile, was again imprisoned and told that if he wanted to be released, he must leave Germany within 24 hours. Marx’s parents escaped to British Mandatory Palestine in January 1940, with their two sons joining them soon afterward. “But when we were finally reunited with them, they were no longer our parents really,” Marx reflects. “We children felt that they had sent us away – which is exactly the opposite of what they really did: They parted from us with a very heavy heart.”</p> \n<p>After fighting in the Israeli War of Independence in 1948-49, Marx would go on to become one of Israel’s most preeminent anthropologists. In 1998, he received the prestigious Israel Prize for his groundbreaking studies on the Bedouin. Marx, who lives in the north Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon, has three children, nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.</p> \n<p>Kristallnacht was such a traumatic experience for him that he never about spoke about it for more than 70 years. He decided to break his silence after he was asked to contribute a chapter on the subject to a recently published book titled “Marking Evil: Holocaust Memory in the Global Age” (Amos Goldberg and Haim Hazan, editors, Berghahn Books, 2015). But Marx says that, contrary to what he assumed, writing about the traumatic events of his childhood “hasn’t cured me.”</p> \n<p>‘The rock scraped his hand’</p> \n<p>Susan Warsinger remembers that she and a younger brother, with whom she shared a room, woke up excited because November 10 was their mother’s birthday. But before they could begin to celebrate, there were bricks and rocks crashing through the windows of their apartment in the town of Bad Kreuznach, southwest Germany.</p> \n<p>“We were really scared, so we ran across the hall to our parents’ bedroom,” recalls Warsinger, who lives today in Chevy Chase, Maryland. At one point, she recounts, a rock came through a window, hitting the crib beneath it in which her newborn baby brother was fast sleep. “That was the most frightening thing of all,” she says. “The rock scraped his hand, but aside from that he was OK.”</p> \n<p>Her family lived on the first floor of a four-story house; the town rabbi and his family lived one floor above them. Before her father was arrested, he managed to get his wife and children up to the top floor, which served as an attic and where they spent the next few days until the violence subsided. They were also joined by the rabbi’s wife and children.</p> \n<p>Warsinger recalls looking outside and seeing the rabbi having his beard shaved off, in an act of public humiliation, before he was dragged away by the storm troopers. She says her own father, for whatever reason, was allowed to return to the family the following day. “It could be that they let him off because he was a friend of the mayor’s and they used to play chess together, or maybe it was because he was a Polish citizen,” she says. “We don’t really know why all the other Jewish fathers were taken away but ours was allowed to come back.”</p> \n<p>After Kristallnacht, Warsinger’s parents paid to have her and her older brother smuggled over the border into France, where the family assumed they would be safer. It took 18 months before they were finally reunited with their parents, who meanwhile found refuge in the United States with the help of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) and a Quaker organization.</p> \n<p>A teacher by profession, Warsinger eventually married a World War II veteran she met at the University of Maryland. They have three children and nine grandchildren. “All my children are contributing to American society,” she says proudly. “One is a cardiologist, another a dancer and another a nutritionist. Hitler didn’t accomplish anything he set out to do with my family.”</p> \n<p>‘She somehow got to Dachau, bribed whoever needed to be bribed’</p> \n<p>His parents sensed in advance that they were in danger and had already planned their escape to Uruguay before Kristallnacht, recalls Yossi Kohn, a retired orthodontist from Haifa.</p> \n<p>Kohn was almost 4 when the pogroms began and he says most of his memories of the time are based on snippets shared by his parents. The family lived at the time on the first floor of a building owned by the Jewish community of Mannheim. His father, Avraham-Artur Kohn, served as the cantor of the town’s Orthodox synagogue, where he also taught Hebrew and was in charge of the local branch of the religious youth movement. On November 10, his father was taking his usual morning walk to the synagogue when someone stopped him and warned him not to get any closer because the building was on fire.</p> \n<p>“My father came home and pushed us all into a corner on the second floor of our building,” Kohn recounts. “We heard footsteps coming up the stairs, and then the Nazi storm troopers burst in and began taking all our books and throwing them out the window,” where they burned them. “Then they grabbed my father and took him away. We only learned a few days later that he had been taken to Dachau.”</p> \n<p>The family had been scheduled to board a ship from Hamburg on November 22, and had already paid for their visas and tickets. Kohn’s mother was not prepared to leave without their father, though. “So she did something very smart,” he recounts. “She somehow got to Dachau, bribed whoever needed to be bribed and succeeded in getting my father out so he could board that ship with us.”</p> \n<p>In 1941, the family moved from Montevideo to Buenos Aires, where his father was hired as cantor of a synagogue attended by German-speaking Jews. In 1950, the family immigrated to Israel.</p> \n<p>After their local synagogue in Mannheim was destroyed, Avraham-Artur Kohn’s choir songbook was discovered among the debris by members of the community who eventually immigrated to Mandatory Palestine. The book remained in their possession for the next 50 years, before it finally found its way back to the Kohn family. A page of the songbook is now on display in a special online exhibit prepared by Yad Vashem to commemorate Kristallnacht.</p> \n<p>“The big question was what to do with it,” says Kohn, who has three children and six grandchildren. “The renewed Jewish community of Mannheim wanted it for its archives, but we decided to give it to Yad Vashem.”</p> \n<p>‘The hospital specialized in German-made dolls’</p> \n<p>She was only one-and-a-half-years-old at the time, so what Lore Mayerfeld knows about Kristallnacht, she knows from her mother.</p> \n<p>“What I was told was that the Nazis came into our apartment and destroyed everything, and then they took my father away to a concentration camp,” says Mayerfeld, who now lives in Jerusalem. She was still wearing her pajamas and clinging to her prized possession – her doll Inga – when the Nazis barged into their apartment in the central German city of Kassel.</p> \n<p>When Mayerfeld’s father was released six months later, her mother begged him to flee Germany since he was the only one in the family in possession of a visa to the United States. “He didn’t want to leave my mother alone, but she told him that if he didn’t leave we would all die,” Mayerfeld recounts. “So reluctantly, he went.”</p> \n<p>It took another 18 months before Mayerfeld and her mother were reunited with him. Following a long journey through France and Portugal, they eventually boarded a ship bound for the United States.</p> \n<p>Mayerfeld has three children, 14 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. “As an only child, that’s very special to me,” she says. In 1991, she and her late husband moved to Israel, where all three of their children live today.</p> \n<p>For many years, Inga sat on display on a bookcase in her home. Mayerfeld says she did not allow her children to touch the precious doll. “There is actually a doll hospital in New York, where I had to take her to have parts of her body repaired,” she relays. “It was a hospital that specialized in German-made dolls.”</p> \n<p>Eventually, Mayerfeld donated the doll to Yad Vashem, where she felt it would be “better appreciated.” The museum’s new online exhibition features several photos of Inga. In these photos, she is dressed in the very same tiny pajamas Mayerfeld wore when the Nazis broke into her home on Kristallnacht. Her mother had saved them.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Many eyes around the world will turn on Sunday at 2 P.M. to the streets of Poland’s major cities, including Warsaw.</p> \n<p>Tensions will reach boiling point around the question of whether ultra-nationalists and xenophobes (some of whom are anti-Semites) succeed in spoiling the centenary celebrations of Poland’s independence and harm the country’s reputation.</p> \n<p>The irony is that the far-right in Poland, who fret so much about the country’s reputation with regard to controversial parts of its past (as surfaced this year around Poland’s “Holocaust law”), may be the ones who do the most serious damage to the country’s image.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion: Poland and Israel’s false declaration on the Holocaust&nbsp;■&nbsp;The princess, the Nazi and the prostitute: Unlikely Righteous Among the Nations revealed</p> \n<p>This could happen if unacceptable scenes from last year’s large parade repeat themselves, including the touting of the slogan “White Europe” and other anti-Semitic expressions, as well as the eruption of violent incidents caused by scary-looking thugs, who have come to Poland from benighted areas of Europe to join their fellow travelers.</p> \n<p>Marches by Polish ultra-nationalists pose a difficult dilemma for the country’s right-wing government, led by the Law and Justice party. On the one hand, the government can’t clash directly with the marchers, who are still part and parcel of this party, having helped it gain power in 2015.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the damage to Poland’s image in the wake of these marches may be severe, conflicting with its public relations efforts and the huge investment the government has made on the international front in recent days, in order to market this centenary as a joyous and festive occasion, while trying to neutralize any land mine which might cast a cloud over the festivities.</p> \n<p>The Warsaw municipality’s attempt to ban the ultra-nationalists’ march failed due to court intervention. President Andrzej Duda, a statesman-like figure who tries to bridge gaps and moderate fissures in Poland’s society, joined the fray, saying he would lead a march of his own. He called on Poles to join him, carrying the country’s red and white flag (implicitly suggesting the avoidance of the white-only flag, one of the ultra-nationalist symbols). Ultra-nationalist organizations have agreed to combine their marches with the one Duda has sponsored.</p> \n<p>We’ll know the results of this decision on Sunday. It will be interesting to see if Poland can keep a state-sanctioned march festive and dignified, or whether it gives voice to ultra-nationalists, who earlier this year called on the president to “sign the law and take off his kippah,” in reference to the Polish legislation criminalizing the statement that the “Polish nation” was implicated in Nazi crimes during the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;With Holocaust declaration, Netanyahu and Polish PM use history for political needs&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Yad Vashem rebukes Netanyahu: Holocaust declaration contains 'grave errors and deceptions'&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israel's stupid, ignorant and amoral betrayal of truth on Polish involvement in the Holocaust&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the same time, the government is promoting other less-controversial initiatives, in association with the centenary. These include the lighting up of famous structures around the world in the colors of Poland’s flag.</p> \n<p>These include Egypt’s pyramids, the leaning tower of Pisa and Tel Aviv’s city hall. They are also disseminating a nice viral video starring Poland’s new ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski.</p> \n<p>The video is in the style of “unimportant facts you didn’t know about Poland” and is characterized, as appropriate to the genre, by its lightness and self-directed humor.</p> \n<p>Among other facts, it tells viewers that Poles invented the paper clip (although there are other claimants, besides the Polish-American pianist Josef Hofmann, to whom the video refers), as well as the most extravagant men’s hairstyles (the video shows those of soccer player Jan Tomaszewski, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, who signed the Versailles Treaty, and Israel’s first prime minister David Ben-Gurion, who was also from Poland).</p> \n<p>The disparity between concerns about a violent xenophobic march on Sunday and the production of the amusing clip demonstrates well the fissures in contemporary Poland. Anyone visiting Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw and Gdansk will find modern and pleasant cities, which are safe, bustling and full of all good things – food, shopping and entertainment – as is appropriate for a post-Communist European country with the most successful economy.</p> \n<p>The tourists, including many Israelis, who fill city squares throughout the year, are living testament to the great success in branding Poland as a “regular” tourist destination, offering more than visits to death camps. This was summarized by an Israeli tourist on an El Al flight from Krakow this month: “Auschwitz? What, am I crazy? We went shopping.”</p> \n<p>Poland can also be pleased with the latest report by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, which pointed to a drop in anti-Semitic incidents since 2015, the year the present government assumed power.</p> \n<p>However, under the surface there is another Poland, one the tourists don’t discern, but which brings hundreds of thousands of locals to the streets, and which causes the left-leaning media to attack the government. This is the Poland which opponents of the government claim, sometimes exaggeratedly, is heading toward a dictatorship, due to government attempts to gain control of the media and the courts. This is a Poland in which the dominant camp opposes the values of the EU such as multiculturalism and equal rights for the LGBT community, and which will not consider any possibility of absorbing Muslim migrants.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The government explains that the reforms it is introducing are meant to improve the functioning of a distorted and top-heavy system, a remnant of the hated Communist regime, which was replaced only 30 years ago. It dismisses charges of dictatorship as “fake news,” stoked by left-leaning media, led by the most important newspaper in Poland, Gazeta Wyborcza.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With respect to migrant influx there is a two-pronged policy. Very quietly, the doors have opened in recent years to massive immigration from Ukraine. There are no official figures yet but there are estimates of more than one million immigrants. Walking the streets of the larger cities, one can hear a mixture of Ukrainian and Polish language on every corner, divulging the origins of the neighborhood’s newcomers.</p> \n<p>In addition, in recent years the government has handed out work visas to many Asians, who have quickly dominated the food delivery market. One can’t miss them these days, on their scooters making deliveries for the online food ordering company, Uber Eats, in large Polish cities.</p> \n<p>This would have been inconceivable in the past. In other words, Poland is no longer “white” but is also far from being a desired destination for migrants, in contrast to its neighbor Germany. Poland, which for most of its history was not independent, have been repeatedly conquered by other nations, including two totalitarian and murderous ones, bears many scars and skeletons as it celebrates its birthday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Despite this, it has managed in recent years to shake off its stereotypic image as an old-fashioned country stuck in the past, and has made impressive strides toward a new path.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The obstacles are still there, obviously. This was seen in Israel following the clumsy Polish contortions around the handling of the so-called Holocaust Law, which maneuvered between a wish to protect “national honor” (while placating the nationalist right wing), and the need to maintain friendly relations with Israel and the U.S. The compromise that was reached – the removal of criminal prosecution of anyone arguing the Polish people were involved in the Holocaust – but the maintaining of the right to pursue civil legal action, with unclear significance, enabled all sides, at least for now, to return to normal.</p> \n<p>The 100th anniversary will allow Poland to show the world its good sides, of which it has many, but will also demonstrate how it proposes to contend with the unpleasant aspects of the past and present.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Donald Trump has other burning problems on his mind, but sooner or later, the expanding economic ties between China and Israel will inevitably attract the American president’s attention as well. The current administration’s paranoia about China’s moves around the world and fear over losing the trade war to Beijing have pushed events in East Asia to the top of Washington’s agenda.</p> \n<p>Two months ago, Haaretz reported that, at a conference with their Israeli counterparts, retired American admirals warned that Washington was simply astonished at Israel’s decision to award major infrastructure projects, including the construction of a civilian port in Haifa, to Chinese companies. Somebody even suggested that the U.S. Sixth Fleet might steer clear of the Israel Navy base in Haifa because of the Chinese involvement in building a civilian port there.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Based on conversations with ministers and other top officials, it now turns out that the Israelis were amazed at the intensity of their American counterparts’ ire on the matter. “They blew up at us,” said one of the Israelis who attended the meetings.</p> \n<p>The Americans asked Israel for guarantees that China wouldn’t be able to take advantage of projects in Israel to improve its strategic standing and its intelligence capabilities. They remained unconvinced that Israel’s answers were good enough – and said if Israel couldn’t provide the guarantees they wanted, that would be grounds to have Israel reconsider its project contracts with China.</p> \n<p>In one such exchange, Americans told their Israeli counterparts that the United States could not be friends with a country for which China was building ports. They mentioned another country, not Israel, but Jerusalem got the hint.</p> \n<p>Washington’s increasingly extreme attitude toward Beijing is the product of a gradual process that began under President Barack Obama, but it has intensified under Trump. In Israel’s analysis of the situation, no malicious intent is ascribed to the Chinese; just long-term strategic thinking focused mainly on patiently accumulating economic dividends.</p> \n<p>Constructing the ports and carrying out infrastructure projects -- from highways to tunnels and subway systems -- all help expand China’s economic and political influence and fit in well with its Belt and Road Initiative, which is aimed at making China the leading world power.</p> \n<p>The Americans are afraid of losing contracts to China, concerned that China will gain a foothold in Israel, afraid of allowing China a foothold in Israel and worried that it would be exploited by the Chinese for intelligence purposes. A top White House official who spoke with an Israeli delegation a few weeks ago said the Pentagon was also infuriated too, as were the Treasury Department and the office of Vice President Mike Pence, but as far as is known, the issue is not yet on Trump’s agenda. The official did warn, however, that when Trump is personally briefed on the matter, he would be expected to be furious.</p> \n<p>Israel probably doesn’t have any way to mollify the president now that contracts have already been signed, but tensions with the Americans over economic relations with China seem to be just a matter of time.</p> \n<p>A State Department official told Haaretz on Thursday: “The U.S. and Israel collaborate extensively on a range of issues, including trade and security. We don’t discuss the details of diplomatic conversations.“</p>",

        "text":["<p>The criticism suffered by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend was earned fair and square. The photos of $15 million in cash from Qatar entering the Gaza Strip in suitcases cast a ridiculous light on his repeated claims of being tough on Hamas. The same goes for his attacks on his predecessor, Ehud Olmert, following the end of the first Gaza war in 2009 and his constant implication that his rivals on the left are undermining national security.</p> \n<p>In reality,&nbsp;Netanyahu&nbsp;is conducting indirect negotiations with Hamas (though he and his government religiously refuse to confirm this). The&nbsp;Qatari cash, which will help preserve Hamas’ hold on Gaza, could not have entered without his approval.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, the left’s attacks on Netanyahu are also tainted by hypocrisy. Not only because any hypothetical government headed by Yesh Atid or Zionist Union would have done exactly the same, but also because this seems to be the right thing to do under the circumstances. True, the photos of the suitcases are embarrassing and carry the connotation of paying a bribe or protection money to the mafia. But the alternative seems to be war.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Continued economic pressure on Gaza will lead to an explosion, which in turn will lead to an Israeli ground operation in Gaza, heavy casualties followed by desperate negotiations over who will assume responsibility for Gaza’s population – or in other words, a return to square one. And if Israel has nothing to gain by invading Gaza, it ought to try any other possible solution before going to war.</p> \n<p>Anyone who’s enjoying taunting Netanyahu for his weakness now won’t be able to say that he didn’t foresee the consequences if the government, under the pressure of political criticism and public unhappiness, gets dragged into a war.</p> \n<p>The right’s criticism of Netanyahu is also unpersuasive. If ministers Avigdor Lieberman and Naftali Bennett are really so shocked by this monetary transfer, let them remove their parties from the governing coalition, forcing Netanyahu to call early elections.</p> \n<p>Lieberman, as defense minister, cannot continue having his cake and eating it too for very long. And&nbsp;Bennett, by accusing Lieberman of weakness toward Hamas while completely ignoring Netanyahu’s responsibility (as well as his own, given his membership in the security cabinet), is clearly acting on the assumption that Israeli voters will buy any nonsense.</p> \n<p>Incidentally, people have short memories. Back in the summer 2016, this very same government, headed by Netanyahu, Bennett and Lieberman, also allowed suitcases full of Qatari cash to enter Gaza, on the pretext of supporting urgent infrastructure projects.</p> \n<p>'Relative quiet'</p> \n<p>Thursday’s cash transfer produced a relatively quiet weekend, the second in a row. Friday morning, Hamas was busy distributing the cash to 27,000 civil servants and some 50,000 families defined as needy. In the afternoon, its security forces generally prevented large numbers of people from nearing the border fence during the weekly demonstrations.</p> \n<p>The fact that fewer tires were burned, reducing the amount of smoke and making it easier for Israeli snipers to see, reduced the number of Palestinian casualties (one Palestinian was killed and a few dozen wounded). The number of bombs and incendiary balloons launched by the Palestinians also fell sharply.</p> \n<p>One&nbsp;serious incident&nbsp;did occur. A Palestinian penetrated to the outskirts of the Israeli community of Netiv Ha’asara and torched a greenhouse. The fact that he managed to penetrate Israel’s multiple lines of defense requires the military to conduct an internal investigation. But this isn’t the kind of incident for which Hamas can be blamed.</p> \n<p>Israel should have woken up sooner and taken steps to ease Gaza’s distress during the three and a half years of relative quiet following the 2014 Gaza war, or at least during the past seven months of demonstrations along the border. During these months of violence, more than 200 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire and the&nbsp;sense of security&nbsp;of Israelis living near Gaza was badly undermined.</p> \n<p>Over the summer, when incendiary balloon launchings were at their height – a threat played up by the media and on social media – Netanyahu was nearly dragged into a war he didn’t want and which the military forcefully advised against. The steps that will soon be approved to ease Gaza’s distress could have been taken much earlier, thereby reducing the damage on all sides.</p> \n<p>There’s still no agreement on Gaza. The&nbsp;relative quiet&nbsp;has been achieved thanks to Egypt’s steamroller tactics against both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, causing the latter to temporarily suspend its threat of further sanctions against Gaza.</p> \n<p>A long-term cease-fire in Gaza could still be thwarted by any of the Palestinian factions – Hamas itself (through a serious terror attack in the West Bank), the PA or Islamic Jihad and the other “rebellious” organizations in Gaza. Hamas’ leadership will also have to understand that its dreams of a serious relaxation of the blockade depend on solving the issue of the dead and missing Israelis held in Gaza.</p> \n<p>But for the first time in many months, a window of opportunity has been created to end the cycle of violence sparked by the border protests. That is no small thing.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The unusual proportions of the 'Totzeret Haaretz' building in Tel Aviv, with architect and superstar designer Ron Arad’s distinctive style built into it, can elicit extreme reactions. Some hate it, some love it and some are plain awed by its sophistication.</p> \n<p>Architect Asa Bruno, who has directed Arad’s studio, in London, for the past two decades, and who has overseen the project (which has also been branded as ToHa), says he and his colleagues are unmoved by the reactions. “You can’t build a building on a scale like this and in a location like this without it arousing emotions. It’s definitely not a bland building that tries to please various sides. Yet at the same time, the building wasn’t planned with the intention of arousing emotions, but rather so as to create a good and unique environment for the people who work there. And yes, also a special urban experience for Tel Aviv.”</p> \n<p>The building, a few minutes’ walk east of the large Shalom train station, is indeed taking up a prominent place on the ever-more crowded skyline of the Tel Aviv metropolis. It will house mainly office space, but its look is quite different than the other multistory buildings that have gone up around it of late, like the Azrieli buildings or the Amot Atrium Tower: It is not narrow, but rather has a relatively low and plump profile, and rises 27 stories, to be joined by a far taller tower of 60 stories.</p> \n<p>Arad’s Israeli-British firm was joined, in the design of Totzeret Haaretz, by the local firm of Yashar Architects. Headed by Avner Yashar, the company already has to its credit a number of projects in the city, among them 1 Rothschild Boulevard, the Wholesale Market project and the Bezalel Market.</p> \n<p>The project’s developers are the Amot and Gav Yam companies, who turned to Arad in 2012 with a request that he come up with an extraordinary architectural concept for them. To that end, they embarked on a long statutory process intended to combine seven different lots into one large plot of land of more than 18 dunams (about 193,750 square feet) for the site of the complex.</p> \n<p>In a conversation in Tel Aviv, Arad – who has lived in London since the 1970s – praises the developers who contacted him asking for an unusual concept: “There are lots of idealistic and ambitious architects, but there are fewer good clients. But, behind every good building there’s also a client. We weren’t out to build an icon. I firmly believe that aesthetics and functionality aren’t enemies but rather friends, and I don’t take part in contests over who’s tallest and who’s the best-looking. I devote the same amount of thought to choosing frames for my glasses as I do when I’m working on a building,” he adds, clutching his eyeglasses, “and I do everything as though I were doing it for the first time.”</p> \n<p>Arad maintains a relatively small studio, with about 20 employees, who work on a wide range of projects -- from product design to sculpture, and from interior design to public buildings. In Israel, the latter include the Beit Shulamit Cancer Center, at Afula’s Emek Medical Center, and currently under construction.</p> \n<p>Seen from above, the Totzeret Haaretz complex is like the letter “L” placed on three legs, each of which rises into a tower of increasing width as it goes higher. The quasi-towers connect with one another via a broad bridge, creating a three-legged complex. One of these legs, which has been sheathed in brass sheeting that now appears golden in color, has attracted attention, although the architects explain that the material will darken into a shade of bronze.</p> \n<p>“I wanted the facade that faces the street to get a special treatment,” Asa Bruno explains to us on a tour of the intriguing sie. “We don’t like to use materials that are treated or painted to look like something else. We are always looking for qualities that come with the material, with its integrity. This material will acquire a natural patina within a few months and will be less shiny and bright.</p> \n<p>“The footprint of the complex covers 1.5 dunams of the plot (just under 16,150 square feet), and containing 5,000 square meters (nearly 54,000 square feet) of floor space. That’s much more than in similar buildings on a similar-size piece of land,” Bruno notes, adding that the generous space between each pair of feet on the structure allows pedestrians to continue to see the city though the building. As a result, the complex is not experienced as a wall of towers (though residents of the tall buildings in Nahalat Yitzhak do experience it as a wall in front of their windows).</p> \n<p>Also freeing up ground space is the developers’ decision to situate only a restaurant and a cafe at street level, instead of building a shopping mall, as is common with other multi-story buildings in the area. In order to encourage workers in the building to use green transportation, the structure offers hundreds of secured parking spaces for bicycles. The underground parking lot, in contrast, has only 950 spaces – less than the 1,300 that were approved by the planning commissions.</p> \n<p>ToHa is the most significant complex at the intersection of Derekh Hashalom and Yigal Alon Boulevard, but around it are many other plots that are expected to accommodate multi-story buildings. It is not yet known how they will connect with one another; what is clear is that this is going to be a very hot section of Gush Dan: In addition to the adjacent train station, an express lane for public transport, and in the more distant future, two metro lines. Today, the area is not pedestrian-friendly, but the decision to make the ground floor of Totzeret Haaretz a public space could indicate a trend, and even set a high bar for other developers who will build multi-story buildings here, as well as to municipal policy makers. In any case, City Hall would do well in the near future to present the public with a collage of all the projects slated for the area.</p> \n<p>Landscape architect Lital Szmuk, who is working on the project’s landscape design, says that the ground floor will be exceptional, and vary from other private open spaces around the city. Very often the developers who manage such spaces prefer to design them in a way that in keeps pedestrians away, so that even though they are designated for public use, they end up being empty. (Examples of this phenomenon are the Frishman 46 building, at the corner of Dizengoff Street, and the Remez Tower on Arlosoroff St.) Here, says Szmuk, a great deal of effort has been put specifically into drawing in the public.</p> \n<p>“This is the largest perlite order we’ve ever made at the firm,” she says, referring to the irregularly shaped pebbles of volcanic glass used as a medium for growing plants. “It’s costing millions of shekels. We are going to plant hundreds of trees, including oaks, poincianas, poplars, trumpet trees, blue jacarandas and mulberries on a bed one meter to a meter and a half deep. Some of the trees are already very big and have been moved from other projects.</p> \n<p>“The landscaping solution is simple – a concrete surface with round holes in it that are openings for trees. The idea is to create a natural wooded grove spread over 11 dunams, with very dense planting. In between, there will be benches and ecological pools.”</p> \n<p>It should be noted that while the grove the developers are planting does contribute to the branding of the project, it is the result of negotiations with the municipality, which in return allowed the developers to put up a complex with very extensive building rights.</p> \n<p>Adjusting the light</p> \n<p>Preparations for the planting are already underway, but at the moment, imagination is required to understand how the grove will look at the end of the process. In contrast, there is no need to imagine the parts of the building itself – most of them are already in place. From the ground floor, you enter an impressive atrium that is 30 meters high (about 98 feet), and that extends into a skylight of another 70 or so meters. The lower section is bounded by two slanted glass walls that are textured in a way designed to prevent glare. The individual floors are different from one another, but have an average floorspace of 2,800 to 3,000 square meters. The structural envelope has been planned as a series of fixed units that enable optimal and economical planning.</p> \n<p>“Over the course of half a year we worked with the utmost care on the geometry of the building: 97 percent of the facades are made of a double-glazed module 3.8 meters high and 1.35 meters wide,” says Bruno. Between the glass panels is a curtain that will go up and down by means of a central smart system, and based on the weather. What varies in the building is mainly the elements made of concrete. Each floor is shaded by an external shelf covered in Dekton – a material made of stone dust. “This is a material with characteristics somewhere between stone and glass. The width of each shelf changes in accordance with climatological calculations determined by computers.”</p> \n<p>Chen Shalita, the green construction consultant for the project, says that the planners have aimed to create a building where it will be pleasant to work. “The light is controlled,” he says. “There are buildings where the workers suffer from glare and others where they suffer from insufficient light. When it’s pleasant for the worker, productivity is higher. This is an important issue today for planning offices.” Bruno and Shalita will be addressing just this issue at a conference of the Israeli Green Building Council, scheduled for Tel Aviv University on November 19.</p> \n<p>From the office flors we go up to a veranda overlooking Gush Dan. Later this will be covered by a deck, a portion of which will house ia restaurant partially open to the public, the developers promise. As we gaze at the surrounding towers, Bruno comments that “the facades of the building are always changing according to the climate. If you look around, you’ll see a lot of multi-story buildings with glass facades that are identical on all sides. This is not construction that takes the climate into consideration. We worked on having every side give a suitable answer to the direction it faces.”</p> \n<p>A welcoming campus</p> \n<p>What motivates a development company to invest in a building like this, I ask Shimon Abudraham, the CEO of Amot Real Estate Enterprise &amp; Development. He replies: “The building where a company’s offices are located says something about the company itself. Just as there are people who want to drive a Tesla and are prepared to put down a deposit a year in advance only for the right to become the owner of an innovative and sophisticated vehicle, there are clients who close a deal quickly in order to ensure for themselves a place in a unique, innovative and well-designed building. We aim to initiate projects that will suit the changes in the habits of consumption work spaces. There is a demand for such offices.”</p> \n<p>The companies renting spaces in the building are companies requring large floorspace – such as Natural Intelligence, which has rented three floors, and WeWork, which is down for four. Other companies that will relocate in the building are Tufin, which is in the field of information security infrastructures and networks in organizations, and the Israeli-Singaporean company Trax.</p> \n<p>“These are companies that want to feel they are in one large space. Large floors enable closeness among the workers. No [other] tower can provide a floor of 3,000 meters. We did this before other competitors,” says Abudraham.</p> \n<p>He notes that the choice of Arad, who does not have prior experience with skyscrapers, was made in the clear knowledge that an additional architect would be added. “We didn’t take him solo but rather, together with Avner Yashar. Moreover, both firms have engineering departments with a lot of experience. The architects didn’t start working on the building without a program. They needed to design an aesthetic building but also to answer certain requirements. The decision to build a green building to the LEED Platinum standard [certification for energy and resource efficiency] is also the company’s. The architect doesn’t get to decide at which level the project he plans will be.”</p> \n<p>Avi Mosler, the CEO of Amot Investments, adds: “We are glad for the opportunity to work with Ron Arad and Avner Yashar, who joined together in an extraordinary collaboration. The instruction given to everyone involved in the planning and design was to aim for the highest-quality result, with no compromises.”</p> \n<p>What was the motivation for a ground floor that is mostly open to the public?</p> \n<p>“We wanted to make the campus a welcoming place to work. The ground floor will allow employees to go for a break in something like a wooded grove. We had a unique opportunity here to create a green environment inside the city. That costs a lot more money, because we are reducing the points of contact between the building and the ground. It’s easiest just to sink columns straight into the ground. We are the only project that is returning more open space to the environment than we are taking. And we decided not to put in a shopping mall, even though we had the option of doing that.”</p>",

Mallory has praised Farrakhan and attended his events, including a recent one in which he asserted that Jews control the media, Hollywood and Mexico.</p> \n<p>In its statement, the march accused those on the right of trying to drive a wedge between various groups of women.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Are U.S. Jews still more safe than the Jews of Europe? | Opinion</p> \n<p>“It’s important to remember that many on the right are thrilled to use any tool they can find to divide and undermine our movement — one that inspired the #WomensWave we saw this week in the midterm elections,” the statement said.</p> \n<p>The statement defended Sarsour and Mallory.</p> \n<p>“Our women of color leaders at the Women’s March have risked their safety to build a bold direct action strategy that addresses the real threat against our communities and country — the threat of white nationalism, which is fueled by anti-Black racism and anti-Semitism,” it said.</p> \n<p>“We all know the real cause of violence and oppression of our communities. This is well-documented and inspired by vile rhetoric coming from the Trump administration and from members of the Republican Party,” the statement concluded.</p> \n<p>The Women’s March is planning another march in Washington, D.C., for Jan. 19.</p> \n<p>Milano criticized Mallory and Sarsour in an article earlier this month in the Advocate for not distancing themselves from Farrakhan, who also has repeatedly made homophobic and transphobic comments.</p> \n<p>“Any time that there is any bigotry or anti-Semitism in that respect, it needs to be called out and addressed,” she said. “I’m disappointed in the leadership of the Women’s March that they haven’t done it adequately.”</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, after Mallory was criticized for not speaking out after she attended the event during which Farrakhan said “The powerful Jews are my enemy,” Sarsour defended Mallory.</p> \n<p>“I will not sit back while a strong, bold, unapologetic, committed Black woman who risks her life every day to speak truth to power and organize and mobilize movements is questioned, berated and abused,” Sarsour wrote on Facebook. “I stand with Tamika Mallory every day, with every fiber of my being because she has so much of what we need in the movement right now to win.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Rabbi Jonathan Sacks has no illusions about Jeremy Corbyn. In an interview with New Statesman that was published in late August, the former chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth called Corbyn an anti-Semite and denounced the British Labour Party leader’s statement that British Zionists “don’t want to study history and ... don’t understand English irony.” Sacks understands that Corbyn is accusing British Jews of dual loyalty, a classic anti-Semitic canard.</p> \n<p>Corbyn is a longtime supporter of Hamas and Hezbollah, which openly declare their desire to destroy Israel. Nevertheless, he has thus far won support from liberal Jews in Britain who have long seen Corbyn’s party as their home. For many years, Labour reflected their ideals — globalization, universalism and love of the “other.” Now, their world is collapsing around them.</p> \n<p>The British Jewish journalist Melanie Phillips assailed them in an essay in Britain’s Jewish Chronicle (September 13) for having been silent when Corbyn spouted anti-Semitic venom about Israel and painted it as a bloodthirsty occupier, a satanic state, yet being shocked now that he’s closing in on them.</p> \n<p>Denial of reality, shock and disbelief are classic responses to distress among liberal Jewish communities, from German Jews who, after the rise of the Nazis, refused to believe that their loyalty to Germany would end in their deaths, to Communist Jews in Stalin’s Soviet Union, who believed the blood libels against other Jews until they themselves were executed or exiled to prison camps in Siberia.</p> \n<p>Now as then, liberal Jews are trapped by their noble mission of “fighting from within.” In Britain, they refuse to admit that Corbyn prefers his Muslim friends to bleeding-heart Jews. And in France, philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy compares the Jews to Jonah the prophet, who was sent to persuade residents of Nineveh repent.</p> \n<p>The Jews must remain in France and fight so that it won’t fall into the hands of the barbarians, he said last year in a lecture at Bar-Ilan University. Levy’s barbarians aren’t just right-wing anti-Semites, but also the left-wing anti-Semites who fawn over Muslim voters, whose numbers are steadily growing in western Europe.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; It's not anti-Semitism if you just hate the bad Jews | Opinion</p> \n<p>Frighteningly, the old anti-Semitism of the right in Europe is increasingly joining hands with the anti-Semitism of the left and Muslim immigrants, and this combination is liable to reach the United States as well. The day is nearing when it will no longer be possible to distinguish between anti-Semitism toward the Jewish community, which espouses liberal and universalist values, and anti-Semitism toward Israel, “the Jew among the nations.” And it’s impossible to legitimize or forgive either of them, because they stem from the same poisoned root.</p> \n<p>I’m sorry for those enlightened, cosmopolitan Jews, but this must be said openly: Their mission to rehabilitate the haters and discover the light in their hearts has ended. They shouldn’t wait until Corbyn is elected prime minister of Britain, or until Linda Sarsour becomes head of the Democratic Party in the United States. They must correctly understand the historical process by which anti-Semitism effects a rapprochement between the radical right and the radical left and its Muslim supports.</p> \n<p>This is the time to start thinking about emigration. Luckily for them, their parents supported the establishment of Israel, and therefore, today they have a homeland and a country to which to flee.</p>",

President-elect Jair Bolsonaro’s plans to move Brazil’s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has upset Egypt and could stir trouble with other Islamic nations.</p> \n<p>“The reaction will be given not only as an individual country but on behalf of the whole Muslim world,” a Turkish diplomatic source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. “We are expecting Brazil to act with reason and not confront the Muslim world.”</p> \n<p>Brazil exports $16 billion annually to the Middle East and Turkey, with just 3% going to Israel, according to government statistics.</p> \n<p>Over a quarter of Brazil’s exports to the region are meat. Brazil’s JBS SA and BRF SA, the world’s top beef producer and poultry exporter, respectively, have bet big on the growing demand for halal meat.</p> \n<p>Brazil exports over $5 billion of halal meat a year, more than twice its nearest rivals, Australia and India, according to Salaam Gateway, a partnership between the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre and Thomson Reuters.</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro’s embassy proposal is part of his overhaul of Brazilian foreign policy, cozying up to major powers such as the United States and undoing what he calls leftist predecessors’ alliances based on “ideological bias.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Is Brazil about to elect Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right executioner of its democracy?&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Bolsonaro for the plan to move the embassy, calling him a “friend.”</p> \n<p>But after Egypt abruptly canceled a visit from Brazilian diplomats and business leaders this week, Bolsonaro said his decision was not final. The Egyptian embassy blamed a scheduling conflict.</p> \n<p>That sounded alarm bells in Brazil’s meat industry. BRF Chairman Pedro Parente said on a Thursday earnings call that the embassy issue was “cause for concern.”</p> \n<p>“We have a very important trade with Arab and halal markets,” he told journalists. “We are confident that when a discussion of the matter involves the relevant areas — the farm, trade and foreign ministries — they will certainly reach the best solution.”</p> \n<p>BRF’s halal business contributed a quarter of its operating revenue and nearly half its operating profit in the third quarter.</p> \n<p>Halal chicken represented nearly half of Brazil’s overall chicken exports of $7.1 billion last year, according to Brazil meatpacking group ABPA.</p> \n<p>“There is a $2-billion trade between Egypt and Brazil, mainly in the food agricultural sector, and within that sector mainly in beef and poultry,” Egypt’s Ambassador to Brazil Alaa Roushdy told Reuters.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;A win for BDS: Brazil's Gilberto Gil cancels show in Israel</p> \n<p>He declined to comment on a hypothetical move of the embassy or if it could have any impact on trade.</p> \n<p>BRF has processing plants in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to meet growing demand for halal meat. The company aims to double its output of processed products in the Gulf by 2023, its head of halal operations said at an October event.</p> \n<p>JBS sent more than an eighth of its exports to the Middle East and Africa in 2017, second only to the Greater China region.</p> \n<p>Representatives for JBS declined to comment on fallout from a potential embassy move.</p> \n<p>The Arab-Brazil Chamber of Commerce expects Brazil’s total exports to a group of 22 Arab countries to reach $20 billion by 2022, up from $13.5 billion in 2017.</p> \n<p>Rubens Hannun, the chamber’s president, said Brazil also stands to benefit from infrastructure investment from Arab sovereign funds. UAE’s Mubadala Development Co, for example, poured some $2 billion into Brazilian commodities empire EBX this decade.</p> \n<p>“We do not want any noise in this relationship,” Hannun said. “We are afraid that would open a door for the competition.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Could Moshe Leon, the man most likely to be Jerusalem’s next mayor after Tuesday’s election, also likely to be the costliest mayor in Israel’s history?</p> \n<p>It would well be because Leon could end up being the person who, by the year 2060, will cause tens of thousands of families to fall below the poverty line as the Haredi poverty rate rises to 25%. Per capita GDP growth will be 15% lower than it should have been and the national debt will grow threefold to 170% of GDP, a rate that spells bankruptcy for the State of Israel.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>How could Leon be responsible for all this? The answer is the political deals that everyone involved in is denying to ensure his election victory on Tuesday. The trade-off is this: The ultra-Orthodox parties Shas and Degel Hatorah agree to support Leon in exchange for Leon’s patron, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, softening his stance on the Haredi draft law.</p> \n<p>Whether or not there is a deal, the fate of Israel could well be determined these days. Even if Leon loses, the pressure is on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to come to a compromise, especially as early elections loom.</p> \n<p>If the law is passed by the Knesset according to the wording now being finalized by MK David Amsalem (Likud), the dystopian future of slow economic growth and bankruptcy, rising poverty and inequality are almost certain to come to pass.</p> \n<p>This isn’t idle speculation; it is the forecast of the Finance Ministry’s chief economist, predicated on the assumption that the levels of education and employment among Israel’s ultra-Orthodox remain at the same low levels they are today. With the Haredi population forecast to triple as a percentage of the national population to nearly a third in 2060, it will means a huge proportion of Israelis won’t be serving in the army, won’t be getting a modern, secular education and won’t be able to fill productive jobs.</p> \n<p>The State of Israel simply can’t survive under these conditions.</p> \n<p>The deliberations in Amselem’s committee on Haredi army service will decide which direction Israel takes. That is because there is a strong connection between drafting Haredi men and their later integration into the labor market.</p> \n<p>If the government abandons targets for drafting more Haredi men and the sanctions that are supposed to be imposed on yeshivot that don’t comply are softened, the effect on the economy will be profound. It will be even worse if the age is raised at which young ultra-Orthodox men can stop studying and go into the labor force with the threat of being drafted.</p> \n<p>As it is, the proposed legislation Amselem started with was a compromise that sought to provide enough recruits for the army without upsetting Haredi leaders too much. The annual threshold for the minimum number of Haredi draftees was hardly challenging, in fact it was even lower that the rate of growth right now. It’s now likely that the legislation will be watered down even more as it winds through Amselem’s committee.</p> \n<p>The idea that “he who doesn’t serve also won’t work” was enshrined in the Tal Law nearly two decades ago that sought to use the stick of unemployment to coax ultra-Orthodox men into the army. In fact, the real victim was secular Israelis, who ended up subsidizing the lives of the Haredi population: We educated the men to sit in a yeshiva all day at our expense.</p> \n<p>The formula of “no army service, no work” should be dispensed with, but the pending legislation sustains it by setting the age at which a Haredi man is free to enter the labor market at 24. That means those who don’t enlist must remain in the yeshiva till that age. They can only pursue a general education after that age, delaying their entry into the labor market.</p> \n<p>Forcing ultra-Orthodox men to remain in the yeshiva until that age is the current situation and the result is that only half of them are in the workforce, versus 88% for non-Haredi Israeli males. Those among the ultra-Orthodox who do work have low rates of productivity.</p> \n<p>The cost of this system comes in an equation calculated by Yohanan Plesner, Gilad Malach and Prof. Amichai Cohen of the Israel Democracy Institute. They found that in order to get 417 Haredi draftees every year, some 14,000 Haredi men ages 22-24 are stuck in yeshivot.</p> \n<p>Whether it’s a local one for Jerusalem or a national one, the deal means the Knesset debate will be go quickly without lawmakers spending the time to understand and weigh the impact of the law they are voting on. Those behind the scenes will be working to water it down.</p> \n<p>What will be left is to save the labor market by enabling the ultra-Orthodox to learn secular subjects like math, science and English and get technical and professional training while they are in the yeshiva. That may happen, at least, when they are free to leave they will have workplace skills and not have to learn the three Rs at age 24. Lowering the exemption age to 22 would help, too.</p> \n<p>Many will object that this will violate the principle of equal burden, but the threat facing Israel is to immense to let that delay a solution.</p>",

Sunday. Palestinian sources in Gaza said an Israeli force was operating inside the Gaza Strip, east of Khan Yunis. Palestinian officials said the group of Hamas men were fired at from a passing car.</p> \n<p>Palestinian sources told Haaretz that one of the casualties is Nour Baraka, a deputy commander of an elite unit of Iz al-Din al-Qassam, the military wing of Hamas. According to a statement from Hamas' military wing, Israeli forces entered Gaza in a civilian vehicle three kilometers east of Khan Yunis. The exchange of fire began after Israeli soldiers kiled Barake.</p> \n<p>Gazan officials identified the other casualties as 21-year-old Omar Jani Abu Hatar, Mohammad Majed Al-Qara, Ala Adin Koidar, Mustafa Hassan Abu Odeh, Mahmoud Atallah Masabach and Ala Fasifis.</p> \n<p>Late Sunday, responding to rumors and reports in Israel, the Israeli army took an unusual step and issued a statement denying that a soldier was abducted during the operation.</p> \n<p>Hamas spokesperson Fawzi Barhoum condemned the &quot;cowardly Israeli aggresion&quot; in his statement on the incident, adding that the Palestinian resistance is ready to carry out its duty and make the enemy pay a high price.</p> \n<p>The Homefront Command announced that schools would be closed on Monday. Residents of Gaza border communities received directions to remain near shelter overnight, but in these orders were canceled in the morning.</p> \n<p>“There were explosions and now it’s a little quieter,” said Roni Keisan, a resident of Kerem Shalom, a kibbutz near the Gaza border. “We can see a massive tank operations in the area. We set up the bomb shelter and are ready for a long sleepless night inside. In the meantime, the only information we’ve received is to stay within reach of sheltered areas.”</p> \n<p>The secretary of Kibbutz Be’eri, Hagi Yaniv, told Haaretz that residents had seen “planes and helicopters circling above the kibbutz” and had heard “explosions both near and far.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu cuts trip short</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, who is&nbsp;visiting in Paris,&nbsp;cut his trip short and is flying back to Israel overnight after receiving live updates and holding consultations on the topic. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman is holding consultations at the military headquarters in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Sunday, Netanyahu said at a briefing for reporters that he would rather explore the possibility of a long-term cease-fire with Hamas than go to war. He&nbsp;defended the decision&nbsp;to let suitcases stuffed with&nbsp;$15 million in cash from Qatar enter Gaza last week.</p> \n<p>“We want to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” he said. “At the moment, what’s undermining stability is internal volatility within Gaza, which it may be in our power to prevent.”</p> \n<p>Prior to the incident, Israeli officials had sounded relatively optimistic about the chances of achieving a long-term cease-fire. But the heavy exchanges of fire and the casualties suffered by Hamas are liable to complicate the situation, thereby forcing&nbsp;Egyptian&nbsp;intelligence officials to step up their pressure on both sides in order to restore quiet.</p> \n<p>The commander of the Gaza Division, Brig. Gen. Eliezer Toledano, met earlier on Sunday with representatives of Israeli communities near Gaza to discuss an incident on Friday in which a Palestinian penetrated Netiv Ha’asara, a moshav just north of Gaza, and&nbsp;torched a greenhouse. Toledano said the incident disturbed him greatly and the IDF would investigate how it happened.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Qatar reportedly finished paying the July salaries of Hamas officials on Saturday. Thousands of officials who have not received their salaries claim that they are part of Hamas' military wing. According to the deal, Qatari money will be transferred to civilian officials only.</p>",

His grit helped America win in the Argonne. Born March 10, 1894, Kaufman spent his earliest years on a farm upstate before the family settled in Brooklyn. Between his foreign heritage (his parents came from Russia) and being Jewish—not to mention his eight older siblings—he had to learn to defend himself. “Unless you could fight in East New York in Brooklyn at that time, you just didn’t have a chance,” he later recalled.&quot;  &quot;Jews were a disproportionately large percentage of the U.S. military in the First World War, and the government even appointed a number of Jewish chaplains to serve the Armed Forces. Still, suspicion and distrust of minorities festered. Jewish communities in America were a relatively recent phenomenon and retained a foreign aura. The U.S. military, like most institutions, was rife with anti-Semitism, and a Jewish soldier had to carefully navigate it. The war provided an international stage to showcase their contributions.&quot; [DailyBeast]  TOP TALKER — Saudis Close to Crown Prince Discussed Killing Other Enemies a Year Before Khashoggi’s Death — by&nbsp;Mark Mazzetti,&nbsp;Ronen Bergman&nbsp;and&nbsp;David Kirkpatrick:&nbsp;&quot;Top Saudi intelligence officials close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked a small group of businessmen last year about using private companies to assassinate Iranian enemies of the kingdom...&nbsp;George Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman, arranged the meeting. He had met previously with Prince Mohammed, and had pitched the Iran plan to Trump White House officials. Another participant in the meetings was Joel Zamel, an Israeli with deep ties to his country’s intelligence and security agencies.&quot;&nbsp;[NYTimes]  Jackson Diehl&nbsp;writes... &quot;Why is Israel tossing a lifeline to Jamal Khashoggi’s killers?&nbsp;Netanyahu’s problem is that in betting so heavily on Mohammed and Trump, he took a large risk with two very unstable actors, each of whom has polarized their political systems. If Mohammed survives... he will be weakened and wary. He won’t be able to deliver the Palestinians for Trump’s peace plan... Trump, too, has been weakened by the Democrats’ capture of the House of Representatives — and so has Netanyahu.&quot;  &quot;While key Democratic leaders in the incoming House, including likely speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), are staunchly pro-Israel, many of their new rank and file will not be. And a lot of Republicans, as well as Democrats, will be repelled by Netanyahu’s appeals on Mohammed’s behalf.&quot; [WashPost]  Once Censored, Billionaire Saudi Prince Returns to Spotlight — by Benoit Faucon&nbsp;and&nbsp;Summer Said:&nbsp;&quot;Billionaire Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal has returned as the kingdom’s public face for global investors...&nbsp;Another sign of Prince al-Waleed’s return to the royal court’s graces is his fresh spree of deals with international investors... He also is in talks with Leonard Blavatnik, owner of Warner Music Group, and other executives to invest in his Riyadh-based entertainment company, Rotana Media Group.&quot; [WSJ]  TRANSITION —&nbsp;A former head of the Mossad has joined controversial Israeli spy firm Black Cube — by&nbsp;Adam Pasick:&nbsp;&quot;Efraim Halevy, the former head of Israeli spy agency Mossad, has&nbsp;joined the board of Black Cube...&nbsp;Black Cube may soon face a US congressional subpoena seeking information about its operations targeting Ben Rhodes and Colin Kahl, former Obama national security officials who helped to forge the Iran nuclear deal. Democrats on the House government oversight committee unsuccessfully&nbsp;requested the subpoena in July, when they were in the minority; they are set to retake control in January following last week’s US midterm elections.&quot; [Quartz]&nbsp;  ULTIMATE DEAL WATCH —&nbsp;Trump's Israeli-Palestinian peace plan will be published &quot;soon&quot; — by Barak Ravid:&nbsp;&quot;White House Middle East peace envoy Jason Greenblatt said in a speech at a closed event in London earlier this week that the U.S. &quot;will soon be ready to publish&quot; President Trump's long awaited&nbsp;[peace] plan.&quot; [Axios]  Abbas threatens new measures against Hamas — by&nbsp;Khaled Abu Toameh:&nbsp;&quot;Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas... speaking during a rally in Ramallah on Sunday marking the 14th anniversary of the death of his predecessor, Yasser Arafat... lashed out at the US and Israel...&nbsp;“There is an American conspiracy in the form of the deal of the century, and there is an Israeli conspiracy to implement the deal,” Abbas said... Abbas said that the PLO Central Council... has decided to make a series of “decisive decisions” in the coming days to determine the future of Palestinian relations with Hamas, Israel and the US.&quot; [JPost]  ON THE GROUND —&nbsp;Covert Israeli military operation in Gaza exposed, igniting new tensions — by&nbsp;Ruth Eglash&nbsp;and Hazem Balousha:&nbsp;&quot;A senior Israeli military officer and seven militants, including a Hamas commander, were killed overnight Sunday after a covert operation by Israel inside the Gaza Strip appeared to have been exposed, sparking an exchange of fire, airstrikes and later a barrage of rocket fire... The Israeli military remained tight-lipped over exact details of the incident late Sunday night. A statement from the army’s General Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot only said a special force had been engaged in a “very meaningful operation for Israel’s security.” ... Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a trip to Paris over the weekend to return to Israel.&quot;&nbsp;[WashPost;&nbsp;NYTimes]  Netanyahu calls Paris conversation with Putin 'very important' — by Dan Williams:&nbsp;&quot;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin at World War One commemorations on Sunday, their first meeting since the downing of a Russian plane during an Israeli air raid in Syria in September. “The conversation with President Putin was good and businesslike. I would even describe it as very important,” Netanyahu told reporters after the ceremony in Paris, adding that he also spoke there with U.S. President Donald Trump.&quot; [Reuters]&nbsp;  Raphael Ahren reports:&nbsp;&quot;Some 70 world leaders attended the central memorial event Sunday on the foot of the Arc de Triomphe, but only Netanyahu, US President Donald Trump, and Russian President Vladimir Putin did not arrive at the venue with a bus like everyone else, but were ushered in separately. During the solemn event, Netanyahu and his wife Sara sat in the front row, next to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and only a few meters away from Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron.&quot; [ToI]&nbsp;  PIC OF THE DAY — Sara Netanyahu took a prominent place on the world stage in Paris yesterday when the spouses of the world leaders posed for a group photo in the Palace of Versailles.&nbsp;</p> \n<p> Wife of GOP megadonor to receive Presidential Medal of Freedom — by&nbsp;Quint Forgey:&nbsp;&quot;Miriam Adelson will receive the medal along with six other “distinguished individuals” at a ceremony on Friday, the White House said...&nbsp;In its brief biography of Miriam Adelson, the White House described her as “a committed doctor, philanthropist, and humanitarian,” as well as “a committed member of the American Jewish community.” [Politico]  HOW IT PLAYED ―&nbsp;Miriam Adelson gave the GOP millions. Trump is giving her the Medal of Freedom — by&nbsp;Michael Brice-Saddler:&nbsp;&quot;The release does not mention that the Adelsons also contributed&nbsp;at least $87 million to GOP candidates in the 2018 midterms...&nbsp;Adelson’s selection... raised some questions about her qualifications for the award and also whether the White House was rewarding a donor.&quot; [WashPost]&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvis, Babe Ruth, Miriam Adelson: Trump’s Very Trumpy Picks for the Medal of Freedom [VanityFair]  COMING SOON – Vice President Mike Pence&nbsp;will deliver the keynote address at the annual conference of the Israeli American Council on&nbsp;Friday, November 30th, in South Florida. The IAC&nbsp;is largely funded by Sheldon and Mirian Adelson.  HAPPENING TODAY —&nbsp;Pastor John Hagee, founder of&nbsp;Christians United for Israel,&nbsp;will be honored&nbsp;for his 60 years of ministry at an event hosted by CUFI in Jerusalem. Ambassador David Friedman is expected to deliver remarks in honor of Hagee. &quot;The State of Israel is fortunate to have you on our side,&quot; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to say in a video address, according to excerpts obtained by Jewish Insider.&nbsp;  ON THE HILL —&nbsp;&quot;The House&nbsp;has a light floor schedule this week... Expect plenty of non-controversial items including &quot;the posthumous award of a Congressional Gold Medal to Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl in recognition of his acts of valor during World War II.&quot; [Axios]  MIDTERMS — Dana Rohrabacher Loses, Eroding Republican Foothold in California — by&nbsp;Adam Nagourney:&nbsp;&quot;Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican fixture in California who represented Orange County for 15 terms, has lost his bid for re-election... [Harley] Rouda, 56, is a former Republican turned Democrat who&nbsp;became a symbol of the Democratic efforts&nbsp;to win back Congress this year. Mr. Rohrabacher, 71, was viewed as particularly vulnerable because he defended Russia in the midst of allegations about its efforts to intervene in elections in the United States.&quot; [NYTimes]  —&nbsp;During the campaign,&nbsp;Rohrabacher&nbsp;came under fire&nbsp;for&nbsp;attending a fundraiser with an alleged Holocaust denier and&nbsp;endorsing&nbsp;an alt-right activist&nbsp;criticized&nbsp;for anti-Semitism. &quot;It’s clear that Dana Rohrabacher has embraced anti-Semitism and individuals who support it,” Rouda charged in an interview with&nbsp;Jewish Insider&nbsp;last month.&nbsp;  DEEP DIVE —&nbsp;Inside Bill Browder's War Against Putin — by Marie Brenner:&nbsp;&quot;Browder’s eldest son, Joshua, was monitoring the Helsinki press conference from Palo Alto. The 21-year-old, who helps oversee his father’s digital operation, was taken aback when [Vladimir] Putin, with an expression of feline self-satisfaction, declared: “Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned $1.5 billion in Russia. They never paid any taxes. . . . We have a solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions, so we have an interest in questioning them.” Joshua immediately texted his father: “Now you have truly made it.” He heard nothing back. Then Joshua felt gut-punched. He saw Trump nod at Putin and call the idea of both sides questioning the other’s suspects as “an incredible offer.” The younger Browder recalled being “shocked. I was really concerned. I was picturing Department of Homeland Security agents coming for him.” [VanityFair]&nbsp;  INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE —&nbsp;A White House Challenge: Balancing the Roles of the First Lady and First Daughter — by&nbsp;Maggie Haberman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Katie Rogers:&nbsp;&quot;As her role has evolved, Ivanka Trump has let family friends know in the clearest terms that she is in the White House to help her father by using her charm and contacts to cut through Washington’s bureaucracy, particularly with Congress... Like her father, Ms. Trump is acutely aware of her news coverage: A rotating cast of White House aides have often tried to get her credit in the news media for issues she has worked on. Her meetings are often summarized by the White House press office and emailed to reporters, a move that is not routinely extended to other senior advisers to Mr. Trump.&quot;  &quot;Ivanka Trump’s interest in politics had led her to forge alliances with moderate Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine, as well as with newly minted Trump confidants like Mr. Graham.&quot; [NYTimes]  2020 WATCH —&nbsp;Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz assembles an elite PR team as he considers running for president — by Brian Schwartz:&nbsp;&quot;Democratic political strategist Hank Sheinkopf said he believes Schultz is putting together a group that could help in a variety of ways if he chooses to run for president. &quot;He wants to show people he can put together a team quickly and the best presidential campaigns have people from multidisciplinary sectors, from the private sector to those in political work. It's smart. The Clinton's first campaign had film makers. So did Ronald Reagan,&quot; Sheinkopf said.&quot;&nbsp;[CNBC]  Deval Patrick’s Presidential Prospects — by&nbsp;Jeffrey Toobin:&nbsp;&quot;Former Massachusetts Governor Deval&nbsp;Patrick is a businessman, but so are Michael Bloomberg, Howard Schultz, and Tom Steyer. Still, Patrick would enter the race with one significant distinction: he is a kind of political heir to Barack Obama, and enjoys broad support from people close to the former President... “Deval is a very genuine person, a very empathetic person,” David Axelrod, who has been a strategist for Patrick as well as for Obama, told me. “He is a guy who makes people feel comfortable. He’s very principled, you can see that—just like Obama.” [NewYorker]</p> \n<p>** Good Monday&nbsp;Morning!

He worries that Silicon Valley is undermining democracy and ushering in a dystopian hellscape in which voting is obsolete. He worries that by creating powerful influence machines to control billions of minds, the big tech companies are destroying the idea of a sovereign individual with free will...&nbsp;But lately, Harari is anxious about something much more personal. If this is his harrowing warning, then why do Silicon Valley C.E.O.s love him so? “One possibility is that my message is not threatening to them, and so they embrace it?” a puzzled Mr. Harari said one afternoon in October. “For me, that’s more worrying. Maybe I’m missing something?”  &quot;When Mr. Harari toured the Bay Area this fall to promote his latest book, the reception was incongruously joyful. Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, threw him a dinner party. The leaders of X, Alphabet’s secretive research division, invited Mr. Harari over... “I’m drawn to Yuval for his clarity of thought,” Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter and Square, wrote in an email, going on to praise a particular chapter on meditation.&quot;&nbsp;[NYTimes]&nbsp;  STARTUP SPOTLIGHT —&nbsp;YieldStreet wants to make exotic bets available to individual investors online — by&nbsp;Josh Saul&nbsp;and&nbsp;Claire Boston:&nbsp;&quot;YieldStreet is selling alternative investments normally reserved for billionaires and hedge funds to individuals who are so-called accredited investors...

If YieldStreet gets its way, it will be poised to grow.

The reasons include competition from American companies such as&nbsp;Alphabet&nbsp;Inc.’s&nbsp;Google, Amazon and Microsoft Corp.&nbsp;that are willing to pay high salaries for Israeli talent. Israel’s immigration laws also make it difficult to import skilled non-Jewish workers.&quot; [WSJ]  HOLLYWOOD —&nbsp;Gerard Butler posts image of Malibu home burned in wildfire — by Danielle Garrand:&nbsp;&quot;The&nbsp;Woolsey and Hill Fires&nbsp;have been blazing through Southern California, forcing some residents to flee their homes and hope there will be something left when they come back. Actor&nbsp;Gerard Butler&nbsp;returned to his Malibu residence Sunday and&nbsp;posted a devastating photo&nbsp;showing it in ruins.&quot; [CBSNews]&nbsp;  — Amy Spiro tweets:&nbsp;&quot;Last month, visiting Israel, Gerard Butler said he hoped his house in Los Angeles would burn down so he'd have an excuse to stay in Israel. This week... Gerard Butler's house in Los Angeles burned down.&quot;&nbsp;  PROFILE —&nbsp;Ofer Berkovitch: The secular mayor candidate challenging Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox bloc for the soul of the holy city — by&nbsp;Raf Sanchez:&nbsp;&quot;Ofer Berkovitch, a 35-year-old city councilor... is facing off in Tuesday’s election against Moshe Lion, a Right-wing politician who once worked for Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. While Mr. Lion is only moderately religious, he has courted ultra-Orthodox leaders...&nbsp;Mr. Berkovitch, the underdog in the race, has accused his opponent of “backroom deals.&quot; “We’re not against the ultra-Orthodox, we want to serve everyone. But we want to have services for everyone, not one community above the other,” he said...&nbsp;He goes into Tuesday’s final round of the election as the underdog. But not all the ultra-Orthodox rabbis have backed Mr. Lion and some have scorned him because of his links to Israel’s secular defence minister.&nbsp;Mr. Berkovitch is hoping those divisions among ultra-Orthodox voters will leave open up a path for him to reach the mayor's office.&quot; [Telegraph]  How Daniel Barenboim's orchestra of Israeli and Arab musicians is faring in the current political climate — by Mark Swed:&nbsp;“Classical music is a very important element in a human being’s life,” stresses Daniel Barenboim, who is sitting in his office at the Staatsoper unter der Linden, Berlin State Opera, which he has headed since 1992...&nbsp;His West-Eastern Divan Orchestra formed in 1999 to train young Israeli and Arab musicians together. And right now he is moving WEDO across America...&nbsp;Barenboim... is just as adamant in his condemnation of violence on both sides as he is on Israel’s right for security. As for anti-Semitism: “It must be fought and as hard as possible; there is no excuse for it.” [LATimes]  Scott Shay writes...&nbsp;&quot;What is unique about anti-Semitism?&nbsp;It is not the Jews’ success, nor their actual power that is the source of anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism has often proliferated at times when the Jews were poor and powerless. Jews who tried returning to their home towns in Europe after surviving the concentration camps could certainly attest to that. Rather, it is the Jews’ historic connection with monotheism that has made them the central target of this projected idolatry.&quot; [PostGazette]  SCENE OVER THE WEEKEND —&nbsp;Met Council CEO David Greenfield and Rabbi Mendel Zarchi hosted a&nbsp;reception Friday night at the annual SOMOS conference, a confab of Hispanic officials in Puerto Rico at the Chabad Center in San Juan.

With&nbsp;Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times... Unlike Anne Frank and thousands of other Jews who spent all or part of World War II sequestered in attics, caves or sewers, Rose Zar survived the Holocaust by hiding in the open. In October 1942, when she was 19, her father feared that the Nazis were closing in on the ghetto where they lived, in Piotrkow, Poland.

        "text":["<p>Israel and the Palestinian factions agreed to a cease-fire that would follow the agreement the two sides reached in 2014, a diplomatic source told Haaretz on Tuesday evening after three days of&nbsp;hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>&quot;The situation remains very precarious and can blow up again,&quot; the foreign source who is involved in the agreement added.</p> \n<p>&quot;What we have seen in the past 48 hours was very dangerous and no efforts should be spared to avoid similar flare-ups. However, and on the bright side of all of this, the fuel shipments, under the UN’s supervision, continued to flow into the Strip unhindered,&quot; the source said.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Hamas tries to dictate new rules in Gaza, but it may be misjudging Israel&nbsp;■&nbsp;Gaza violence: Just another flare-up on the road to a long-term deal</p> \n<p>An Israeli official responded earlier to cease-fire reports, saying that a cease-fire has been reached and that &quot;Israel reserves its freedom to operate.&quot;</p> \n<p>The official added that &quot;requests by Hamas to form a cease-fire came from four different mediators. Israel responded that developments on the ground will determine [the Israeli reaction].&quot; The four mediators the official mentioned are Egypt, the United Nations, Norway and Switzerland.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian factions in Gaza released a joint statement saying that &quot;a cease-fire has been reached and we have responded to Egyptian efforts on this matter.&quot; The Palestinian factions also stated that they are &quot;committed to the cease-fire as long as Israel doesn't break it and doesn't attack the Palestinian people.&quot;</p> \n<p>Hamas, the group ruling the coastal enclave, said it &quot;really appreciates efforts alongside different entities to obtain a cease-fire and we thank and cherish the Egyptian effort and the international effort, as well as the role the Norwegians and Qataris played.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hamas also thanked the Palestinian people and stated that it was proud of Palestinians &quot;for standing strong in backing forces of the resistance until victory was had in pushing off Israeli aggression.&quot;</p> \n<p>The UN Security Council announced that it will convene later Tuesday for a special session following the escalation in hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel's envoy to the UN, Danny Danon, said ahead of the meeting that Israel &quot;will not accept a call for 'both sides to act with restraint.'&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;There is a side that attacks and fires 400 rockets toward civilians and there is a side that protects its civilians. Every member country in the Security Council ought to ask itself how it would respond after a barrage of missiles is fired at its people,&quot; Danon stated.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The United States on Tuesday condemned rocket and missile attacks from Gaza into Israel and said it stood with Israel as it defends itself.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We condemn in the strongest terms the rocket, missile and mortar attacks that are taking place from Gaza into Israel,&quot; U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a news briefing. &quot;We call for the sustained halt of those attacks. We stand with Israel as Israel defends itself against these attacks. It is simply unacceptable to target civilians.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Celebrations in Gaza, demonstrations in Israel</p> \n<p>Israelis took the streets of Sderot, one of the main cities in southern Israel to suffer from the rocket threat, to express their dismay following news of the cease-fire.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One protester told Haaretz: &quot;I'm protesting over the oversight, the disgrace, the silencing. The cease-fire agreement that has just been signed is very, very sad. We're very angry at the government. We expected them to do something to stop terror. But a cease-fire, especially one announced by Hamas, is not what we expected.&quot;</p> \n<p>Hundreds of protesters gathered at the entrance to Sderot, blocking roads and burning tires. Residents of the city were joined by Israelis from Gaza-border communities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel Police forces were dispatched to disperse the demonstration.</p> \n<p>Minutes after the cease-fire was announced, the Israeli army said that Iron Dome missile defense batteries intercepted over 100 rockets out of the 460 rockets that were fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip during the three-day round of hostilities. The Israeli military attacked 160 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terror targets in the Strip, among which were four unique terror assets.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman's bureau released a statement following news on the emerging cease-fire in which it denied previous reports that said Lieberman supported a halt to Israeli strikes on Gaza.</p> \n<p>&quot;The defense minister's stance is consistent and hasn't chaged. [News of] Lieberman's support of halting attacks are fake,&quot; the statement read. Education Minister Naftali Bennett also released a statement denying he supported any kind of cease-fire.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Associates of the defense minister said that from the moment the latest round of hostilities began, he demanded that Israel take a &quot;tough and resolute action against Hamas.&quot; Sources close to Bennett said that he &quot;firmly resisted [a cease-fire] in the clearest way possible.&quot;</p> \n<p>Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked and Jerusalem Affairs Minister Zeev Elkin also contested the cease-fire at the cabinet meeting.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, other sources said that all of the cabinet ministers eventually came to support defense officials' stance that Israel should act to end hostilities. Minister Yoav Galant said in an interview with the Israel Television Company that the dispute in the cabinet meeting was not over whether a cease-fire should be implemented but rather on what future steps Israel ought to take.</p> \n<p>Some cabinet ministers claimed after news broke of the cease-fire agreement that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &quot;imprisoned&quot; them in the conference room, alluding to the notion that while they were discussing potential solutions to the escalation, the premier was aware that there were already advances underway to promote a cease-fire.</p> \n<p>Israel's security cabinet convened for six hours and&nbsp;was briefed by IDF officials on the attacks and extensive actions against terror elements in Gaza.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In Gaza, Clerics in government offices received news of the cease-fire by announcing that they will return to work starting Wednesday morning. Parades celebrating the halt in hostilities started throughout the Strip on Tuesday evening, as part of attempts by Hamas and other Palestinian factions to convey a sense of victory to Gazans.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Palestinian reports said Israel struck in northern Gaza. The attack reportedly resulted in casualties and Gaza’s Health Ministry said a 29-year-old man identified as Khaled Maaruf was killed.</p> \n<p>The head of Hamas' political wing, Ismail Haniyeh, spoke for the first time about the escalation since the flare-up began, saying on Tuesday afternoon that &quot;if Israel stops the airstrikes, we can return to the cease-fire understandings.&quot;</p> \n<p>A&nbsp; different Hamas official stated earlier that “as soon as Israel stops its aggression on the Gaza Strip, the forces of the resistance will halt the fire. All mediators must stop Israel.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu spoke on the phone with French President Emmanuel Macron about the ongoing tensions.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu thanked Macron for hosting him in Paris for a conference&nbsp;marking the 100th anniversary of World War I's end earlier this week, and apologized for having left the conference early in order to return to Israel due to the hostilities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu told the French president that Israel was enforcing its right to protect itself from terror elements that are acting to hurt Israeli civilians. The premier also said that the international community ought to continue its efforts to curb Iranian aggression in the region.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>'Completely different'</p> \n<p>Israel came under a heavy barrage of rocket fire from the Gaza Strip starting Monday, a day after a flare-up in which&nbsp;an Israeli officer&nbsp;and seven Palestinians were killed. An&nbsp;anti-tank missile launched from Gaza hit a bus&nbsp;in southern Israel Monday afternoon, severely wounding a 19-year-old soldier.</p> \n<p>The projectiles fired from the Strip hit Israel in a number of locations. In Asheklon, a 40-year-old man was killed&nbsp;after a house was hit by a rocket late Monday night. Two women who were in the same building at the time of the incident are said to be in critical condition. The fatality is a man from the West Bank Palestinian city of Hebron, not an Israeli citizen as initially suggested by local media.</p> \n<p>The victim was found by other civilians buried in the rubble an hour after police and firefighters had already left, in what neighbors described as a &quot;terrible failure&quot; to locate him.</p> \n<p>Rescue operations at the building had identified a&nbsp;60-year-old woman, unconscious with blast wounds and multiple injuries, around 40 minutes after the house was hit, but had altogether missed the other casualties. The other victims were spotted by a man who had come to take pictures of the damage one hour after the hit.</p> \n<p>Israel Police said comprehensive searches were conducted by emergency and rescue forces, &quot;sometimes while risking their lives, in dozens of sites where rockets fell in the south, with their primary objective being to save human lives and prevent them being harmed.&quot;</p> \n<p>The statement emphazised that during the searches, the structure was under the immediate threat of collapse, due to gas canisters catching fire.</p> \n<p>In Gaza, seven Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes during the latest round of violence, according to Palestinian sources. The Israel Air Force struck over 100 Hamas and Islamic Jihad targets overnight Monday, including an intelligence compound said to be located in the heart of the city next to a school, a mosque and diplomatic facilities.</p> \n<p>The complex itself houses a kindergarten and a munitions warehouse. The Israeli army said it is used for intelligence gathering, research and development. Hamas' Public Security offices were also hit, said the spokesperson.</p> \n<p>A senior Air Force officer said on Tuesday that the airstrikes Monday overnight were &quot;completely different from anything we've known in the past. These are targets of high-rise buildings in city centers.&quot; According to the officer, such targets were only struck twice during the entire campaign of 2014's Operation Protective Edge. &quot;Just tonight, we've hit four&quot; of these targets, he said.</p> \n<p>&quot;We've learned how to attack these targets at the heart of residential neighborhoods and obliterate them without killing anyone in the strike. We uphold our values, we're not fighting against civilians,&quot; said the officer, adding they were acting to &quot;exact a price from the other side.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>IAF also fired at a Palestinian said to be a member of a group launching rockets in the northern Gaza Strip. An Israeli helicopter also struck &quot;a number of suspects&quot; trying to cross the border fence in the north of the Strip, the spokesperson added.</p> \n<p>Palestinians reports claim that a man who was killed during the Israeli strike was 26-year-old Khaled Sultan, a farmer, and not part of a group launching rockets.</p> \n<p>Another Palestinian report Tuesday says an Israeli helicopter opened fire on a group of people east of Gaza City, claiming one was killed and several were wounded. The man killed was Mussab Hus, 23, Palestinian reports said.</p> \n<p>Hamas' military wing spokesman said Monday that Be'er Sheva and Ashdod would be targeted next if &quot;Israel persisted in its aggression.&quot; The Islamic Jihad echoed the statement, saying Gaza factions have the capacity to continue their offensive.</p> \n<p>Senior Hamas official Husan Badran said Tuesday that &quot;if Netanyahu is interested in ending this round, he must fire [Defense Minister] Lieberman, who in his foolish conduct caused the escalation.&quot;</p> \n<p>The office of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories posted a statement on its Arabic Facebook page, saying: &quot;Hamas and the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip are the ones bringing ruin upon Gazans! The persistent launching of rockets at Israel have grave repercussions in the Gaza Strip. Residents of Gaza, terrorism has repercussions.&quot;</p> \n<p>Following a situation assessment, the Israeli army eased security restrictions for residents of southern Israel, including school activity within sheltered institutions. People are allowed to leave bomb shelters, but were instructed to remain in their vicinity.</p> \n<p>Schools will be closed in most major southern Israeli cities, including Be'er Sheva, Sderot, Ashkelon, Kiryat Malachi, Kiryat Gat and Ashdod. Students in regional councils Sha'ar Hanegev, Eshkol, Merchavim and Sedot Hanegev will also not attend school.</p> \n<p>The Israeli army reinforced Armored Corps and Infantry units near the Strip, the IDF Spokesperson's Unit said.</p> \n<p>Reuters contributed to this report.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Women and girls in the&nbsp;Bedouin community are frequently raped and abused from a young age. These cases are rarely reported, as the victims are not only blamed and shamed, but could be murdered, say therapists at recently opened units to treat sexual assault victims in the Bedouin community.</p> \n<p>The Social Services Ministry has recently opened two such units in the Bedouin sector in the south. Their location is kept secret, for the safety of both the victims and staff members.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>One of the units’ patients is a 23-year old Bedouin woman, who had been raped by a relative from the age of 12. At 15 she ran away from home to the Tel Aviv bus terminal, where, penniless and unable to speak even basic Hebrew, she was gang raped in the street. She returned home. Three years later she was raped again, this time by a man who courted her, then forced himself on her. Today she is suicidal, suffers from deep depression and eating disorders, cries a lot and hardly leaves her home.</p> \n<p>“A similar unit for the Arab community was opened in Be’er Sheva eight years ago,” says Liat Armerman, the ministry’s district supervisor for youth services in the south.</p> \n<p>“But the Bedouin women were afraid of coming to a treatment center in a large city, where they could be identified,” she says. “Also, many of them don’t have a car or means to travel from a remote village to the city. There was also difficulty to establish trust with a therapist who didn’t speak Arabic.”</p> \n<p>After failed past attempts, it was finally made possible to open two treatment units in the Bedouin communities, Armerman says. An attempt to open two additional units in other Bedouin communities failed.</p> \n<p>Yasmin (fictitious name), 37, a Bedouin social worker specializing in treating teens and young women in distress, manages the units with Samar, 29, an Israeli Arab with a degree in gender studies. The two asked to remain anonymous to avoid exposing their patients.</p> \n<p>“There are winds of change in Bedouin society,” says Yasmin, married and a mother, who wears a traditional hijab. “In my community we were raised to think that women who didn’t study were flawed. I dreamed of academic studies from a young age and have achieved my ambitions. But there are tribes, villages and communities in which women are oppressed, not allowed out of the house to study and develop. Today a new generation of young women goes to university, although tradition and social norms are still blocking many of them.”</p> \n<p>Samar, wearing a fashionable dress and no head covering, says she always dreamed of improving women’s status in Arab society. “I saw how much these women suffered from oppression and always wanted to change the situation,” she says.</p> \n<p>The silence among Bedouin sexual assault victims is even deeper than in other societies. “Until a few years ago a victim wouldn’t talk at all,” says Yasmin. “Bedouin rape victims feel they are always to blame. As soon as one opens her mouth and tells – she’s always to blame and it can lead to her death. She will be accused of bringing it on herself. Of wearing something provocative or tempting the man, regardless of the circumstances.</p> \n<p>“Many victims don’t know that what happened to them is rape or that it’s against the law. But even those who do are restricted by the thought of the heavy price their female relatives and father will have to pay,” she says.</p> \n<p>In recent years, however, there has been a gradual, cautious awakening. “It’s a drop in the ocean but women are slowly beginning to talk,” Yasmin says. “There are more reports than ever. Young women are exposed to knowledge, stories, NGOs, school counselors talk to them in class. The silence is beginning to break.”</p> \n<p>There are no accurate figures on sexual assaults, but Yasmin and Samar say the cases they deal with involve repetitive, brutal rape and other forms of abuse. “Clearly what we know is the tip of the iceberg and most incidents aren’t reported and are silenced, especially in the poorest villages where women’s oppression is most prevalent.”</p> \n<p>In one case, which is by no means rare, Yasmin tells of a 15-year old shepherd girl who fell pregnant after being gang-raped, without being aware of the pregnancy. Since the tribe’s girls and women are covered from head to toe, nobody noticed her condition.</p> \n<p>Just before giving birth the girl felt bad and was taken to hospital. The staff spoke to her, while her father and brother waited in the hall, absorbed in their cell phones, unaware what was going on inside. The medical staff whisked the girl through a hidden corridor to the delivery room, where the baby was delivered successfully.</p> \n<p>“Social workers and a judge, wearing a medical cloak as camouflage, were brought to arrange an instant adoption, while the father and brother were told a different story. All this was done so that the girl could return home safely. Had the father and brother known what was happening she would have been murdered,” says Yasmin.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Everyone on the spectrum between Meir Kahane and Meretz shares a common denominator, on the basis of which they are all considered Zionists. This common denominator consists of two tenets. According to one, Jews have strong reasons for interpreting their collective existence as nationhood; according to the other, that nationhood is to be realized in the Land of Israel. Most of the justifications for these two tenets appear in Israel’s Declaration of Independence. Israeli scholars have interpreted these justifications in two ways, both of which imply Jewish supremacy over the Arabs in the country.</p> \n<p>According to one reading, Jewish nationhood has not lapsed, and the Jews’ ownership of the Land of Israel was never lost even when they were physically cut off from it, because that severance was forced upon them. That fact catches two birds with one stone: It precludes the expiration of either the Jews’ nationhood or of their ownership over Palestine. This proprietary interpretation of Zionism implies the supremacy of the Jews – at least as a collective – over everyone else living in that land: they are its landlords.</p> \n<p>The foundations of the religious version of this interpretation need no explanation. The academic basis for its secular version was provided by ideological historians during the early years of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in the 1930s. The most prominent of these was Ben-Zion Dinur, who would later serve as minister of education in several early Mapai (Labor) governments. The primary motif of Dinur’s historical writings – with respect to the Jewish people and the Land of Israel during the pre-Zionist period – was the centrality of the land in the daily life of Diaspora Jews. According to Dinur, and to Israel’s Declaration of Independence, the Jews never ceased striving to return and take possession of their land. As a result, their proprietary right to it never lapsed. This implies that Arab possession of the land, at least at the collective level, must be considered that of a plunderer, or of someone occupying a stolen property.</p> \n<p>The second prevalent interpretation of Zionism justifies Jewish supremacy by invoking nations’ universal right to self-determination. It interprets this as “a right to a nation-state — a state whose institutions and official public culture […] offers special benefits to the people with whom the state is identified. At the same time, it puts those citizens who are not members of the preferred national community at a disadvantage.” These are the words of Israeli legal scholar Ruth Gavison, who is supported by other renowned experts on law and political theory. The latter cite examples from other countries. The 2003 book “Israel and the Family of Nations: The Jewish Nation-State and Human Rights,” coauthored by Amnon Rubinstein, a constitutional law professor and former minister of education, and the historian and political theorist Alexander Yakobson, is the bible of such examples.</p> \n<p>Judaism and cat lovers</p> \n<p>There is no doubt that these approaches reflect the mainstream Zionist position. Intellectuals like Gavison, Rubinstein or Shlomo Avineri do not critique it. On the contrary, their reputation amounts to a knockdown argument in the hands of the mainstream. However, at the same time, they also constitute easy targets for the post-Zionist and anti-Zionist thought that has developed in Israel during the past 30 years.</p> \n<p>Some post-Zionist critiques of the mainstream approaches are lethal indeed. But others lead to conclusions that are just as groundless as those they are critiquing. Prominent examples of post-Zionists include historian Shlomo Sand and sociologist Uri Ram. They argue against attributing nationhood to the Jews, on the grounds that world Jewry at the end of the 19th century – and today as well – lacks the essential characteristics of a nation, namely a common territory and culture. From this they conclude that attributing nationhood to the Jews belongs to the realm of the bizarre (Ram) and is like attributing nationhood to the world collective of cat lovers (Sand).</p> \n<p>Apparently, that argument should have been imparted to Count Clermont-Tonnerre, who declared in the French National Assembly after the Revolution that his country would grant Jews full rights as individuals – and zero rights as a nation. If he’d known what Ram and Sand know, he could have spared himself the announcement. The Jews in the 19th and preceding centuries – and today, as well – indeed do not constitute a fully fledged nation in the way that the Poles do, for example. But it does not follow from this that they are a full-fledged non-nation in the way that the community of cat lovers is (just as the fact that a pen without ink is not a full-fledged pen doesn’t mean that it is a full- fledged non-pen in the way that a ruler is, for example).</p> \n<p>What makes world Jewry a nation in a partial sense is, among other things, the fact that its social profile – as expressed in the religion of Jews and in their non-Jewish social environments, their art, their music and their entire fabric of life – has been that of a nation originating in Palestine. That profile largely determined the attitude toward Jews in the societies in whose midst they have lived. It was the reason for their persecution in Europe. It is also the reason Zionism offered them what it did: an opportunity to be transformed from being a Palestinian nation only in their social profile into a real and concrete nation in the Land of Israel.</p> \n<p>One can of course ask whether all this was justified, but that’s an issue post-Zionist academics don’t address. They criticize Dinur and the Zionist movement’s principle of Jewish nationhood not only because they misinterpret the notion of nationhood, but also because they ground it in a false historiography. And they are correct: A few spurts of immigration to Palestine by fragments of communities throughout the second millennium no more establish the agency of a Jewish collective and its intentionality to return to the Land of Israel than the emigration of many Israelis from this land since the inception of Zionism is sufficient to attribute the opposite intention to the Jewish collective.</p> \n<p>But again, the post-Zionists leap from a well-founded critique to unfounded conclusions. For example, in place of the historiography put forward by mainstream Zionism – namely that Jewry’s full national continuity has persisted since antiquity – Sand tries to argue that, because, according to him, there is purportedly no genetic continuity between ancient and modern Jewry, it follows that the Jewish nationhood engendered by Zionism is a total fabrication, a nationhood created out of thin air.</p> \n<p>If the false historiography that underpins proprietary Zionism weren’t bad enough, the political morality it relies upon is equally objectionable. It is a political morality that allows individuals and groups to create territorial rights unilaterally by grabbing land; it assumes that the sins of forefathers can be inherited by their descendants; it implies supremacy over today’s Palestinians because of the plunder that the settlers, along with Dinur, attribute to their ancestors of more than 1,000 years ago.</p> \n<p>Gravest of all, proprietary Zionism encourages policy makers not only to realize a Jewish supremacy of the type manifested in the recently adopted nation-state law and many other Israeli statutes, but also to perpetuate the state of affairs that has emerged in the West Bank in recent decades: a Jewish supremacy that sinks its jaws on a daily and ongoing basis into the life and tissue of Palestinians, and into their most basic human rights. This is a Zionism that in English would be called “rabid.”</p> \n<p>Jewish supremacy vs. international values</p> \n<p>Not surprisingly, we find very few proprietary Zionists among contemporary Israeli scholars of law and political theory – individuals who are trained in applying critical thinking to political and legal matters. Gavison, Rubinstein and Yakobson justify the status of the Jews in the Land of Israel not by inventing historical grounds for a revival of rights acquired unilaterally in antiquity, but on the basis of the modern, universally acknowledged right to national self-determination.</p> \n<p>However, they present that right misleadingly, as if it justified a hierarchy vesting the Jews with a supreme status. Both Gavison’s definition, quoted here, and the analogies with other countries offered by Rubinstein and Yakobson – which allow for Jewish supremacy – are misleading in terms of international law, comparative politics and the accepted view among Western political theorists. True, the right to national self-determination confers some privileges upon the members of the ethnic and/or cultural group entitled to it within a particular country. But the privileges in question, such as collective language rights, or rights to representation in the public sphere of their country, are privileges only as compared with those of people who have become citizens through immigration.</p> \n<p>The Flemish and the Walloon peoples in Belgium possess linguistic and cultural privileges relative to their country’s citizens of Colombian, Ukrainian or Arab origins. Neither the Flemish nor the Walloon population of Belgium enjoys supremacy over the other. Both possess equal collective privileges by virtue of their ethno-cultural belonging. True, in Germany, ethno-cultural Germans are privileged vis-&agrave;-vis all other citizens. However, this is so because there is no other distinct group of citizens in Germany that has good reasons for viewing Germany as its ethnic and/or cultural homeland as such.</p> \n<p>The post-Zionist academics do not assail Gavison and Rubinstein for their scholarly errors. Instead, as usual, they draw on errors made by the academic spokespeople of mainstream Zionism in order to make errors of their own. An example has been provided recently on the pages of Haaretz (Hebrew edition) by the political scientist Neve Gordon of Ben-Gurion University. He informed his readers that as a professor he imparted (what I take to be) errors of the kind made by Gavison and Rubinstein to another Haaretz op-ed writer, Nave Dromi, when she was his student. Because she internalized what he taught her so well, and because she chose Zionism, Gordon argues that Dromi is working for Jewish supremacy; whereas he, because he chose equality, is working against Zionism.</p> \n<p>Because Gavison’s, Rubinstein’s and Gordon’s conception of the right to national self-determination is misleading, the choice between Zionism and equality is a false one. The right to self-determination must be interpreted as privileging homeland groups, such as the Germans in Germany and the Flemish and the Walloon peoples in Belgium, vis-&agrave;-vis immigrant groups in these countries and not vis-&agrave;-vis each other. In Israel, it should not be interpreted as privileging the Jews vis-&agrave;-vis Palestinians. Rather, it should privilege both groups vis-&agrave;-vis, for example, Filipino migrants, regarding their collective cultural and national rights.</p> \n<p>The bride’s dilemma</p> \n<p>It could be argued that the above disqualification of proprietary Zionism rules out the possibility of viewing the Jews as a group that has grounds for seeing the Land of Israel as its homeland, and that therefore national privileges in Israel accrue only to the Palestinians. At most, it could be added, national privileges accrue to Israeli Jews in the way that they accrue to the settler-colonialist nations of the New World. These rights accrue to the Israeli Jews not because there was any historical justification for them as Jews living outside this land to establish full-fledged Jewish nationhood in Palestine, but rather because they accidentally developed a distinct national history and identity after they accidentally settled in Palestine of all places. This – the argument would proceed – is not Zionism, but rather a sheer post- and anti-Zionism. The first alternative specified above is unreservedly anti-Zionist, for it rejects the Zionist formation of a Jewish nation in Palestine both before the event and after it. The second option is also anti-Zionist, because it denies any acceptable justificatory ties between Israeli Jewry, on the one hand, and the history and the interests of the world Jewish collective, on the other.</p> \n<p>But these conclusions are erroneous. Rejecting the historical bond between the Jews of antiquity and the Land of Israel as a basis for modern Jewish ownership of this land is not to deny that that bond was a major component of the social profile of modern Jewry. As noted, this bond only serves as a basis for their social profile as a Palestinian nation. Because of that profile, the Jews were partially a nation even before their Israeli segment became a full-fledged nation. Since this profile was a major cause of their persecution, Zionism proposed a national solution for it. It was only natural for Zionism to prefer the land with which Jews’ identity as a nation was associated over other sites contemplated for it, such as Uganda and Argentina.</p> \n<p>However, this is not enough. The land was wholly Arab in its demography and in the culture of its public sphere, and remains partly so today. Anyone who makes do with the connection between the Land of Israel and the Jews’ identity as a nation in order to justify the realization of Zionism in it is like a man who find a cure for his loneliness by marrying a woman he loves, even though she is already married. For him to prefer her over others is justified, of course. But a serious obstacle lies in the path of fulfilling that justified preference: The woman is already married.</p> \n<p>Proprietary Zionism solves this problem by arguing that it’s the Arabs who stole the bride, and that Zionism is only an attempt to restore her to her legal husband. But the reasons that have been mentioned here seem sufficient for rejecting this form of Zionism, indeed contemptuously.</p> \n<p>The only justification that makes it possible to overcome the current obstacle is one of the central justifications in the Zionist repertoire. It appears in the sixth paragraph of Israel’s Declaration of Independence: “The catastrophe which recently befell the Jewish people – the massacre of millions of Jews in Europe – was another clear demonstration of the urgency of solving the problem of its homelessness by re-establishing in Eretz-Israel the Jewish State.”</p> \n<p>These words justify Zionism not as the realization of ownership of the land that has not lapsed since antiquity. They justify it as a necessity in resolving the Jewish problem of modernity. They make it possible to interpret the Jewish people solving its problem in the terms by which criminal law interprets a critically wounded person breaking into a drugstore to steal the medication that would save his life. The act in question is normally criminalized but is permitted – with serious reservations – in emergencies.</p> \n<p>Concrete fabric</p> \n<p>The approach that emerges from the argument so far, apart from relying on an egalitarian conception of the right to self-determination, justifies Zionism by distinguishing between two issues. First, why prefer the Land of Israel over other places as the geographical site for the realization of Jewish nationhood? Second, what is the justification for realizing this preference despite the fact that the land was Arab? The key to answering the first question is the Jews’ social profile in modernity, which consists of having been a Palestinian nation in antiquity. The key to answering the second is the necessity created by the persistence and intensity of Jewish persecution in modernity.</p> \n<p>This account renders the current interpretation of Zionism egalitarian not only with respect to the status of both Jews and Palestinians at the time of any future settlement of their conflict, namely as enjoying an equal realization of their right to self-determination. It renders them equal also with respect to their relative status at the inception of their conflict. It views both of them as victims and neither of them as a proprietor vis-&agrave;-vis a plunderer.</p> \n<p>This account also clarifies the distinction between Israel and nations that were constituted by European colonialism. The nationhood consisting particularly of Jews and constituted by Zionism particularly in Palestine ties the history and fate of this particular people to this particular country. Preventing a recurrence of that history was the formative goal of political Zionism. The colonization of Palestine was its means for turning a people that was persecuted because it was conceived of as an ancient Palestinian people into a concrete Palestinian nation.</p> \n<p>The egalitarian Zionism I have described is consistent with the actual rather than the mythic history of the Zionist idea and the Zionist movement. The idea and the movement alike were motivated by, and were successful because of, the repeated expulsions of Jews from European countries during the second millennium. They were not engendered because the Jews were “forcibly exiled” (as per the Declaration of Independence) from Palestine in the first century C.E.</p> \n<p>This form of Zionism is consistent not only with Zionist history itself but also with the concrete history of world Jewry before Zionism appeared as well as after. To be cogent, it does not need fabricated tales about Jewry’s full-fledged nationhood before or after the inception of Zionism, or about the “striving of Jews in every successive generation to re-establish themselves in their ancient homeland” (Israel’s Declaration of Independence).</p> \n<p>This form of Zionism is based on a political morality that allocates territorial rights in light of the interests of contemporary nations, not on a morality that bestows such rights on the basis of unilateral acts of acquisition in antiquity.</p> \n<p>It is based on a notion of justice that doesn’t allow the sins of the Arabs’ seventh-century forefathers to be visited on their descendants in the modern era. Egalitarian Zionism avoids one of the ugliest aspects of mainstream Zionism: It does not turn the Arabs in the Land of Israel into perpetual hostages of intra-Jewish debates on the territorial, demographic and constitutional scope of Jewish property in Palestine, or on whether moral, pragmatic or tactical reasons require ceding part of the land and, if so, how much.</p> \n<p>Because this form of Zionism does not imply Jewish supremacy, no grounds arise for rejecting it. If Judaism or Israeli Jews seek to go on maintaining Israel as a state that realizes Zionism, only an egalitarian version like the one described here can allow it to be just and legitimate. On the basis of Gavison and Rubinstein’s hierarchical Zionism, Israel by their own definition is non-egalitarian and therefore unjust. The proprietary Zionism of Dinur and the settlers risks rendering Israel an outlaw state and therefore illegitimate.</p> \n<p>The Israeli mainstream has been realizing these two forms of Zionism for decades. There is no basis for it: not in the history that motivated Zionism and made it successful; not in the Jewish history that preceded Zionism; not in the Jewish history that followed the emergence of Zionism; not in any acceptable political morality; not in international law. Nor does it promote the good of Judaism, the good of Zionism, or the good of Israel.</p> \n<p>Chaim Gans is a professor of legal and political theory at Tel Aviv University.

        "text":["<p>Suppose the Exodus from Egypt had never occurred. Suppose the Romans never exiled the Jews. Suppose also that there had been no Jews in antiquity. Even then, the justification for establishing their nationhood in Israel would be valid along the lines I tried to explain in my article “From rabid Zionism to egalitarian Zionism&quot; (November 9, 2018).</p> \n<p>Shlomo Sand’s response to my arguments (“The twisted logic of the Jewish historic right to Israel,” November 16, 2018), misses that central point. In this sense he’s like Naftali Bennett. The education minister carries an ancient coin in his pocket in order to prove Jewish ownership of the land since antiquity. Sand’s understandable revulsion at the Jewish-national implications of Bennett’s version of nationalism, based on that coin, leads him to reject Zionism in its entirety.</p> \n<p>The justification I tried to provide for this ideology frees us both from Bennett’s coin and from Sand’s contentions against it. It’s anchored not in the history of the Jews in antiquity, but rather in two pivotal facts regarding their history in modernity.</p> \n<p>Fact 1: A major component of the Jews’ social profile in modernity, in their own eyes, and in the eyes of their surroundings, is that of a group originating in Palestine in antiquity. It doesn’t take a historian to recognize this fact. Suffice it to read the Passover Haggadah, be a tourist in Florence or listen to the “Passions,” preferably Bach’s.</p> \n<p>Even if Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Tarfon, who were reclining in Bnei Brak in the second century C.E., weren’t actually reclining there, and even if baby Jesus, who was presented at the Temple by his parents, never existed, and even if Jews didn’t play a part when that same Jesus was tried by Pilate as a grown-up – the Haggadah tells the first story, Renaissance artists painted the second and the Passions related to the third.</p> \n<p>The Jews and the communities of Europe among which they have existed in modernity, are nourished by these stories in the modern era. They and their surroundings understand Judaism and identify Jews on their basis. The stories are about Jews who lived in the Land of Israel in antiquity, and who then shared a territory, a language and a culture.</p> \n<p>Whether nationalism and modern nations are a modern phenomenon, as modernist theoreticians of nationalism maintain, or whether national groups are not only modern but ancient, as primordialist theoreticians argue, the Jewish way of life in antiquity, as imagined in the Haggadah, in Renaissance paintings and in the Passions, was a quasi-national existence. It was such even if there were no Jews in antiquity, just as a unicorn’s existence is that of a unicorn and not of a duocorn, even if unicorns exist only in fairytales.</p> \n<p>Sand asks me to read the distinguished Jewish, non-Zionist writers Hermann Cohen and Franz Rosenzweig, and informs me about the Talmudic ban on collective Jewish immigration to the Holy Land, as if they weaken my arguments. But they do the opposite: If the Jewish masses were not viewing themselves (in part) as a collective originating in the ancient Land of Israel, the Talmud would not have had to impose the ban, and Cohen and Rosenzweig would not have had to bolster their diasporic Jewish ideology with the argument that the Judaism of the ancient Land of Israel was only one type of Judaism.</p> \n<p>These talmudic and ideological anecdotes weaken mainstream Zionism’s claim that the Jews never ceased to be a nation and strove throughout the generations to regain the Land of Israel. But the argument I was making for a very modest version of Zionism, as opposed to mainstream Zionism, does not presuppose an unbroken Jewish nationhood since Antiquity and an undeviating striving of the Jews in every generation to return to the Land of Israel. It only assumes that the social profile of the Jews of modernity is one of a nation that originated in Palestine of antiquity. Sand doesn’t seem to have noticed the distinction.</p> \n<p>Fact 2: The social profile of the Jews in modernity, that of a group originating in ancient Palestine, constituted a central element in shaping the attitudes toward them adopted by surrounding communities – at times great sympathy, at times cruel persecution. This time it’s a real fact, not one about whose reality (also for the purposes of my argument) one can be indifferent.</p> \n<p>The persecutions in question continued through the second millennium C.E. persistently and intensely. Their persistence became decisive when they continued despite the Emancipation of European Jewry; that their intensity has no competition incontestable by the fact of the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>Here questions arise that are not of historical fact, but rather of political morality. These are even less within the purview of Sand’s expertise than is Jewish history. For example, the question of whether it is morally justified for members of the persecuted group – because it is perceived to belong to a different culture and territory – to organize in order to prevent their continued humiliation and the threat to their lives. Is it justified for them to act in this way by attempting to transform the group into a full-fledged nation in that other territory, even though it is inhabited by others?</p> \n<p>After he diminishes my extensively qualified “yes” response to these questions by the rhetorical device of describing it as a “last desperate attempt to justify the Zionist enterprise retroactively,” Sand tries to refute it. As befits the concreteness of his thinking as a historian, he does so by making such brute assertions as, “Zionism failed utterly to rescue Europe’s Jews.”</p> \n<p>Should I respond by arguing the opposite, namely, that Zionism did in fact rescue some of Europe’s Jews? And that it’s possible that many of those it did not rescue, perished because they did not accept Zionism? And that if they had accepted it, they would have been rescued? But I wish to stress a different point. It pertains to the way I understand the urgent Jewish necessity to which Israel has been, and still is, a response.</p> \n<p>At issue is not the necessity faced by the concrete individuals who initiated Zionism and established Israel to save their and their fellows’ skin. At issue is the need to make it possible for them, and more importantly for their descendants, to live (or to die, if there’s no alternative) under conditions of non-humiliation. In this sense, Israel is important as an embodiment of Jewish self-rule not only for its own Jews, but for world Jewry as a whole, and for many generations. This underpinning of Zionism is immune to the anti-Zionist argument, also made by Sand, that stems from the fact that the great majority of Eastern European Jews chose not Zionism but America to rescue themselves from the horrors of persecution.</p> \n<p>It is not the saving of life itself that underlies the justification for Israel’s establishment, but the creation of a possibility of Jewish life under conditions of governmental non-humiliation. This should have been secured then for Jews as human beings – not specifically as Jews – and it needs to be secured for them today as well. Only Israeli right-wingers such as Bennett and Netanyahu compete with anti-Zionists of Sand’s ilk in their imperviousness to this, each from his own side: Sand is impervious to the Jews and their history of humiliation; Bennett and Netanyahu are impervious to the interest non-Jews have in living under conditions of non-humiliation. To Sand’s credit, it should be noted that his imperviousness stems only from miscomprehension, and not from heartlessness as well.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the 1970s, before the dramatic election upset by Menachem Begin, young Moshe Kahlon was a member of the Likud branch in Givat Olga, a neighborhood of Hadera. It was a small group, fired by ideals, that loathed Mapai (the longtime ruling party and forerunner of Labor). They called themselves “little, vigilant Beitar,” referring to the Revisionist movement from which Likud sprang.</p> \n<p>This week, with Benjamin Netanyahu’s post-Yisrael Beiteinu coalition reborn with 61 MKs, Kahlon recalled those times. “We won’t be the ones to topple a government,” he told me. “In the end, it will fall on its own. Let them try to conduct business like this. I’m freeing Bibi of the noose, but I have no illusions: It won’t last long.”</p> \n<p>Some would say that Finance Minister Kahlon gave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the rope to hang himself. In the meantime, the minimalist coalition got through its first parliamentary week practically unscathed. There was full mobilization of the ranks. The opposition, however, looked less good. MK Avigdor Lieberman, the outgoing defense minister, didn’t want to sit next to MK Ayman Odeh, head of the Joint Arab List, in the Knesset plenum, and asked fellow party member MK Sofa Landver, the outgoing immigrant absorption minister, to act as a separation barrier. Zionist Union was dealing with a childish spat between its factional chairman, MK Yoel Hasson, and MK Hilik Bar, who had traveled to China to disseminate his crucial political message without asking permission.</p> \n<p>It’s so typical of this group that even when they can finally enjoy a little grace – through no act of their own – they manage to shoot themselves in the foot. It’s no wonder that their great white hope, former Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, is telling interlocutors that he isn’t even considering entering that cuckoo’s nest (my phrase, but that’s the spirit of what he’s saying).</p> \n<p>But back to the key players. On Tuesday, after Education Minister Naftali Bennett's capitulation in the Knesset – he backed down on his threatening demand for “the defense portfolio, or early elections” – Netanyahu met with Kahlon, chairman of Kulanu, along with Tourism Minister Yariv Levin, the government’s liaison with the Knesset, and Jerusalem Affairs Minister Zeev Elkin, whose advice is always welcome.</p> \n<p>The prime minister was on a high after the Bennett debacle in the plenum, and projected determination. “We can do it,” he said. “I will provide a personal example: I will be present for every vote in the Knesset.” And he was as good as his word. At least on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Kahlon took advantage of the occasion to announce that henceforth Kulanu would support only legislation of economic and/or security-national importance. Personal caprices (such as the so-called “Gideon Sa’ar bill”) would remain wet dreams. Kahlon didn’t say it in so many words, but if the security situation is truly as grave as Netanyahu says, then better he should deal with that than with his fears.</p> \n<p>Before Lieberman’s resignation, Kahlon intended to back the Sa’ar bill, by means of which Netanyahu sought to deprive the president of the possibility, after an election, of deciding for himself to whom to entrust formation of a government. It was to Kahlon’s benefit, too. He liked the clause stipulating that only party leaders, and not just any “MK who has agreed,” as the law now reads, would be eligible to form a government.</p> \n<p>Kahlon was less enthusiastic, however, about the second clause, which stipulated that only the party leader who obtains the most recommendations of MKs would be entrusted with the mission. Let’s imagine a situation in which 61 MKs recommend Netanyahu, and 59 MKs recommend Kahlon, in their consultations with the president – but hovering over Netanyahu is an indictment for bribery and it’s clear that his days are numbered. In that situation, shouldn’t the president exercise his discretion and give the nod to the other guy?</p> \n<p>In any event, the wording of the legislation, as submitted by the coalition whip, MK David Amsalem (Likud), will probably not enter the law books. “The public atmosphere has changed,” Kahlon says, explaining his reasoning. “With 61 MKs, on the eve of an election, we’re in a different situation. All irresponsible, populist legislation has to be blocked.”</p> \n<p>Just how far the MKs, particularly from the ruling parties, will allow themselves to go as they keep their eyes on party primaries, we’ll see in the weeks ahead. One senior member of Likud had a solution for a situation in which private bills get approved in a preliminary vote by the Knesset. “Never mind,” he said, “we’ll bury them in committee.” Not very democratic, but effective.</p> \n<p>At the end of this week, the puzzle remained: Why did Netanyahu – who a year and a half ago wanted to dismantle his government over the creation of the Public Broadcasting Corporation, and ditto about nine months ago, because of the dispute over the conscription law – go out of his way this time to prevent the fall of the government, which he had so devoutly wished for, especially with the polls looking good and his reelection apparently a foregone conclusion? Why?</p> \n<p>His considerations are unknown to us. With Netanyahu, there is always something hidden from us that no other politician or aide even knows; one guess is as good as another. The investigations against the premier, most of which have ended and now await the decisions of the attorney general, are of course a central factor. That’s between him and his lawyers.</p> \n<p>There are some who think that he wants to keep his seat until July 2019 and thereby become the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s history. Others will argue that he’s afraid he’s being set up, that just before the election a coalition against him will crystallize – of Kahlon with Benny Gantz, for example. (A private poll commissioned by one of them predicts that a slate along those lines would win almost 30 Knesset seats.) And there are other options, too.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is the embodiment of the proverb, “Happy is the man who is always anxious.” It’s obvious to him that the political map in the 2019 election will be different from the present one, but it’s not clear from which direction the evil winds will blow. This week, in a private conversation, when asked about his reluctance to bring the election forward, he said: “Our bloc isn’t tight enough.” With that as his assessment, the rest is understandable.</p> \n<p>Comic relief</p> \n<p>“Two pals walked carefree, bim bam boom,” an old Israeli children’s song says, “one got a smack on the knee, bim bam boom.” Naftali and Ayelet, two pals, this week walked the walk. Both got a smack on the knee. More accurately, on the head. The episode of the ultimatum about an early election and the defense portfolio is a political comedy skit that will be long remembered. Another entry in the Pantheon of political bloopers.</p> \n<p>It might not cost the two, and their party, Habayit Hayehudi, in the polling booths, which will remain shut for now because of their decision to retract the ultimatum. People in these parts have short memories. The record of the person who vanquished the pair (maybe that’s what Netanyahu was referring to when he thundered at his press conference, “We will overcome our enemies!”) is also studded with no few embarrassing U-turns.</p> \n<p>The echoes of laughter having faded, we can now see that the incident reveals something about the depth of political distress felt by Bennett and Shaked as numbers 1 and 2, in a single-sector party that, ultimately, is the successor to the National Religious Party.</p> \n<p>The two are caught in the isolation trap. On the one hand, they’re dying to look like the epitome of all-Israeli statesmanship since they know that if they cannot capture the minds and hearts of the secular soft right they’re going nowhere. They will always remain a niche party of Hardalim – a fusion of Haredim (ultra-Orthodox) and religious Zionists – in which extremist, benighted rabbis who hate Arabs and gays set the tone.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, despite their efforts, they have not succeeded in looking more right-wing than Likud and Netanyahu. All those places have been taken.</p> \n<p>When these two try – such as this week, when Bennett implicitly accused the IDF military advocate general of being responsible for the fact that the army isn’t defeating our enemies, or in the case of deputy attorney general Dina Zilber (whom Shaked attempted to fire after Zilber was critical of the “loyalty in culture” bill backed by the government), or in Shaked’s war against the independence of the High Court of Justice and against the attorney general – they look more radical than Likud.</p> \n<p>Bennett and Shaked have big dreams: First he’ll be prime minister, then she will be. But they are mired in pettiness. A faction of eight MKs in a coalition that now numbers 61 has limited ability when it comes to repeatedly challenging the prime minister.</p> \n<p>Bennett occasionally creates his own passing crises. The most dramatic one was during the formation of the current government, when he made his entry into the coalition conditional on Shaked being appointed justice minister. He pulled it off, but this week the two of them totally failed to decipher the mood of their target audience.</p> \n<p>Their voters are an ideological group, in part messianic. Personal issues are less important to them than the “Land of Israel.” Bennett believed they would back him, but when he looked behind he discovered, to his horror, that his followers had turned their back on him. And not for the first time, as we learned in the final week of the 2015 election campaign.</p> \n<p>Back then, the moment the settlers heard the prime minister utter the words, “toppling of the right-wing government in 1992” and “Oslo” – they leaped to attention and saluted the leader, eyes glazing over. Netanyahu knows what makes that group tick. They’re like rag dolls in his hands. He gave a speech, activated some rabbis, stained the honor of the National Security Council by sending its head, Meir Ben-Shabbat, to reveal various security-related developments to Rabbi Haim Druckman – and got what he wanted.</p> \n<p>Shaked is willing to admit that confronting the prime minister with a public ultimatum was a mistake. Chivalrously, she shares the responsibility with her party leader. To an outsider it looks as though she was dragged after Bennett, but she claims they were in this boat together from the first.</p> \n<p>On Sunday night, about an hour after Netanyahu concluded his speech in defense establishment headquarters in Tel Aviv, Bennett and Shaked met in the former’s office in the city. One glance was enough for them to grasp that this was it, the game was over. Cell phones were placed in flight mode. They devoted themselves to formulating the declarations they would deliver the next day in the Knesset. “We wrote with our heart’s blood,” she said.</p> \n<p>There was something odd in their statements. They sounded like summing-up speeches, like statements presaging withdrawal from political life. The whole nostalgic mini-drama ended with an anticlimax. I asked Shaked how much damage they had suffered. “It only strengthened us in terms of the [electoral] base,” the justice minister replied. “People were very moved.”</p> \n<p>In and/or out</p> \n<p>Next week will see a cabinet reshuffle. In the wake of Yisrael Beiteinu’s departure from the government and the decision by Netanyahu to retain the defense portfolio for himself, the premier will bid farewell to the Foreign Ministry. The Immigrant Absorption Ministry is also orphaned. Both portfolios will go to Likud. That initial move could, of course, lead to secondary tremors, depending on who gets the two vacant posts.</p> \n<p>Foreign Affairs is of course the sprinkles atop the whipped cream on the Hanukkah donut. After three and a half years in which Netanyahu plundered its powers and spheres of responsibility, which he then handed out, like Santa Claus, among restive ministries and ministers, the Foreign Affairs Ministry is now an empty shell. It’s an exclusive travel agency – and even that has to be qualified, because with a coalition of 61 MKs the new foreign minister will be more of a ground attendant than a frequent flier.</p> \n<p>Still, it’s a job that’s filled with glory. Two senior Likud figures each have a written promise from the prime minister to get the portfolio if it’s given to Likud: Transportation and Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz, and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan.</p> \n<p>No, that’s not a mistake: He made the identical promise, in writing, to both those gentlemen. First to Katz, afterward to Erdan. Bibi doesn’t blink in cases like this. With him it’s always two for the price of one. Whoever isn’t appointed is liable to whip out the embarrassing document. Or not. Maybe he’ll get a tempting follow-up letter that will smooth his ruffled feathers.</p> \n<p>And it’s always possible that Netanyahu will opt for a third path and give the ministry to someone who doesn’t have a letter from him. Yuval Steinitz, for example, the current energy minister, who is not perceived as a threat to senior party figures come primary time.</p> \n<p>If Netanyahu wants to appeal to the party’s central committee on the eve of a possible election, he might want to favor Katz, who is chairman of the party secretariat and can pull strings when he wants to. Erdan will find it hard to forgive Bibi for being slighted, but he’s used to it. If Erdan becomes foreign minister, Netanyahu might install Miri Regev – the woman whose sycophancy toward him and his wife is second only to her baseness and vulgarity – in the Ministry of Public Security. This week we saw Ms. Regev in action again, when she accused former Chief of Staff Gantz of indirect responsibility for the death of a 4-year-old Israeli boy, Daniel Tragerman, in the 2014 Gaza war. The timing of that assertion vis-&agrave;-vis the cabinet reshuffle can’t be a coincidence, at least not in her mind.</p> \n<p>There’s another possibility: that Netanyahu will opt for outsourcing foreign affairs. There’s no shortage of people outside the political arena who would be suitable. He took that path toward the end of his first term as prime minister, in January 1999, when he appointed Moshe Arens, who had run against him for party leader and lost, as defense minister in the transitional government.</p> \n<p>The immigrant absorption portfolio is a simpler matter. Netanyahu’s industrious deputy in the Foreign Ministry, Tzipi Hotovely, would be happy to accept it. She met with him to make her case, too. It’s likely, in the spirit of the time, that Netanyahu will prefer to replace one woman (the outgoing minister, Sofa Landver) with another.</p> \n<p>Hotovely also brings him another bonus: She’s from the national-religious community. When Netanyahu goes back to fighting Bennett, Shaked and Habayit Hayehudi over support of the right-wing electoral base, Hotovely’s presence at the cabinet table and by his side in visits to yeshivas and army preparatory courses might help, and certainly won’t hurt.</p> \n<p>It goes without saying that the question of the portfolios is the only issue that’s of interest to the ministers and MKs in the ruling party. Maybe that rush of emotion is what prompted Erdan and Katz to take the podium at this week’s Jerusalem Post conference and hurl threats at the Gaza Strip. They certainly figured that in the wake of the prime minister’s Sunday speech – in which he warned of the need for “sacrifice” – they too were required to unleash threats and give the impression that war is just around the corner (“We’re closer than ever to conquering Gaza,” Erdan said). But things turned out differently. Netanyahu called them and demanded that they stop rattling their sabers. That’s his prerogative, right?</p> \n<p>Future perfect</p> \n<p>Polls are a type of guilty pleasure that politicians often sin with. They instruct the pollster which questions to ask and hope the results will be pleasing. Flattering results are then passed along by word of mouth and sometimes make their way to the media. Less complimentary ones are shelved for all time.</p> \n<p>An in-depth, reliable, professional public opinion survey, one that’s not biased in favor of the person who commissions it, is an essential tool for every politician, just as it is for commercial companies checking their markets. It’s a foundation on which to build a future plan of action. The polls on election voting preferences are mostly bread and circuses for the media. As long as the political map isn’t clear and orderly, they are of very little value. The numbers change as rapidly as pictures in a slot machine.</p> \n<p>MK Tzipi Livni (Zionist Union/Hatnuah), a serious consumer of polls, is at a crossroads. Her position as No. 2 to Avi Gabbay doesn’t augur well for her. She’s making immense efforts to establish a center-left bloc – first, by recruiting Benny Gantz to the listing ship, on the reasonable assumption that his entry would force the stubborn Gabbay to disembark.</p> \n<p>The most recent survey she commissioned, about a week ago, was conducted by a well-known pollster and was analyzed by a leading expert who isn’t inclined to pleasing the clients. The poll presented a scenario in which a center-bloc was formed, headed alternately by all the usual suspects (Livni, Gantz, Ehud Barak, Moshe Ya’alon, Gabbay &amp; Co.), their names appearing in changing order. The average result for the bloc was 33 Knesset seats.</p> \n<p>Livni also examined what the future holds for Zionist Union if it doesn’t join forces with other opposition factions, and she heads the slate: The poll said 20 Knesset seats – as opposed to 12 to 14 seats under Gabbay.</p> \n<p>The question is why Livni, who undertook in writing and orally to be second on the party slate, and in return was appointed leader of the opposition, is examining a completely unrealistic scenario: Gabbay has no intention of leaving.</p> \n<p>Livni’s office didn’t have an answer to that question. Maybe it’s intellectual curiosity on her part, a theoretical exercise. Or not. In the meantime, she is saying no to Labor MKs who are imploring her to seize the reins and declare unilateral disengagement from Gabbay. In a situation where everything collapses, everything goes; she might go along with a “decision of the movement.”</p> \n<p>To be fair to Livni, it needs to be made clear that replacing Gabbay by one means or another (such as by encouraging the split that’s erupting in Zionist Union as a first step) is not what she’s after. She is genuinely striving to bring about something new. She has no problem giving up the top spot in favor of Gantz, who at the moment looks like a walking reservoir of Knesset seats. In such a situation, with Gantz taking the lead, she believes, Gabbay would wake up, hear the music and do the right thing.</p>",

Before I&nbsp;left&nbsp;home one of my uncles gave me a piece of paper on which &quot;Kibbutz Kfar Menahem&quot; was written. When I arrived, I met the Carmon family who received me, and mainly their son Shlomo. They made me feel at home from the start.</p> \n<p>I came from a typical North American Jewish family, with all the accompanying pressure regarding social status and outward appearance, and the sense of freedom immediately penetrated me. I was charmed by the atmosphere of grass, trees and loving people.</p> \n<p>After years of traveling between Canada and Israel, I found my place on the kibbutz. I had met very warm people, whom I returned to visit repeatedly, and in 1976 I made aliyah to Israel with my wife and our two children. I worked in the chicken runs and in agriculture, and in the end I found my place as a handyman. As a person with only one hand, and a law school graduate, I can say that this was an experience that I never could have had in Canada.</p> \n<p>I planned my work in a way that would leave me time for photography, both on the kibbutz and in the country as a whole.

How was the flight?</p> \n<p>I nearly freaked out on the plane. Eleven hours. But it was a good experience, and now that I’ve opened that door I can do more things, travel the world.</p> \n<p>You go, girl. Did you come alone?</p> \n<p>I came with a lady named Jules, who organizes missionary trips, to different destinations. Besides sightseeing, we try to do something for the community, too, to work on faith, promote God and the sisterhood.</p> \n<p>Who are the sisters?</p> \n<p>We’re 20 women from ages 20 to 50. I didn’t know the others before. We were here a week, and I learned a lot.</p> \n<p>What, for example?</p> \n<p>To accept responsibility, to pay attention to the world. I loved the people here – I love people. People are different, but you can always connect. And the falafel was great. I’d like to come back one day, maybe when my financial situation is better.</p> \n<p>Where did you go?</p> \n<p>We were at Christian sites. And we were in Jerusalem with a guide who talked about the history of the city and the Jewish people. It was ... wow! And I rode a camel. I wouldn’t do that again.</p> \n<p>Did you really do something for the community?</p> \n<p>We met with an organization in south Tel Aviv that helps women who worked in the sex industry. They make bags from old kitesurfing kites, and we worked with them a little.</p> \n<p>How religious are you?</p> \n<p>I’m majoring in sociology and psychology at university, but I also work for a Christian organization on campus. It’s very important for me. I’m a spiritual person, and I believe in God and Jesus. I’m a Christian, but Christianity has many restrictions and rituals, and in my opinion that’s not what God intended. He’s a God of love! So someone should not be made to feel inferior, just because he believes in something else.</p> \n<p>What do people do in a campus Christian organization?</p> \n<p>You’re supposed to learn and teach people about God and Jesus. We are trying to reach people, but at school we’re limited in time, so we just try to make people feel special.</p> \n<p>How?</p> \n<p>You try to work with people who are less fortunate and to remind them that actually they are lucky. You say things like, “You have a chance, you don’t have to kill yourself, your life has meaning, you’re important to someone.” For people who grew up with a feeling of insecurity, that’s very important. I grew up like that, and it’s important for me to pay it forward.</p> \n<p>Why were you insecure?</p> \n<p>For years I had suicidal thoughts, I felt left out in school and everything was very dark. And even though I grew up in a Christian home, I didn’t understand how to get out of that place. I didn’t understand a lot of things about life, I wanted to look like someone else, I didn’t like myself. Now I say to girls, “You’re beautiful the way you are, you don’t need to change.” It’s important to hear that at an early age.</p> \n<p>You underwent a big change of consciousness.</p> \n<p>It all started when I tried to look for one small thing in myself that I liked. And I also started to write a lot in a diary. It may sound strange, but that’s how I started to communicate with myself, and instead of being with people all the time, I learned how to be alone and to enjoy being with myself. That’s how you develop self-love. And I also started to read the Bible and go to church. I got to God for myself, and I learned from him that I’m special and different, and that’s a good thing.</p> \n<p>Do you still keep a diary?</p> \n<p>I keep many of them; I like to write about what I feel and see. I appreciate what goes on inside me, compare things, write what it’s possible to do better. Hey, I’m not perfect, I’m young and I need to grow, change, understand where it’s possible to move and what the toxic things are that I want to get rid of. Every time I write, I take a glance at what I’ve written before. When you write you sometimes get inspiration from yourself. For example, I look at the day I started to write, and I see how the joy has grown.</p> \n<p>Martin Schroeder, 33, lives in Sarti, Greece; arriving from Budapest</p> \n<p>Hello, is this your first time in Israel?</p> \n<p>It’s my sixth time. I’m here for six days to visit a friend who moved here six years ago from Hungary.</p> \n<p>We should play shesh besh [backgammon; “shesh” is Hebrew for “six”].</p> \n<p>I hope you don’t play that game for money, because in all my travels in the world I’ve never encountered a more expensive place than&nbsp;Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Do you travel a lot?</p> \n<p>I’ve been traveling for nine years. From May to October I live and work in northern Greece as a tour guide and taxi driver. Then, from October to May, I travel. I always divide the winter in two: Up until Christmas I visit friends and family, and from January to May I choose a new place to live and learn something new.</p> \n<p>Where have you lived and what have you done?</p> \n<p>Salzburg, Thessaloniki, Bologna, Colombia, Mexico, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, India. In Guatemala I worked as a bartender in a hostel, and in Ecuador I was a diving instructor. As a European it’s easy for me to find jobs overseas, because people always want European tourists to come and for there to be someone who speaks their languages.</p> \n<p>Now you’re in the friends’ period.</p> \n<p>This part has become a bit demanding. Since October, I’ve been to Madrid, Milan, Belgrade, Budapest, Prague and Bratislava, and from here I’ll go to Vienna. I take it from day to day. My journey isn’t very organized, I make contact at the last minute and sleep on the sofa at friends’ places.</p> \n<p>What do people do in your village?</p> \n<p>Hang out. Sarti is right on the coast, and of all the countries I’ve seen, it has the most beautiful beach. But I have to admit that over time something strange has happened: I’m German by origin, and Greece used to be a place to escape to, but now it’s a bummer to go back there, because I have to work.</p> \n<p>Someone has to bring home the souvlaki!</p> \n<p>I don’t need much. I live on a budget, and I get along. I learned in university that capitalism has three pillars: money, connections and education. I decided to forgo the money and concentrate on the other two.</p> \n<p>How does it work with a round-the-world ticket?</p> \n<p>Well, I’m not so simple and pure. I use airplanes, cell phones, email. I need them and admit that they improve my life. And I’m a parasite when it comes to discarded “capitalist” things. I have an iPhone 4 that a friend left me – no one will steal it, you can’t find a charger for it. So I live within capitalism, but I refuse to feed it much.</p> \n<p>Can you really escape the system?</p> \n<p>I live on cash, without a bank account. I don’t sign contracts. I choose not to leave footprints behind. I’m not out to write a book, become famous or have children. I have no need for that. I already have a great deal of meaning in my life. I live in the present and that gives me strength and security. I hope this will help me avoid becoming sad, angry and scared when I get old.</p> \n<p>Definitely something to aspire to.</p> \n<p>I don’t like fear. Fear is the fuel on which German society travels – fear of being poor, for example. That’s the reason Germany is so rich. And it comes with negative baggage. I see it in Greece every day. They’re poorer but less depressed and battered; they don’t give a shit and it works.</p> \n<p>“Yassou,” as Zorba said.</p> \n<p>Life is happier in simpler countries. I’m from a small town in East Germany. The Berlin Wall fell when I was 4. I remember how before that my father would take me to a hill from where you could see the other side. We would look at the cars across the border, and he wanted one so badly. On our side everyone had the same communist cars, but he dreamed of an Opel or Volkswagen. Now he has a car like that, and I don’t think it’s done him any good.</p> \n<p>And do you have it better than he does?</p> \n<p>There are disadvantages. It’s hard for me to hang on to a relationship because I’m on the move, but mostly – I don’t know if it’s something within me, or a product of society, the fact is that I want a dog really badly. One day I’ll have to change my life, but I’ll have a dog.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Researchers from the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies have found that the positive aspects of a legislative amendment that bars entry into the country of some anti-Israel boycott activists &quot;appear to be largely local tactical benefits, whereas the potential damage is more significant and extensive.&quot;</p> \n<p>The institute's research fellows, Michal Hatuel Radoshitzky, Amir Prager and Shahar Eilam, did a cost-benefit analysis of the amendment to the Entry into Israel Law, which was enacted in March, 2017. &quot;As the amendment falls short of aiding the struggle against the delegitimization of Israel, and arguably might even intensify it, measures should be taken to prevent further damage resulting from additional legislative measures or the flawed use of existing tools,&quot; the authors wrote.</p> \n<p>Among the cases they examined was that of Lara Alqasem, the 22-year-old American student who was barred entry into Israel in October based on the amendment, as a result of her alleged involvement in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. Alqasem, who is of Palestinian heritage, was ultimately allowed in to study at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem after her case was taken to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis: It's not Lara Alqasem or BDS that Israelis need to fear</p> \n<p>In ruling in her favor, Supreme Court Justice Neal Hendel wrote: &quot;The Law of Entry to Israel is intended to protect the state's sovereignty, and the public's safety and security. It does not have a component of penalty, or revenge for previous bad behavior.&quot; He added: &quot;The Interior Ministry has openly admitted that it does not have any evidence of the appellant's engaging in boycott activity since April 2017, except for mysterious 'indications' whose essence hasn't been clarified and regarding which no evidence has been submitted.&quot; Citing Alqasem's involvement in the group Students for Justice in Palestine, Hendel stated: &quot;The material submitted regarding the appellant's activity in the SJP organization shows that even at that stage, the boycott activity was minor and limited in character.&quot;</p> \n<p>In enumerating the benefits of the legislation, the authors of the INSS paper mention that up to this point, only a small number of people have been denied entry into the country, meaning that the direct impact of the amendment has been limited. &quot;The amendment is likely to have a deterring effect on activists, and presumably some have chosen or will choose to not try to enter Israel,&quot; it was noted, although the BDS movement's activities &quot;are not dependent on the physical presence of activists in the country or in the Palestinian territories.&quot;</p> \n<p>Among the purported disadvantages, the authors wrote: &quot;In the global campaign against the legitimacy, image, and international standing of the State of Israel, both pro-Israel and anti-Israel activists strive to influence the consciousness and perceptions of large audiences, with an emphasis on liberal target groups in the West.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;In this campaign, Israel’s most significant asset is the fact that it is a democratic state that champions individual rights and freedom of expression. However, the amendment of the Entry into Israel Law is one in a series of recent legislative measures and government decisions perceived by progressive audiences around the Western world as anti-democratic and anti-liberal, and in turn, arouses antagonism toward Israel,&quot; they stated. &quot;Israel is perceived as a state that is motivated by fear of the media and civil political organization. This image strengthens the perception that Israel has something to hide, and thereby bolsters the narrative that BDS activists seek to promote in the international arena.&quot;</p> \n<p>The authors also noted the law's impact on the Israeli academic community, where concern has been expressed that it would provide grounds for the claim that academic conferences should not be held in the country because some potential participants would not be allowed in. And from a legal standpoint, they noted that even prior to the amendment of the Entry into Israel Law, the interior minister had broad authority to bar individuals from coming into the country.</p> \n<p>The authors recommend that future legislative proceedings examine the possible implications for Israel's international standing and its relationship with Diaspora Jewry, as well as whether the amendment serves the purpose for which it was passed. The authors also call for improving communications among the agencies involved in the law's implementation and add: &quot;Israel would be wise to limit the invocation of this legislation, and to deny entry and residency in Israel only in extreme cases that fully meet the requirements and criteria of the law.&quot;</p>",

She has two restaurants – Gazala’s Place and Gazala’s – and every time I go by them, they’re full of diners.</p> \n<p>“I come from Daliat al-Carmel, a place I love very much, but everything there is so limited for a woman. I never had it easy and so what I did is considered a real revolution,” she says. “I’m a divorced Druze woman, living and working in New York, raising two kids alone. I’m more independent than many American women and I’m proud of it,” she goes on, adding: “I really don’t know how I did what I did, I didn’t have it easy in marriage, with the kids or in business. If I was able to do what I’ve done here with two restaurants, any women with strong willpower can do it,” she says.</p> \n<p>Success in business has nothing to do with gender or nationality, Halabi believes, but how much you’re willing to give of yourself. “Believe me, men would find it hard to do what I did. I worked seven days a week for long hours – there were nights when I only slept an hour; I didn’t see the kids much. I had to be strong. Even when I was tired, I didn’t show it. I worked sick. I gave of myself, that’s simply the secret of my success.”</p> \n<p>Followed her husband</p> \n<p>Halabi arrived in New York in 2001, two months before the attack on the Twin Towers. She had met a Druze man in Israel, who lived in the United States, and they decided to get married and live in New York. It wasn’t easy; the family was so against it that her father and brothers didn’t attend her engagement parties. Her mother was in the hospital, and only her sisters took part in all the ceremonies around the marriage. “It took them years to get over it,” she says.</p> \n<p>We’re sitting in her new restaurant, Gazala’s, on the Upper West Side. A song by Israeli singer Pe’er Tasi is playing in the background. Last time it was Idan Reichel. From time to time there are songs in Arabic. “It’s true that Druze women are supposed to stay close to their families but in this case I followed my husband. I came here in the most legitimate way there is. I was the little one at home and they treated me that way. My mother wanted me to stay a little girl. I loved the village but I didn’t find myself there.”</p> \n<p>Halabi wonders aloud whether her success stems from her desire to prove to her family that she made the right decision to move to America. “The truth is that I had guilt feelings about my family in Israel. Here in New York it wasn’t simple. I didn’t know English at all. I cleaned my apartment and then cleaned all the steps in the building. I thought that’s what is done. I cooked a lot, and knocked on the neighbors’ doors and offered them food because I thought that’s what was done. I quickly learned that in New York you don’t just knock on a neighbor’s door and you don’t clean the steps of the whole building. That’s how I learned. Slowly.”</p> \n<p>Suddenly, a celebrity</p> \n<p>Halabi began her business career in 2005. “I started catering from home. I made ma’amouls [filled pastries] that were a big success. After that I decided that I wanted something more regular and a year later I opened a restaurant in the East Village. It failed. I didn’t have workers and I didn’t know what I should be doing. I closed after six weeks and I thought I’d never open another restaurant. But a year later, in 2007, I opened the restaurant in Hell’s Kitchen, which is still there. There were only 28 places. Suddenly Time Out and the Daily News wrote about me and then a reporter from the New York Times. When they told me that they had written about me in the New York Times, I didn’t really understand what it meant, but suddenly the phone didn’t stop ringing. People stood in line outside. I didn’t understand what was happening to me. I was under pressure, exhausted from work. At one point I had to close the restaurant for a few hours to calm down. The idea that people were standing in line outside put me under a lot of pressure.”</p> \n<p>Halabi opened her second restaurant on Columbus Avenue on the Upper West Side in 2010. She was walking down the street and saw an empty restaurant she thought would be perfect. That one was also a hit, but it closed in 2015 after the building changed ownership and she was offered a deal to vacate. “I felt tired and I wanted to go back home. I had saved money and I thought: ‘I’ll build myself my dream house in Daliat el-Carmel and I’ll live near my parents.’ The thing is, it’s not accepted for a woman to build a house in the village. I gave management of the project to a woman relative who’s an engineer. I brought a contractor, also a relative, and it turned into a nightmare. They really treated me disrespectfully. I have lots of feeling for the family and the village, but there in the village they denigrated me. We set a price with the contractor and the price kept going up. I decided to fire the contractor. In the end he sued me and it was a nightmare for a year and a half and left a bitter taste in my mouth. Then I decided not to go back. I wanted a house in my village, with security. I was fair with people and they weren’t fair with me. I asked myself what will happen to my daughter when she grows up. They’ll disrespect her because she’s a woman? I don’t need it. So it’s true, women aren’t treated respectfully here either but it’s much better than in the Druze village. So thanks you, I’m staying here. There has never in Druze history been a woman who wanted to build a house with her own money without the help of her parents or husband.”</p> \n<p>Halabi returned to New York. The next step was to open Gazala’s, the restaurant on Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side, which she did in August. “It was a quiet opening. Lots of people came. I didn’t expect such success,” she says.</p> \n<p>Halabi describes her restaurant as Druze-Israeli. True, there are a few typical Druze dishes like labaneh, Halabi kabab and Druze pita baked on the traditional saj. There are also typical filled Druze cookies and ma’amouls, but that’s it. All in all, the menu at Gazala’s is very familiar to an Israeli diner: humus, falafel, labaneh, Turkish salad, tahini, humus masabakha, “cigars,” qubbeh, stuffed grape leaves, shawarma, lamb and various types of kabab. Sometimes she brings coffee with cardamom from Israel. The menu is Gazala’s version of Middle Eastern fare and for desert she offers a dish she learned at home called ush a-sarya, which is actually a Lebanese dish that her grandmother used to make and brought with her from the Land of The Cedars.</p> \n<p>Bourekas, bourekas</p> \n<p>If you ask Halabi what the most popular item on her menu is, she’ll tell you it’s bourekas, although bourekas are not exactly the signature dish of Druze cuisine. In 2008, Time Out New York put Gazala’s bourekas on their cover and since then, the appeared in the Daily News and the New York Times. Halabi makes them on site with her special fillings, including labaneh, cheese and spinach and even dried tomatoes.</p> \n<p>On the menu is a photo of her parents, Gad and Joara, but the truth is the parents in the picture don’t come to New York often. They visited her twice, once when her son was born and the second time when she opened her Columbus Avenue restaurant in 2012. “My mother helped in the kitchen but she didn’t get along in the city. She didn’t understand how I could sleep with ambulance sirens in the street all night. She needed the quiet of the night in Daliat al-Carmel.”</p> \n<p>Halabi has an expressive face, sometimes hard and other times sensitive on the edge of tears. She says you don’t want to fall into her hands if she’s angry. She does everything in the restaurant. She’s the omnipotent boss, noticing every detail while at the same making a thousand ma’amouls, while catching up on things with her family in Israel.</p> \n<p>Halabi was raised in a household with five sisters and one brother. Her brother, Salim, runs the emergency ward in the Carmel Hospital in Haifa. “I think my sisters would want to be in my shoes. They don’t see how hard it is to live here, that it’s hard to raise children with Druze values in Manhattan. I have two kids, a boy and a girl, age 15 and 14. There were days when I saw them only when they were asleep. Now they’re teenagers but as children they saw themselves as Israeli Druze even though they don’t speak Hebrew or Arabic, but only English.”</p> \n<p>One day when I came to dine at Gazala’s, she wasn’t there. She called from her car. “I’m on my way to Washington D.C., she said. “There’s a demonstration being organized by Druze who live in America.” It was hard to hear her. A few days later she told me that the Islamic State had abducted 30 Druze from Syria and had killed one man and a pregnant woman. “So we decided to protest. We gathered 500 people near the White House to protest. Maybe it would help. People don’t know but the Druze suffered a lot in the civil war in Syria. They killed 300 people in one night in the area of Suweida. People don’t talk about that suffering,” she said.</p> \n<p>While Israel roiled over the nation-state law, Halabi looked on from the sidelines. “I see Israel as a wonderful country, but today I also have the opportunity to live in New York and be an American. That doesn’t mean giving up my roots. I didn’t come out against the community. I didn’t come out against the religion. All in all I’m the good girl of the family. I travel to Israel in a bit of an unusual way. I buy a ticket at the airport and head out. In Israel I have no problems except one: the airport. When I come into the country there’s no problem but when I leave – that’s where the problem starts. I have an American passport and an Israeli passport. So do my children. The thing is that security treats me like a terrorist. My father is a wounded Israeli army veteran from the Yom Kippur War. My uncle, Yihye Halabi, is a brigadier general in the army. So why do they treat me this way? I’m Israeli Druze and proud of it. I don’t deserve this treatment by security and at passport control,” she says.</p> \n<p>Surrounded by Israelis</p> \n<p>In New York Halabi has good ties with quite a few Israelis. “When I opened my restaurants, and I’ve opened four so far, 90 percent of my guests in the first couple of months were Israelis. Israelis always came to me when I needed customers. My first workers were demobilized soldiers from Israel. My girlfriends are Israeli Jewish women,” she says. She recently hired a manager, Guy Goldstein, who has worked in a number of Israeli restaurants, so she can devote herself to the kitchen.</p> \n<p>Her plans for the future? Halabi says she might open another restaurant in New York, maybe even a few. It’s hard to know. One doesn’t always make long-term plans. She works according to her gut feeling. If she finds the right place, it will happen. And yes, she has another plan: to open a restaurant in Israel. Not in Daliat al-Carmel, but in Tel Aviv. Nothing concrete, but it certainly could happen. With Gazala Halabi, you can never know.</p>",

A senior employee in one of these organizations told Haaretz that if Israel has abused the network of international or local aid groups, it could undermine the critical activities of organizations large and small: The Hamas government that controls the Gaza Strip might take precautions that will interfere with their entry into the Strip and their work.</p> \n<p>“No one will listen to the protest of a small organization on the exploitation of humanitarian activity,” he said. “Large organizations need to make their voices heard.”</p> \n<p>Foreigners who entered the Gaza Strip last week reported more exacting questioning than usual at Hamas’ border control position and strict identity checks of passengers at checkpoints within the Strip.</p> \n<p>A Westerner who visits the Strip frequently told Haaretz they sense some suspicion on the part of ordinary Gazans toward foreigners — and not for the first time.</p> \n<p>What is interesting is that Palestinian media outlets did not publish the suspicions about the Israel special force impersonating aid workers: In other words, Hamas did not raise this claim publicly.</p> \n<p>According to versions heard in the Gaza Strip, the members of the unit carried forged Palestinian ID cards, presumably of Gazans, and said they had food distribution coupons. It also seems they spent a number of days in the Strip before they were exposed.</p> \n<p>Working for an aid organization is a logical and convenient cover story. As part of the strict limits on movement by Israel, foreigners and Palestinians who are not residents of the Strip, who work for international aid organizations (and foreign journalists) are among the few who receive entry permits into the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>Hamas senior official Moussa Abu Marzouk was quoted as hinting that the entry of the unit was made possible through a checkpoint of the Palestinian Authority, at the Erez border crossing.</p> \n<p>His statement fed the constant suspicions against the PA’s security services of cooperation and help for the Israeli security forces. But knowing how the official entry process into the Gaza Strip from Israel works raises doubts about the feasibility of this scenario.</p> \n<p>In addition to navigating the bureaucracy of Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories to obtain an entry permit from Israel, foreigners seeking to enter the Gaza Strip must also coordinate their travel in advance with the Hamas authorities.</p> \n<p>To enter officially through the Erez crossing, you must submit full identification details, including details on the purpose of the visit and the organization and identity of contact persons inside the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;How Hamas sold out Gaza for cash from Qatar and collaboration with Israel&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>The military unit’s entry through Erez would have required Israel to use the name of a well-known aid organization, which would not raise any suspicions. Did the Israel Defense Forces use the name of an organization such as UNRWA or an Italian aid group funded by the European Union, for example?</p> \n<p>And if it turns out that to carry out the mission, the IDF invented a fictitious aid group a long time ago, and in doing so received the help of COGAT, from now on it can be expected that every real new organization will find it difficult to be trusted by the authorities and residents in the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>On entry to the Gaza Strip, those who receive permits go through four checkpoints: On the Israel side of the crossing, at the first registration position of the PA on the other side of the crossing, at the checkpoint of the PA police, which was once the Hamas checkpoint and was handed over to the PA about a year ago when it was attempted to establish a reconciliation government, and at the new registration position of Hamas, which has restarted operations these last few months.</p> \n<p>Even those bearing Palestinian identity cards — which according to reports the members of the unit carried — must pass through the posts of the PA and Hamas and answer questions. At the Hamas position, suitcases are not always checked, but a person who often enters the Gaza Strip told Haaretz that the check — even if only to search for alcohol — is always a risk to be taken into account.</p> \n<p>It is hard to believe that the members of the Israeli military unit would have entered Gaza without weapons, on one hand, or would have risked exposure, on the other, he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One gets the impression from media reports that Hamas and the IDF are both busy competing over who was humiliated more by the exposure of the unit’s operations. What is certain is that making humanitarian aid into a tool in the service of Israeli military intelligence contributes to the feeling of vulnerability and isolation of the Strip.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Amin Abu-Sakik, 34, who lives in Arara in the Negev, was married to A for more than a decade when he met H, a Palestinian woman 12 years his junior. The two were married in June 2017, and waited about two weeks until they asked the Muslim religious court to approve their marriage.</p> \n<p>In April, Abu-Sakik was indicted on charges of polygamy, an offense punishable by up to five years in prison.</p> \n<p>On July 16, Abu-Sakik’s attorney, Hamud Jamal, told the Be’er Sheba Magistrate’s Court that his client “had married in the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority and declared his marriage in Israel. This is just an accepted and known phenomenon.”</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Judge Ron Solkin convicted Abu-Sakik right after Jamal finished speaking. The penalty phase of the trial is to take place next month, and it remains to be seen whether the prosecution will ask for jail time.</p> \n<p>Abu-Sakik’s conviction is the first legal achievement for the prosecution since Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked declared war on polygamy, common mainly in Bedouin society. A committee was established, headed by Justice Ministry Director General Emi Palmor, to find civil ways to stop the practice, while a legal team appointed by Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit forged guidelines for enforcement.</p> \n<p>The goal was clear: After years of turning a blind eye, the authorities have begun enforcing the 1977 law against polygamy.</p> \n<p>Since the first indictment on charges of polygamy following Shaked’s announcement and until mid-October, 15 more indictments have been served. But the figures show that most of the cases have been closed because of Mendelblit’s directive not to press charges in cases of marriages that took place before the new guidelines were published. Polygamists who took another wife before January 2017 will not be prosecuted, Mendelblit said, other than in exceptional cases such as marriage to a minor or violence.</p> \n<p>According to the figures provided by the prosecution to Haaretz as part of the Freedom of Information Law, so far the prosecution has opened 351 cases involving polygamy, of which 297 have been closed without indictment, 35 cases are still under review and 16 indictments have been filed. Three cases have been given over to another prosecuting body.</p> \n<p>“The moment the guideline was published and a decision was made, we received a very large number of cases at the same time. The cases that according to the guidelines we had to close, we closed. If there was evidence, we prosecuted,” southern district prosecutor Alon Altman told Haaretz. Altman said the pace of the work was good, and that he doesn't believe any case gets shelved for months to &quot;gather dust.&quot;</p> \n<p>Erosion of opposition</p> \n<p>Precise figures on polygamy in Israel are hard to come by, because in many cases, women are smuggled into Israel for polygamous marriages. A committee set up to examine the matter concluded that although the state has not allocated the resources to properly assess the phenomenon, about 18.5 percent of men with families in Bedouin society in the Negev [some 6,179] are involved in polygamous marriages.</p> \n<p>Defense attorneys are responding to the change in policy by claiming first and foremost that enforcement is selective and discriminatory. Another claim is that only the men in the polygamous relationship is prosecuted, not the women.</p> \n<p>Since most of the cases are still before the courts, the impact of such arguments is still unclear. But a hearing that took place in the Be’er Sheva Magistrate’s Court last week might be an indication of what lies ahead.</p> \n<p>Zahi Abu-Jodah, 28, from an unrecognized Bedouin community in the Negev, is now on trial for taking a second wife. He, too, registered his marriage with the Muslim religious authorities two weeks after it occurred.</p> \n<p>Abu-Jodah’s attorney, Meir Suissa, told the court it was inconceivable for his client to be held criminally accountable when his marriage was approved by the religious authorities. “It is unclear where the state gets the gall to indict the accused without showing in any document that the prohibition against the marriage was brought to the accused’s attention.”</p> \n<p>Last week, Judge Solkin rejected this argument. He conceded that there had been a change in the prosecution’s policy but that everything necessary had been done to make the public aware of the change in policy. He also cited the “extensive and harmful implications,” not to mention the illegality, of polygamy.</p> \n<p>As for the response of the Muslim religious authorities to the change in enforcement: Attorney Insaf Abu-Sharb, a social activist and member of the Palmor committee, said, their opposition is softening.</p> \n<p>“The feeling is that everyone is keeping quiet meanwhile and waiting to see if this is a whim of the right-wing government and the Justice Ministry that will soon pass,” Abu-Sharb said, adding she believes Bedouin men are beginning to accept intervention and that things are changing.</p> \n<p>Still, the response of many in the Bedouin community shows that change is slow. “The state can make laws, but it can’t change our religion,” the chairman of the local council of the Bedouin town of Lakiya, Salem Abu-Ayash, told a local radio station.</p> \n<p>“We are Muslims and you are Jews, and we each have to act according to our own religious laws. Religion is above the law,” he said.</p>",

Back in the days before security cameras, I know Israelis who made sure to piss on the arch when no one was looking. And I totally get them.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Netanyahu lays trap for Bennett, who might make a colossal political mistake&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;'Israel stopped winning':&nbsp;Bennett slams Netanyahu, but won't quit government&nbsp;■&nbsp;Behind the scenes of Bennett's flip-flop on Netanyahu ultimatum</p> \n<p>Being there this weekend has an extra resonance. In a few days we’ll be commemorating the 71st anniversary of UN Resolution 181 of November 29, 1947, which called for the partition of the British-ruled Palestine Mandate into a Jewish state and an Arab state. Google “Titus Arch 1947” for one of the most moving images of Jewish resurrection - the footage of the Jews of Rome gathering at the arch, along with Holocaust survivors from across Europe.</p> \n<p>Throughout their history, Roman Jews had observed an unwritten rule never to walk beneath Titus’ Arch. But on the morning of November 30, 1947, they assembled there for the first time in joy, only three years after they had been in hiding, with the Germans rounding up deportations to Auschwitz, while the Vatican turned a blind eye - and made the most incredible prayer in the history of Jewish exile.</p> \n<p>The United Nations had voted to establish a Jewish sovereign state in the homeland and finally the Jews of Rome, joined by Holocaust survivors from across Europe, could raise their middle finger to Titus and to history.</p> \n<p>Seventy-one years later, are we still worthy of that moment? Does today’s Israel confirm the dreams of those Jews?</p> \n<p>One of the forums at the MED 2018 conference, organized by Italy’s public broadcaster RAI and the ISPI think-tank, is a closed discussion of journalists working around the Mediterranean and across the Middle East. Since it’s held under Chatham House rules, I’m not at liberty to discuss what was said there, but as an Israeli journalist, discussing the repression of media together with colleagues from the Arab world, it’s impossible to avoid a fleeting feeling of smugness.</p> \n<p>Even the most cynical Israeli hack, who laughs at that awful cliche of “the only democracy in the Middle East,” has to make comparisons in his mind. No matter how much we complain, we have it so much better.</p> \n<p>And to be quite honest, coming from the Arch of Titus on Thursday morning, I needed that brief comforting feeling of self-satisfaction. Looking up at the enslaved Jews on the arch, after this farcical political week in Israel, for the first time I seriously began to doubt we had stood the test.</p> \n<p>I don’t need to recap for readers the sequence of events in which Israel at one moment seemed to be going to early elections, with Benjamin Netanyahu having lost the confidence of most of his coalition, and on the next day Naftali Bennett spectacularly backed down, agreed to remain in government and Netanyahu once again proved his omnipotence.</p> \n<p>But just before Bennett’s statement in the Knesset on Monday morning, there was a moment which few besides the most obsessive political observers noticed.</p> \n<p>Miki Zohar, a little-known Likud MK, who currently chairs the Knesset committee in charge of all procedural parliamentary matters, was going around the Knesset, promising to block the planned motion aimed at dissolving the Knesset and bringing forward general elections.</p> \n<p>Zohar wasn’t talking of marshaling a parliamentary majority to defeat the vote. He was citing non-existent “security” concerns and “the interest of the state” to prevent what he called “whims of politicians.” In other words, Zohar was saying that even if a dissolution vote would pass, he would obstruct any attempts to allow it to proceed to its final readings, thereby aborting the election process.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;In the name of security&nbsp;&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>What’s more astonishing is that no one saw fit to call out Zohar. Despite Netanyahu’s regal manner, Israel is a parliamentary democracy and the implications of what his foot soldier Zohar was saying was that Likud would carry out a coup against Israel’s democracy. And yet no one noticed a member of the ruling party called openly for a coup.</p> \n<p>I know, it’s difficult to speak of “Israeli democracy” when Israel has for 51 years been holding millions of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza under military rule with no civil rights. But the whole point is that at least within the Green Line, it has remained an imperfect, but still functioning, democracy.</p> \n<p>In some ways, particularly the discrimination against minorities and the lack of full freedom from religion, it is worse than most Western and liberal democracies. But in other aspects, the fairness and transparency of its election system, independence of its judiciary, accountability of elected officials to the law and freedom of speech, few democracies are Israel’s equals.</p> \n<p>And here was an elected member of the ruling party openly advocating a coup against the parliamentary majority, the bedrock of Israel’s limited democracy, and not one of his colleagues or of the journalists interviewing him thought it worth pointing out.</p> \n<p>The moment passed, Bennett backed down, and Zohar’s machinations were swallowed up in the coverage of how Netanyahu had once again pulled a Houdini. But I can’t forget his smugly stupid face, blithely saying on Monday morning how he planned to take down Israeli democracy.</p> \n<p>I can’t read those thousands of joyous Jewish faces in the black-and-white footage from 71 years ago. Who can say what Jewish state they imagined was about to come into being? The Israeli Declaration of Independence, which would be written and signed less than six months later, promised that the new state would be based on “freedom, justice and peace,” and somehow, it was implicit that would mean democracy.</p> \n<p>But maybe all it needs is one ignorant MK prepared to do whatever he can to keep Netanyahu in power. It’s tenuous. A right-winger will argue that Zohar is a nobody and who cares what he says – if Bennett had resigned, there would have been an unstoppable majority for dissolving the Knesset and bringing the election forward. And left-wingers will laugh at me for only noticing now how screwed Israeli democracy is.</p> \n<p>But they’re both wrong, and anyway, that’s not the point.</p> \n<p>Spend a bit of time speaking with our regional neighbors, whose hearts leapt in the early months of 2011 with the prospect of democracy in the Middle East, boosted by the “Facebook revolution” (how quaint and ridiculous any notion of Facebook boosting democracy now sounds) only to see their hopes dashed with even worse repression than before. Every bit of democracy built in Israel over 70 years is precious and can be so easily blown away with excuses of “security” and the “interests of the state.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>KENTUCKY – A thin rain fell, but it did not look like a flood was about to wash away northern Kentucky. Yet, standing in front of us was Noah’s Ark, waiting to save mankind. It is 155.5 meters (510 feet) long and is perched in the middle of a beautiful green park. Along the trail are plants clipped into the shapes of pairs of elephants and giraffes. Hundreds of visitors who came to Grant County in Kentucky on the same rainy morning stood, gazing at it in wonder. Nothing had prepared us for the amazing sight of the enormous ark, without any windows, as tall as a seven-story building (16 meters high) nestled in the heart of America.</p> \n<p>The Ark Encounter, as the park is called, is one of those places you must see to believe. Immediately after you step into the ark, you find yourself engaged on two different levels. This is an awe-inspiring, fascinating, entertaining tourist attraction. But it is also one with terrifyingly serious intentions. Its founders “recreated” the biblical story of the flood and Noah, who built his lifeboat so that his family, along with the lizards, owls, bears and porcupines, would survive the flood. The ark floated and humanity was saved because of a single family. The animal kingdom survived and the story has a happy ending. A wonderful tale.</p> \n<p>But the builders of the modern version of the ark believe that this was not just a story. In their view, the Book of Genesis is a history book, every detail of which is accurate. They invested $120 million (through private donations and state funds) in building the Ark Encounter to convince visitors that the world was created less than 6,000 years ago, that Noah was 600 years old when the flood took place, that he spent 70 years building the ark and that 6,744 animals belonging to 1,398 species were on the vessel. How do they get to this precise number? The founders, members of “Answers in Genesis,” an evangelical Christian ministry, have made the exacting calculations.</p> \n<p>To spread their beliefs that the world was created in six days and rebooted after the flood, they invested a great deal of money and effort – and the ark project is just the beginning. Later, they will build a Tower of Babel, too, they promise. Over 2 million people have already visited the Ark Encounter since it was opened two years ago. It is the most popular tourist attraction today in Kentucky, with the visitors coming primarily from the Bible Belt.</p> \n<p>In addition to the new ark, visitors to the region take in the Creation Museum about an hour’s drive away in Petersburg, Kentucky. At this museum, built 10 years ago by Answers in Genesis, you can see dinosaurs strolling in the Garden of Eden, alongside Adam and Eve.</p> \n<p>Our friends, the dinosaurs</p> \n<p>For over four hours, I climbed between the decks of the ark. It doesn’t have staircases, only well-designed, long, polished wooden platforms. Every floor is about a different topic. The first deck is devoted to the living conditions of the animals and people who spent the 150 days of the flood inside the ark. It turns out they had thousands of jugs of water made out of clay, containers of food, piles of straw – and mostly lots of large wooden cages where the animals lived: pair by pair. Noah and his family are displayed on the second deck alongside questions about evolution, compared to creationist theory. The third floor compares Noah’s era to ours today. It turns out that Judgment Day will come but we can still be saved.</p> \n<p>The lighting is a bit dim, yellowish. No natural light enters the ark. A fascinating soundtrack accompanies the visitors. You hear kids bleating and elephants trumpeting, human cries along with barking, chirping and screeching. You can hear the incredible storm raging outside. In a few places there is music. The pens contain animals in the form of terrifyingly realistic models, complete with fur and a vital look in their eyes. Made especially for the ark museum, they are truly wonderful – especially the dinosaurs. You didn’t know there were dinosaurs in Noah’s Ark? Then it’s a good thing you came to visit the Ark Encounter. It turns out that the subject of dinosaurs is a really big thing. If until now you thought the dinosaurs went extinct over 60 million years ago, then think again – the dinosaurs were in the ark too, alongside people.</p> \n<p>All the exhibits are complemented by displays of information, diagrams and figures that lend it all a scientific feel. A team of Hollywood designers, led by Patrick Marsh – who worked for Universal Studios and built such attractions as King Kong – are responsible for the excellent design. The level of work on the ark, including all its details and components, competes quite successfully with the best theme parks in America. Some of the animals move, others make noises, some of them flap their wings and other eat out of the hands of mannequins of Noah, his sons and daughters-in-law. The daughters-in-law may not have names in the Book of Genesis, but the founders of the ark took some artistic liberties.</p> \n<p>This is not the only case of such liberties. The bible does not elaborate on many topics, beginning with the precise dimensions of the ark, its appearance, or how the internal spaces were divided up. The builders of the contemporary ark took it upon themselves to fill in those blanks. They also provide detailed explanations of their decisions and the considerations that guided them. To judge by the fascinated and wonderstruck looks of the visitors, they did a good job.</p> \n<p>“It is not a cute story, it is a horrible story,” says Hunt. “This is a story of genocide and incest. God killed everybody,” says Hunt, questioning the premise that the extinction of humanity can be presented as a Disney-style attraction.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The approach of the founders of Noah’s ark is surprising. They are not trying to hide or skirt the accepted scientific claims. Just the opposite. They present the latest scientific theories one by one and address the claims of those who espouse evolution, history of the human species and the world.</p> \n<p>Over 120 exhibits are spread out throughout the ark. In every one, the scientific approach is presented alongside the “divine” approach. God’s word is much simpler and much more convincing than the complex and confusing claims of humans. In a few places, detailed explanations are presented of why everything written in the Bible is true. In other places in the ark, questions are directed at the creationists: How did Noah keep the temperature cool inside the ark so the polar bears could survive? Each of these is answered in a simple, direct and convincing manner. The answer? Polar bears don’t need low temperatures. But in any case, polar bears weren’t on the ark – Noah took only one pair of bears with him. All the bears in our world today are their descendants, including the polar bears.</p> \n<p>The correct approach</p> \n<p>The people behind the ark leave no grey area – there is only the correct and incorrect approach. They, of course, are right. They are not apologetic about this. On the contrary, they have gone on the offensive. The innocent visitor, charmed by the scale and quality of the exhibit and the first impression it leaves, doesn’t have a chance.</p> \n<p>Scientists may present the skeleton of Lucy – the fossil of an Australopithecus found in Ethiopia that is estimated to be 3 million years old and considered to be a possible ancestor of modern man – as proof of evolution. The ark and Creation Museum don’t ignore that. They, too, display the fossil bones, but alongside a model of a chimpanzee with an explanation that Lucy was an ape.</p> \n<p>“Maybe there is something to this story,” an elderly man standing next to me says, as we read the nice explanation, – using clear and simple pictures and illustrations – detailing the process that created the Grand Canyon as the direct result of the flood. So what if geologists unanimously agree that the Grand Canyon was created through a long process by the Colorado River 6 million years ago, while the creators of the Ark Encounter think it was created in a flash by the flood, only 5,000 years ago?</p> \n<p>Like most of the visitors to the ark, I too was not prepared to deal with the onslaught. Those who believe in the story of creation nod their heads in agreement and march on with satisfaction to the next display. The members of the larger group, who tend to believe the scientists and think that geologists know what they are talking about, are filled with doubt for a moment. It takes knowledge and determination to overcome more than 120 impressive exhibits. It is easier and more convenient to drown in delusions.</p> \n<p>Answers in Genesis</p> \n<p>The organization that built the ark, Answers in Genesis, is an evangelical Christian group that proclaims the truth is written in the Bible and it is historical and factual. Ken Ham, 67, who was born in Australia but now lives in the United States, renamed and founded the U.S. branch of the group in 1994. He even taught high school science classes. Since then he has published 50 books, including “The Lie: Evolution” and a children’s book: “Dinosaurs of Eden,” that answers questions such as whether Adam and Noah lived along with the dinosaurs (The answer is yes). Much of his work has been done along with his colleagues Mark Looy and Mike Zovath.</p> \n<p>The day after I visited Noah’s ark, at the end of a visit to the Creation Museum, I had a long conversation with Looy, one of the founders, and Patrick Kanewske, who served in the Marines for 30 years and today is one of the senior executives for the two attractions. They were both very pleasant, polite and were happy to answer my questions. The fact that the Ark Encounter has drawn interest in Israel seemed to be taken for granted for them. They are not afraid of criticism or a cynical approach in the media. In fact, they demonstrated endless warmth and friendliness. The ark is a Christian themed attraction and people come to see it because they are curious about the Biblical story, says Looy.</p> \n<p>“The bible is history. We take it literally. This is how we portray it here,” says Looy, noting that “we do give two different views – men’s word and God’s word. We don’t give our opinion in what you have to believe, as you probably saw, especially in the scientific exhibits. We think the creation side, God’s side, is very compelling.”</p> \n<p>As for why they chose the story of Noah’s Ark and the flood, he says it is because the flood was a dramatic turning point in the history of mankind, a new beginning for history. In the future, they plan on presenting other dramas, including the life of Jesus and the Tower of Babels. “This is just the beginning,” says Looy.</p> \n<p>The reason they chose Kentucky is that it’s a location accessible to two-thirds of the U.S. population who can reach it in less than a day of driving. Their presence also helps to boost an economically depressed region. The two sites employ 1,000 people and stimulate commerce and industry in the region, says Looy.</p> \n<p>The organization is not involved in politics, he says. But it does take a position concerning “religious” issues such as abortion and marriage. In Looy’s view, America was once a Christian nation, but not so anymore. He argues that people gave up Christianity because of science, which supposedly disproved the Biblical account. The group’s goal is to provide the church with good answers to defend their faith.</p> \n<p>Looy is well aware that for now the creationists are still in the minority. But he is hopeful about the impact that the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum have had on the two million people who have already visited and been exposed to new information. Fighting evolution is a difficult battle, he admits, but he is optimistic.</p> \n<p>LGBTs left out </p> \n<p>Looy’s optimism worries many people, two of whom I met the day after my visit to the ark. We met at a Mexican restaurant off the highway leading to Cincinnati, Ohio – they didn’t want to get anywhere close to the Ark Encounter.</p> \n<p>The Tri-State Freethinkers is an organization of atheists from Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana with 2,800 members. They act against racial discrimination, the Ku Klux Klan, support legal abortions, aid LGBT people, and back the right to die with dignity. Their battles have included demonstrations in front of the ark, since the day it was launched.</p> \n<p>How can you build an amusement park based on a story that is filled with genocide and incest, ask Jen Scott and Jim Hunt, two members of the Freethinkers in their 30s, who live in Florence, Kentucky, a suburban community in the northern part of the state, not far from Cincinnati. Is Noah’s family the example we want to educate the children of Kentucky on, they ask?</p> \n<p>“It is not a cute story, it is a horrible story,” says Hunt. “This is a story of genocide and incest. God killed everybody,” says Hunt, questioning the premise that the extinction of humanity can be presented as a Disney-style attraction. “What is amusing about that?”</p> \n<p>The Ark Encounter was set up with support of the founders and a number of wealthy evangelical figures. The local authority provided the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Employees must declare their religious belief and pledge that they are not LGBT, charge Scott and Hunt. Single people must commit to not having sex before marriage, they add.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Spokespeople for Answers for Genesis confirmed that employees at the museums are required to sign a declaration pledging that they believe in Christianity and God’s creation of the world. They declined to show me the wording of this statement and did not provide details of what it includes. In response to a question of whether I could be hired there, they said it depends on whether I would be willing to sign the declaration.</p> \n<p>Where’s the rainbow?</p> \n<p>Near the end of the visit in the ark, I expected to reach the upper deck, outside. But there is no such thing. At no time does the window heralding hope open above my head. The ark is a closed bubble. Noah may be standing on a ladder on the uppermost deck and holding a dove, but that’s all.</p> \n<p>You can’t even see the rainbow, and that’s a shame, because after the flood the colorful rainbow is supposed to appear – a promise to us that the threat to mankind and animals in our world is over. Instead of the rainbow was a large store selling souvenirs and from there we went on to the Ararat Zoo. The pair of kangaroos smiled at me.</p> \n<p>Correction (November 25, 2018): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Ark Encounter was set up&nbsp;with support from the state of Kentucky and has since been corrected. In addition, the article incorrectly stated that the founders took out a loan for the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

To demonstrate it, they asked Qahtani to go to a nearby mall, buy an iPhone and give them its number. During that meeting they showed how this was enough to hack into the new phone and record and photograph the participants in the meeting.</p> \n<p>The meeting in Vienna wasn’t the first one between the two sides. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently expressed pride in the tightening ties with Gulf states, with Israel’s strength its technology.

On the line was W., an Israeli dealing in defense-related technologies and who operates through Cyprus-based companies. (Many defense-related companies do business in Cyprus because of its favorable tax laws.) W. asked his European interlocutor to help him do business in the Gulf.</p> \n<p>Among the European businessman’s acquaintances were the two senior Saudi officials, Malihi and Qahtani.</p> \n<p>On February 1, 2017, W. and the businessman met for the first time. The main topic was the marketing of cyberattack software. Unlike ordinary weapons systems, the price depends only on a customer’s eagerness to buy the system.</p> \n<p>The following month, the European businessman traveled to a weapons exhibition in the United Arab Emirates, where a friend introduced him to Malihi, the Saudi businessman.</p> \n<p>In April 2017, a meeting was arranged in Vienna between Malihi, Qahtani and representatives of Israeli companies. Two more meetings subsequently took place with officials of Israeli companies in which other Israelis were present. These meetings took place at the Four Seasons Hotel in Limassol, Cyprus, where Israeli cybercompanies often meet with foreign clients.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Snowden: Israeli firm's spyware was used to track Khashoggi</p> \n<p>The meetings were attended by W. and his son.

Their main interest was cybersystems. For a few dozens of millions of dollars, they would be able to hack into the phones of regime opponents in Saudi Arabia and around the world and collect classified information about them.</p> \n<p>According to the European businessman, the Saudis, already at the first meeting, passed along to the representatives of one of the companies details of a Twitter account of a person who had tweeted against the regime. They wanted to know who was behind the account, but the Israeli company refused to say.</p> \n<p>In the June 2017 meeting, the Saudis expressed interest in NSO’s technology.</p> \n<p>According to the European businessman, in July 2017 another meeting was held between the parties, the first at W.’s home in Cyprus. W. proposed selling Pegasus 3 software to the Saudis for $208 million.</p> \n<p>Malihi subsequently contacted W. and invited him to Riyadh to present the software to members of the royal family. The department that oversees defense exports in Israel’s Defense Ministry and the ministry’s department for defense assistance, responsible for encouraging exports, refused to approve W.’s trip.</p> \n<p>Using the initials for the defense assistance department, W. reportedly said “screw the D.A.” and chartered a small plane, taking with him NSO’s founder, Shalev Hulio, to the meetings in the Gulf. According to the European businessman, the pair were there for three days, beginning on July 18, 2017.</p> \n<p>At these meetings, the European businessman said, an agreement was made to sell the Pegasus 3 to the Saudis for $55 million.</p> \n<p>According to the European businessman, the details of the deal became known to him only through his contacts in the defense assistance department. He said he had agreed orally with W. that his commission in the deal would be 5 percent – $2.75 million.</p> \n<p>But W. and his son stopped answering the European businessman’s phone calls. Later, the businessman told the police, he received an email from W.’s lawyer that contained a fake contract in which the company would agree to pay only his expenses and to consider whether to pay him a bonus if the deal went through.</p> \n<p>The European businessman, assisted by an Israeli lawyer, filed a complaint in April 2018. He was questioned by the police’s national fraud squad and was told that the affair had been transferred to another unit specializing in such matters. Since then he has been contacted by the income tax authorities, who are apparently checking whether there has been any unreported income from the deal.</p> \n<p>The European businessman’s claims seem to be substantiated by correspondence Haaretz has obtained between Cem Koksal, a Turkish businessman living in the UAE, and W.’s lawyers in Israel. The European businessman said in his complaint that Koksal was involved in mediating the deal.</p> \n<p>In a letter sent by Koksal’s lawyer in February of this year, he demanded his portion from W. In a response letter, sent in early March, W.’s attorney denied the existence of the deal. The deal had not been signed, the letter claimed, due to Koksal’s negligence, therefore he was due no commission or compensation of any kind.</p> \n<p>These issues have a wider context. From the claims by the European businessman and Koksal’s letter, it emerges that the deal was signed in the summer of 2017, a few months before Crown Prince Mohammed began his purge of regime opponents. During that purge, the Saudi regime arrested and tortured members of the royal family and Saudi businessmen accused of corruption. The Saudis also held Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri for a few days in a Riyadh hotel.</p> \n<p>In the following months the Saudis continued their hunt for regime opponents living abroad, which raised international attention only when the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul came to light in October.</p> \n<p>It has recently been claimed that NSO helped the Saudi regime surveil its opponents. According to an article in Forbes magazine and reports from Citizen Lab, a Canadian academic think tank focusing on technology and human rights, among the surveillance targets were the satirist Ghanem Almasrir and human rights activist Yahya Asiri, who live in London, and Omar Abdulaziz, who lives in exile in Canada.</p> \n<p>These three men were in contact with Khashoggi. Last month, Edward Snowden, who uncovered the classified surveillance program of the U.S. National Security Agency, claimed that Pegasus had been used by the Saudi authorities to surveil Khashoggi.</p> \n<p>“They are the worst of the worst,” Snowden said of NSO, whose people he accused of aiding and abetting human rights violations.</p> \n<p>NSO’s founders and chief executives are Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio. The company is registered in Cyprus but its development headquarters is in Herzliya. In 2014 the company was sold to private equity firm Francisco Partners based on a valuation of $250 million.</p> \n<p>Francisco Partners did not respond to Haaretz’s request for comment.</p> \n<p>In May, Verint Systems offered to buy NSO for $1 billion, but the offer was rejected. The company is awash in cash. Earlier this month all its employees went on vacation in Phuket, Thailand. Netta Barzilai, Lior Suchard, the Ma Kashur Trio and the band Infected Mushroom were also flown there to entertain them.</p> \n<p>The Pegasus system developed by NSO was a “one-click system,” meaning that the victim had to press on a link sent to him through phishing. The new system no longer requires this. Only the number of the SIM card is needed to hack into the phone. It’s unknown how Pegasus does this.</p> \n<p>Technology sources believe that the technology either exploits breaches in the cellphone’s modem, the part that receives messages from the antenna, or security breaches in the apps installed on a phone. As soon as a phone is hacked, the speaker and camera can be used for recording conversations. Even encoded apps such as WhatsApp can be monitored.</p> \n<p>NSO’s operations are extremely profitable.</p> \n<p>The company, which conceals its client list, has been linked to countries that violate human rights. NSO says its products are used in the fight against crime and terror, but in certain countries the authorities identify anti-regime activists and journalists as terrorists and subject them to surveillance.</p> \n<p>In 2012, NSO sold an earlier version of Pegasus to Mexico to help it combat the drug cartel in that country. According to the company, all its contracts include a clause specifically permitting the use of its software only to “investigate and prevent crime or acts of terror.” But The New York Times reported in 2016 that the Mexican authorities also surveilled journalists and lawyers.</p> \n<p>Following that report, Mexican victims of the surveillance filed a lawsuit in Israel against NSO last September. This year, The New York Times reported that the software had been sold to the UAE, where it helped the authorities track leaders of neighboring countries as well as a London newspaper editor.</p> \n<p>In response to these reports, NSO said it “operated and operates solely in compliance with defense export laws and under the guidelines and close oversight of all elements of the defense establishment, including all matters relating to export policies and licenses.</p> \n<p>“The information presented by Haaretz about the company and its products and their use is wrong, based on partial rumors and gossip. The presentation distorts reality.</p> \n<p>“The company has an independent, external ethics committee such as no other company like it has. It includes experts in legal affairs and international relations. The committee examines every deal so that the use of the system will take place only according to permitted objectives of investigating and preventing terror and crime.</p> \n<p>“The company’s products assist law enforcement agencies in protecting people around the world from terror attacks, drug cartels, child kidnappers for ransom, pedophiles, and other criminals and terrorists.</p> \n<p>“In contrast to newspaper reports, the company does not sell its products or allow their use in many countries. Moreover, the company greatly limits the extent to which its customers use its products and is not involved in the operation of the systems by customers.”</p> \n<p>A statement on W.’s behalf said: “This is a false and completely baseless complaint, leverage for an act of extortion by the complainants, knowing that there is no basis for their claims and that if they would turn to the relevant courts they would be immediately rejected.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Mossad’s Kidon unit, which foreign media describe as Israel’s official assassination squad, must be worried sick over the fallout from the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Alongside its many successful hits, some of which are surely still unknown, Kidon’s men (and presumably women) have also known notorious failures, including the mistaken 1970 killing of Moroccan waiter Ahmed Bouchiki in Lillehammer, Norway, the failed 1997 assassination of Hamas leader Khaled Mashal in Jordan and the successful, albeit meticulously filmed 2010 hit on Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel paid a price for these and other operational flops, but it never came close to undermining its international standing or threatening the careers of its leaders.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Khashoggi scandal completes Trump-Netanyahu symbiosis</p> \n<p>From a professional point of view, Khashoggi’s murder was exceptionally brutal, but also spectacularly stupid. It was carried out inside a diplomatic installation, the likes of which are routinely under surveillance by host countries, a factor that undermined Riyadh’s ability to plausibly deny responsibility. But rather than stay silent, the Saudi PR geniuses added insult to injury with a series of rebuttals so ridiculous they were seen as admissions of guilt.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The ensuing rage and outcry against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aka MBS, especially in the U.S., set a new standard for reactions to botched assassinations, which could come to haunt Israel as well. Unlike most Israeli operations, the Saudi hit was singularly brainless, flouted diplomatic protocol and, on top of that, its target was a Saudi citizen – not a foreign enemy. Nevertheless, the next time Israel is implicated in a failed or even successful assassination on foreign soil, its critics will cite the Saudi precedent in order to press for a forceful international response.</p> \n<p>Benjamin Netanyahu is experienced in such matters. The Mashal affair, which took place during his first term in office, compelled the prime minister to release the late Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin; the Mabhouh caper, which unfolded during Netanyahu’s second coming, reportedly and allegedly exposed Kidon’s modus operandi for all the world to see. Netanyahu knows that Saudi Arabia will have to pay a price, but the demand for the crown prince's removal seems way too steep. So that even if the sword hanging over Mohammed bin Salman's head did not endanger the entire Middle East strategy he encouraged Trump to adopt, Netanyahu would still have a personal, professional and national interest in minimizing the prince's punishment.</p> \n<p>But it is a strategic threat with possible domestic political repercussions that has moved the prime minister to openly take one for the Trump-Netanyahu team. Netanyahu and his aides, led by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Ron Dermer, have been working around the clock to protect Trump and to prevent his administration from “throwing out the prince with the bathwater,” as Dermer put it. Netanyahu has volunteered to serve as Trump’s human shield to protect him from widespread demands by both Democrats and Republicans to punish the crown prince and his kingdom for the Khashoggi assassination.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu and Trump hope that the extraordinarily frank but characteristically childish statement issued by the White House this week, in which Trump vowed to stick with Crown Prince Mohammed through thick and thin, will seal the lid on the Khashoggi affair. Saudi Arabia is too crucial an ally for the United States to dump: If George W. Bush successfully maintained ties with Riyadh despite the heavy involvement of Saudi citizens in the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, Trump can certainly afford to more or less ignore the assassination of a journalist who the Saudis describe “as an ‘enemy of the state’ and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that,” as Trump wrote in a “doth protest too much” part of his statement.</p> \n<p>Even if Trump no longer has the personal economic interests in Saudi Arabia of which he boasted in the past, his improved ties with the kingdom – especially the half-a-trillion-dollar arms deal signed during his visit to Riyadh last year – is a rare feather in his otherwise barren diplomatic hat.</p> \n<p>“The world is a very dangerous place!” Trump explained in his statement, in case anyone thought otherwise. And even though the evidence clearly points to the crown prince's complicity – a conclusion supported by a leaked CIA report – Trump is yet to be convinced: “Maybe he did and maybe he didn’t,” he asserted. “America First!” Trump explained, reverting to the slogan of the pre-World War II and at least partially anti-Semitic movement that encapsulates much of the apprehension of American Jews about the his presidency.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump had no hesitation about deploying whatever remains of Israel’s good name as a political Iron Dome. On Thursday night he asserted, “Israel would be in a lot of trouble without Saudi Arabia.” In his written statement, Trump mentioned Israel twice: First to underline Saudi Arabia’s importance in warding off the big Satan Iran and then to justify Washington’s intention of standing by Riyadh in order to “ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel, Trump assumes, is the magic word that will ensure the support of Evangelicals, who will in turn mitigate the harsh positions taken by some Republican Senators, especially Lindsey Graham, against the Saudi crown prince.</p> \n<p>Democrats, in any case, were apparently less impressed. Widely respected Washington Post columnist Jackson Diehl wrote that “a lot of Republicans as well as Democrats will be repelled… by the spectacle of an Israeli leader lobbying to excuse an Arab dictator for murder.” Diehl made a direct connection between Netanyahu’s lobbying on behalf of Crown Prince Mohammed and Israel’s staunch defense of Trump in the wake of last month’s massacre of 11 worshippers in Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue. Netanyahu’s reasoning may be acceptable for Israelis and their right-wing supporters in the U.S., but his handling of both the Khashoggi murder and the Pittsburgh massacre is widely perceived by American liberals as the latest expressions of his overenthusiastic embrace of a president who is arguably the most reviled in American history.</p> \n<p>As it is, Israel was already skating on thin ice in its relations with Democrats, who have now returned to wielding real power after seizing control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections. As U.S. commentators have pointed out in recent days, the Democratic triumph was far more extensive and sweeping than was thought in the first hours after polls closed. Not only do they now enjoy a commanding 35-member majority in the House, which could grow to 37 after the two last races are called, but their 8 percent or 8.6 million vote advantage is their biggest since the 1974 midterms held just after Richard Nixon’s Watergate-induced resignation. The Democratic surge was especially pronounced among women and, more ominously for Israel, among young voters, who came out in droves to vote against Trump.</p> \n<p>Israel can still rely on the Democratic old guard, even though Nancy Pelosi, frontrunner to serve as the new Speaker of the House, hasn’t forgiven Netanyahu for his controversial March 2015 speech to Congress against Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. The Democratic clock, however, is ticking against Israel’s favor: For the party’s new generation, the foundations of traditional support for Israel – the Holocaust, independence and the Six-Day War – are nothing more than historical footnotes. Many of them have grown up with an Israel that is mentioned mainly in connection with its 51-year-old occupation of the Palestinian territories, its steady slide into the ranks of abhorrent anti-democratic, ethnocentric autocracies and its growing estrangement from American Jews, who voted overwhelmingly for Trump’s political opponents. For many Democrats, Jewish or not, Netanyahu’s unequivocal and unseemly backing for Trump is a cardinal and unforgivable sin.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s willingness to openly and unabashedly defend Saudi Arabia also strays from Israel’s traditional aversion to public scrutiny of its influence on Washington’s decision-making, especially in volatile international crises that could ultimately lead to U.S. military involvement. Israel and its supporters spent years rebuffing distorted claims that it pushed George W. Bush to go to war with Iraq. If the Saudi situation spins out of control, Netanyahu’s involvement will be undeniable: His name on the Saudi debacle will be etched in stone.</p> \n<p>Luckily for him, though, Israeli public opinion seems unperturbed by the fate of relations with Saudi Arabia or, for that matter, by the country’s increasingly precarious standing with Democrats. Netanyahu’s decision to refrain from retaliating forcefully to last week’s brazen rocket attack by Hamas enraged the Israeli public, especially on the right, but it is mostly blind to the disturbing wider picture: Netanyahu’s entire, Trump-centered national security policies may be on the verge of complete and systematic collapse.</p> \n<p>The evidence is mounting: The huge propaganda victory scored by Hamas in last week’s outburst has undermined Netanyahu’s image as number one security honcho who makes Israel’s enemies tremble with fear. The September downing of a Russian spy plane over Syria has inhibited the air force’s freedom of action against Iran and Hezbollah and undercut Netanyahu’s swagger about his stellar relationship with Vladimir Putin. And the Saudi embroilment in the Khashoggi affair isn’t over yet: In a worst-case scenario it could sabotage the anti-Iranian front conjured by Trump and Netanyahu and undermine Netanyahu’s claim to improve relations with moderate Arab states despite the total freeze on peace moves with the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Crown Prince Mohammed, after all, was to play a critical role in tempering Palestinian expectations and bringing them “back to reality,” as Dermer often says, in advance of the perennially-imminent publication of Trump’s peace plan. Some commentators predict that the Saudi crown prince is now so indebted to Trump that his support for the plan will be even more emphatic, but it’s more reasonable to assume that his newly-precarious hold on power will dissuade him from expressing emphatic support for a peace plan that is bound to enrage Palestinians as well as the proverbial “Arab street” in Riyadh, Mecca and other Arab cities.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu might actually welcome Saudi reticence that could help convince the Trump administration to hold off once again with its plan. The recent coalition crisis made it crystal clear that Netanyahu could be one of the first victims of his Washington BFF’s blueprint. Any peace plan published by the White House, even one viewed by Palestinians and the world as completely one-sided in Israel’s favor, will necessarily include relinquishment of territory, in East Jerusalem as well as the West Bank. It will be uniformly rejected by most of the Israeli right. Netanyahu is certainly loath to reject the fruit of Trump’s pro-Israel peace team’s labor, but anything less than a resounding “no” on his part could persuade even more voters to opt for parties to his right in the upcoming elections.</p> \n<p>The bottom line is that even the friendliest U.S. president in human history, as Netanyahu often describes him, is carrying a ticking time bomb that could soon blow up in the prime minister’s face. And as Netanyahu has recently learned from the botched military incursion in Gaza, the downing of the Russian plane and the horrid Khashoggi killing in Istanbul, unexpected developments can shake up the Middle East and demolish his image as its master manipulator. When lady luck thumbs her nose at the start of an election year, even the conventional wisdom about Netanyahu’s inevitable victory could dissipate in an instant, along with his hitherto-lauded grand strategies.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the Gaza Strip, which triggered Israel’s most recent political crisis, relative quiet actually prevailed this week. The intermediaries, members of Egyptian intelligence, asked Hamas for three weekends of quiet. During the first week the organization kept its promise. Last Friday, its security personnel were deployed near the border with Israel and prevented the demonstrators, many of them Hamas activists themselves, from approaching the fence.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The positive influence of the fuel and money from Qatar is still being felt, with the most important improvement in the situation being the tripling of the electricity supply to the inhabitants. The Israel Defense Forces, accordingly, has lowered some aspects of the high alert in the south, but remains defensively pessimistic. The army units continue to train and to prepare for a possibility of escalation, which is liable even to mushroom into a large-scale operation next time.</p> \n<p>The leaders’ interest is still focused on the northern front. As opposed to the possible impression left by Netanyahu’s speech this week, we are not facing an immediate danger of war. On the other hand, there is also a gap between the public’s awareness and the actual severity of the situation. Israel is still deeply mired in a complicated strategic situation: The downing of the Ilyushin plane by a Syrian defense system on September 17 infuriated the Russians, changed their conduct and reduced the IAF’s freedom of activity in the skies of Syria.</p> \n<p>If previously attacks against Iranian arms convoys and bases in Syria were approved almost routinely, now any such activity – and the Israeli leadership has already hinted that several such attacks have nevertheless been carried out – is accompanied by a great degree of uncertainty. Russia is turning a cold shoulder to Israel. Even former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman was unable to arrange a meeting in Moscow with his counterpart, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, and apparently IAF Commander Norkin also had a difficult experience there.</p> \n<p>Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot lectured on Wednesday at a conference of the State Comptroller’s Office. “The crying that I hear about the loss of Israeli deterrence,” he said, “does not accord with the intelligence material that I read every morning about Gaza, Syria and Lebanon.” On all those fronts, it should be repeated, Netanyahu has until now shown caution and responsibility. That is an essential approach in order to prevent an unwanted war.</p> \n<p>Bennett’s CNN maneuver</p> \n<p>During his disastrous press conference at the beginning of the week, in which he threatened to resign from the government and changed his mind, Education Minister Naftali Bennett performed a CNN maneuver. A few weeks ago U.S. President Donald Trump inflated an incident with a CNN correspondent, thereby diverting discussion from the relative Republican failure in the midterm Congressional elections.</p> \n<p>Bennett embarked on a frontal attack against an easy target – Maj. Gen. Sharon Afek, the military advocate general. He claimed that IDF soldiers “are more afraid of the MAG than of Yahya Sinwar,” the Hamas chief. When he was criticized, the following day Bennett supported his assertion by quoting parts of the statements of Maj. Gen. (res.) Yishai Bar, former president of the Military Appeals Court.</p> \n<p>At a conference of the Israel Democracy Institute about the status of the IDF as a people’s army, Bar said he had advised former Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi “not to bring the legal advisers into the war rooms.” I asked Bar the next day about what he said. His viewpoint is more complicated than that presented by the education minister. Throughout his years in the IDF, Bar vocally advocated strict observance of the rules of international law during combat in the territories. He also believes that this obligation must be imposed on the commanders during combat. The role of the legal advisers is to supervise, not to replace the commanders. Bennett wants more than that. In his statements he claimed in effect that the restraints imposed by the Military Prosecution on the soldiers prevent the IDF from winning at war.</p> \n<p>According to a survey presented at the conference, the nation is moving in the direction of the education minister. The survey, conducted by Prof. Tamar Hermann and Or Anavi, examined the views of the Israeli public regarding values in combat, ranging from adopting punitive measures (home demolition, the death penalty for terrorists) to the rules for opening fire. As expected, the survey indicates substantial support for the punitive policy in the territories along with a demand to take more severe steps.</p> \n<p>The political controversy is reflected in all its gravity, in the responses regarding the IDF’s conduct in combat. While those who place themselves on the left and the center fully support the views of the senior commanders, as they were reflected for example in the affair of soldier Elor Azaria (who was convicted of shooting at an incapacitated terrorist), the attitude on the right varies.</p> \n<p>“On the right, and especially in the ultra-Orthodox community, there is an erosion and even an oppositional attitude to these viewpoints,” write Hermann and Anavi. Half of the right-wingers (47 percent vs. 48 percent) are opposed to prosecuting a soldier for looting, and a majority (53 percent) support killing a terrorist after he has been incapacitated and does not present any danger (in brief, the Azaria affair). Among the ultra-Orthodox, a sweeping majority opposes the declared views of the army on these issues.</p> \n<p>And yet, they write, “On every issue in which the state institutions – the IDF, political leaders, the courts and the school system – opposed a specific method of operation,” that has an influence on the public. They add a recommendation: “The discussion should be conducted not only within the army, but in public forums as well, thus providing senior commanders with public support, which is essential for preserving public confidence in the army systems.” Bennett, who this week once again declared himself a suitable candidate for the job of defense minister in the future, apparently didn’t see the email.</p> \n<p>While in the Israel Democracy Institute they argued about IDF values, at the training base in Tze’elim the fighters of the Kfir Brigade practiced occupying a Palestinian village. The complex, which includes tunnels and shafts, looks like the outskirts of the Palestinian towns in the Gaza Strip. At the entrance to one of the houses that he is supposed to search with his fighters, the platoon commander hears a recording of a crying baby. Now he has to make a decision: How should he enter the house, knowing that there are civilians there, and perhaps enemy fighters as well?</p> \n<p>The senior officers at the site explain that the platoon commander has to take into account considerations such as proportionality and distinguishing between terrorists and innocent bystanders – and perhaps he can take over another house, which better serves his goal. In another scenario, a barrage was fired at the soldiers from inside a building in which there was a large number of civilians. Does the platoon commander summon a combat helicopter to drop a bomb on the building, or use precise sniper fire to silence the source of the shooting?</p> \n<p>All these scenarios, like the rules of combat, are formulated by commanders. The legal advisers are not even in evidence. Although Kfir is the brigade in which Azaria served, its commanders seem very confident and expert at the rules of combat as they are dictated to them by their superiors.</p> \n<p>Reckless Regev</p> \n<p>The venomous attack by Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev on former IDF chief and emerging politician Benny Gantz is evidence of the nature of the military atmosphere these days. During Operation Defensive Edge, Regev claimed in an interview with the Keshet broadcasting franchise, the former chief of staff called on the residents of the south to go out and pick anemones, and “Daniel Tragerman, the little boy, was killed.”</p> \n<p>The connection between the two events is minimal. Gantz was expressing a future hope for quiet towards the end of the operation in the summer of 2014 (anemones actually grow in the winter and in Israel picking them is prohibited). Four-year-old Daniel Tragerman was killed in a mortar attack against his kibbutz Nahal Oz. Gantz, who was touring the area during the incident, was one of the first to visit the family.</p> \n<p>Regev did not apologize, of course. To hell with the facts: After all, we’re living in the world of Donald Trump. She also ignored the identity of the prime minister who appointed Gantz chief of staff and was his superior during the frustrating days of Operation Protective Edge. Her attack was apparently related to the latest surveys, which indicate growing public support for appointing Gantz defense minister.</p> \n<p>Gantz was often criticized on these pages during his tenure as chief of staff, mainly in connection with the IDF’s performance during Operation Protective Edge. It is doubtful whether the man who even now is extremely cautious about expressing even the slightest original idea will really fulfill the left’s dreams of a dramatic political change. If we measure chiefs of staff using the slogan with which the IDF approached the disengagement from Gaza – that it would be carried out “with sensitivity and determination” – &nbsp;Gantz for the most part has demonstrated somewhat more sensitivity than determination.</p> \n<p>And still, the former chief of staff has more integrity in his little finger than Regev has ever demonstrated. Only a few weeks ago, after a misogynistic remark from the Knesset podium by Yesh Atid MK Elazar Stern, she declared that she was mortally insulted and immediately received a warm embrace from the left and from women’s organizations.</p> \n<p>Regev has not always been a model of sisterhood. In 2002 she served as the deputy of IDF Spokesperson Brig. Gen. Ruth Yaron. The two didn’t get along, to put it mildly. The head of the Operations Directorate, Maj. Gen. Dan Harel, the most decent and compassionate member of the General Staff, was called on to decide. When Harel heard how Regev treated one of her subordinates, a female soldier in the unit, and what expressions she used, he made sure to remove her immediately from her position.</p> \n<p>Regev had a soft landing. The “farm forum,” with which Regev had a close connection at the time (that is the period that has long since been erased from her memory, just like being a spokesperson for the disengagement), took her in. As a person on loan from the army in a new position in the bureau of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, she was appointed the coordinator of public relations for the Home Front prior to the second Gulf War. Later she returned to the Defense Ministry as the chief censor.</p> \n<p>Two years later, when Dan Halutz, who had great political aspirations, was appointed chief of staff, she proudly returned with him to the General Staff as the IDF spokesperson. Halutz also lived to regret it.

        "text":["<p>When Elizabeth Rynecki was 16, her grandfather George tried to share some notes he had jotted down about his Holocaust experiences. But, at the time, she showed very little interest.</p> \n<p>“I guess you could say I was not a very wise teenager and I just didn’t get it,” she says in hindsight. “My understanding of World War II history at that age was pretty minimal.”</p> \n<p>The one thing she did know – and, indeed, could not avoid knowing – was that George’s father Moshe Rynecki had been an artist before the war, and a very prolific one at that. After all, his paintings of Jewish life in pre-war Poland adorned the walls of her childhood home in northern California.</p> \n<p>“Chasing Portraits,” a documentary film that will have its Israeli premiere next week at the annual&nbsp;Jerusalem&nbsp;Jewish Film Festival, chronicles Elizabeth’s crusade to track down her great-grandfather’s lost paintings. She calls it a “companion piece” to the book by the same name, which she authored and had published two years ago.</p> \n<p>Not long after George passed away, Elizabeth and her father were cleaning out his home when they discovered the completed version of his Holocaust memoir. By then, she had developed a keen interest in her family history and was ready to dive in.</p> \n<p>There was one segment among its many pages that jumped out at her, she recalls. It explained why her grandfather had decided to commit his Holocaust memories to writing. “There are hundreds of books on the subject,” he wrote. “Nevertheless, I’m a Jew and I write, and I’ll do it until the end of my days, if only for my granddaughter Elizabeth to know the truth and not be afraid of it.”</p> \n<p>What exactly he meant by that, Elizabeth couldn’t really be sure. It seemed that her grandfather wanted her to carry on where he had left off in keeping the family story alive. But how could she bear witness, she recalls asking herself, if she had never personally experienced the atrocities of the Holocaust?</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>But then, an idea took root. “I started to realize,” she says,” that my great-grandfather’s paintings were survivors too, survivors with no voice, and that they are a powerful reflection of life in Poland before the war that not many people are aware of. I felt that I could rescue that legacy and share it with the world.”</p> \n<p>Born in 1881 in a small town outside Warsaw, Moshe Rynecki began drawing at a very young age and eventually attended the Warsaw Academy of Arts. His very distinctive work captures Jewish life in pre-war Poland in all its diversity – from men and women engaged in work and recreation to scenes of religious observance and celebration. It includes numerous portraits as well, among them quite a few self-portraits. Although some of his paintings were exhibited in galleries, Moshe never managed to sell any of them while he was alive. For their livelihood, he and his wife Perla ran a store that sold writing and painting supplies.</p> \n<p>When World War II broke out, Moshe began searching for a safe haven for his collection of roughly 800 works. Eventually, he divided them up into bundles and hid them with people he knew in various locations around the city. A letter explaining where they could be found was left with his wife and son.</p> \n<p>After the Jews of Warsaw were forced to move into a ghetto, Elizabeth’s grandparents and father, along with Moshe’s wife, found refuge outside its walls, hiding among non-Jews. Moshe, however, said he wanted to “stay with his people,” according to his son’s memoir, and insisted on remaining in the ghetto.</p> \n<p>He did not survive. Like many Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto, he is believed to have been transported to the death camp of Majdanek sometime in 1943, where he died in the gas chambers. After the war, his wife was able to retrieve only one bundle of 120 paintings that he had hidden. She found them in the cellar of a home in the Praga district of Warsaw.</p> \n<p>One of those paintings was later donated to Yad Vashem, and another to a museum in California. Two others were apparently gifted by Moshe’s son to friends of the family, and the rest remained with the Rynecki family.</p> \n<p>Elizabeth began her quest to share her great-grandfather’s legacy by creating a website in his honor, to which she uploaded photos of all the paintings that had been salvaged, with brief descriptions of each. Her family had always assumed that the rest of the collection had been lost or destroyed during the war. But once the gallery went online, she suddenly started hearing from collectors and curators around the globe who were familiar with the work of Moshe Rynecki. To her great delight, she learned from them that there were many other paintings that had survived the war.</p> \n<p>To date, Elizabeth has discovered another 80 paintings of her great-grandfather’s, which had been hitherto unknown. More than 50 of them were found lying in the archives of two museums in Poland: the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw and The National Museum in Warsaw. She was contacted by a Jewish collector in Canada, whose family had purchased a large number of Moshe Rynecki pieces immediately after the war under somewhat mysterious circumstances, who invited her to see and photograph them. A non-Jewish collector in Poland, who had another piece in his possession, gifted it to her. Thus far, it is the only piece to be returned to the family.</p> \n<p>Repossessing the paintings, Elizabeth says, has never been her goal. After all, she is cognizant of the fact – or at least wants very much to believe – that in most cases, her great-grandfather’s paintings were purchased or acquired in good faith. Her only wish, she says, is to be given the opportunity to see them with her own eyes and to photograph high quality images of them so that they can be added to her online gallery.</p> \n<p>Elizabeth knows of a woman in Israel, a cousin of the Canadian collector, who owns several of her great-grandfather’s works. That woman, however, has thus far rebuffed her ongoing pleas to pay a visit and see them up close.&nbsp; That is one of the reasons, she says, that she is flying to Israel this week to attend the screenings of her film.</p> \n<p>“I’ve asked this woman’s cousins to convey to her I’m hoping that she comes to see my film because I believe that if she does,” she says, she will better understand the story and grant me the right to see those paintings.”</p> \n<p>“Chasing Portraits,” which will screen in Jerusalem on December 5 and December 6, is one of several films in this year’s festival lineup devoted to the fate of Jewish art during the Holocaust.&nbsp; “Also Life is an Art – The Case of Max Emden” tells the story of a prominent Jewish-German collector whose paintings were looted by the Nazis and who died a pauper.&nbsp; “Hitler Versus Picasso and the Others” explores the Nazi obsession with art.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It hasn't taken Austria's government long to show its anti-Muslim colors.</p> \n<p>This spring, a few months after the Christian-democratic conservative Austrian People's Party formed a coalition government with the populist far right Freedom Party , one of the first bills targeting Muslims was announced – a proposal banning Muslim elementary schoolers from wearing the hijab.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The proposal is cloaked in indirect language that bans religious &quot;full head coverings&quot; while permitting &quot;partial head coverings&quot; - a means of exempting the Jewish kippa from the constraints of the bill and has meanwhile been pushed through.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;When the Fear of Muslims Leads Jews to Whitewash the Far Right&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Does Europe's Far Right Hate Muslims the Same Way They Hate Jews?</p> \n<p>The coalition’s efforts to target Muslims while exempting Jews reflects both far-right Austria’s hierarchy of otherized minority groups, and a clear attempt to divide minority groups from creating a unified bloc in solidarity against discriminatory legislation, and an appeal to the Jewish community to join a &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; front against the Muslim &quot;other&quot;, playing on fears about Muslim anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>It should also serve as a warning to Jews that, bearing in mind anti-Semitism on the right in Austria is hardly extinct, that getting an exemption to this law is no protection for the future – in fact, it may well set a precedent.</p> \n<p>It should be noted that Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is explicitly wooing Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - inviting him to a conference on anti-Semitism in Vienna and funding a Holocaust memorial – motivated at least in part by its desire to persuade Israel to drop its boycott of the Freedom Party, that is strongly endorsed by Austria's Jewish community itself.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The anti-hijab policy proposal reflects the politics of both the People’s Party and the Freedom Party. The Freedom Party is infamous for its ties to ex-Nazis and to racist strategies. The People’s Party, meanwhile, has started co-opting the Freedom Party’s Islamophobic agenda - in a subtler form with a liberal facade, but nevertheless with &nbsp;fierce dedication.</p> \n<p>The anti-Muslim sentiment is clearly voiced by Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz of the People’s Party, who called for the hijab ban. Kurz has also said Austria does not need Muslim pre-schools and called to close them, even while kindergartens of other religious groups are co-financed by the state.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The hijab ban fits the ruling coalition’s pattern of using symbolic identity politics and scapegoating Muslims as the cause of social ills in order to distract the electorate from socially and economic unjust measures.</p> \n<p>While the original proposal was to ban religious garments for kindergarteners, the government realized this would be a difficult move, especially in the face of criticism by the Jewish Community. Soon, the Austrian government backtracked: A government with a right-wing party could not commit a strategic blunder and harm A community whose members were murdered in their millions on the same soil 80 years ago. While the original plan had been to implement a law by July 2018, the government realized things would be more complicated.</p> \n<p>Instead, the government chose a different way to implement the proposal. Rather than passing a law, the government chose to draft a contract between the federal government and the nine states, calling for a ban on full hair coverings, while allowing partial hair covering.</p> \n<p>This formulation ensured that Jewish skullcaps were permitted, while filling the proposal’s actual purpose of targeting the Muslim hijab. The proposal explicitly states that &quot;wearing of the hijab by kids in elementary educational institutions can lead to an early sexual segregation, which is not compatible with basic Austrian values and social norms. Orienting oneself according to religious values shall not to be in contradiction with civic education, which has to secure the equality of men and women.&quot;</p> \n<p>This statement by Austria's lawmakers reveals not only typical stereotypes towards Islam and its social practice. It also breaks with the secular nature of Austrian politics.</p> \n<p>According to the Austrian constitution, neither the state nor a legally recognized church or religious community may interfere with one another. This also means that the state cannot define religion or acceptable religious practice. In 1992, an official education ministry document explicitly states that wearing the hijab was a religious duty for Muslim women and is protected by the Austrian constitution, which secures freedom of religion.</p> \n<p>The lawmakers’ explanation also reflects a strategy of victim-reversal. While reports show Muslim children are the group most affected by racism in Austria’s educational institutions, the explanation blames the hijab as a marker for sexual segregation, portraying the marginalized Muslim pupil as the perpetrator of segregation. The government, rather than empowering marginalized young Muslim pupils who are confronted with racism, portrays them as the powerful actors, who define the rules in the school yard.</p> \n<p>During the negotiations over the proposal, the federal government declared that Austria’s nine states would receive federal education funds only if they agree to implement the ban. Since this regulation needs to pass a vote in national parliament as well as the nine regional parliaments, it may be that one of the three states where the opposition Social Democrats hold power will vote against this contract.</p> \n<p>But even in this scenario, the anti-Muslim camp will chalk up a victory.</p> \n<p>If the opposition votes the proposal down, the right-wing government could position itself as the champion of the struggle against political Islam and paint itself as the victim,&nbsp; while blaming the agents of multiculturalism and anti-discrimination, namely Austria’s left-leaning political parties. Thus the governing right-wing parties could rally further public support for equating social democratic multiculturalism with alleged Islamization.</p> \n<p>The federal government has made its goal very clear: The conservative education minister stated that &quot;every single hijab is one hijab too many.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the end, all nine states, even the social democratic ones, may pass the bill, partly because they feel they burnt their fingers at the polls by opposing past anti-Muslim measures.</p> \n<p>Those campaigns by the Freedom Party allowed the far right to frame themselves as the liberators of women, and the Social Democrats as the party who wanted to make the hijab mandatory. The PR strategists for the Social Democrats fear losing parts of their electorate amid similar government strategies, even if the ban is just the first legal step to a further extension of prohibitions in other fields - which is the explicit aim of the Freedom Party's leader.</p> \n<p>What about Austria's Muslim community itself?</p> \n<p>Legally recognized religious communities and churches will play a major role in this battle. Since it is an explicit attack on the freedom of religion, the Islamic Religious Community, an official representative body, has a say and also voted against this law, since it is one of 16 legally recognized churches and religious communities.</p> \n<p>But voting against the bill would be an important measure for other religious communities and churches too, especially those representing minorities such as the Jewish community. While the Catholic Church did issue a relatively critical response, other minority religions have been largely quiet. But there are many reasons for them to break that silence.</p> \n<p>The first is solidarity. The second is fear that they could be targeted next. If the state can interfere so drastically in the affairs of a religious community, this precedent will not be easily reversed. This should particularly concern Jews given that anti-Semitism is everything but gone in Austria, especially within the current government, no matter what their public statements might suggest.</p> \n<p>Farid Hafez is a Senior Research Scholar at Georgetown University's&nbsp;Bridge Initiative&nbsp;and Senior Scholar at Salzburg University in the Department of Political Science and Sociology.

        "text":["<p>One day a month ago, at 5 A.M., Adeeb Joudeh realized that his world had collapsed. Joudeh, 55, is a well-respected figure in Jerusalem’s Old City. The Joudehs are one of the oldest Palestinian families in Jerusalem, one of the two Muslim families that hold the keys to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The keys and custodianship have been passed down from father to son – Muslims – for centuries.</p> \n<p>His role as keeper of the keys brings Joudeh to the church’s doors every morning. On that bitter morning he received a call from his neighbors in the Muslim Quarter. They told him to show up quickly because Jews had moved into the house he had sold.</p> \n<p>“I realized right away what had happened,” Joudeh says, even though he had “sold the house openly, to a person recommended by everybody” – a Palestinian.</p> \n<p>Since that morning, Joudeh has been defending his reputation in the city’s Palestinian community, where there's no greater crime than such a sale.</p> \n<p>Since settlers moved in to the Joudeh family home, other deals have come to light in which houses were sold to Jews, with the accompanying dramas. This week, for example, every cemetery in East Jerusalem refused to bury Alla Kiresh, a victim of a car accident in the Jordan Valley, because his name was associated with the sale of a house to Jews. A fatwa to that effect was issued by a preacher at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p> \n<p>In the end, Kiresh was buried without a ceremony outside Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority is holding Issam Akel on similar suspicions, with the Israel Police and Shin Bet Security Service trying to get him released.</p> \n<p>The sale of Joudeh’s house is roiling Palestinians throughout East Jerusalem, as well as on the social networks and in the wider media, for two reasons: the prominence of his family and the involvement of senior PA figures.</p> \n<p>Joudeh says he’s not afraid but admits he doesn’t roam the Old City’s streets like he used to. “There’s a lot of incitement against me and there are many fools around here. I’ve been condemned to death,” he says, adding that he doesn’t go back to his old house. “It hurts me to go there, I’ll have a heart attack.”</p> \n<p>Tax haven</p> \n<p>“I started coming to the church with my father when I was 8,” Joudeh says. “Now I’m 55, the keeper of the keys. In the future, one of my sons will assume this role.” Being a Muslim, Joudeh doesn’t pray there.</p> \n<p>Joudeh has also served as a police investigator, one of a handful of policemen from East Jerusalem. When the current affair blew up, this fact was proof to his rivals that he was disloyal to the Palestinian cause.</p> \n<p>“I put the house up for sale in 2012,” he says. “First I turned to the Waqf religious trust and other Palestinian companies, but they weren’t interested. We wanted the building to remain in good hands, with Palestinians looking after it, but nobody wanted it.”</p> \n<p>Two years ago, Joudeh was approached by Fadi Elsalameen, a Palestinian businessman and activist who lives in the United States. He offered to buy the house.</p> \n<p>Elsalameen is known as someone close to Mohammed Dahlan, the bitterest rival of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Elalameen constantly accuses the PA of corruption. Two years ago, he visited East Jerusalem surrounded by bodyguards, saying he feared abduction by the PA.</p> \n<p>Elsalameen says the PA did everything it could to cancel the deal. His accounts in West Bank banks were frozen and he couldn’t transfer the money to Joudeh. The deal was ultimately canceled.</p> \n<p>The next person to approach Joudeh was Khaled Atari, a Palestinian businessman with a bank in Ramallah, someone considered close to the PA, particularly to its intelligence chief, Majed Faraj, a candidate to take over from Abbas one day.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know Atari but I looked into it – I went to Adnan Husseini, the PA’s minister for Jerusalem affairs, and to other officials,” Joudeh says.</p> \n<p>“They all said they knew him personally and that he’s clean. No one had anything bad to say about him. I met him at the best restaurants in Ramallah and I saw how people treated him. You felt you were sitting with someone with status.”</p> \n<p>Atari was not immediately available for comment.</p> \n<p>The deal was signed in 2016 and the house was sold to Atari for $2.5 million. Atari transferred the title from his name to a company called Daho Holdings, registered on a Caribbean island, a tax haven. Settler activists are known for using such havens to conceal the identity of the buyer and seller.</p> \n<p>Joudeh didn’t find anything suspicious. The buyer told him he wanted to save on taxes. He says that until he got the call from his neighbors he didn’t imagine that Atari was connected to settlers. His next call was to Atari.</p> \n<p>“I told him that there were settlers in the house,” Joudeh says. “He wasn’t fazed; he said it was early and he’d call the next day. He hasn’t called since.”</p> \n<p>Public procedure</p> \n<p>The two met during a mediation procedure conducted by family chiefs in East Jerusalem, led by Sheikh Abdullah Alqam of the Shoafat refugee camp. The procedure was public and conducted on Facebook. Atari tried to defend himself, claiming he bought the house under Elsalameen’s instructions. Elsalameen vehemently denies this.</p> \n<p>The mediator, Alqam, is inclined to believe Joudeh. “I think Joudeh is clean and Atari was the one who sold,” Alqam says. “I have a document at home showing that Atari paid property tax and the water and electricity bills, all in his name. He said he wanted the house for his daughter and then we saw settlers moving in.”</p> \n<p>Joudeh adds: “If Elsalameen wanted to buy the house, what did he need Atari for? He just needed to transfer the money to me; we already had an agreement.”</p> \n<p>But the mediation was halted after Atari complained that he was being threatened. The police arrested Alqam and he was forbidden to continue handling the issue. “Someone high up is protecting him,” Joudeh says, referring to a temporal, not a religious, power. “Behind him is a big secret that only he knows about.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the storm around Joudeh continues. Last week his extended family announced that the keys would be taken from him and given to another family member until the issue was cleared up. Joudeh says this is a family branch in Jordan that has no say in the matter, so he still goes to the church every day.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t run away and I’m not hiding. I sold the house openly, to a person recommended by everybody. I constantly think of ways of getting out of this mess,” Joudeh says.</p> \n<p>“Journalists and people on the street have condemned me to death without asking me about it. No one has approached me to find out the truth,” he adds.</p> \n<p>“I have an honored position and I’ve always fought to retain our family’s reputation. We’re the oldest family in the city – would I sully our name so easily? I repeat, I’m innocent. God knows I’m innocent.”</p>",

The party referred to “entire teams of criminals who are defacing Hitorerut signs, who are damaging the democratic process and inciting in every direction against Ofer Berkovitch and the Hitorerut movement.</p> \n<p>“It is inconceivable that a cabinet member in the State of Israel would express himself in such a manner,” Hitorerut said, maintaining that a red line had been crossed following other acts of incitement against the party.</p> \n<p>Early Friday thousands of notices were posted around Jerusalem directed at the city’s ultra-Orthodox population and making a variety of promises. They were perceived as being in support of Leon, but Leon’s campaign headquarters denied it, saying they were designed to harm his reputation among non-ultra-Orthodox residents of the city.</p> \n<p>One of the versions of the posters promised the ultra-Orthodox “full control” of the local religious council and of the Chief Rabbinate. Another said Leon would give the ultra-Orthodox control of the neighborhood administration in Ramot, a Jerusalem neighborhood where a large number of secular residents live.</p> \n<p>In denying that he was behind the posters, Leon tweeted: “Berkovitch is losing his senses as well as the last drops of integrity that he has and is opting for ugly incitement.”</p> \n<p>Leon accused Berkovitch’s headquarters of fabricating the posters in the hope they would undermine support for Leon. Hitorerut denied this and said if Leon had such suspicions, he should file a complaint with the police.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It was very important to Diaspora Affairs and Education Minister Naftali Bennett to question the credibility of Anti-Defamation League figures indicating a dramatic rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States in 2017, the greatest single-year increase since the organization began tracking such data, in 1979. Speaking at a public discussion in New York held in the wake of the October 27 massacre in Pittsburgh, Bennett said he was “not sure there’s a surge in anti-Semitism in the United States.”</p> \n<p>The reason for Bennett’s denial of the rise in right-wing anti-Semitism in the United States is simple: Bennett is first a rightist and only after that a Jew.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Israelis’ post-Pittsburgh defense of Trump isn’t just realpolitik: They just don’t get it&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;Trump, the Jews and anti-Semitism: A dangerous double game&nbsp;| Explained&nbsp;■&nbsp;American Jews may never forgive Israel for its reaction to the Pittsburgh massacre&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There is no reason to think anyone in the Israeli might rejoiced over the terror attack or the tragic deaths of 11 innocent Jews. But it appears that underneath the expressions of shock and condemnation, an understanding is emerging of the complexity behind the hatred of Jews at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh, irrespective of their affiliation with Conservative Judaism. It seems that he right recognized that it was not only an anti-Semitic hate crime, or a spontaneous pogrom, but also an act of terrorism directed at Jews as leftist, globalist, human rights activists who love Syrian refugees.</p> \n<p>As the social-media posts of the murderer, Robert Bowers, make clear, he associates Jews with the global Jewish refugee aid organization HIAS. One can only imagine the online comments from Israeli right-wingers if, heaven forbid, a bomb were to explode in the offices of the Israeli anti-occupation organization B’Tselem.</p> \n<p>That could also be why this time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet colleagues did not issue their Pavlovian call for Jews to immigrate to Israel, as they did with French Jews after the terror attacks in Paris. After all, why would Israel’s right-wing government want those leftists from the United States in Israel?</p> \n<p>On the surface, one might suspect that this is a case of political maturation. Finally, Netanyahu and his cabinet colleagues realized that such calls only play into the hands of anti-Semites who seek to cleanse their country of Jews. Finally, they understood completely that such calls could serve to reanimate the old anti-Semitic charge of dual loyalty, thereby further endangering Diaspora Jews.</p> \n<p>But it’s hard to believe that’s the reason. Netanyahu’s government is cozying up to illiberal regimes and flirting with the far right, which is on the rise throughout the world. Under Netanyahu, Israel is strengthening its ties with the Visegrad Group — the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Netanyahu cooperated with his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki, issuing a controversial joint statement validating the Polish Holocaust narrative, which differs with that of many historians, including experts at Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and memorial.</p> \n<p>But the rise of the far right in Europe and the United States (and now in Latin America as well) does not, to put it mildly, benefit the Jews in these countries. In creating warmer relations with right-wing regimes, Israel gives them a seal of approval, reinforces this global trend and participates in it. As a result, Israel is putting the lives of Diaspora Jews in jeopardy.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu took Israel on a dangerous ride. He is betting on the strong side of the world, in the belief that the growing global ultranationalism he is encouraging won’t backfire on the Jews, in the Diaspora or in their homeland. Whether it pays off or not, Israel’s mere willingness to join this coalition of ultranationalist, populist regimes — only because the coalition’s declared target isn’t the Jews this time — retroactively justifies this kind of determination by states and people throughout history.</p> \n<p>It’s not only in Pittsburgh that the Jews have been identified as the enemies of nationalism. Anti-Semitic hatred has always been complex. The right wing in Israel is starting down the path that many anti-Semites have tread before it. It will be very interesting to see what it ultimately discovers.</p>",

        "text":["<p>With his swept-back hair and blue eyes, Austria’s young Chancellor Sebastian Kurz was featured on the cover of Newsweek last week, with the magazine calling him a rising star in the firmament of global politics.</p> \n<p>The extensive profile described the conservative leader as an ambitious activist who has garnered impressive support within his country, mainly among young people.</p> \n<p>However, a stain hovers over this optimistic portrayal, in the form of his rhetorical flirtation with his country’s dark past and his tight alliance with the extreme right-wing Freedom Party and the Israeli-Jewish boycott of its cabinet members. The continuing boycott has become a persistent blemish on the shining image of the rising star, and it appears that he’s determined to remove it.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;The Freedom Party's neo-Nazis can't camouflage their hatred of Jews with visits to Israel&nbsp;■&nbsp;The heartbreaking suicide note Jews left their loves ones after Kristallnacht</p> \n<p>Over the last two weeks, in the shadow of events commemorating the eightieth anniversary of Kristallnacht, the Chancellor made some gestures to the Jewish community.</p> \n<p>The first is the hosting in 10 days of a large international conference in Vienna, called “Europe beyond anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism – securing Jewish life in Europe.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;Don't fixate on the Freedom Party. The real anti-Semitic threat is from Muslims</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to attend. If he does so, this will be the first visit by an Israeli prime minister since 1997 when Netanyahu also visited the country. Before that, only Golda Meir and Presidents Moshe Katzav and Shimon Peres had gone to Austria on official visits.</p> \n<p>A few days before that, the chancellor announced that his government would finance the erection of a monument commemorating 66,000 Austrian Jews who perished in the Holocaust. Kurz approved the granting of citizenship to descendants of these victims.</p> \n<p>Making an exception, Austria will allow children and grandchildren of Holocaust victims to hold dual citizenship. In an interview he gave to the Jewish Chronicle, Kurz said that Austria wanted to give them a chance to become citizens if they wished to do so, but in the same interview he again defended his decision to form an alliance with the Freedom Party.</p> \n<p>Last month President Reuven Rivlin was the focus of Austrian pressure to obtain Israel’s stamp of kashrut, while the Freedom Party was conducting a stormy campaign to force Jews to obtain permits in order to buy kosher meat. On his way back from a state visit to Denmark, the president stopped in Austria and met his counterpart President Alexander Van der Bellen at the airport.</p> \n<p>An official statement they later released said that they had talked about the strong relations between the two countries and that Rivlin had noted his appreciation for the warm relations between Van der Bellen and the local Jewish community. It was reported that the Austrian president said at their meeting that Austria bears joint responsibility for the terrible crimes which led to the flight of Austria’s Jews.</p> \n<p>However, there was another part of their conversation which has not yet been reported. Haaretz has learned that Rivlin was surprised when Van der Bellen wondered whether Israel would reconsider its boycott of the Freedom Party’s cabinet members. Rivlin was not expecting such a direct appeal, which showed that the Austrians were well acquainted with diverse political positions in Israel, having designated Rivlin as a major opposition figure.</p> \n<p>In response, Rivlin told his counterpart at length why he objects to normalization of relations with those ministers, given the party’s anti-Semitic roots and the current accusations by Jewish leaders in Austria that the party is stoking anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>Sources at the president’s bureau confirmed that the topic was one of several that had been raised by the Austrian president, and that in response Rivlin had repeated his consistent stance, clarifying that he was not taking a position on the political considerations that guide any government in forming a coalition.</p> \n<p>“The president clarified the difficulties inherent in Israel’s ties with representatives of parties that hold neo-Fascist ideas, while recalling that anti-Semitism did not begin with the Nazis.” He added that one cannot support Israel while holding anti-Semitic positions, said these sources. Thus, despite efforts to persuade him, Rivlin still objects strenuously to lifting the boycott. Austrians will not be absolved by him. On the other hand, Rivlin is not in charge of Israel’s foreign policy, and winds blowing from the person who is, Benjamin Netanyahu, are less resolute.</p> \n<p>A history of boycotts</p> \n<p>The history of the Freedom Party (FPO) is intertwined with Austria’s complex attitude, which persists to this day, to its role in World War II. While Germany, due to international circumstances, accepted its past, Austria did not touch the wounds associated with the dark past of its leaders during the Nazi period until the late 1980s. As in Poland, the perception remains that Austria, other than being Hitler’s birthplace, was a victim of his rule. In the absence of a deep-reaching acceptance of responsibility, Austria became fertile ground for neo-Nazi activity after the war.</p> \n<p>The Freedom Party, Kurz’s coalition partner, was founded by Nazi activists after the war. Since then it has been the extreme right-wing marker of Austria’s political system, with countless anti-Semitic incidents and cases of Holocaust denial attributed to it. Some party supporters greet their leader with a Nazi salute, with party rallies featuring Nazi concepts and symbols.</p> \n<p>Israel’s ties with Austria were complicated from the start, with the Herut Party (precursor of Likud) newspaper calling in 1949 to avoid recognizing Austria. There were some bumpy milestones in this relationship during the tenures of chancellors Bruno Kreisky, Kurt Waldheim and Jorg Haider. Thus, in the 1970s, Golda Meir tried to no avail to reach an understanding with Kreisky, who was a bitter critic of Zionism. Attempts at dialogue were replaced by boycotts and a lowering of the level of diplomatic relations in the 1980s, when it was revealed that Kurt Waldheim had served in the Wehrmacht.</p> \n<p>In February 2000 there was a significant blow-up when the conservative Austrian People’s Party under Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel joined the Freedom Party, headed by Haider. This was the first time that the party became a legitimate coalition partner. Israel withdrew its ambassador and demoted its level of relations, suspending all ties with the Austrian government. Austria kept its ambassador to Israel in place. Israel’s boycott was only lifted three and a half years later, when Haider left the party.</p> \n<p>The party gained strength again in 2008, this time under Haider’s replacement Heinz-Christian Strache. In 2010, the Austrian Jewish community was furious when Deputy Minister Ayoub Kara met Strache in Vienna, heaping praises on him. The community’s leader wrote a sharp letter to Netanyahu, describing the event as a stab in the back of Austrian Jews. Strache tried to improve his image by forging ties with Israel’s right wing.</p> \n<p>Among other things, he expressed support for expanding settlements and for transferring Austria’s embassy to Jerusalem. He met Likud members and visited Yad Vashem. But incidents with an anti-Semitic flavor continued. For example, in 2012 Strache held a ball for party members suspected of neo-Nazi activity. Thousands of Jews protested outside the building and Strache declared that attempts to disrupt the ball were similar to Kristallnacht. In the same year, Strache posted a cartoon reminiscent of Nazi depictions of Jews, on his Facebook page.</p> \n<p>Israel’s attitude towards Strache became critical during the 2017 election campaign in Austria. The young and promising foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, planned to join Strache in forming a conservative right-wing government. Kurz was considered a friend of the Jewish community and an ardent supporter of Israel. However, his story is also not free of blemishes. Thus, in a campaign speech he used an anti-Semitic sounding allusion to “the Silbersteins,” referring to a campaign against him led by Israeli political consultant Tal Silberstein.</p> \n<p>When Kurz won in December 2017 and added Strache to his cabinet as vice-chancellor, Israel took its time in responding. In the end, despite pressure by right-wing members such as Likud MK Yehuda Glick, who had developed tight links with Strache, Netanyahu announced that Israel would boycott extreme right-wing ministers in Austria, and would limit its ties to purely professional matters with their offices.</p> \n<p>The status of the embassy remained as it was, and Netanyahu stressed that he would maintain direct links with the elected chancellor. Strache expressed optimism, stating that the situation was different than the steps taken by Israel in 2000. Kurz said he respected Israel’s decision and that he was optimistic with regard to the future. “Our task will be to do good work at home and persuade abroad. We’ll dispel all concerns” he said.</p> \n<p>Since then Kurz is indeed trying to dispel concerns. He’s met Netanyahu three times since his election. The first time was last February at a conference on international security in Munich. Netanyahu said at the time that Kurz had updated him with regard to steps Austria was taking against anti-Semitism and in support of Israel. He promised to change the way Austria votes at the United Nations. In March, Netanyahu praised Kurz’s speech against anti-Semitism. However, that same month Austria had to return home an employee at its embassy in Israel who was photographed wearing a shirt with Nazi emblems.</p> \n<p>Last June Kurz visited Israel. He went to the Western Wall on a private visit and met Netanyahu again, promising that his country would resolutely combat any form of anti-Semitism in Europe. He added that Austria wants to support Israel and its security needs.</p> \n<p>However, the Jewish community in Austria was roiled again when the FPO promoted a law that would limit kosher slaughter. The plan, which was foiled, called for registering Jews wanting to buy kosher meat in a special database. The third meeting of the two leaders was last September after the UN General Assembly meeting in New York.</p> \n<p>The Jewish community in Austria, which consists of diverse streams, is closely monitoring anti-Semitic incidents. Since the rise of the current government it has documented 40 incidents associated with the Freedom Party. They include patently anti-Semitic incidents which were not followed by any action on the part of the party.</p> \n<p>This week, in the shadow of the 80th Kristallnacht anniversary, extreme right-wing groups which identify with the party desecrated Holocaust monuments by placing garbage bins at these sites. The community expects Israel to back them in their struggle. Many Jews support Kurz himself, but insist that the FPO must undergo full repentance in order to obtain legitimacy from Israel and the Jewish community.</p> \n<p>The Austrian government’s spokesman, Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal, told Haaretz this week that relations between Kurz and Netanyahu are “personally and professionally close,” and that the rebuilding of ties between the countries is an important part of the government’s plan, which is based on a commitment to the existence and security of Israel as a Jewish state. He emphasized that this decision includes the FPO. He said that the chancellor and his deputy have a great understanding of Israel’s concerns in these matters, and are intent on rebuilding relations based on trust.</p> \n<p>Jerusalem in exchange for Kneissl</p> \n<p>One of these confidence-building steps could be, according to diplomatic sources, a declaration on the status of Jerusalem. Strache has expressed support for moving the embassy but Kurz has clarified that Austria would not be the first European Union member to do so. He said that Austria abides by the EU position by which the future of Jerusalem would be determined in direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. The same sources noted that when Austria ceases to be president of the EU at the end of this year, the situation could change and enable some measures, such as moving tourist, culture and commercial affairs of the Austrian embassy to Jerusalem, as was done by the Czech Republic.</p> \n<p>Israel in turn would normalize its relations with Austria’s foreign minister, who represents the party but who is not herself a party member. Karin Kneissl, an expert on the Middle East who studied for a while at the Hebrew University, is also boycotted by Israel, not only because she represents the FPO but because she compared Zionism and Nazism in a book she wrote. She also criticized the Israel Defense Forces and Netanyahu. Since she is not a party member and plays a key role in the two countries’ relations, her background may serve in forging a compromise. Diplomatic sources confirmed this to Haaretz.</p> \n<p>The Jewish community is split with regard to such a scenario, with reservations about distinguishing her from the party, since she has never condemned any of the incidents associated with the party during the time she has served in its name. In the meantime Kneissl is testing the water. She’s been trying to “snatch” random hallway meetings with senior Israeli officials and depict these as a lifting of the boycott.</p> \n<p>During a European conference she met Construction and Housing Minister Yoav Galant and was photographed talking to him. Galant was surprised by all the questions he received later since he hadn’t recognized her. He said she’d presented herself as a former student at the Hebrew University and shook his hand. They didn’t exchange any further words, he said. Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel also bumped into her and off the cuff invited her to Israel. The foreign ministry had to do some fancy footwork to cancel that invitation.</p> \n<p>Sources in Israel say that one consideration of this issue is the attitude of the rest of the world to the Kurz government. The world was united against the Haider government, with 14 EU countries demoting the level of their diplomatic relations. The return of the Israeli ambassador was part of an international campaign.</p> \n<p>Europe has now changed. No steps have been taken against Strache. Israel’s role as the torchbearer in this matter has become more complicated. Some question whether leaving relations with the FPO to marginal right-wing groups in Israel might hurt the chances of normalization leading to moderation. They wonder whether talking isn’t preferable to boycotting.</p> \n<p>In any case, Netanyahu’s upcoming visit will not include meetings with FPO ministers or with Kneissl. But his associates do not deny the possibility that the boycott may be lifted soon. If Kneissl comes on an official visit, the dilemma will again land on Rivlin’s doorstep, since he will have to host her.</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON - As the first midterm results came in on Tuesday night, many leading political pundits in the United States described the outcome as a “mixed bag”: Some good results for the Democratic Party, but not the “blue wave” they had hoped for.</p> \n<p>James Carville, a leading Democratic political strategist, said on MSNBC during the early part of Election Night coverage: “This is not going to be the wave election that people like me would have hoped for.”</p> \n<p>Ever since, though, as more and more votes have been counted and more tight races are being decided, the political narrative has shifted. In the last five days, there has not been a single day without good news for the Democrats. Their majority in the House of Representatives has grown from a very thin one to a more comfortable one, and their position in the Senate has also improved.</p> \n<p>Dave Wasserman, House editor of the Cook Political Report, summed up the latest developments by tweeting Saturday that as Tuesday’s results come into focus, “The story developing is significantly more favorable to Dems than the narrative that emerged on Election Night.”</p> \n<p>Matthew Dowd, a political analyst for ABC News who worked on George W. Bush’s election campaigns, noted that Democrats are likely to end up picking more House seats than they did in the 2006 midterms, “when the incumbent president had a much worse economy. That seems like a bit of a wave election to me.”</p> \n<p>In the House of Representatives, the first results seemed to indicate that the Democrats would have a very thin majority – one that would allow President Donald Trump to try to create splits among the party’s own legislators. The official result on Wednesday morning, when many close races still hadn’t been decided and when millions of votes in Western states still hadn’t been counted, was that the Democrats had picked up “only” 28 seats in the House. That was less than their 31-seat gain in 2006, the last “blue wave” election.</p> \n<p>Yet in recent days close races all across the country – from New Jersey to New Mexico – have been called in favor of the Democrats. In addition, as votes are being counted in California, the Democrats appear to be on track to win in a number of Republican-held seats in Orange County, which has traditionally been a GOP stronghold.</p> \n<p>Analysts now believe that after all the votes across the country are counted, Democrats will pick up close to 40 seats in the House – a significantly better result than they achieved in 2006. In fact, such a result would represent the best midterms for the Democrats since the 1974 election that followed the Watergate scandal and President Richard Nixon’s resignation, when they won 49 seats.</p> \n<p>One of the late-breaking victories for the Democrats came in Georgia: The southern state’s 6th Congressional District was once the home of Newt Gingrich, former Republican Speaker of the House and one of the most polarizing figures in American politics in recent decades. Last year, the district held a special election that drew national attention and ended in a comfortable victory for Republican nominee Karen Handel.</p> \n<p>From January, though, the district will be represented by a Democrat for the first time in decades. Lucy McBath, a gun-control activist who lost her own son to gun violence, narrowly defeated Handel on Tuesday, thus “flipping” a seat the Democrats failed to win just last year.</p> \n<p>One race that is yet to be decided, but is leaning toward another Democratic “flip,” is the race for Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. This is a district where most voters favored Trump in the 2016 presidential election, by a margin of 10 percentage points. Yet as of Sunday morning, it seems the district’s incumbent Republican congressman, Bruce Poliquin, will narrowly lose to his Democratic challenger Jared Golden, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> \n<p>This is one of the few districts that uses the “ranked-choice voting” system, in which the electorate choose the candidate they prefer, and then choose a “second” option in case no candidate wins at least 50 percent of the vote. Golden and Poliquin both received approximately 46 percent of the vote, while a number of independent candidates received a combined 8 percent of the vote. Exit polls suggest Golden will receive more “second choice” votes than Poliquin, providing Democrats with another victory in a part of the country where Trump triumphed two years ago.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Democrats have also received some encouraging news in recent days on the Senate front. While there is no doubt that the Senate will remain Republican, the number of seats each party has still makes a big difference. In 2017, when Trump tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the opposition of only three Republican senators was enough to block him. (The Democrats had 48 seats in the chamber, meaning that three Republicans joining them in any specific vote created a majority in the Democrats’ favor.)</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, as the GOP easily recaptured seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, it seemed like the Democrats could sink into a very deep hole in the Senate with 55 or even 56 Republican seats a real possibility. In such a scenario, there would be almost no hope for the Democrats to get enough Republicans to cross sides for any vote.</p> \n<p>Yet with every passing day, the situation has shifted slowly toward the Democrats. Late on Election Might, it became clear that Democrat of West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin had survived – despite his state giving Trump his largest victory in 2016. A few hours later, it was officially announced that the Democrats had “flipped” a Senate seat in Nevada, where Jacky Rosen defeated incumbent Sen. Dean Heller.</p> \n<p>Two days later, the Democrats received good news from Montana: Incumbent Sen. Jon Tester kept his seat, despite a concentrated effort by Trump to help his Republican opponent Matt Rosendale. Trump visited Montana a number of times to campaign against Tester. He was furious at the senator for blocking his nominee for leading the Department of Veterans Affairs. Yet Tester didn’t just survive – he also managed to win more than 50 percent of the vote for the first time in his statewide political career. (His previous victories were made possible with a plurality of the vote thanks to third-party candidates.)</p> \n<p>As of Sunday morning, the Democrats also look well positioned to flip another Senate seat, this time in Arizona. In the battle to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, the Democratic candidate Kyrsten Sinema has a slight lead over Republican candidate Martha McSally. There are still hundreds of thousands of votes left to count, but most of them are from urban and suburban areas that historically are more favorable to the Democrats.</p> \n<p>Nate Cohn, the leading polling analyst for the New York Times, tweeted Saturday: “Sinema now up 1.5 points. Very hard to imagine a McSally comeback at this point.”Nate Silver of the FiveThirtyEight website has also described the current state of the race as “leaning Democrat.”</p> \n<p>If Sinema indeed wins, she will become the first Democratic senator from Arizona in over two decades. She will also cut the Republican majority in the Senate to 53-47. In such a scenario, Democrats would need to convince four Republicans to join them in order to pass legislation or block nominations by Trump – not an easy feat, but one they believe could be achieved under the right circumstances.</p> \n<p>Last but not least, the Democrats are still hopeful the recount currently underway in Florida could further improve their situation. When Florida’s first results came in on Election Night, many Democrats felt like they were experiencing d&eacute;j&agrave; vu from 2016. Back then, Trump’s strength in Florida was the first portent of his shock victory.</p> \n<p>But not only did the national results turn out differently this time, so did the results in Florida itself. The margins are much closer than in 2016, leading to the recount announced Saturday. The Democrats’ chances of winning both the Senate and Governor races are still low, however.</p> \n<p>Another race in Florida heading toward a recount is the one for the state’s commissioner of agriculture, a role that oversees many of the state’s gun policies. Democrats put an emphasis on this race following the massacre at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland last February. Right now, Democratic nominee Nikki Fried has a slight lead. She has promised to shut down loopholes and strictly enforce existing gun laws in the state. If she emerges victorious from the recount, Florida Democrats will have reason to be satisfied, even if they end up losing the other two close races.</p> \n<p>All over the United States, the Democrats have also won close to 400 state legislative seats, in addition to “flipping” seven governorships and not losing a single one. Going into Election Day, there were 33 Republican and 16 Democratic governors (Alaska had an independent governor). Now, though, the balance will be 27 Republicans to 23 Democrats.</p> \n<p>Political analyst Amy Walter noted that “Election narratives get set on Election Night and are very difficult to change, even when the numbers do.” There is no doubt, though, that the picture today is much better for the Democrats than it was on Tuesday night.</p>",

        "text":["<p>LONDON – The underground artist Banksy set out this week to promote Palestine, producing a provocative poster that earned him high praise from the Palestinian tourism minister and infuriated others, sparking a social media spat with a top Israeli art collector in London who said the project was anti-Semitic.</p> \n<p>Batia Ofer, wife of London-based Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer, is known for her left-leaning views on Israeli-Palestinian issues. The Ofers also own an important postwar and contemporary art collection. However, Banksy's latest salvo was, she says, was a step too far.</p> \n<p>“We are very pro-peace. But having said that&nbsp;– I will stand up for our right to exist when people try to incite against us,” Batia Ofer told Haaretz in an email exchange.</p> \n<p>The saga began last Friday, when Banksy – who most recently shocked the art world by having one of his prints shredded just after it had been sold for $1.4 million at Sotheby’s – announced on his Instagram account that he would be displaying a replica of the West Bank separation barrier at the World Travel Market London international trade show. This is the largest trade show in the world, with some 50,000 travel agents in attendance, conducting $4.2 billion in business deals.</p> \n<p>“Opening my first ever stall at a trade fair next week. I’ve painted a replica separation barrier to promote the Walled Off Hotel.&nbsp;… We’ll be at the Palestine stand giving away free stuff,” Banksy wrote, attaching a picture of the work to be displayed: Two gray concrete slabs – mimicking the 700-kilometer (435-mile) wall that separates Israel and the West Bank – and featuring two angels representing Israel and Palestine attempting to pry the wall apart.</p> \n<p>This is not the first time Banksy has showed support for the Palestinian cause, or the first time he has helped Palestine with its tourism efforts. His nine-room Walled Off Hotel in Bethlehem, which boasts of offering “the worst view of any hotel in the world,” has attracted over 50,000 tourists since it opened last March.</p> \n<p>Palestinian Tourism Minister Rula Maayah, who has credited Banksy for driving younger people to visit the West Bank, praised the artist’s help at the trade show this week for promoting &quot;Palestine and [focusing] on the occupation, but at the same time … talking about the beauty of Palestine.”</p> \n<p>The delighted World Travel Market, meanwhile, took to social media to crow about about the artist’s attention.</p> \n<p>The Palestine stand, one of the smallest at the trade show, seemed to be the place-to-be when the event opened last Tuesday, with hundreds of travel agents and other travel professionals lining up to get a glimpse of the anonymous artist’s latest work.</p> \n<p>Ofer said she is all for tourism to the West Bank and supports some Palestinian causes&nbsp;–&nbsp;including a yearly fellowship she and her husband set up for two Palestinian students (along with two Israeli ones) to attend the Harvard Kennedy School.</p> \n<p>What bothered her, she said, was a limited edition poster by the artist, which the Palestinian team handed out at their booth. The poster, which Banksy also promoted on his Instagram account, shows children using a watchtower as a fairground ride. The slogan underneath reads: “Visit historic Palestine, the Israeli army liked it so much they never left!”</p> \n<p>“You may criticize Israel for the current situation – and I’m totally for a two-state solution and fight for justice on both sides,” said Ofer, addressing Banksy on both the artist's and her own Instagram page. “BUT insinuating we don’t have a right to exist … is disgraceful. In addition – military service in Israel is mandatory! So your poster is denouncing all Israelis! Your posters resemble Nazi propaganda in the 1930s and spread antisemitism @banksy #antisemitism&quot;</p> \n<p>Ofer attached an image making the social media rounds to her post: A version of the Banksy poster, replacing the word “Palestine” with “Israel,” and replacing Banksy’s slogan with the tagline “All are welcome to the only democracy in the Middle East.” The children spinning around the watchtower are tagged, in Ofer’s post, with names: “Christian,” “Palestinian,” “Druze,” “Muslim,” and – one holding a rainbow flag&nbsp;– “LGBTQ.”</p> \n<p>Banksy has not responded to Ofer's criticism.</p>",

Palestinian sources in Gaza said an IDF force was operating inside the Gaza Strip, east of Khan Yunis. Palestinian officials said the group of Hamas men were fired at from a passing car.</p> \n<p>Palestinian sources told Haaretz that one of the casualties is Nour Baraka, a deputy commander of an elite unit of Iz al-Din al-Qassam, the military wing of Hamas.</p> \n<p>According to a statement from Hamas' military wing, Israeli forces entered Gaza in a civilian vehicle three kilometers east of Khan Yunis. The exchange of fire began after Israeli soldiers kiled Barake.</p> \n<p>Gazan officials identified the other casualties as 21-year-old Omar Jani Abu Hatar, Mohammad Majed Al-Qara, Ala Adin Koidar, Mustafa Hassan Abu Odeh, Mahmoud Atallah Masabach and Ala Fasifis.</p> \n<p>After rumors began flying in through Israel, the unit took the unusual step of issuing another statement saying that “No member of our forces was abducted during the security incident” and that “additional details will follow.” Security forces in Gaza announced a state of high alert, and the Islamic Jihad declared their forces' readiness.</p> \n<p>Hamas spokesperson Fawzi Barhoum condemned the &quot;cowardly Israeli aggresion&quot; in his statement on the incident, adding that the Palestinian resistance is ready to carry out its duty and make the enemy pay a high price.</p> \n<p>Residents of Israeli communities near Gaza said the scope of these airstrikes was exceptional and “sounded almost like a war.” The Homefront Command announced that schools would be closed on Monday. Residents of Gaza border communities received directions to remain near shelter.</p> \n<p>“There were explosions and now it’s a little quieter,” said Roni Keisan, a resident of Kerem Shalom, a kibbutz near the Gaza border. “We can see a massive tank operations in the area. We set up the bomb shelter and are ready for a long sleepless night inside. In the meantime, the only information we’ve received is to stay within reach of sheltered areas.”</p> \n<p>The secretary of Kibbutz Be’eri, Hagi Yaniv, told Haaretz that residents had seen “planes and helicopters circling above the kibbutz” and had heard “explosions both near and far.”</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is visiting in Paris, cut his trip short and is flying back to Israel overnight after receiving live updates and holding consultations on the topic. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman is holding consultations at the military headquarters in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Sunday, Netanyahu said at a briefing for reporters that he would rather explore the possibility of a long-term cease-fire with Hamas than go to war. He defended the decision to let suitcases stuffed with $15 million in cash from Qatar enter Gaza last week.</p> \n<p>“We want to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” he said. “At the moment, what’s undermining stability is internal volatility within Gaza, which it may be in our power to prevent.”</p> \n<p>Prior to the incident, Israeli officials had sounded relatively optimistic about the chances of achieving a long-term cease-fire. But the heavy exchanges of fire and the casualties suffered by Hamas are liable to complicate the situation, thereby forcing Egyptian intelligence officials to step up their pressure on both sides in order to restore quiet.</p> \n<p>The commander of the Gaza Division, Brig. Gen. Eliezer Toledano, met earlier on Sunday with representatives of Israeli communities near Gaza to discuss an incident on Friday in which a Palestinian penetrated Netiv Ha’asara, a moshav just north of Gaza, and torched a greenhouse. Toledano said the incident disturbed him greatly and the IDF would investigate how it happened.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Qatar reportedly finished paying the July salaries of Hamas officials on Saturday.

        "text":["<p>Brazil, the most important country in South America, has elected a new president – Jair Bolsonaro. A country rich in natural resources, with the eighth largest economy in the world, it has for years been beset by rampant corruption and economic crisis in an outstanding example of governmental mismanagement. The people of Brazil have signaled that they want a change. Those responsible for years of corruption are out.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On August 31, 2016 the Brazilian Senate removed Rousseff from office. Replacing Rousseff was Fernando Haddad of the Workers’ Party who vied against Bolsonaro in the election. In the same election, Rousseff herself failed in her bid to win a seat in the Senate.</p> \n<p>Rousseff’s administration had allowed the opening of a Palestinian embassy in the Brazilian capital, Brazilia, and maintained close relationships with the Palestinians. Nevertheless, it came as a surprise when Brazil refused to approve the appointment of Danny Dayan, a resident of the Karnei Shomron settlement in Samaria, as Israel’s ambassador to Brazil in 2015. The approval of an ambassador by the host country, although part of the diplomatic protocol, is generally considered no more than a formality. It did not turn out to be the case this time. Brazil withheld from approving the appointment.</p> \n<p>Prior to Brazil’s decision, a number of Israelis took the very unusual step of approaching the Brazilian government urging it to reject the appointment. Among them were former Israeli ambassadors who in the past had loyally served the Israeli government without regard to who approved their appointment. Whether their recommendations to the Brazilian government had an impact on the final decision is not known. Israel had no choice but to withdraw Dayan’s appointment as ambassador to Brazil and appoint someone else in his stead, who was duly approved.</p> \n<p>Dayan is now serving as Israel’s Consul General in New York City. It is unlikely that this episode could have occurred under the administration of the newly elected Brazilian president, Bolsonaro.</p> \n<p>As was to be expected, Bolsonaro’s election was denounced by critics, both inside and outside Brazil, some of whom labeled him a populist similar to U.S. President Donald Trump. Such criticism has also been voiced in Israel. Whether he will succeed in overcoming massive corruption and liberalizing Brazil’s economy, the tasks he has set for himself, remains to be seen. For Israel the question is whether he is good for Israel.</p> \n<p>So far the indications are that Israeli-Brazilian relations are about to change substantially for the better. After 13 years under the presidencies of Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, it looks like there is going to be a radical change.</p> \n<p>Moving the Brazilian embassy in Israel to Jerusalem was one of Bolsonaro’s early announcements and would constitute and dramatic change. Only a handful of central American countries have followed the American example in this regard.</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro has already spoken to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who plans to attend Bolsonaro’s inauguration. One can safely assume Bolsonaro will also visit Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Establishing that kind of relationship with one of the world’s great countries can only mean increased stature for Israel among the nations. There is no doubt that the change in Brazil is good for Israel. Hopefully, it is also good for Brazil.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The suitcases of Qatari cash entering the Gaza Strip and the extra hours of electricity Gaza residents received thanks to the increased fuel supply sparked a small buying spree and celebratory media headlines this weekend. They also fed the delusion that the weekly demonstrations along the Israeli border had ended and life would now return to its difficult normal.</p> \n<p>Update: Six killed, including Hamas military commander, in Israeli raid in Gaza</p> \n<p>Qatar budgeted $90 million for Gaza, thereby forcing the hands of Egypt and Israel, which consider it a “terror-supporting state.” But $90 million is trivial compared to what Gaza needs.</p> \n<p>A World Bank study published in March founded that half of Gazans live in poverty. Annual per capita income is $1,820, down from about $2,500 in 1994. Foreign investment is negligible. Only international aid – including that provided by UNRWA, whose budget Washington has cut – keeps the economy alive.</p> \n<p>Unemployment is over 50 percent, and even higher among young people, who constitute most of the population. Moreover, just repairing the damage done by Israel’s 2014 war with Gaza is expected to cost $1.7 billion.</p> \n<p>These grim statistics can’t be changed by Qatar’s limited donation. Gazans need a comprehensive plan including a port, a stable electricity grid, regular fuel supplies, a sewage treatment system, potable water, agricultural development and investment in manufacturing.</p> \n<p>If Israel wants a long-term deal with Gaza, it will have to let in building materials, open its border crossings to imports and exports and let Gazans work in Israel. The diplomatic significance of such a deal isn’t just official recognition of Gaza’s Hamas government – something Israel has already effectively granted by holding Hamas responsible for everything done in Gaza. It also means ending the blockade that has lasted more than 11 years and adopting a new strategy toward Hamas.</p> \n<p>With help from the Palestinian Authority and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, Israel has succeeded in almost completely severing Gaza from the West Bank, both politically and economically. Both wanted Hamas weakened or even destroyed, and relied on economic sanctions to achieve this goal. Israel’s blockade and Abbas’ cessation of payments to 40,000 Gazan civil servants were supposed to make Hamas capitulate.</p> \n<p>But then the Gazan public entered the picture. Many Gazans responded to Hamas’ call for regular, lengthy, violent demonstrations along the Israeli border; others got swept up unintentionally. These demonstrations have lasted for seven months.</p> \n<p>Egypt, which was trying to broker both a PA-Hamas reconciliation and a Hamas-Israel deal, found itself conducting ad hoc negotiations to restore quiet, without which the latter deal would be impossible.</p> \n<p>Abbas quickly discovered that his “partnership” with Israel in pressuring Hamas was showing cracks. Israel wanted quiet now, even at the price of a significant retreat from the economic strangulation policy. And Egypt felt the same.</p> \n<p>Both countries therefore had to swallow the Qatari frog, even though Qatar is officially under Saudi, Bahraini, Emirati and Egyptian sanctions. Abbas was left alone in the war against Hamas, and last week he capitulated to Egypt’s pressure to give the cease-fire deal a chance.</p> \n<p>Hamas seemingly can present the calm and the payment of salaries as a diplomatic achievement. But it has no way to leverage this achievement as long as Abbas sticks to his conditions for internal reconciliation. These include subordinating Hamas’ arms to the PA, establishing a unified security service and restoring control of tax collection and the judicial system in Gaza to the PA.</p> \n<p>As long as Egypt and Israel conditioned the reopening of the border crossings on PA control of those crossings, Abbas’ conditions carried real weight. But both countries have now retreated from this demand. Thus, these conditions now are only capable of stymieing the internal reconciliation.</p> \n<p>Hamas can boast of its achievement to Gazan residents, but since it doesn’t stand for elections, its ability to rule Gaza actually depends on Israel and Egypt. So for now, the main beneficiary of recent developments is Gaza’s public more than its leadership.</p> \n<p>But Hamas has become a player in Israeli politics, which may be one of its greatest sources of power. Cabinet ministers are openly squabbling over Gaza policy and it will be an issue in Israel’s next election.</p> \n<p>As long as Hamas controls Gaza, it can perpetuate the Strip’s separation from the PA and thereby thwart efforts to establish a unified Palestinian representative that could negotiate with Jerusalem and Washington.</p> \n<p>That’s a great service to Israel’s government, which fears Donald Trump’s “deal of the century” or any other diplomatic move that would require it to pay a territorial price.</p> \n<p>Thus in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s view, any concession to Hamas that preserves the Palestinian schism is worth it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In February 2018, Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf bin Alawi made his first official visit to the Palestinian Authority and an unofficial visit to Israel. The visit to Israel was defined as a religious pilgrimage to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the media did not report it. But what he said in Ramallah was astonishing, and even more far-reaching than the impressive peace declarations by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and King Hussein of Jordan in their time.</p> \n<p>About two years ago, I was invited by the Sultan of Oman, Qaboos bin Said al Said, to visit his country with a small international group. He is the longest-reigning ruler in the Muslim world and I was told that I was the first person to arrive in Oman with an Israeli passport since the outbreak of the second intifada. Even then there were signs that Oman’s policy toward Israel was changing; the foreign minister’s visit in February merely reinforced them.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;The sultan’s new friend: Just why did Netanyahu visit Oman? | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bin Alawi did not condemn the occupation, nor mention the 1967 borders or right of return, although it is clear that his support for a Palestinian state means some kind of Israeli withdrawal. He did not condemn the United States for moving its embassy to Jerusalem, or demand a Palestinian capital in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>What he did say was, “The need to establish a Palestinian state today resembles the urgency that was felt at the time for establishing the State of Israel after the two world wars.” Then, he said, “there was an international desire to establish Israel,” just as today “the establishment of a Palestinian state has become a strategic need for the entire world.” So why did the sultan agree to an official visit by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu two-and-a-half weeks ago?</p> \n<p>Oman produces a million barrels of oil a day and an amount of gas that brings in similar income. That’s not a lot, but the modest size of the population (about 3 million citizens and 1.5 million foreign workers living in a land 12 times the size of Israel), the lack of government corruption and prudent economic policies mean that Omanis have a good standard of living. That’s what I heard and saw in Oman, including from the “man on the street” and the security guards at the official guest house where we stayed.</p> \n<p>Oman’s stability also stems from its neutrality regarding all the conflicts in the Arab and Muslim world. Almost all Omanis are Muslims, but the vast majority are neither Sunni nor Shi’ite but rather Ibadis, a fascinating incarnation of the extreme Kharijite community from the seventh century.</p> \n<p>Today they are among the most moderate Muslim communities. The status of women is relatively good and you can get alcoholic drinks in any hotel. Qaboos has good ties with the Muslim world and acts as a mediator and conciliator. His interest in facilitating reconciliation stems from the prestige this position brings, but also from the fact that a major regional shake-up – a Saudi-Iranian or an Iranian-American conflict – could capsize his own ship, which is now sailing on quiet waters.</p> \n<p>The sultan is trying to promote an arrangement that will cool off the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, and mediating without direct talks is not mediating. That’s why Abbas visited Oman before Netanyahu’s visit. More broadly, his foreign minister’s mission in February and Netanyahu’s recent visit were aimed at trying to reconcile the PA and the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>Oman can help U.S. President Donald Trump precisely because it keeps its distance from the conflict. That’s also why the sultan can discuss options with Abbas that the latter wouldn’t be willing to hear from anyone else.</p> \n<p>Helping Trump is important because he can provide Oman with American security guarantees. After all, American-Iranian tensions are escalating; last week the U.S. imposed a new phase of economic sanctions. Due to its economic and political ties with Iran, Oman is exposed to American retaliatory measures. It is therefore important for the sultan to show Trump that Oman can help his administration in the Israeli-Palestinian context. If the sultan is indeed trying to also mediate between the United States-Israel and Iran, as some media have reported, such a move has no chance now and he knows it. But there is value to the offer, which could be useful the moment something changes in the United States, in Iran or both.</p> \n<p>The sultan will probably not pay a domestic price for Netanyahu’s visit; my impression when I was there is that his control is absolute or virtually absolute. Iran wasn’t happy about the visit, but it needs Oman. In the Arab world, Qaboos has been castigated by Islamists and extremist intellectuals, but not by the regimes.</p> \n<p>The chances of Oman’s mediation advancing the peace process are low, but even if it fails, Qaboos’ move has already helped his country’s security. It is also possible that technological and intelligence cooperation with Israel will help Oman, and in exchange there will be trade relations. The visit improved Netanyahu’s position and eroded Abbas’ status. It will also encourage similar steps by other countries. All this might lower Palestinian expectations, though that may be an unattainable goal.</p> \n<p>Dr. Amatzia Baram is a professor emeritus of the University of Haifa.</p>",

        "text":["<p>After the heaviest concentration of shelling ever on southern Israel – worse than the highest daily numbers during Operation Protective Edge – the most right-wing security cabinet ever decided on Tuesday to pursue another cease-fire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The official announcement was formulated in vague language (and instructed the Israel Defense Forces “to continue operations as necessary.”) But its significance became clear in the afternoon: The IDF held its fire, as did the Palestinian organizations in the Gaza Strip, which admitted it openly.</p> \n<p>This occurred despite much of the rhetoric being broadcast since the current round of strikes began Sunday evening. The decision was made despite the public pressure and increasing media criticism of what was being portrayed as a feeble government response. It may cause some political damage. Nevertheless, it seems that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is determined. In a manner completely congruent with his remarks to journalists in Paris earlier this week, Netanyahu prefers quiet over war in Gaza and he is prepared to take no small risk to achieve it.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Why Netanyahu will do almost anything for a cease-fire&nbsp;■&nbsp;Why Hamas' missile attack on Israeli bus actually shows it's not looking to spark full-on Gaza war&nbsp;■&nbsp;Hamas tries to dictate new rules of game in Gaza, but it may be misjudging Israel</p> \n<p>The decision involved an argument in the security cabinet. In contrast to the first leaks, ministers Avigdor Lieberman and Naftali Bennett made sure to stress after the discussion that they do not believe in an arrangement. On the other hand, Netanyahu is supported by the heads of all the security services, who believe that there is no justification for going to war now in Gaza, even after the heavy barrages of the last two days.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has expressed his line of thought throughout this period: He believes a ground operation in Gaza is liable to foul up and exact a heavy price, and that no one will assume control of the Strip even if Israel removes Hamas from there. There were probably other reasons as well. It appears the prime minister believes he can continue to promote relations with the Gulf states after his public visit to Oman and perhaps use those ties to channel money into the Strip and ease the infrastructure problems there. And there is also the Iranian threat in Syria and Lebanon, which Netanyahu believes requires attention and resources.</p> \n<p>The prime minister is taking a considerable risk. Efforts at reaching a long-term arrangement can go awry again, as has happened frequently. There is also the impression that Hamas leaders believe they can gradually raise the intensity of military action against Israel without paying much of a price. But the security cabinet decision restores quiet to the Gaza-border communities, at least until the next eruption.</p> \n<p>The numbers recorded up to Tuesday afternoon are simply insane: More than 450 rockets and mortars fired from the Gaza Strip. Most were aimed at the small border-area communities but some were fired at cities in the south. One could also detect an effort by Hamas and the Palestinian organizations to challenge Israel’s defense systems. Iron Dome batteries intercepted many of the projectiles aimed at populated areas. But a rocket that hit an old building with no security rooms caused casualties – one dead and two critically wounded – and there was a serious breach in the IDF’s security apparatus that allowed an anti-tank missile to blow up a bus near the border, seriously wounding a soldier.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian response came several hours after the botched IDF special forces operation deep in the Gaza Strip east of Khan Yunis on Sunday night. Hamas did not suffice with boasting that it had rebuffed an Israeli infiltration and killed a senior officer in an elite unit. The organization wanted to signal that its response to deep penetration of its territory (and, from its point of view, the violation of its sovereignty) must be more severe. This was essentially an effort to dictate new rules of the game: Even secret activity exposed in their territory – of the type the IDF conducts along all of Israel’s borders – will lead to a heavy bombardment of Israeli territory.</p> \n<p>Hamas’ decision to respond sharply may have been influenced by Netanyahu’s repeated statements that he isn’t interested in an escalation. Hamas leaders themselves seem to have been surprised by the limited Israeli response to rocket barrages in each of the earlier rounds of violence in recent months. As a result, the Palestinians are growing increasingly bold.</p> \n<p>The anti-tank missile blunder</p> \n<p>The most worrisome event was recorded for all to see, with Hamas posting and distributing a video of the attack on the Israeli bus near the border of northern Gaza on Monday afternoon. The video shows clearly how the bus driver entered an area with absolutely no barrier between him and the border, so that it was completely exposed to a direct hit by an anti-tank missile. Right in front of it were several smaller vans, most of them apparently military ones, as they were surrounded by soldiers.</p> \n<p>The missile blew up the bus and seriously wounded a soldier who’d been standing near it. The bus was carrying reinforcements that had been summoned to the area, and dozens of soldiers had gotten off the bus only a few minutes earlier. One can understand from this video that Hamas’ anti-tank cell is very familiar with the details of troop movements and chose to fire the missile at the appropriate time.</p> \n<p>The video is both chilling and aggravating. With all due caution, one must say this is not how an army in a state of combat is supposed to operate. These lessons should have been learned after previous bloody incidents of anti-tank fire during Operation Pillar of Defense in Gaza (2012) and from the incident on the slopes of Mount Dov on the Lebanese border in which an officer and a soldier were killed in January 2015. Military doctrine calls for keeping the units’ staging areas beyond the range of the enemy’s heavy artillery. In Hamas’ case this means mortar fire up to a range of five kilometers. This is ignored repeatedly, creating unnecessary exposure to mortar fire and this time to a focused anti-tank ambush, even though this already cost lives and generated criticism during Protective Edge. One would expect the IDF to be more meticulous in its handling of movements close to the fence; this was a serious error that requires thorough investigation. On Monday night the IDF announced the appointment of an inquiry committee headed by a brigadier general to investigate.</p> \n<p>Even if Israel seeks a prolonged cease-fire, which is certainly preferable to war, it is possible that in retrospect it may be necessary to reevaluate the decision to proceed with such haste. As things look at the moment, Hamas is signaling that it has the upper hand, and the Israeli moves have not yet reminded it of the actual gap in capabilities between the sides. This is a problematic point of departure for reaching a long-term cease-fire.</p>",

        "text":["<p>This should be a time of unbridled celebration for the Women’s March.</p> \n<p>The midterm elections showed that the mass protest in January 2017, on the day following the inauguration of President Donald Trump, has borne fruit. Last week, an unprecedented number of culturally diverse women ran and won seats at the national and state levels – many of them crediting the Women’s March for inspiring them.</p> \n<p>Yet the movement has been riven with discord as it begins to plan its third march for January, primarily around the refusal of three of the group’s four co-chairs – Tamika Mallory, Carmen Perez and Linda Sarsour – to distance themselves from controversial Nation of Islam founder Louis Farrakhan.</p> \n<p>While he continues to make anti-Semitic and anti-LGBT statements – most recently declaring “I’m not anti-Semite, I’m anti-termite” – increased sensitivity to anti-Semitism following last month’s Pittsburgh synagogue massacre has magnified the backlash.</p> \n<p>On October 30, three days after a gunman killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue, Hollywood actress Alyssa Milano was quoted in LGBT magazine The Advocate expressing unhappiness with the Women’s March leaders’ continued support of Farrakhan. Milano has been credited with popularizing the #MeToo movement in the past year.</p> \n<p>“Any time that there is any bigotry or anti-Semitism in that respect, it needs to be called out and addressed,” Milano said. “I’m disappointed in the leadership of the Women’s March that they haven’t done it adequately. When asked if she planned to address the next march under its current leadership without a renunciation of Farrakhan, Milano answered: “I would say no at this point. [It’s] unfortunate that none of them have come forward against him at this point. Or even given a really good reason why [we should] support them.”</p> \n<p>Milano was backed early last week by fellow actress Debra Messing, who tweeted: “I stand with you, Alyssa Milano.”</p> \n<p>And last Thursday, a German NGO, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, suspended plans to give a human rights award to the Women’s March. The award was postponed until after it could “have the matter investigated by an independent party.”</p> \n<p>On Saturday, Teresa Shook – who initiated the Women’s March with a Facebook post – took to the social media site again, writing: “We cannot tolerate hate speech, bigotry, white supremacy, racism, misogyny, anti-Semitism, homophobia, xenophobia from within our own community or WM leaders. The soul of this Movement is love, aloha and solidarity. We must bring it back to that.”</p> \n<p>In a telephone interview with Haaretz, Shook said she was disturbed by the division she sees in the movement. Asked whether she agreed with Milano’s reluctance to appear at the Women’s March under its current leadership, she said, “I can understand her position.”</p> \n<p>She added that the Friedrich Ebert Foundation’s decision made her feel “sad for all of the women. There are so many women across the world who made that happen. I feel bad for them. It was their march,” she said.</p> \n<p>Shook, who lives in Hawaii, is not formally affiliated with any of the Women’s March groups. She said she has deliberately remained independent, offering advice and support on an informal basis to help the movement in any way she can.</p> \n<p>But she is concerned about its future. “I feel that we have to figure something out going forward. The rift is getting too big to heal, and I’m not sure what the solution is at this point. Many organizations have been reaching out to me asking what they should do – but I don’t have an answer.”</p> \n<p>Shook was the first person to suggest a march on the day after Trump’s inauguration. Another woman with a similar idea, Bob Bland, consolidated the various efforts spinning across social media into a central Women’s March organization, which assembled the first record-breaking march. Actively seeking diversity, Bland brought in Mallory, Sarsour and Perez in an effort to make the group more inclusive.</p> \n<p>The three women became co-chairs with Bland, bringing a wealth of experience to the table when it came to organizing rallies and protests. But they also brought personal and professional connections to Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam.</p> \n<p>Mallory has known Farrakhan since she was a child and has worked with&nbsp;the Nation of Islam&nbsp;for decades in urban anti-violence efforts. Sarsour is a prominent advocate for Muslim Americans, criminal justice reform and civil rights. She is also the former executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, and is a staunch supporter of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, opposing normalizing ties with supporters of Zionism.</p> \n<p>The three women worked together in Justice League NYC, a criminal-justice-reform task force co-founded by Perez. The latter is also executive director of Harry Belafonte’s Gathering for Justice organization.</p> \n<p>Speaking at Farrakhan’s 2016 Saviour’s Day rally, Perez said her group was “really grateful for the minister and his support of the Justice League … knowing we have the support of the Nation of Islam, who’s constantly showing up for us and we’re here to serve as well.”</p> \n<p>Their backgrounds and affiliations were never a secret. But until last winter, after the Women’s March held its first anniversary events, the level of controversy was minimal and did not interfere with the march and its spirit of unity – at least publicly. Attacks on the leaders, primarily Sarsour, came mostly from political opponents on the pro-Trump right.</p> \n<p>That changed in late February, when Mallory attended a Saviour’s Day rally in Chicago. Farrakhan acknowledged her presence on stage, as part of a speech which included statements that “the powerful Jews are my enemy,” and Jews were responsible for “degenerate behavior in Hollywood, turning men into women and women into men.”</p> \n<p>Her appearance drew public criticism from the left, with many calling on the co-founders to renounce the Nation of Islam leader or step down from their leadership roles.</p> \n<p>But Mallory doubled down on her defense of Farrakhan – and Sarsour and Perez stood by her, further alienating many left-wing Jews. This led to cracks in the Women’s March coalition, with the heads of some chapters distancing themselves from the national leadership.</p> \n<p>The tensions between the Jewish community and the Women’s March leadership intensified in April, after Mallory blasted Starbucks for including the Anti-Defamation League in its anti-bias training, accusing the ADL of “constantly attacking black and brown people.” As a result of the pressure, Starbucks dropped the ADL as a participant in its racial sensitivity training.</p> \n<p>Throughout the controversy, the Women’s March organization has attempted to walk the delicate tightrope of denouncing the sentiments expressed by Farrakhan while supporting its co-founders.</p> \n<p>During the first round of controversy, the group released a statement declaring that “Minister Farrakhan’s statements about Jewish, queer and trans people are not aligned with the Women’s March Unity Principles.” At the same time, the statement expressed continued support for Mallory. “We love and value our sister and co-president Tamika Mallory,” it said, adding that “neither we nor she shy away from the fact that intersectional movement building is difficult.”</p> \n<p>Following the publicity generated by Milano’s comments last week, the organization issued another statement, saying it does “not support or endorse” the statements made by Farrakhan. Again, the group also staunchly defended its leadership as having “risked their safety” to fight “the threat of white nationalism, which is fueled by anti-Black racism and anti-Semitism.” It added “that many on the right are thrilled to use any tool they can find to divide and undermine our movement.”</p> \n<p>And it seems it has sown discord, with Women’s March communications director Cassady Fendlay – who also works with the Justice League – accusing Milano of “acting in accordance with the tradition of white women who use the labor of women of color when it’s convenient for them, and then use their power to trash those women when it becomes more expedient.”</p> \n<p>Milano’s “performative outrage, making a public statement condemning a Black man,” Fendlay wrote, “will have no impact on curbing anti-Semitism, neither in the Nation of Islam nor in our society. ... Milano and all the white women lined up behind her are actually enforcing the power of white supremacy through their misguided attempt to challenge hate speech.”</p> \n<p>Progressive Jewish women fired back that the group’s rhetoric smacked of victim-blaming and whataboutism: “We cannot allow our movement to stand for partnering with hate, attending hate-group events, cheering violent speeches where minorities are called termites and satanic,” wrote activist Carly Pildis in Tablet.</p> \n<p>Non-Jewish allies of the Women’s March, like anti-gun violence activist Shannon Watts, have joined Milano in expressing reservations about its leadership.&nbsp;Watts tweeted: “The Women’s March was never about specific leaders or the celebrities who spoke: it was about the women who marched.” (The tweet has subsequently been removed.)</p> \n<p>One longtime Women’s March activist, who asked not to be named, predicts a “big blowout” in the organization in coming months. “This has been coming to a head for a long time – and it’s frustrating,” she told Haaretz. “It’s not what the march was supposed to be about. We already have so much ugly divisive rhetoric going on in the Trump administration, it saddens me that it has to take place inside our movement as well.</p> \n<p>“We might have been able to overcome this earlier on, if the apologies had been stronger and there had been a commitment to do better,” she added. “But now it feels like the wounds are too deep.”</p>",

Based on the latest figures, with 99.88% of the vote counted, Leon led by 6,528 votes.</p> \n<p>Leon, a former accountant, is politically close to Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman and was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s director general in his first term.</p> \n<p>While celebrating his victory in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Talpiot, Leon said, &quot;tonight, Jerusalem chose consolidation, unity, togetherness and goodness. I plan, with the help of God, to be a mayor for all the residents of Jerusalem.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Victory or not, losing the Hasidim made the Jerusalem mayoral race tough for Moshe Leon</p> \n<p>Interior Minister Arye Dery congratulated Leon, telling the mayor-elect by phone, &quot;Give thanks to the Lord for he is good…. Much congratulations, and good, good, good luck.&quot;</p> \n<p>Berkovitch refused to confirm that he had lost the race, saying that the soldiers' votes have yet to be counted and claimed there had been &quot;many irregularities&quot; and added that the legal team of his faction Hitorerut would be studying the results.</p> \n<p>The votes in 18 booths have yet to be counted, as do roughly 9,000 votes of the disabled, soldiers and prisoners.</p> \n<p>In a speech to Hitorerut activists, Berkovitch admitted that &quot;at the moment, the results do not look good.&quot;</p> \n<p>However, he added, &quot;I really believe in what we did here. We laid down foundations for a new Israeli hope. There is a not-inconsiderable number of booths that we will thoroughly examine. I cannot release you without hope. Our legal team will work tonight and tomorrow morning. There is reason we warned about a power working against us aggressively, violently and on the borderline of legality. We are not giving up on the chance of winning in this round.&quot;</p> \n<p>Though Berkovitch may have won a majority among the soldiers, it probably will not be enough to close the gap.</p> \n<p>After the count, Leon went to his faction headquarters, where his supporters were celebrating his triumph. United Torah Judaism leader Moshe Gafni called to congratulate him. An announcement from the party stated that that thousands of people streamed to Kanfei Nesharim Street to celebrate, including Knesset members Uri Maklev and Yakov Asher.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, on Wednesday morning there were complaints, after the event, about the behavior of Leon's people for tearing down posters of rivals, and destroying rivals' ballot papers in the voting booths. Fake announcements against Berkovitch were disseminated in the city throughout Tuesday, and material inciting against Berkovitch was disseminated.</p> \n<p>Among other things a fake video was disseminated to thousands of city residents, ostensibly showing a car with signs in Arabic urging the residents to vote for Berkovitch, with the statement, &quot;The Arabs in East Jerusalem are now going to vote for Berkovitch. Watch Berkovitch's car distribute flyers in Arabic, saying, &quot;Berkovitch – only with me can you keep your home.&quot;</p> \n<p>Earlier in the day, Jerusalemites received letters ostensibly from the New Israel Fund and Peace Now movements, calling on them to vote for Berkovitch so he would push residential construction for Palestinians in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Also, during the day, other material smearing Berkovitch was disseminated too. In the neighborhood of Gilo, posters went up saying, &quot; Berkovitch, the people of Gilo are worse than Arabs… go find voters in East Jerusalem.&quot; Other ads accused Berkovitch of cooperating with the extremist Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox who demonstrate against army service.</p> \n<p>No fewer than 110 candidates in 55 municipal governments in Israel vied in runoff elections around the country on Tuesday. The additional round was called in locales where no one candidate managed to win more than 40 percent of the vote in the election two weeks ago.</p> \n<p>Voters on Tuesday ousted seven incumbent mayors, some of whom had been in office for years. In the Tel Aviv suburbs, Rishon Letzion Mayor Dov Tzur was defeated by Raz Kinstlich; Ramat Gan Mayor Yisrael Zinger was bested by Carmel Shama-Hacohen, Israel's former ambassador to UNESCO; and Ra'anana Mayor Eitan Ginzburg lost to Haim Broide.</p> \n<p>In the north, the longtime mayor of Ma'alot-Tarshiha, Shlomo Buchbut, lost in the second round to Arkadi Pomerantz.</p> \n<p>National voter turnout was 43.25%, compared to 50.9% in runoff elections in 2013.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Precious little early Christian art has survived in the Holy Land, though this is where the religion itself was born. But now, an extremely rare depiction of Jesus from the early Christian era has been found in the ruins of Shivta, a large Byzantine farming village in the heart of Israel’s Negev desert.</p> \n<p>“His face is right there, looking at us,” says Dr. Emma Maayan-Fanar, the art historian who finally noticed the wall painting a century after it was uncovered.</p> \n<p>A first painting found by others in Shivta last year turned out to show Jesus’ transfiguration: the present team was the one to realize what the painting showed, but the drawing of his face did not survive the centuries. The second one shows his baptism and his face. Maayan-Fanar and the team – Dr. Ravit Linn, Dr. Yotam Tepper and Prof. Guy Bar-Oz of the Zinman Institute of Archaeology at the University of Haifa – described the find in the world archaeological journal Antiquity: &quot;Christ's face revealed at Shivta&quot;.</p> \n<p>The gospels never describe Jesus’ appearance. All depictions of him are later artist impressions, and while surviving depictions of Jesus abound in old monasteries and churches elsewhere, they are all but nonexistent in Israel.</p> \n<p>In contrast to the Western image of Jesus as someone with flowing long hair and, sometimes, a beard, the Shivta painting shows him in the Eastern style with short curly hair, a long face and an elongated nose, says Maayan-Fanar.</p> \n<p>Shivta is in the heart of the Negev, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Be’er Sheva. The village was founded in the 2nd century C.E. and survived for about 650 years, before being abandoned in the early Islamic period.</p> \n<p>This was no shriveled desert backwater. Shivta sustained a large population and during its heyday in the fifth to seventh centuries, had no less than three churches. It apparently never had a Jewish presence, though it did have a mosque in the early Islamic period, says Tepper.</p> \n<p>The first painting in Shivta of Jesus, also badly eroded, had been found in the southernmost church. This second one of his baptism – which naturally would have taken place in his adulthood, not infancy – has been found in the northern church, says Maayan-Fanar. But it almost wasn’t.</p> \n<p>Now you see it</p> \n<p>The ruins at Shivta were first discovered in 1871 by the linguist and explorer Edward Henry Palmer, and have received much archaeological attention since. But the archaeologists of yore kept terrible records, and also it seems that past excavators noticed the churches but did not observe the murals.</p> \n<p>How could the church have been found and explored, yet the painting go undetected for a century?</p> \n<p>The wall painting was badly damaged and has centuries of dirt accretion on it. Also, says Maayan-Fanar, it was very high – possibly to cause awe among its observers in antiquity: They had to look up at it.</p> \n<p>Archaeologists exploring the site in the 1920s thought they saw something, but that sighting was never pursued, the art historian tells Haaretz. She herself had been at the site several times and hadn’t noticed it. And then...</p> \n<p>“I was there at the right time, at the right place with the right angle of light and, suddenly, I saw eyes,” Maayan-Fanar says. “It was the face of Jesus at his baptism, looking at us.”</p> \n<p>Her husband, the professional photographer Dror Maayan, took hi-res photographs of the site, and in them the image lost for over 1,500 years becomes clearer. “We can really see him now,” says the art historian.</p> \n<p>The image of Jesus</p> \n<p>What Jesus looked like has been the subject of debate as heated as it is pointless, since there are no known contemporary descriptions of him. The earliest “portrait” of him, found in Syria, dates to 200 years after his death. And in any case, histories of the time were known more for their messages and less for their meticulous accuracy.</p> \n<p>Jesus is generally shown with brown eyes, based on the general (and probably correct) assumption that he should look like people did in the Middle East 2,000 years ago. Actually, the coastal Levant is thronged with blue-eyed people, going back about 6,500 years to the arrival of Aryan migrants from Iran or southern Turkey, who mixed with the locals. Just based on local norms, Jesus’ eyes could have been anything from blue to hazel-green to brown.</p> \n<p>As for his hair, its style in Christian art is a matter of time and place – and that’s assuming he wasn’t balding, as happens to some men. During the first centuries of Christianity’s evolution, Jesus was depicted in all sorts of ways: with short hair, long hair, bearded or bare-chinned. There was no consensus image, explains Maayan-Fanar.</p> \n<p>For instance, catacombs in Rome dating to about the 4th century show Jesus with short hair, she says. So do the pictures of Jesus drawn by the Coptic Christians in Egypt and early Byzantines in Syria.</p> \n<p>By about the sixth century, though, in the West Jesus would come to be drawn with long hair and a beard, while in the East he would continue to be drawn with short hair for some time to come.</p> \n<p>The earliest-known image of Jesus is found in Dura, Syria (on the border with Iran), and has been dated somewhere from the year 233 to 256. Around 1,800 years ago, Dura had been a burgeoning multicultural metropolis, with Jews, pagans and Christians all rubbing shoulders and houses of worship for each. One of the murals in the Dura-Europos church baptistery depicts Jesus as the faithful shepherd, carrying a sheep on his shoulder. It has a decidedly eastern flavor.</p> \n<p>The images there survived because the whole city was destroyed around the mid-third century and the murals were buried in sand – and thus preserved. The Shivta imagery also seems eastern.</p> \n<p>Looking at the photographs of the apse at Shivta is not entirely helpful to the layman. But Tepper explains that preserving and restoring the paintings – by Linn – will take time. And cost money.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Maayan Fanar says that “standing in the apse, you can see discolorations, red lines.” The high-tech photography helped tease the facial features drawn in antiquity, and also showed that there were two figures.</p> \n<p>The figure interpreted as John the Baptist is drawn large and youthful Jesus was smaller, as was customary in Byzantine art. Another reason to interpret the remains of the painting as this image is context: The mural was in the baptistery, Maayan-Fanar points out.</p> \n<p>It bears adding that the dating of the churches in Shivta, and the subjects of their murals, pend confirmation.</p> \n<p>Even inscriptions found in the ruins at Shivta have not been particularly helpful in dating the village or its edifices, Tepper says. “Some think the churches were first built in the 4th century,” Maayan-Fanar says - particularly Abraham Negev, who studied Byzantine settlement in the Negev.</p> \n<p>Tepper points out that a mosaic in the northern church dates to the 6th century, and according to Maayan-Fanar, the images in the village are in keeping with finds dated to the sixth century – in nearby Egypt, for instance.</p> \n<p>As for the second painting of Jesus in Shivta, it had been noticed and described a year ago and is equally extraordinary – not just for surviving, but because it shows Jesus’ “transfiguration.” In other words, becoming divinely radiant while climbing Mount Tabor (aka Kfar Tavor), according to the gospels.</p> \n<p>Only two depictions of his transfiguration had been known until last year: One in Ravenna, Italy; and the other in St. Catherine’s Monastery, Sinai. Then, last year, a third was found in Shivta, of all places, says Maayan Fanar.</p> \n<p>Lesson one: Evidently, it wasn’t that the early Christian artists weren’t depicting the scene for theological reasons – the paintings simply didn’t survive. Lesson two: Shivta had been important in the greater scheme of Byzantine things.</p> \n<p>Come the Islamic period, a mosque was built by the southern church. Some take their juxtaposition as attesting to religious coexistence and tolerance. Tepper thinks that’s perhaps a tad sentimental, and suggests instead that the mosque had been erected after the church was abandoned.</p> \n<p>“There’s Arabic graffiti on the northern church,” Tepper says, qualifying that it hasn’t been dated yet. Arabic graffiti has also been found in other ancient churches in the Negev, and it doesn’t seem likely to attest to benign coexistence.</p> \n<p>In any case, the whole site met its end sometime in the late 8th or early 9th century, possibly by quake or other natural catastrophe, leaving behind ruins. And, it seems, two paintings of Jesus.</p> \n<p>There were almost certainly other paintings, but they are gone. “There are some areas with remains of plaster and paint, but you can’t see a thing,” Maayan-Fanar says.</p> \n<p>Of course, given the faintness of the image in Shivta, the identification of Jesus and John the Baptist are arguable. The fact is, the church and its baptistery were sitting there uncovered for nearly a century and nobody saw the face of Jesus looking at us, Maayan-Fanar admits. But in the future, God – and budgets – willing, the painting can be restored and everybody can see it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s hard to know if Israel and Hamas will sustain the fragile calm they’ve achieved. It could be shattered by the time this article is published in print Thursday morning.</p> \n<p>The political scene, on the other hand, is easier to understand. Zionist Union will assail Benjamin Netanyahu for not being right-wing enough. Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid party will say Netanyahu and Zionist Union leader Avi Gabbay are mere imitations of Lapid, who’s the real thing. Naftali Bennett will tweet that his fellow rightist, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, is a member of the Arab-Jewish anti-nationalism group Ta’ayush. Lieberman will blame God and Netanyahu will resign to save his skin. Only the security cabinet will blame the army.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>But let’s ignore the background noise for a moment and address the facts. The broader cabinet doesn’t want a military operation in Gaza. The parties in the governing coalition know how to threaten resigning over other issues. Puffing up their chests for the media is mainly an attempt to blame anyone not running fast enough. It’s surprising they haven’t dragged in the left-wing New Israel Fund yet.</p> \n<p>Communities near Gaza have been under fire for years. Instead of doing something about it, cabinet members keep yelling that we can’t talk to Hamas. Obviously we can, we always have, like when we got Gilad Shalit freed and when we ended the 2014 Gaza war. This was talking to them, even if we used Egyptian mediators. Only when it’s time to give Israelis who live near Gaza the quiet they deserve, we suddenly can’t talk to Hamas.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Farewell to Avigdor Lieberman, a cartoon defense minister | Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;12 shocking headlines from Lieberman’s bombastic career in Israeli politics</p> \n<p>Netanyahu read the picture and understood that we have nothing to gain from another operation in Gaza and that Hamas won’t disappear. The pictures of suitcases filled with cash from Qatar had a political price, and we know how Netanyahu loves paying bills. This was a rare occasion when he showed leadership, and that’s commendable. We should note to people on the left that many Netanyahu voters are willing to live with these pictures and aren’t eager for another military operation.</p> \n<p>What isn’t clear is why soldiers were sent on a mission deep into Gaza and the only answer we got was that we do it all the time. Someone bet people’s lives that there would be an escalation and the bet went awry.</p> \n<p>Another fact is that Hamas opted for an escalation. Hamas too knows how to shell symbolic targets when it wants to, and it too has a database of “proportionate responses.” It bet that the government would prefer to focus on the north rather than be dragged once again into the Gaza mire. There’s a lesson here: Military superiority isn’t the answer to everything, and when you maintain a few volatile fronts under the heading “managing the conflict,” you can get bitten.</p> \n<p>People on the right like to say that an agreement is made from a position of strength. They should apply this notion to their own performance. Instead of reaching an agreement from every position of strength, they preferred to bask in their imaginary power and launch a years-long blockade with occasional military campaigns for restoring “deterrence.”</p> \n<p>The problem lies not in the government’s reasonable concern about sending the army back in when all we’d get is fresh graves. Even though a long-term agreement is the right thing to do, the government is being drawn into a partial and fragile deal years too late and made from so weak a position it’s a wonder Lieberman, Bennett and Netanyahu dare show their faces in public.</p> \n<p>A book is making the rounds on the right asking “why do you vote for the right and get the left?” I’m guessing the answer isn’t in the book. Right-wing voters aren’t getting the left. They’re getting what they voted for: a collection of incompetent people dragged belatedly into an unstable and partial solution because they’re afraid the lies they sold their voters will be exposed. It would be funny if it didn’t keep ending in bloodshed.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Blaming U.S. President Donald Trump for a resurgence of racism in America, some Hispanics are seeking Spanish citizenship based on their Jewish roots, according to&nbsp;The New York Times.</p> \n<p>An&nbsp;article&nbsp;identifying several such individuals, including one Albuquerque, New Mexico, woman who was raised Catholic, appeared Tuesday. The Times reported an increase in interest by non-Jews from the United States and Latin America who, for various reasons, have applied for a Spanish passport based on a 2015 law that Spain passed to atone for the expulsion of Jews during the Inquisition. Portugal&nbsp;passed&nbsp;similar legislation a year earlier.</p> \n<p>The article raises several interesting questions, including whether those seeking to flee racism in the United States would do well to immigrate under a law with strong Jewish connotations to Spain — a country whose society has a strong tradition of anti-Semitism that surveys consistently suggest isn’t going away anytime soon.</p> \n<p>But a more practical question concerns the very feasibility of what The Times article describes as an “exit strategy” for American Hispanics who are not Jewish.</p> \n<p>On paper, there is no reason that a Catholic applicant shouldn’t be naturalized. “Descendants of Sephardim,” after all, could include millions of South and Central Americans with Jewish ancestry, and hundreds of thousands more in Africa.</p> \n<p>The laws in Spain and Portugal, whose constitutions forbid discrimination on the basis of religion or ethnicity, do not require applicants be Jewish. They stipulate only that they prove Sephardic lineage.</p> \n<p>But in practice, the laws in Spain and Portugal may be applied too selectively to serve large numbers of non-Jews.&nbsp;This is partly because the laws in those countries make local Jewish communities responsible for vetting applications.</p> \n<p>Some communities, including in Porto, Portugal, only approve applicants considered Jewish according to halachah, or rabbinic law. The Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain, or FCJE, says on its website that non-Jews may apply.</p> \n<p>But even the website of the Spanish Ministry of Labour, Migrations and Social Security encourages applicants to obtain rabbinical certification to support their application.</p> \n<p>It may appear discriminatory, but the de facto preference in some communities for applications by Jews is arguably in keeping with the spirit of the law, which Spanish and Portuguese officials have said many times is to atone for religious persecution of Jews. Muslims, atheists and others also were persecuted during the Inquisition.</p> \n<p>On the ground, non-Jewish applicants can be naturalized if they have a Jewish grandparent, “or even, in some cases, a paternal great-grandfather,” according to Jacob Bendahan, an Israeli lawyer handling applications. In any case, “even if the applicant is not Jewish, they must present documents proving they are descended from Sephardim who were expelled. A ketubah, something,” he added, using the word for a Jewish wedding contract.</p> \n<p>“It’s impossible for a Catholic applicant with Catholic lineage to get naturalized [just] because he has a Sephardic last name, like Perez or Cardozo,” Bendahan said.</p> \n<p>The number of applicants approved so far — no more than 6,500 in Spain and about 2,000 in Portugal – suggests that the law is being interpreted strictly.</p> \n<p>Spain and Portugal, European Union countries with high unemployment and national debts burdened by their relatively generous welfare policies, are broadly speaking not interested in encouraging immigration from their impoverished former colonies.</p> \n<p>But would an applicant who feels discriminated against in the United States feel more comfortable in Spain?</p> \n<p>The prevalence of anti-Semitic sentiment in the kingdom provides little assurances, despite the pro-Sephardic legislation in Spain and growing awareness to the touristic and educational potential of sites connected to Jewish heritage.</p> \n<p>Spain, along with Italy, topped the Anti-Defamation League’s 2015 anti-Semitism&nbsp;index&nbsp;in Western Europe with 29 percent of the population holding anti-Semitic views. Jews are often conflated in Spain with Israel — including by a Catalan lawmaker who demanded the leader of Barcelona’s Jewish community be removed from the local government’s parliament for being “a foreign agent.”</p> \n<p>Until 2015, Spain had a town called “Castrillo Kill Jews” — the name has been changed. Still, across northern Spain, people toast one another with the phrase “kill a Jew.” In a 2018 Pew survey of European countries, respondents in Spain and Portugal were the likeliest to agree with the statement that “Jews always pursue their own interests and not the interest of the country they live in.”</p> \n<p>Boycotts of Israel are particularly&nbsp;popular&nbsp;in Spain, which had about 50 municipalities join the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement – a higher number than anywhere else in Europe. In 2015, organizers of a music festival near Barcelona demanded that the American-Jewish singer Matisyahu sign a statement condemning Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. Matisyahu, who was the only artist asked to sign the document, declined and was disinvited.</p> \n<p>Israel-related anti-Semitism is rife throughout Western Europe, but Spain still shows signs of classic Jew-hatred of the religious variety.</p> \n<p>This sentiment made an appearance in 2015, when the RTVE state network&nbsp;aired&nbsp;a radio program titled “From the Inferno — The Jewish People: Propagator of the Satan Cult.”</p> \n<p>The fact that a “vehemently anti-Semitic work filled with anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and slander made it to the Spanish airwaves is seriously troubling and warrants immediate condemnation from the Spanish government,” Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL’s national director, said after JTA reported about the show.</p> \n<p>Yigal Palmor, a senior spokesman for the Jewish Agency and former spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, had some questions of his own following the show.</p> \n<p>“How can a public entity give a podium to this sort of crude, lowly and disgusting racism?” he asked on Twitter, adding “A return of the Inquisition.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Jerusalem is known for being many things to many people, a holy city to all three monotheistic religions and the pulsing heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But while its sun-bleached stone buildings and ancient olive trees imbue it with a timeless kind of beauty, Jerusalem is not recognized as a world-class green city, with centrally located parks and tree-canopied boulevards. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Why, then, would a national park bill here in Israel be so controversial? National parks are no less than the natural manifestation of democracy, enshrining the idea that beautiful outdoor spaces should be preserved for the enjoyment and access of all the people. They create green lungs to hedge against climate change. They provide a meditative pause from the pressures of urban life.</p> \n<p>But in Israel, they can also be exploited to entrench the occupation.</p> \n<p>This Thursday, an amendment to the National Parks, Nature Reserves and Memorial Sites Law moves onto the Knesset Interior Committee on its way to combined second and third final readings. Amendment 17, &quot;Planning for Housing in an Existing Neighborhood in a National Park,&quot; would overturn the long-standing prohibition against building inside national parks. Unsurprisingly, traditional defenders of the environment, including the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, are vigorously protesting it.</p> \n<p>Beyond the obvious sin of subverting the very purpose of a national park, the bill is an offense to the principles of law. Amendment 17 is not intended for all national parks in Israel. It applies to just one: The City of David (Ir David) National Park in Silwan. Why, then, if it is not intended to be applied universally, and if all the recognized defenders of national parks universally oppose it, would it be coming up for a first reading sometime next week?</p> \n<p>The answer to that question lies in the frontline guardians of the City of David – not the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, which has ultimate authority for the park, but the group to which it privatized daily operations in the 1990s, an organization called Elad.</p> \n<p>Elad is not an environmental group or an archeological authority; it has no professional capacity to even compete for a bid to manage a national park (had there been a transparent tender process, which there was not). It is, though, a right-wing settler group.</p> \n<p>Elad is the only entity promoting this bill. Faced by objections from a spectrum of green groups, the group lobbied for a custom-made exemption to fit the City of David alone to push out Palestinians and permit building homes for settlers in a national park. That by itself should demonstrate Elad’s unfitness for running such a space.</p> \n<p>Amendment 17 is specifically designed to enable Elad to expand its foothold in Silwan where, backed by the state, it has seized roughly 75 Palestinian homes over the last several decades. The latest eviction took place last week. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>The City of David park sits just across the street from Jerusalem's Old City, within the Old Walls National Park that encircles it. According to its website, the park draws some half a million visitors every year.</p> \n<p>Visitors include students from throughout Israel, new IDF officers - for whom the park is a mandatory part of military orientation, and tourists from every part of the globe. Those tourists may well be blissfully ignorant about the political complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – even, for that matter, that they are standing in occupied territory, while taking in the sights and purchasing mementos stamped with the ubiquitous golden harp of King David.</p> \n<p>Most tourists are unaware that their guides' set speeches omit huge swaths of civilization and erase any vying narratives of historical connections to Jerusalem. And because most tourists have no cause to go beyond the park, they do not see Silwan, the Palestinian neighborhood in which the park is embedded.</p> \n<p>Amendment 17 conclusively demonstrates that there is not one facet of life in Jerusalem – not construction of an apartment, approval of a road, management of a tourist site or use of a national park – that is apolitical. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Not one of these pillars of urban planning is excluded from settlement building in East Jerusalem, where national parks are valued not as pastoral picnic settings but as tools, by which the state transfers to private right wing organization the power to manage and develop public tourist, archaeological and educational projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This bill is the ultimate symbol of discrimination in planning in East Jerusalem, where a mere 15% of the land is allocated for Palestinian building; and where, in the years since the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1967, 12 Israeli neighborhoods/settlements have been built - but not a single major Palestinian one.</p> \n<p>National parks are often declared in order to prohibit Palestinians from building. Now, those same authorities&nbsp; - who greenlight the Jerusalem municipal authorities to suppress Palestinian development - are promoting a bill to ensure that settlers can build in these otherwise forbidden zones.</p> \n<p>There are already 2,500 settlers living in and managing sites in the heart of Palestinian neighborhoods in the Old City Basin. That Israelization enables Israel to cement its control over the most contentious seven square kilometers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – to the acute detriment of both East Jerusalem's&nbsp;Palestinian residents, and the two state solution.</p> \n<p>Betty Herschman is Ir Amim's Director of International Relations &amp; Advocacyand is an expert on Jerusalem in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

        "text":["<p>The interview with Jewish terrorist Yitzhak Gabai, who was convicted of an arson attack against a bilingual school in Jerusalem four years ago, has been denounced by all of the usual left-leaning commentators, as well as by senior right-wing journalists like Erel Segal and Amit Segal. Channel 20 has apologized, distanced itself from the interview, criticized its own employees and is conducting an investigation. It would seem that the issue is in the past.</p> \n<p>But it really isn’t. There were five Jewish men present in the Channel 20 studio when the interview took place; one of them – Ari Shamay – is a leftist. They discussed what Gabai had done.</p> \n<p>The atmosphere was positively jolly. One could even call it celebratory. They laughed and joked. What Gabai did was extremely grave. He set fire to a school. If the studio guest had been an Arab terrorist who torched a school, those Jewish men sitting beside him would not have been joking with him. They would have been openly hostile and unable to conceal their loathing.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Outcry over Israeli-Arab intermarriage exposes the racist truth about Israel | Opinion</p> \n<p>The atmosphere in the studio during the discussion of Gabai’s crime was like an inside joke among Jews. After all, Gabai is not just a convicted terrorist; he’s a racist. Just like the Ku Klux Klan. On the walls of the school, slogans like “Death to the Arabs,” “No coexistence with cancer” and “No more assimilation” were painted. And remember: Israel’s Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev has called Sudanese asylum seekers ‘a cancer.’ In the Jewish national homeland, which no longer defines itself as democratic, ‘cancer’ is the byword for non-Jews.</p> \n<p>Gabai is a violent, racist ultra-nationalist. In the interview, he said that the aim of his arson attack was to get the Israeli public riled up about assimilation between Jews and Arabs. Israelis are already up in arms over this very issue; just look how they reacted to the wedding of Lucy Aharish and Tzachi Halevy.</p> \n<p>Gabai’s views represent the mainstream of Jewish public opinion in Israel; they are accepted by members of the government and the man (and woman) on the street: Arabs and Sudanese are a cancer, coexistence is unacceptable. And if the current fighting with Gaza escalates into a full-blown war, “Death to the Arabs” will once again ring out at demonstrations – and not just among supporters of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer club.</p> \n<p>The problem that Israeli society has with Gabai has nothing to do with this views, which have become the norm. And make no mistake about it: Any Arab convicted of similar crimes to Gabai’s, or who sprayed “Death to the Jews” on the wall of a school, would have been handed a far more severe punishment than the one meted out to Gabai. For his crime, which was defended by his fascist lawyer, Itamar Ben-Gvir, Gabai’s punishment was nothing more than a slap on the wrist.</p> \n<p>The problem that Channel 20’s management, both Segals and the Israeli mainstream have with Gabai is his refusal to put a pretty face on violent, extreme-nationalist racism. He’s not eloquent. He doesn’t engage in euphemisms. I don’t know whether his opinions are significantly different to those of Segal and Segal. Radical nationalism and racism are a common denominator. So, too, is the desire to see dead Arabs.</p> \n<p>The problem is with the style. Amit Segal appears on television channels which split off from Channel 2 and Army Radio; Erel Segal is about to join the Kan public broadcaster and already has a slot on Radio 103. The mainstream loves his racist nationalism – as long as it’s candy-coated. Gabai, however, doesn’t dress up his racism and even Channel 20 can’t interview him, because he refuses to play the game.</p> \n<p>Gabai is tactless. Even his lawyer – a rabble-rousing supporter of Meir Kahane – was forced to interrupt him and remind him that he’s supposed to state that he regrets his actions. In other words, to remind him to lie. Gabai is not sophisticated; he doesn’t understand nuance; he’s childish and a bit of an idiot. He refuses to pay lip service to democracy. But he is not a marginal or deranged figure. He’s not an anomaly. He openly states what wiser, smarter racists than him think.</p> \n<p>Gabai is not a cancer in the Israeli mainstream. The way that the other people in the studio jovially interacted with him proves that they share a common language, common values and a common worldview. He is the flesh of the Israeli mainstream’s flesh; he is part of its body. But he’s the part that is supposed to remain hidden from view. Suddenly, in an interview on Channel 20, he burst out. Watching that interview was like watching Israeli society caught with its pants down.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Tuesday marked the start of “freshman orientation” in Washington, D.C., where new members of Congress arrived to meet their colleagues and learn how the House and Senate actually work.</p> \n<p>Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minneapolis and one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, quickly met up with some of her fellow trail-blazing colleagues like Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;As a Muslim woman, Ilhan Omar’s 'as-salaam aleikum' made me uncomfortable&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>But back at home, many of her Jewish constituents were grappling with remarks her office made on Sunday to a website called MuslimGirl, claiming that Omar supported the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel.</p> \n<p>This seemed like a bait-and-switch to many Jewish Minnesotans: When she was asked at an August primary debate held in a synagogue to specify “exactly where you stand” on BDS, Omar said that BDS was “not helpful in getting that two-state solution” — never explaining that she in fact supported the policy.</p> \n<p>“She’s either misrepresenting or misunderstanding. And I hope to be able to have a dialogue with her that clarifies which of those is the nature of her stance,” said Rabbi Avi Olitzky of Beth El Synagogue, which hosted the debate.</p> \n<p>However, he added, “Just as I have with all of our previous elected officials, I hope to be able to continue a dialogue once Congresswoman-elect Omar is in office. However, this starts her tenure off on the wrong foot.”</p> \n<p>Omar’s office did not respond to an interview request.</p> \n<p>It’s unclear why Omar and her team decided to come forward about BDS stance now, after the election but before she is sworn in and can vote on the issue. Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez, who were both criticized for their statements on Israel during their campaigns, do not appear to have said anything on the subject since their general election victories last week.</p> \n<p>Omar, a former Somali refugee who became a community activist and then a member of the state House, appears to be the first member (or future member) of Congress to publicly support the BDS movement.</p> \n<p>She cruised to general election victory in November in a district, Minnesota’s 5th, that hasn’t voted for a Republican since 1962. The district encompasses Minneapolis and some of its suburbs, including St. Louis Park, which has a large Jewish population. The seat opened up when 12-year incumbent Rep. Keith Ellison — who had faced criticism from some Jewish groups for his pro-Palestinian votes and past ties with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, but had a good working relationship with local Jewish institutions — announced he was running for state Attorney General, which he was also elected to last week.</p> \n<p>Omar, currently in her first term in the state House, was seen as one of the front-runners in the district primary of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (Minnesota’s version of the Democratic Party). But some in the Jewish community were concerned about her past comments about Israel. During a 2012 war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Omar tweeted: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” Many saw this as repeating anti-Semitic tropes about Jews using magic to control world events.</p> \n<p>When a Twitter user, citing her 2012 tweet, called her a “Jew hater” in May 2018, during her primary campaign, she replied: “Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Don't expect Democrats to obstruct Trump’s pro-Israel policies – or punish Netanyahu | Opinion</p> \n<p>Omar also voted in 2017 against a bill that would bar the state government from contracting with companies that engage in BDS; it passed with large bipartisan majorities and was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton, but was opposed by the ACLU and other organizations on free speech grounds.</p> \n<p>During the primary debate, held before a capacity crowd at Beth El about a week before the election, Omar never mentioned that she was not only a defender of the right to boycott but a supporter of boycotts herself. “I believe right now with the BDS movement, it’s not helpful in getting that two-state solution,” she said in response to being asked “exactly where you stand on” BDS. “I think the particular purpose for [BDS] is to make sure that there is pressure, and I think that pressure really is counteractive. Because in order for us to have a process of getting to a two-state solution, people have to be willing to come to the table and have a conversation about how that is going to be possible and I think that stops the dialogue.”</p> \n<p>But in the article published Sunday, titled “Ilhan Omar: Why Advocating for Palestine is Not Anti-Semitic,” MuslimGirl reported that Omar’s campaign told them: “Ilhan believes in and supports the BDS movement, and has fought to make sure people’s right to support it isn’t criminalized. She does however, have reservations on the effectiveness of the movement in accomplishing a lasting solution.”</p> \n<p>Omar was called out on this discrepancy in a text exchange with Lonny Goldsmith, the editor of the local Jewish news organization TC Jewfolk. Goldsmith published the exchange on his site.</p> \n<p>“My position has always been the same,” Omar texted Goldsmith. “I believe and supports the BDS movement, and have fought to make sure people right to support it isn’t criminalized, re: my vote against the Anti-BDS bill. I do however, have reservations on effectiveness of the movement in accomplishing a lasting solution. Which is what I believe I said at the forum.”</p> \n<p>Omar denied that not explicitly saying she supported BDS at the debate was an act of political expediency, saying that she ran an “unapologetic” race.</p> \n<p>The moderator “didn’t ask for a yes or no answer,” Omar wrote.</p> \n<p>“She asked for your stance on it,” Goldsmith replied. “She also asked you specify ‘exactly where you stand on that.’ That was an opportunity to say you supported it.”</p> \n<p>The text thread ended there.</p> \n<p>Omar won her primary with 48 percent of the vote; the second-place finisher got 30 percent. She then won the general election 78-22 percent.</p> \n<p>“Anecdotally, a lot of my peers who claim to be supporters of Israel are the same people who voted for Ilhan,” said Margarita Lyadova, a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota, which is mostly based in the 5th district.</p> \n<p>According to exit polling, “the top priorities of Jewish voters are domestic issues,” explained Halie Soifer, the executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, which pointedly refused to endorse Omar. She also noted that 79 percent of Jewish voters supported Democrats.</p> \n<p>Many Jewish Minnesotans reached by the Forward said they were not surprised by the news, but still disappointed in Omar.</p> \n<p>“I think she clearly danced around the question” at the debate, said Aaron Baumgarten, a business analyst originally from St. Louis Park who voted absentee. “I would bet that being at a synagogue, at an event hosted by Jewish groups, was the reason for not being open about her stance.”</p> \n<p>“I think she should have” been explicit, said Beth Gendler, the executive director of the National Council of Jewish Women-Minnesota, which co-sponsored the Beth El event. “I think we all look for honesty in our candidates.”</p> \n<p>She added that NCJW has worked with Omar in her capacity as a state legislator on progressive policy priorities, and Gendler said they hope to continue to do so.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The Women’s March anti-Semitism controversy threatening the movement's future | Explained</p> \n<p>“We’re troubled by her support of BDS, and we want to maintain our working relationship with her as a member of Congress,” she said. “We need each other.”</p> \n<p>The Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas sounded a similar theme.</p> \n<p>“The BDS movement seeks to deny the Jewish people our right to self-determination and is indeed counteractive to a goal that both the JCRC and Rep. Omar support: a two-state solution that recognizes, in Rep. Omar’s words: ‘Israel’s place in the Middle East and the Jewish people’s rightful place in the region.’ The JCRC looks forward to working and building dialogue with Representative-elect Omar on this mutual goal,” executive director Steve Hunegs said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Of course, not everybody in the community was displeased.</p> \n<p>“I was thrilled to hear that Ilhan Omar supports the BDS movement and that she is committed to making sure that people’s constitutional right to boycott is protected,” Shay Berkowitz, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace and a state party delegate, told the Forward via Facebook. She added that Omar will be “a much-needed bold and courageous voice in Congress.”</p> \n<p>National Jewish political groups also wanted to respond. Representatives of the JDCA and the Republican Jewish Coalition (where, full disclosure, I interned for a college semester) both said they were “not surprised” by the Omar news.</p> \n<p>“We made a statement denouncing her position in August,” Soifer said. “We were very clear about where she stood.”</p> \n<p>But Soifer also argued that Omar, Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez were “outside the mainstream” of the party.&nbsp; “By the end of this [election cycle], we’ll have picked up almost 40 seats, we’ll have 230 Democratic House members. 99.9 percent of them don’t share those views.”</p> \n<p>RJC national spokesman Neil Straus said that was a “Pollyanna-ish view,” citing many more members of Congress who he said harbored anti-Semitic sentiments.</p> \n<p>“You have Hank Johnson, who calls Israelis termites. You have Andre Carson, who freely associates with Louis Farrakhan…Democrats who associate with the Women’s March. Alyssa Milano and Debra Messing, they’re far from right-wing spokespeople. They recognize the Women’s March for what it is, but Kirsten Gillibrand doesn’t, somehow. Cory Booker doesn’t, somehow.”</p> \n<p>Israeli-Palestinian issues are not likely to play a large role in Omar’s life in the House, especially since staunchly pro-Israel Democrats will hold the party’s top positions and chair the House committees that would control the progress of most Israel-related legislation.</p> \n<p>While Lyadova said she was “disappointed” in Omar and concerned that the news would give support to the BDS movement, which she thinks is harmful to Jewish college students, she tried to look at the bigger picture.</p> \n<p>“She was elected to work for the state of Minnesota, and her stance on Israel in no way makes better or worse her capacity to do good work for Minnesota,” Lyadova said. “She can still do great work and not like Israel.”</p> \n<p>For more stories, go to www.forward.com.

        "text":["<p>The official trailer for “The Girl in the Spider’s Web” opens with the scene that appears at the beginning of the film. A bleeding, frightened woman sits on the floor, and a man standing above her says, “Sorry I said those things. You know how much I love you.” Suddenly a woman dressed in black appears. “I’m a fan of yours,” she says to the appalled man. “A CEO who beat up two prostitutes, but then got acquitted in court yesterday.”</p> \n<p>The two are obviously not evenly matched – the next thing the man knows, he’s hanging upside-down from the ceiling. The woman in black transfers all his money to the women he attacked and to his wife, and for dessert she subjects his penis to an electric shock. In the latest film adaptation of the “Millennium” bestsellers, the character of Lisbeth Salander is showcased impressively as an avenger in the spirit of vigilante movies – which are currently enjoying a comeback. But in short order the picture refocuses on action in the spirit of the standard routine.</p> \n<p>The Swedish author Stieg Larsson didn’t live to see the success of Lisbeth, the protagonist of his books; he died suddenly of a heart attack at age 50, a year before publication of “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” in 2005. That book, which was translated into English in 2008, quickly became a global cultural phenomenon. By 2017, more than 85 million copies of the books in the series had been sold worldwide. In Sweden, Larsson’s trilogy was adapted for the cinema already in 2009, but the film largely missed the latent potential.</p> \n<p>Hollywood’s point of departure (most American viewers aren’t familiar with the Swedish versions) led to a second adaptation of “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,” directed by David Fincher in 2011. In both cases, the actresses who played Lisbeth – Noomi Rapace in the Swedish film, Rooney Mara in the American version – succeeded in transcending the pedestrian scripts and preserving interest in the character of the brilliant, mysterious hacker heroine.</p> \n<p>Hollywood has chosen to try again, although the result is not exactly a sequel. “The Girl in the Spider’s Web” is not based on Larsson’s trilogy, but on a book by David Lagercrantz, who was entrusted with the task of continuing the story of Lisbeth and the journalist Mikael Blomkvist. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Sony Studios chose to leap over the other two Larsson books in the trilogy and plunge straight into the fourth episode – the one by Lagercrantz – because they found it the most convenient for familiarizing a new audience with the story.</p> \n<p>Fede Alvarez got the directing nod after creating a successful fusion of tension and horror in “Don’t Breathe.” The mission of adapting the book for the screen was initially given to Steven Knight, who wrote the screenplay for “Eastern Promises” and created the British television series “Peaky Blinders.” Cast in the lead role was Claire Foy, star of the series “The Crown,” who makes the sharp transition from Elizabeth to Lisbeth.</p> \n<p>Covert violence</p> \n<p>Indeed, prior familiarity with the characters is not essential, as the film is entirely occupied with a return to the sources of the girl and the tattoo. The plot begins with a bitter childhood memory of a violent father and an unknown sister, whom the girl Lisbeth abandons. Subsequently we meet the adult Lisbeth – older than the character played by Rapace and Mara – who has taken it upon herself to seal the fate of men who attack women without suffering any consequences. But the appearance of a scientist, played by Stephen Merchant (creator of the British version of “The Office”), hurls her into a new world of espionage games. The scientist, who has developed a program that is capable of destroying the world with nuclear bombs, is afraid that it will fall into the wrong hands. The plot thickens when Lisbeth finds herself coping simultaneously with the Swedish espionage service, the U.S. National Security Agency and a Russian gang that has an interest in spider tattoos.</p> \n<p>Without getting into comparisons between the books and the movies, it’s worth looking at the differences between the Swedish and American versions of “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,” and “The Girl in the Spider’s Web.” In all three films, Lisbeth and her journalist ally are caught up in the midst of a psychological thriller that’s occupied with the more or less covert violence that Swedish society prefers to forget. They pursue justice, but at times do not practice it in their deeds; they are burdened by the past and their reactions are often exaggerated. Little of this exists in the new film, which has turned into a worldwide espionage thriller, centering around an omnipotent heroine whose gist is action, rife with shootings and bomb blasts.</p> \n<p>The literary material, itself problem-studded, has undergone a kind of distillation so as to leave only what suits a standard Hollywood box-office hit. With Lisbeth already positioned as a central heroine and Mikael as her helpmate, the director and the screenwriter have sloughed off layer after layer, leaving the basic set of qualities that action heroes require: a formative trauma, an impulse to revenge and an army of villains ripe for liquidation.</p> \n<p>But even as an action heroine, Lisbeth undergoes a shift. At the start of the film she is presented as a kind of Dirty Harry and gains fame as “a woman who hurts men who hurt women.” That’s a revenge fantasy in the #MeToo world, but based on rules and codes of action that operate in disconnect from it. All this only intensifies when it turns out that she has to save the whole world within the framework of espionage games.</p> \n<p>Claire Foy does as much as she can with the character she’s been given and is able to preserve some of the vulnerability that stirred interest in the trilogy of novels and in the films. The trauma is identical, but the transition to an action-spy movie alters the meaning. The dragon emblazoned on her skin still gets a host of close-ups, but no longer evokes associations of a psychic wound that will not heal. Now it recalls the symbol of an avenging superhero, such as the “Punisher” or the “Dark Knight,” of a kind that makes it possible to characterize and identify him, and – God and the box office willing – to become merchandise. Although Lisbeth is less interesting as an omnipotent heroine at espionage games, Foy takes advantage of the few opportunities that are given her for forging reminders of humanity. The result, once more, is that the protagonist of “The Girl in the Spider’s Web” is more interesting than the film itself.</p> \n<p>Despite everything, with an adjustment of expectations it’s possible to enjoy “The Girl in the Spider’s Web,” or at least parts of it. The action is fast-paced if not creative, and the tension is sustained, even if the plot is forgotten. The fact that Lisbeth is undergoing a third cinematic incarnation – Rapace, Mara and now Foy – while entering a production line in the spirit of James Bond and Jason Bourne, only heightens the likelihood that we’ll see her again, even if “The Girl in a Spider’s Web” doesn’t fare well.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Jerusalem is a city rife with festivals. Every month there seems to be another art festival. Late last month we had Manofim: Jerusalem Contemporary Art Festival, which this year celebrated its 10th anniversary. It featured dance and performance art, home tours, meetings with artists, a conference on art, evenings of homages and a 10th-anniversary party.</p> \n<p>The main exhibition of Manofim, curated by the festival’s directors, Rinat Edelstein and Le Hee Shulov, is on view for a full month and transcends the festival’s boundaries. Titled “Properties,” it’s set in the Talbieh neighborhood and focuses on the historic layers of the area, its buildings and institutions, the transformations that occurred in its social fabric and its character in the past and the present. Behind this multiplicity is an exhibition that revolves wholly around the wound of 1948. The exhibition is taking place amid hot public debate over the government’s proposed “culture loyalty” law, which would deny funding to cultural institutions deemed disloyal to the state. In short, this is a brave exhibition – and an intriguing one.</p> \n<p>Last year, by comparison, the venue of Manofim’s central exhibition was the Mormon university on Mount Scopus; it offered a panoramic view of sacred paths in both heavenly and earthly Jerusalem. That fine exhibition was held in a tricky space, in which the artworks had to compete with the spectacular view of the city from the campus. However, the show, which dealt with the theology of the city, avoided any direct reference to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – even though it overlooked the Temple Mount – and featured only Jewish artists.</p> \n<p>This year’s exhibition comes back down to earth, and instead of an overarching view from on high presents an in-depth street-level look at one neighborhood. Many of the artists are Palestinians, and quite a few of the Jewish Israeli artists are also occupied in their work with the Palestine question. It’s a disjointed exhibition, without a single space, without a central venue. Its point of departure is a walk through Talbieh, the neighborhood built by the Palestinian bourgeoisie in the 1920s, inhabited by an Israeli bourgeois population after 1948, and currently mostly in the possession of a Jewish bourgeoisie that lives outside Israel. The major works of the exhibition are located in six of Talbieh’s mansions – private homes that afterward became public buildings, or buildings that remained private residences but underwent a change of ownership.</p> \n<p>At first, the route of the exhibition seems to be a typical real-estate walk of the kind that has become popular here, which delights in the size of homes and the stateliness of their facades, the furniture and the wall decorations, the excellent gardening and the clean neighborhood – an urban pearl of tranquility and sedateness. The walk through Talbieh reveals that its tranquility is of a ghostly character, that the neighborhood’s past hovers over its present and clings to it tenaciously. It’s the past of a place that today is a ghost neighborhood, where few of the homeowners live on a regular basis and where many of the homes are empty for most of the year.</p> \n<p>Trespassing and encroachment</p> \n<p>Instead of the smooth language of the aesthetic explanations that usually accompany tours of homes, a sign in front of each structure taking part in the exhibition tells the story of its construction, ownership evolution and current usage or non-usage. These are the opening terms of the artistic exhibition currently placed in each building. The transition between the different exhibition sites, the entry and exit from house to house, do not add up to a thrilling outing among buildings and objects. In the progression through the neighborhood, visitors to the exhibition personify the trespassing and encroachment that formed the historic consolidation of the present serene atmosphere. The exhibition takes the standard tour of properties, inverts it and turns the gaze on its component parts: The properties on exhibit are those of “absentees,” and the absentees are manifested in them through the prism of the artworks.</p> \n<p>The works denote different strategies of manifestation. On display in the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, which is located in a residence built in the 1920s for the distinguished Nashashibi family, manifestation takes the form of historic documentation in an exhibition titled the “Archaeology of the Address,” guided by Tovi Fenster, a professor of geography and human environment. It traces the evolution of the ownership of houses in Jerusalem through an archival work that turns up purchase documents, architectural designs and photographs, alongside interviews with tenants. A similar project relating to homes in Jaffa was presented two years ago by the Zochrot NGO, which promotes awareness of the Palestinian Nakba, and paved the way for the “Properties” exhibition in Jerusalem. Opposite this is a para-fictitious manifestation in an installation by Maya Attoun, which reprises the residence of the last private tenant in the building. Attoun has recreated a room from what remained in it and from materials of her own, without the viewer being able to distinguish sharply between the two. A rhetoric of artworks counterpoised to a rhetoric of revivification – and both existing concurrent with the daily work of the institute, whose staff are ensconced in their rooms as they conduct their research, so that the work of the past melds into the work of the present.</p> \n<p>Matters are less mixed in the building of the Israel Psychoanalytic Society, which was erected in the 1920s by Dimitri Hanna: The analysts suffer less from uninvited visits. But multimedia artist Nadav Assor has laid cables on the walls of various rooms in the building, and with the aid of a listening device the visitor can eavesdrop on a network of monologues that revive the home’s Palestinian past. It’s a kind of mental work of restoring the repressed that the building itself conducts, and as such offers an alternative to the analysis of the individual.</p> \n<p>There are more fine works in the exhibition, and their cumulative effect at the different sites succeeds in breaching the hermetic structure of an art exhibition. At their best, they tell the story of the place, not only didactically but phantasmatically as well. The temptation to wander amid the highly impressive buildings of Talbieh is great – through the eye it’s sweet as honey, but it fills the gut with bitter acid. These really are real-estate properties: mobile populations, people and objects that moved to and fro, and only the buildings remained intact.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Avigdor Lieberman’s resignation as defense minister had been simmering for weeks. When the escalation in Gaza began, beginning with the protests Hamas orchestrated along the Israeli border in late March, Lieberman toed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s line. He also believed, as Netanyahu did, that the conflict with Iran in Syria, which was spiking at that point, was more important; and he was persuaded by the army’s reasoning that it would be better not to have relatively intense military campaigns on two fronts at once.</p> \n<p>The dispute erupted at the end of the summer, when Netanyahu, backed by the army and the Shin Bet security service, began actively promoting moves to come to a long-term arrangement for the Strip. Lieberman expressed objections, at first in discussions behind closed doors and gradually in the media as well. He objected to allowing Qatari fuel into the Strip, to hasty truces after each round of fighting, and certainly to letting in suitcases with millions of dollars in cash from Qatar into the Hamas-controlled territory.</p> \n<p>But Netanyahu did not take Lieberman’s opinion into account and at the same time struck an agreement with army Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot that turned the prime minister into an acting defense minister of sorts. Lieberman himself recently admitted in interviews that he no longer had any influence over policy regarding the Strip.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Bennett's party warns Netanyahu: Give us defense portfolio or we'll quit coalition&nbsp;■&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamas hails defense chief's resignation: We caused political earthquake in Israel</p> \n<p>All of this was apparent this week. Netanyahu aimed to reach agreement on another cease-fire in Gaza&nbsp;despite the rocket barrages and public criticism. At the security cabinet meeting on Tuesday, he imposed his will on the ministers — and then, not content with that, the prime minister’s staff misleadingly leaked that assertion that the security cabinet's decision on a cease-fire was reached unanimously, including Lieberman and the Habayit Hayehudi leader, Education Minister Naftali Bennett.</p> \n<p>Sick of the situation, Lieberman took advantage of the incident as grounds for his resignation. It also came, of course, against the backdrop of political calculations. It is impossible to reconcile Lieberman’s tough rhetoric on Gaza and his forced acquiescence to the containment policy Israel is implementing in practice on the ground. He probably believed that going to elections while he was still defense minister, and with missiles continuing to rain down on the Israeli communities near the Gaza border every week or two, would have imperiled his party’s chances of even passing the minimum vote threshold required to make it into the next Knesset.</p> \n<p>A civilian and a gentleman</p> \n<p>Lieberman became defense minister in a whirlwind in late May 2016. Netanyahu had fired Moshe Yaalon as defense minister following their dispute in the case of Elor Azaria, the soldier who was ultimately convicted of manslaughter for killing a terrorist in Hebron who had already been subdued. It was suggested at the time that Netanyahu viewed Lieberman as another weapon in his war against the elites. The prime minister always had fraught relations with the leaders of the defense establishment. Lieberman, it was argued, would help Netanyahu put the generals in their place.</p> \n<p>That scenario did not pan out. In fact, Lieberman did not lead the charge against the military elite. On the contrary, in his personal contacts with the top brass, he proved to be a gentleman. He also scrupulously backed them up in public. He did not try to constrain moves by Eisenkot, even when the chief of staff publicly contradicted him on the handling of the Azaria case; over the rules of engagement for soldiers facing a wave of lone-wolf terrorists armed with knives; and Eisenkot's opposition to collective punishment in response to terrorist attacks in the territories.</p> \n<p>But by the same token, Lieberman also had difficulty leaving his mark. Like Amir Peretz, another defense minister who came from a civilian background, Lieberman seemed to be perceived by the top brass as an outsider. He did not have the natural authority that is the result of experience and prior roles. The military establishment gave him the same treatment it has given to previous civilian ministers. It embraced him, chewed him up and spit him back out — as if he had never existed.</p> \n<p>The Israel Defense Forces will bid him farewell with the traditional ceremony on Friday. In the days to come, his picture will surely be hung next to the framed pictures of his predecessors, in the hallway leading to the office he is leaving. But in practice, his tenure as defense minister will not leave behind the mark that he had hoped for. He is the defense minister who never was.</p> \n<p>Nor did Lieberman do much damage. Peretz, by comparison, was among those responsible for a terrible failure, the 2006 Second Lebanon War. But Peretz will always deserve credit for Iron Dome, the anti-missile system he approved and promoted contrary to the army’s opinion. Lieberman tried to do something similar with regard to a new missile arsenal, but the branding of the effort didn’t help him and the long-range significance of the decision remains unclear. On Wednesday, while enumerating his achievements at the ministry in response to a challenging question at his press conference, it wasn't long before he got to mentioning the establishment of an Arabic-language website aimed at reaching for Palestinians — not exactly a resounding achievement that will be recalled for generations.</p> \n<p>No personal attack on Netanyahu</p> \n<p>The press conference, like his entire term in office, looked like a frustrating experience for him, despite his usual banter with reporters. Lieberman attacked Israel's decision to allow the fuel and cash into Gaza and accused the government of having a lax policy on terrorism, but he avoided attacking Netanyahu personally.</p> \n<p>In their power struggle, however, he did achieve one important thing: Aviv Kochavi’s appointment as the next chief of staff. That went through despite Netanyahu’s delaying tactics, as Lieberman took advantage of the prime minister’s visit to Oman.</p> \n<p>The appointment hasn’t yet been approved by the appointment committee that is to consider it or the cabinet, but there appears to be no chance that Netanyahu will try to sabotage it now. On the other hand, the question regarding a new deputy chief of staff will be reopened. Netanyahu tried to press for the appointment of Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir, but Lieberman opposed it, and the issue has not been settled.</p> \n<p>The more important and burning question is who Lieberman’s successor will be. Netanyahu will have difficulty, in practice and politically, to hold three portfolios simultaneously — the premiership, foreign minister and defense minister. Naftali Bennett, who still regrets not standing firm on his demand for the post in 2016, hastened to announce that he wants the job. Bennett may be forced on Netanyahu to keep the coalition alive, albeit on artificial respiration, for a few more months, even with 61 Knesset members (out of 120), but obviously that’s the last thing the prime minister would want.</p> \n<p>Another possibility over which rumors have been swirling is that former chief of staff Benny Gantz will be appointed to the post. The move would be the political equivalent of a checkmate. Gantz is a key anchor in the hopes the opposition is nurturing about a lineup that could run against Netanyahu in the next election. He is also perceived as statesmanlike and unbiased. On the other hand, Gantz wouldn’t make it easier in any way for Netanyahu to manage a coalition of 61 and would also leave other contenders for the position feeling frustrated.</p> \n<p>The bottom line is that Netanyahu has to mull over the situation and has some complicated political maneuvering to do. The top army brass will be watching the situation, but it is hard to say that Lieberman's departure leaves the same sense of shock and anxiety as was caused by the dismissal of Yaalon two and a half years ago. The generals have gotten used to it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>An outbreak of measles in Israel has reached ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods in the U.S.</p> \n<p>In recent days, media outlets have reported on the dramatic rise in cases of measles in Haredi communities in New York and New Jersey.</p> \n<p>The outbreak has raised severe concerns for the councils and leaders of these communities, and has caused panic among parents from neighborhoods where vaccination rates have been low.</p> \n<p>In some of these communities, steps have been taken to control the outbreak, including imposing excommunication on those who refuse to vaccinate; prohibiting whomever does not vaccinate their children from attending synagogue; and restricting unvaccinated school children from attending educational institutions.</p> \n<p>Media reports are tying the outbreak in Haredi communities in the U.S. to cases of measles in Israel. The reports highlight the lethal case of a toddler who died in Jerusalem over a week ago.</p> \n<p>Since the beginning of the year, 1,401 cases of measles have been diagnosed in Israel, according to the Israeli Health Ministry. The most major outbreaks have been in Jerusalem, Beit Shemesh and the West Bank settlement of Betar Ilit, comprising about 60 percent of all of the cases nationwide. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>In response to the measles outbreak, Israeli heath officials have launched a vaccination drive aimed at boosting the vaccination rate among the country's ultra-Orthodox population from 55 percent to 95 percent, similar to the Israeli population as a whole.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; N.Y. warns of measles outbreak in Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community</p> \n<p>Also last week, 11 new cases of measles were reported among babies and children, from the age of seven months to four years old, in the Hasidic communities of Williamsburg and Borough Park in Brooklyn, bringing the number of such cases to 17.</p> \n<p>In the wake of the outbreak, the New York State Department of Health is cautioning Brooklyn's Haredi communities and calling on parents to vaccinate their children. “Parents opposed to vaccination against measles and other diseases are not only putting their own children at risk, but endangering other children and families,” said New York City Councilmember Mark Levine, who also serves as the Chair of Council Committee on Health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Fifty cases of measles have been reported by Yeshiva World News (YWN) in the Haredi communities in Monsey, Spring Valley, and New Square, in Rockland County, N.Y. Two children have been hospitalized.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Local councils are taking precautionary measures so that the disease does not continue to spread among children. At the Vizhnitz girls’ school, Vizhnitz Monsey, it was decided that unvaccinated pupils will not be admitted to school in the next 21 days. The school clarified that they will not accept those who are unvaccinated due to religious or ideological considerations: “Religious exemptions will not be recognized during the measles outbreak.”</p> \n<p>According to the report, Rockland County is also at stake. Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert announced that for schools in New Square, known as the first all-Hasidic village founded in the U.S., all unvaccinated children or babies who have yet to be vaccinated should stay home for 21 days since the first case of measles was reported in the county.</p> \n<p>Several of the synagogues in the county announced to worshippers that whoever is not vaccinated will not be permitted entry. As a result, many Haredi families have checked the vaccination histories of their children.</p> \n<p>In recent days, approximately 2,000 people from these Haredi communities have been vaccinated.</p> \n<p>In Lakewood, N.J., home to the Lakewood Yeshiva, one of the two largest yeshivas in the world, at least four cases of measles have been diagnosed, according to reports. These cases were enough to cause alarm within the community and its councils. Hundreds of children were brought to pediatricians in recent days for vaccination after the reports. The county's Health Department, in cooperation with New Jersey’s Emergency Health Services (EMS), set up large medical tents equipped with approximately 1,500 vaccines. At least six schools and synagogues announced unvaccinated children and worshippers would not be allowed to enter.</p> \n<p>Low rates of vaccination</p> \n<p>The source of the outbreak in Haredi communities has been associated with Israel and the reciprocal visits to Israel and the U.S., by those who are unvaccinated and exposed to the disease, or had infected others.</p> \n<p>According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, the New York State Department of Health asserts that the first three cases of infection in New York were children who had visited Israel. “As Israel and other countries are facing outbreaks, the risk of measles acutely influences our communities in New York, especially in neighborhoods in which international travel is popular and frequent,” said Levine, adding “I highly recommend to all parents in the city to tend to their children and complete all recommended vaccinations.”</p> \n<p>To counter this, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene enlisted community figures to encourage families to get the&nbsp;Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine (MMR). Those who were enlisted include Rabbi David Niederman, president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn, and&nbsp;Rabbi Avi Greenstein, executive director of the Boro Park Jewish Community Council. “It says in the Torah ‘V’nishmartem Meod L’nafshoseichem,’ that a person must guard their health,” Niederman said in the DOHMH news release. “It is abundantly clear on the necessity for parents to ensure that their children are vaccinated, especially from measles.”</p> \n<p>Reports appearing in the U.S. are disseminating data, which has been published recently in Israel, and emphasizing the many cases in Jerusalem, as well as the low rates of vaccination in Haredi neighborhoods. &nbsp;Prior to the outbreak, it was about 50%.</p> \n<p>The rates of vaccination in Haredi communities in New York are low. According to a report in Newsweek, studies have shown that the last measles outbreak in Haredi communities was in 2013, which saw the largest outbreak since 1992.</p> \n<p>There are also those who blame Trump for the measles outbreak.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Yaakov Horowitz, a rabbi and educator in Monsey, N.Y., known also in Israel as an activist leading the struggle against child sexual assault in Haredi society, argues in a published post that the U.S. president, through his attitude toward science and medicine, has also contributed to the measles outbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“From my perspective, and after speaking with hundreds of well-intentioned parents who have opposed vaccination for years, the anti-vaccination movement rests on two principles: 1. Diminishing respect for science and research in order to emphasize emotions and feelings; 2. Belief in conspiracy theories. If you follow political life, you know well that President Trump trusts his basic instincts over anything else, over the value of science and the foundation of our government. He also embraces and frequently initiates wild conspiracy theories, and his relationship to the truth is intermittent.” Horowitz considers that the Haredi public in the U.S. is influenced by Trump’s attitude, related everything that has to do with vaccinations.</p> \n<p>Correction (November 14, 2018): This article mistakenly attributed data to the Jewish Theological Seminary, instead of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, and has since been amended.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A website posing as a Harvard University research institute posted Wednesday a fake article alleging a former Mossad chief had said Defense Minister Avigdor&nbsp;Lieberman, who resigned earlier that day, is a Russian spy, implying he was therefore actually fired by the prime minister.</p> \n<p>The article appeared on an imitation website of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, a prestigious research institute at Harvard University. It was first shared by a fake Twitter handle who also distributed it to several journalists. According to the piece, dated November 14, former Mossad chief Tamir Pardo had told a Belfer-sponsored seminar the previous week that he had confidential information according to which Lieberman was a Russian agent and that “Moscow's interests will take priority over those of Tel Aviv for Lieberman.&quot;</p> \n<p>Needless to say, Lieberman is not a Russian agent, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not fire him and Tamir Pardo said no such thing. This was a classic, well-produced piece of fake news whose source is still not clear.</p> \n<p>First of all, the website that the Twitter user posted from is a forgery, and was not an amateur job. The web address of the real Belfer Center is belfercenter.org, while the forged page’s URL is belfercenter.net. The design, however, is identical to that of the original and the links are the same, other than the name of the domain. Even experienced web users might miss this critical detail.</p> \n<p>Both the website and the domain name were purchased from Name Cheap, a company that specializes in anonymous web hosting, meaning that it doesn’t reveal who purchases and sets up websites on its platform.</p> \n<p>The Twitter account that disseminated the fake news, by &quot;Bina Melamed,&quot; is also a fake account of high quality; it was established in 2010 and has quite a few followers. But when you examine the account closely, you see that in all the years it has existed, it has only issued four “Likes.” The followers also look fake – mostly accounts in Arabic or Russian bots.</p> \n<p>Unlike most fictitious users who try to influence a discussion or other users, this fictitious user tries to trick journalists. The user sent the article to numerous reporters, among them Liat Lahav, Laura Rozen, and Haaretz’s Allison Kaplan Sommer, to try to persuade them to write follow-up stories to the false report.</p> \n<p>This method was used against Netanyahu and his son Yair in the past. As part of that failed operation, a fake news site also stored on Name Cheap was built, and an unknown Twitter profile sent Jewish and Israeli journalists a fake article dealing with Yair Netanyahu and his business in the United Arab Emirates. Haaretz journalist Chaim Levinson detected that scam, limiting its spread, but there were some journalists who bought it. This time, the quality of the fake profile was higher.</p> \n<p>In this case as well, it was journalists’ vigilance that blocked the fake news from going far. The big question is who was behind it. As of now, all efforts to find out who is behind the fake website and Twitter profile have failed.</p> \n<p>Ran Bar-Zik is a developer at OATH and writes at internet-israel.com</p>",

        "text":["<p>France’s most violent urban riot in more than a decade engulfed some of central Paris on Saturday as “yellow jacket” activists torched cars, smashed windows, looted stores and tagged the Arc de Triomphe with multi-colored graffiti.</p> \n<p>Protesters angry about rising taxes and the high cost of living clashed with French riot police, who closed off some of the city’s most popular tourist areas and fired tear gas and water cannon as they tried to quell the mayhem in the streets. At least 110 people were injured.</p> \n<p>French President Emmanuel Macron denounced the violence from the G-20 summit in Argentina, saying those who attacked police and vandalized the Arc de Triomphe will be “held responsible for their acts.” He said he will hold an emergency government meeting Sunday on the protests.</p> \n<p>(Violence) has nothing to do with the peaceful expression of a legitimate anger” and “no cause justifies” attacks on police or pillaging stores and burning buildings, Macron said in Buenos Aires. He refused to answer any questions from journalists about the situation in Paris.</p> \n<p>It was the third straight weekend of clashes in Paris involving activists dressed in the fluorescent yellow vests of a new protest movement and the worst urban violence since at least 2005. The scene contrasted sharply with other protests in France, where demonstrations and road blockades elsewhere were largely peaceful Saturday.</p> \n<p>The violence is Macron’s biggest challenge so far as president, and even colored his international image as he had to defend his plans for fuel tax rises — the initial impetus for the protest movement — to other leaders at the G-20 summit. France’s failure to quell the anger has led to copycat yellow jacket movements in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>Thousands of French police were deployed to try to contain the violence, which began Saturday morning near the Arc de Triomphe and continued well after dark. Paris police said at least 110 people, including 20 police officers, were injured in the violent protests and 224 others were arrested.</p> \n<p>Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, speaking on French television channel TF1, said one protester was in a life-threatening condition after being part of a group pulling down a metal fence at the Tuileries gardens. A video on social media shows the heavy fence falling on some protesters.</p> \n<p>By the afternoon, clashed continued down several streets popular with tourists. Pockets of demonstrators built makeshift barricades in the middle of Paris streets, lit fires, torched cars and trash cans, threw rocks at police and smashed and looted stores.</p> \n<p>Some demonstrators removed the barriers protecting the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I under the Arc de Triomphe monument to pose near its eternal flame and sing the national anthem. An Associated Press reporter at the scene saw other protesters and a soldier intervene to disperse the troublemakers and protect the flame. Police later fired tear gas in the area.</p> \n<p>Graffiti sprayed onto the Arc de Triomphe read: “yellow jackets will triumph.”</p> \n<p>By Saturday afternoon, a large part of central Paris was locked down by police, with all roads leading away from the Arc closed off as more police moved in. Over 20 downtown Paris metro stations were closed for security reasons and police ordered stores in nearby neighborhoods to close early Saturday evening.</p> \n<p>Hours later, some cars still smoldered and law enforcement and protesters were still facing off elsewhere in the capital.</p> \n<p>French television showed police leading a shaken woman away from the protesters, and loud bangs rang out near the famed Champs Elysees Avenue where the violence was centered.</p> \n<p>Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo tweeted her “indignation” and “deep sadness” at the destruction and clashes with police, saying that violence is “not acceptable.”</p> \n<p>In addition to rising taxes, the demonstrators are furious about Macron’s leadership, saying that his government does not care about the problems of ordinary people. The grassroots protests began with motorists upset over a fuel tax hike, but now involve a broad range of demands related to France’s high cost of living.</p> \n<p>The violence in Paris, however, suggests that some protests appear to have been taken over by more radical far-right or far-left groups.</p> \n<p>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen urged the protesters to go home in a tweet.</p> \n<p>French authorities said they counted 75,000 protesters Saturday across the country, including 5,500 in Paris, numbers that were less than last week’s protest but produced much more destruction.</p> \n<p>Earlier Saturday, several hundred peaceful protesters in Paris passed through police checkpoints to reach the Champs-Elysees. They marched on the famed avenue behind a big banner that read “Macron, stop taking us for stupid people.”</p> \n<p>Access to the Champs-Elysees was closed to cars and strictly monitored by police with identity checks and bag inspections.</p> \n<p>“It’s difficult to reach the end of the month. People work and pay a lot of taxes and we are fed up,” said Rabah Mendez, a protester who came from a southern suburb to march peacefully in Paris.</p> \n<p>“Our purchasing power is severely diminishing every day. And then: taxes, taxes and taxes,” said Paris resident Hedwige Lebrun. “The state is asking us to tighten our belts, but they, on the contrary, live totally above all standards with our money.”</p> \n<p>Since the yellow jacket movement kicked off on Nov. 17, two people have been killed and hundreds injured in clashes or accidents stemming from the protests.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s indecent embrace of some of the least democratic regimes on the planet is a stain upon his already filthy government.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, he warmly welcomed Chadian President Idriss D&eacute;by – a leader who, on Election Day in 2016, cut his citizens’ internet access and mobile communications, and whose country is third-from-last on The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index. Among the 52 nations that the EIU describes as “authoritarian,” only Syria and North Korea perform worse.</p> \n<p>In April, Chad’s parliament approved a new constitution that expanded D&eacute;by’s powers and could allow him to serve unopposed until 2033, which would take his tenure to a staggering 43 years.</p> \n<p>On the same day as the visit, it was reported that Israel is actively pursuing relations of some kind with two other “authoritarian” countries: Sudan (155th out of 167 nations) and Bahrain (146th). And as Haaretz reported exclusively over the weekend, Israeli hackers-for-hire NSO offered to sell advanced cellular attack capabilities to Saudi Arabia, which is 159th on the EIU’s list of shame.</p> \n<p>Hailing “the rising status of Israel among the nations,” Netanyahu positively glowed with pride as he sat beside a leader who, according to Amnesty International, has “repeatedly banned peaceful assemblies, and arrested and prosecuted human rights defenders, activists and journalists, some of whom became prisoners of conscience.”</p> \n<p>D&eacute;by’s visit was not a pilgrimage to the Muslim holy sites. It was not a fact-finding tour by a leader who has taken a sudden and unexpected interest in Jewish history. In fact, sources in Chad told Reuters that D&eacute;by’s visit is mainly focused on security issues. Israel, the sources said, has supplied the Chadian army with weaponry and other equipment this year to help in its fight against northern rebels.</p> \n<p>What is most disturbing about the prime minister’s lecherous ogling of these countries is not the pursuit itself. Countries – especially those facing security threats – need all the friends they can get. I understand that. But to parade these relations as achievements, to take such lewd pleasure in them, is unforgivable.</p> \n<p>If such relations are deemed important to Israel’s strategic fortitude – so be it. If we need to do deals with regimes which violate everything that Jewish, progressive values hold dear, then we can at least expect our leaders to have the shame, the moral awareness and the public modesty not to flaunt them. Not to try and turn what could be described as an evil necessity into a national cause for celebration.</p> \n<p>Does Netanyahu think that Israelis are stupid? Does he think we are unaware of the crimes against humanity committed by his new bedfellows? By siding with these authoritarian nations and squabbling with those nations that Israel should try to emulate, the prime minister is insulting our intelligence and our morality.</p> \n<p>Such behavior is shameless and shameful. Israel’s nascent relations with such countries may be necessary, but are certainly no cause for celebration.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Artists have launched a protest against the so-called loyalty in culture bill sponsored by Culture Minister Miri Regev by burning their works in Tel Aviv on Sunday night.</p> \n<p>“Burning Art: Artists Against the Loyalty Law,” opened at Kikar Hamedina. During Sunday night’s action, the initiators of the protest, illustrator Zeev Engelmayer and artist Oren Fischer called on artists who work with materials to come and burn their works, “to sacrifice them as victims of the loyalty law,” or alternately to come to the square to display them.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“This law will lead to art in the service of the government and to creators beginning to take ‘the agenda’ into account,” said Engelmayer, creator of the cartoon character Shoshke, at the opening. “Filmmakers are starting to think about whether it pays to make a film. Any criticism is deemed unpatriotic. … We are at the start of a slippery slope that will lead us to disaster. If we don’t band together and start to fight the situation now, it will be too late. Art cannot exist without an independent agenda. The moment someone dictates to you, it is no longer art, but propaganda.” After his speech, Engelmayer set alight a version of Shoshke.</p> \n<p>Author Amir Harash burned his work, “The World Would be Lost,” while declaring, “In a place where books aren’t burned, they don’t read books.” Artist Oren Fisher burned the book “Max and Moritz,” for which he illustrated a cover that was displayed in his one-man show. “The book is full of innocence, it’s an emotional story about compassion – a book that I won’t be able to display because it’s against what the government is trying to advance,” he said, to explain why he was burning it.</p> \n<p>Artist, lecturer and curator Shahar Sarig said he was planning to burn his painting, “Jews Together at a Bar Mitzvah.” He said the work from 2008 constituted a landmark in his career, which is why he chose to burn it. “It’s from an exhibition that dealt with Judaica and Jewish Art from the 19th century, like Modigliani, and sought to show that one could deal with Judaica today,” Sarig explained. “The painting demonstrates the belief that there can be dialogue, and I’m burning it because personally, I’ve lost more of my faith in systems because of the law.”</p> \n<p>Artist Sigalit Landau will display her work, “Jepththa’s Daughter” (a temporary name), which is not going to be burned; it will be shown in a group exhibition called “Athens in Tel Aviv” that’s opening Thursday at the Neve Schechter Gallery in Tel Aviv. The sculpture, 2.5 meters high, was just finished on Sunday; its name comes from the biblical figure known only by the name of her father, the judge Jepththa from Gilead, and who was sacrificed because of a vow her father had made.</p> \n<p>She connected her work to the protest. “We are sacrificing culture for politics,” she said. “These are people who don’t understand culture and how much love is needed to bring something into the world.”</p>",

The group brings not only experience, “but a philosophy of government,” said David Axelrod... “This is a group that has really seen it all,” said Eric Lesser, a former Obama White House aide who is now a state senator in Massachusetts. “They’re just not going to be intimidated.”  &quot;A pair of them, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, have previously tussled with Congress. Ms. Slotkin, a former C.I.A. officer who served three tours of duty in Iraq and informed the nation’s strategy against the Islamic State, appeared before the Senate for her confirmation hearing as a nominee for assistant secretary of defense to Mr. Obama. (She also served under George W. Bush.) Mr. Malinowski, who helped levy sanctions against North Korean officials for human rights abuses, was confirmed as assistant secretary of state after receiving lavish praise from Senator John McCain.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Compares Migrant Caravan To Jews Fleeing Holocaust:&nbsp;&quot;New York Democratic Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Sunday compared members of the migrant caravan attempting to enter the United States to Jews fleeing Nazi Germany during the Holocaust... “Asking to be considered a refugee &amp; applying for status isn’t a crime,” she wrote on Twitter. “It wasn’t for Jewish families fleeing Germany.

In the story Mr. Saban is telling, he is about to make a lot of money, and then quadruple it into even&nbsp;more money. Mr. Raz cuts in, astonished. “But half a billion dollars — that’s a lot of money,” he says. “I mean, wow.” “Two billion is more,” Mr. Saban says. “Was money — becoming really rich — did that motivate you?” Mr. Raz asks a moment later. “You know, it wasn’t&nbsp;only&nbsp;money, but it was&nbsp;also&nbsp;money,” Mr. Saban says. “Money is a marker to success.”  &quot;There’s a moment like this in every episode of How I Built This...&nbsp;By creating a safe space for entrepreneurs to share their stories of ascent, Mr. Raz has become one of the most popular podcasters in history...

How have you been processing the tragedy?&nbsp;I’m about to do “Finding Your Roots,” so I’ve been thinking about my family, and how this, anti-Semitism, is our fight. Thinking about the people in that synagogue — 80, 90 years old — and the moment before they die, they hear this guy yell out, “All Jews must die!” That’s how you die. It’s just too outrageous. It’s sad. It’s stupid. It’s ugly.&quot;  &quot;And as another Jewish person, trying to make meaning of something like that is sort of impossible. It’s hard to find ways to feel as if you can help in a productive way and not just consume it and feel bad.&nbsp;Read Viktor Frankl’s “Man’s Search for Meaning,” about his experience in a concentration camp. It’s not what the universe serves you accidentally, but it’s about your proactive way to experience the cards and to navigate them that creates meaning and purpose and satisfaction in life. That’s applicable to all of us, even in our little tragedies. And now, to have this be old news, because there’s been another shooting — you can get addicted to watching. You have to be discriminating about what you receive and how you use your short time here.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  After the Tree of Life Synagogue Shooting, a Russian-Jewish Immigrant Remembers Squirrel Hill — by&nbsp;Ellen Litman:&nbsp;&quot;In Russia, the very word “Jew” was embarrassing, unseemly. You didn’t say it in polite company. Didn’t say it at all if you could help it. If you were a Jew in Russia you tried to conceal it...&nbsp;In Squirrel Hill, Jews didn’t worry about being visible. They knew, of course, that anti-Semitism existed, but Orthodox women in long dresses and Orthodox men in black hats roamed its streets unafraid. The kids from the yeshiva schools loitered on Murray after classes. I’d look at their faces and be reminded of my own face, as if maybe we had the same ancestors, as if they were a version of myself.&quot; [NewYorker]  TALK OF THE TOWN — New York City museums are fighting to keep art stolen by the Nazis — by&nbsp;Isabel Vincent:&nbsp;&quot;There are “tens of thousands” of artworks in US museums with Nazi-era provenance...

Mr. Glassman was deeply active in the world and in trying to address its ills. His activism was as much a product of his Buddhist spiritualism as it was of the liberal Jewish tradition into which he was born; the two remained inseparable throughout his life.

        "text":["<p>Throughout his years as a politician, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would frequently complain about the media’s negative attitude toward him. In 1999, shortly before he lost the prime minister’s seat, he gave the speech where he repeated again and again, “They’re afraid” – referring to the media.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s claims against the media have some merit, but instead of working to improve his public image in the media via legitimate means, it seems that over the years he decided that in order to fortify his political standing, he would need to change the entire media market in Israel.</p> \n<p>As has been exposed in the past, during the previous decade Netanyahu worked to bring in Arnon Milchan and Ronald Lauder as investors in Channel 10; later, U.S. gambling magnate Sheldon Adelson arrived in Israel and invested massive sums in launching the free newspaper Israel Hayom, which is considered Netanyahu’s personal mouthpiece. Along the way, Israel Hayom delivered a blow to Netanyahu’s bitter enemy, Israel’s largest tabloid newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 'Flush your iPhone': The minute this scandal became a Netanyahu bribery case</p> \n<p>On top of his public actions, it seems that Netanyahu found another means to influence his media coverage, in ways that raise suspicions of criminal activity. As revealed in TheMarker, back in 2009 Netanyahu struck a deal with Yedioth Ahronoth publisher Arnon Mozes that would have weakened Israel Hayom in exchange for more positive coverage of Netanyahu in Yedioth. That affair turned into Case 2000. Later, according to the recommendations of Case 1000, Netanyahu intervened in the affairs at Channel 10 in a way that constituted a conflict of interest.</p> \n<p>Based on what was published on Sunday regarding Case 4000, it seems that this is the most serious case yet. Netanyahu didn’t blanch at granting benefits worth hundreds of millions of shekels to Shaul Elovitch and his Bezeq Group, at the expense of Israel’s communications consumers. The foundation for the case began with the 2015 elections, when Netanyahu was re-elected prime minister and insisted on keeping the communications portfolio for himself, in order to “carry out reforms.” He later signed all coalition partners on an agreement blocking them from intervening in his communication-related decisions. These agreements, combined with the weakened checks and balances in the relevant ministries and in the Attorney General’s Office, granted Netanyahu free rein to carry out give-and-take agreements with Elovitch and Bezeq, primarily through his then-crony Communications Ministry director general Shlomo Filber, who has since turned state’s witness.</p> \n<p>The suspicions against Netanyahu in the Bezeq case revolve around the decisions at the Communications Ministry that made things too easy for the company: Quick, perfectly timed approval for Bezeq’s merger with Yes in 2015; the rejection and softening of significant parts of the reform mandating that infrastructure companies including Bezeq sell telephony services wholesale to virtual competitors; and additional decisions that impacted Elovitch’s pocket. The police recommendation states explicitly that evidence indicates that Netanyahu received his favorable coverage from Elovitch’s news website Walla in exchange for regulatory assistance.</p> \n<p>Does this evidence rely on state’s witnesses? Are there recordings of Netanyahu himself? These questions will be answered if and when an indictment is filed.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel and Chad may have a perceived enemy of Jihadi extremists in common — the rationale behind Benjamin Netanyahu’s invitation to Chad’s Idriss Deby to Jerusalem last week and the decision to renew diplomatic ties between the two countries&nbsp;- but when it comes to global attention the two states could not be more dissimilar.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In Israel, even the most picayune matters and conflicts get coverage. Chad, on the other hand, is on the dark side of the journalism moon: it’s hard and expensive to get to, journalist visas are no small obstacle, and working without one can land you in prison alongside thousands of its regime’s critics, a fact that makes people reluctant to talk. Chad’s roads are rough and in some remote parts terror groups are active. Its dark, dusty capital, N’Djamena, is plagued by street crime; at dusk, markets close and most people stay indoors.</p> \n<p>The most recent situation report by the United Nations Children’s Fund states that 4.4 million of Chad’s 12 million people are in dire circumstances, including 1.6 million who need water, sanitation and hygiene facilities. This year, 2.5 million children need humanitarian assistance, with more than a quarter million children under five suffering from hunger. Others maladies include tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, staph infections, and an assortment of congenital diseases.</p> \n<p>In spring, a measles outbreak swept through the landlocked former French colony, taking more lives.&nbsp;Lake Chad used to provide food and livelihoods for Chad and its neighbors. But drought and other factors have depleted it to less than 10 percent of what it was in the 1960s, when the lake was about the size of Israel.</p> \n<p>Raids by Boko Haram, which dreams of a caliphate in neighboring Nigeria, have made it hard for fishermen to fish. Farmers, fearful they won’t be able to stay to harvest crops, have stopped planting. Some 600,000 refugees and Chadian returnees, many fleeing an ongoing conflict in the Central African Republic on Chad’s southern border, have filled camps around N’Djamena.</p> \n<p>Somehow, amid all this grimness, the headline news out of Chad this year was its import of six rhinos to Zakouma, a luxury bush lodge. Two of the rhinos since died from unknown causes; that also made news.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Such is the paradox of extremely poor countries, that in one place you can have mass hunger and in another tourists arriving to enjoy the adventure of a lifetime. Don’t judge them: given the scant coverage, how could they know?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So let us use Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s embrace of Idriss Deby, the man most responsible for Chad’s deplorable circumstances, to call out some flaws that Netanyahu has to know about.</p> \n<p>Deby became president in 1990 with the help of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, displacing Hissen Habr&eacute;, the strongman who came to power in 1982 with American and French support.</p> \n<p>Deby later fell out with Gaddafi, who had thoughts of adding Chad to Libya. Bereft of ideas, Deby relied primarily on revenue from oil. The country, which has little else but some uranium mines to the north, has never prospered, and the collapse of oil prices in late 2015 was devastating. Frequent strikes have included hospital staff, leaving an underserved population at greater risk.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Having failed his country, Deby rewarded himself earlier this year by pushing a new constitution through parliament that allows him to stay in office until 2033 and expands his presidential powers.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s misplaced warmth is a moral question, and perhaps a practical one as well.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Netanyahu’s lewd pleasure in relations with authoritarian regimes is unforgivable | Opinion</p> \n<p>It is impoverished, despotic and failed nations that export the large numbers of refugees and asylum-seekers currently worrying Europe, the Promised Land for Africans. Africa’s problems, so remote and irrelevant, are likely to become ever more present and immediate in Europe and elsewhere. Israel has plenty of its own recent experience with migrants from Sudan and Eritrea escaping harsh conditions there.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Despots like Deby increase global insecurity. They are effective recruiters for terror groups. They create conditions — unemployment, boredom, hopelessness, brutality — that nourish the terrorist cause. Paradoxically, the threat of terror is useful to them, as it has been for Deby, by excusing and stopping scrutiny of performance and keeping foreign aid and support flowing.</p> \n<p>In September, I joined a group of aid workers and volunteers as they delivered nutritional supplements and educational supplies to N’Djamena. One stop was the Mother and Child Hospital’s 31-bed pediatric intensive care unit. Between the stifling heat and the grim scene, it was almost hard to breathe. The scene illustrated how, when a society falls apart, the heaviest consequences land on its most vulnerable people.</p> \n<p>These included a 3-year-old named Ezechiel, who lay on his side, his skin lined and cracked as if there wasn’t quite enough of it to cover his frail bones. Rapid, shallow breaths filled and emptied the sack of his belly. His eyes were wide, his gaze distant and detached. Ezechiel’s parents had left him, and by the time his grandfather arrived, hunger had all but eaten him alive.</p> \n<p>A few days later, unable to pay the hospital bill — fees range from $25 to $175, a veritable fortune for people with nothing — Ezechiel’s grandfather took him away to an unknown fate. Another 3-year-old, Fatim&eacute;, had 1st-degree burns, a consequence of a folk remedy to treat diarrhea by searing children’s backs and anuses with hot irons. The next day, septic shock took her life. Eighty percent of the tiny patients would probably survive, but most would have permanent developmental injuries.</p> \n<p>Such are the tragedies within the statistics, but they are the human equivalent of trees falling in forests with no one around to hear. It is, then, perhaps worth pausing to listen as Netanyahu welcomes Deby, who has led his country to circumstances in which such scenes are too commonplace and expected to be considered news.</p> \n<p>Todd Pitock is a Philadelphia-based journalist who writes frequently on Africa. His work appears in publications including The New York Times, Smithsonian Magazine, Politico and others. &nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON – Two police departments in the northeastern United States decided over the past week to cancel their participation in a program that involves visiting Israel and meeting Israeli police officers, due to public pressure by a coalition of progressive organisations, including a number of groups affiliated with the boycott, sanctions and divestment movement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is the first time in the program’s two decades that political pressure has led to police departments canceling their participation.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The program is managed by the Anti-Defamation League. Titled Resiliency and Counterterrorism, it includes a week-long seminar in Israel, during which participating police officers from across the United States learn how Israeli law enforcement deals with the threat of terrorism. The American officers meet with Israeli and Palestinian police officers during the visit and learn from their experience.</p> \n<p>The opponents of this program, including a number of groups affiliated with the BDS movement and others focused on domestic law enforcement issues in the United States, claim that the program inspires American police departments and other law enforcement agencies, including the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, to adopt harsher policies commonly used in Israel.</p> \n<p>This claim is denied by the ADL, which says the program focuses on dealing with terrorism threats and the importance of community-police ties to successfully deal with such threats.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; This is the real game Israel is playing with the BDS movement. It's terrifying | Opinion</p> \n<p>The program has existed for more than a decade and has attracted hundreds of participants from across the United States. This week, however, the Vermont State Police, which is responsible for law enforcement in approximately half of the northeastern state, and the police department in the town of Northampton, Massachusetts, both informed the ADL office in Boston that they will not take part in the program, which is scheduled to begin in Israel within days.</p> \n<p>These two departments’ decisions were hailed as a victory by groups that have been active against the ADL program. Jewish Voice for Peace put out a press release stating: “For the first time in 20 years, the all expense-paid trips to Israel where American law enforcement are trained by the Israeli military and police have run into a snag.” JVP was part of a coalition of local organizations in both Vermont and Massachusetts that pushed these police departments to cancel their participation in the seminar.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; VP Pence says BDS has 'no place' in U.S. market</p> \n<p>ADL, it should be noted, denied that the trips include any sort of tactical training by the Israel Defense Forces.</p> \n<p>Stefanie Fox, JVP’s deputy director, wrote in response that “the coalitions that quickly mobilized to demand cancelation – and the principled response to do so from local decision-makers – demonstrates the growing consensus that the Israeli military does not offer a good model, not for for the people of Israel/Palestine and not for our communities here at home.”</p> \n<p>In a statement on Friday, ADL told Haaretz that the purpose of the program is “to provide senior American law enforcement leaders with education to enhance their effectiveness in preventing and responding to extremist and terrorist threats and violence. The weeklong seminar enables participants to study how Israel works to thwart terrorism within its framework of a democratic and multicultural nation.&quot;</p> \n<p>The organization also noted that “participants meet with senior officials from both Israeli and Palestinian law enforcement to learn about the challenges that they face and how they overcome them, and learn as well about community resiliency in the aftermath of terror and tragedy.”</p> \n<p>ADL added “the characterization that the seminar consists of tactical, military-style training with the Israeli military is simply wrong. The assertion that American-Jewish institutions are responsible for rising levels of police brutality and racism against people of color in the United States because of this program is patently false, and neither helpful in dealing with the racial challenges facing this country nor in solving the complex Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&quot;</p> \n<p>The coalition that led to the cancellations in Vermont and Massachusetts is currently working to convince other police departments to back out of the program. On Friday, a letter addressing the issue was sent to the mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh, by a group of local activists from JVP and other organizations.</p> \n<p>“Given that the Boston Police Department is under your jurisdiction as Mayor of Boston, we ask that you too choose to cancel Boston’s participation in the seminar,” the activists wrote. “We’ve seen your office take firm positions, time after time, against the racist and bigoted policies of the Trump administration. The people you have pledged to protect are asking today that you continue to do so by saying no to police training with a military force that currently maintains a brutal military occupation.”</p> \n<p>The Vermont State Police said in a statement released Friday that the ADL program “offered an opportunity to interact with Israeli and Palestinian law-enforcement agencies, observe the security strategies and systems Israel uses to prevent terror attacks, and discuss the challenges the parties face in the region.” However, it added, following criticism raised over the issue by local activists, the chief of the state police decided to “withdraw his participation.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Here, in short, are two conclusions from the police recommendations in Case 4000.</p> \n<p>One: For a not insignificant period, the communications minister was essentially Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder in Bezeq Communications. At the time it was in Elovitch’s interest to advance regulations that would cement Bezeq’s monopoly. It was also in his interest to receive several favors from the Communications Ministry, in order to enable the publicly-held telecom firm to buy out Elovitch’s privately held shares in satellite TV company Yes, garnering Elovitch himself hundreds of millions of shekels.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Two: For a not insignificant period – years, in fact – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s wife Sara was in practice the editor of Walla, a popular, influential news website controlled by the Bezeq group.</p> \n<p>This combination is a knockout blow to the Israeli public: expensive communication services, and news media that distort reality and work to keep the public in the dark.</p> \n<p>The police recommendations in the Bezeq case were expected – not due to any leaks, but due to how the investigation was progressing. The media are responsible for how the investigation developed, including in no small part Gidi Weitz’s investigation in Haaretz. Case 4000, which came on top of the Bezeq case, was being pushed forward by the media and the public nearly to the same extent, and at the same time that the Justice Ministry was making its recommendations.</p> \n<p>The Bezeq case started with the Israel Securities Authority, due to suspicions that Elovitch and decision makers at Bezeq illegally advanced Bezeq’s acquisition of Elovitch’s Yes holdings. During that investigation, suspicions arose that the acquisition was made possible because Elovitch knew that he would receive the necessary regulatory approval from the Communications Ministry.</p> \n<p>How did Elovitch know? This is how the Bezeq-Elovitch case turned into Case 4000. The Israel Securities Authority initially ignored this question and what was happening in the Communications Ministry. It hung in the air, and only weeks later did it wind up on the desk of Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit. Mendelblit, who showed great caution in launching a new investigation into Netanyahu, didn’t rush into another probe. A good portion of the investigations was conducted quietly.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;To survive three bribery cases, Netanyahu may push Israel's democracy to the brink&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;Read the Haaretz investigation that started it all:&nbsp;The Israeli news site in Netanyahu's pocket</p> \n<p>When Mendelblit was convinced to take action, the police and the securities authority were given broad decision-making power, including backing to strike deals with two state’s witnesses. One was with Communications Ministry director general Shlomo Filber, and the second was with the Netanyahus’ communications adviser Nir Hefetz. The two, along with plenty of additional evidence, answer the question of how Elovitch knew he’d get regulatory approval. Filber allegedly worked on behalf of Netanyahu for Elovitch’s good, while the two maintained steady contact.</p> \n<p>The contact between Filber and Elovich was only slightly less intensive than the ongoing contact between Sara Netanyahu (generally via Hefetz) and the Elovitches, regarding everything that had to do with Walla’s coverage of the Netanyahus.</p> \n<p>The police recommendations do not oblige the state prosecution to act. A decision to issue an indictment, if it comes, is up to Mendelblit alone.</p> \n<p>Mendelblit has accompanied the case from its beginning, and he ordered the probe only after he became convinced that the suspicions were serious. He was involved in all the decision-making processes, and he approved the state’s witness deals and backed the investigators. Case 4000 won’t conclude without an indictment.</p>",

It is probably not at all clear to the new council members just what that pledge implies, and its legality may yet be contested in the courts, but the spirit is clear: Don’t let too many Arabs into the city, whether or not they are home owners, business entrepreneurs, teachers or students.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Most residents of Afula have no doubt had a chance to drop by the city’s hospital, HaEmek Medical Center, either as patients or as visitors. Without any disregard for that hospital, I would recommend a visit to Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer or Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, after which they should rethink the pledge they have just been asked to make as Afula city councilors.</p> \n<p>At Tel Hashomer in Ramat Gan they will find Arab doctors, including some professors, along with Arab nurses and nurses’ aides, providing the best of care to patients, Jews and Arabs alike. They work with their Jewish colleagues in perfect harmony.</p> \n<p>Some of the best nurses at Tel Hashomer are young Arab women, professionally trained, who leave their homes in Umm el-Fahm at 5:30 A.M. to arrive on time for the morning shift that starts at 8 A.M. Some of the Jewish patients specifically ask for their assistance.</p> \n<p>There seems to be perfect peace and harmony between medical and administrative staff and patients. A visit to Rambam in Haifa presents a very similar picture.</p> \n<p>Both illustrate the great strides that have been made in integrating the country’s Arab population into Israeli society and the economy. This is the result of the great abilities of Israel’s Arab citizens and the opportunities offered by Israel’s economy. This is to the benefit of all – the state of Israel itself and its Jewish and Arab citizens.</p> \n<p>Of course, it is not only in the medical field that we can witness the contributions the country’s Arab citizens make to Israeli society. It just happens to be a stellar example. It can also be seen in the universities and colleges, in industry and in all professions.</p> \n<p>Some of Afula’s municipal administrators may be unaware of the benefits that everyone would reap by having Arab citizens living in the neighborhood. Or perhaps they feel that these benefits can be obtained by keeping Arab citizens away from the city. They are wrong on both counts. They will learn.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: Preserving a Racist Character in Israel |&nbsp;Editorial&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With the giant scientific and technological strides it has taken, modern-day Israel has created opportunities for its citizens to advance and contribute to their country.</p> \n<p>This progress is predicated on opening these opportunities to all of Israel’s citizens – Jews, Muslim, Druze and Christians. To providing every one of Israel’s citizens with a modern education and letting him or her fully utilize their capabilities. There should no difference between Jew and Arab here. Not in Afula and not at Tel Hashomer.</p> \n<p>The fact that Israel is the nation-state of the Jews should not influence this in the least. On the contrary, Israel should pride itself on the equal opportunity in all fields that it offers all its citizens – Jews and non-Jews alike.</p>",

        "text":["<p>What are the core issues in this case?</p> \n<p>They involve the give-and-take relationship between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the owner of Bezeq telecommunications and the Walla News website, Shaul Elovitch. The main allegation is that Netanyahu, in his capacity as communications minister, enabled Elovitch to obtain financial benefits amounting to hundreds of millions of shekels. In exchange, Netanyahu received favorable coverage for himself and his family, along with negative coverage for his rivals on the site. In legalese, the Israel Police suspect a bribery deal, involving regulatory benefits in exchange for positive media coverage.</p> \n<p>How did the affair start?</p> \n<p>It all began in May 2015. Two months after winning another term as prime minister, Netanyahu also became minister of communications. In a declaration to the state comptroller he failed to mention that Elovitch was a friend and that the two had close ties relating to the coverage of Netanyahu on Walla.</p> \n<p>A Haaretz investigation in October that year revealed how that popular news website, which was under the control of Bezeq, the largest communications monopoly in Israel, became a means for offering Netanyahu certain benefits. The investigation showed how, at a time when serious regulatory decisions were being discussed, the website’s management pressured its journalists to promote positive stories about the prime minister’s wife, which were essentially dictated to them by people close to Netanyahu – among them his then-spokesman Nir Hefetz.</p> \n<p>Negative items about the Netanyahu family were censored, and headlines that may have damaged their image were changed. Walla CEO Ilan Yeshua has clarified more than once that the tendentious reporting constituted implementation of a policy dictated by Elovitch. He also linked the lenient coverage of Netanyahu and his wife to government decisions regarding Bezeq.</p> \n<p>When did the investigation begin?</p> \n<p>The investigation officially started in December 2017, when Ilan Yeshua was summoned to give testimony at the Israel Securities Authority. He handed over a raft of recordings, phone messages and correspondence between himself and Elovitch, and between himself and Netanyahu’s people, all relating to slanting news coverage. Even though some information about the nature of coverage at Walla had come up during an investigation of Bezeq by the ISA, this information had not been investigated any further.</p> \n<p>The police and state prosecutors formally announced the launching of the Case 4000 investigation on February 18, with the arrest of Nir Hefetz, former director general of the communications ministry Shlomo Filber, Elovitch and his wife, and other senior Bezeq officials.</p> \n<p>Who are the suspects and what are the police recommendations relating to each one?</p> \n<p>Thirteen people have been investigated in this affair.</p> \n<p>* Benjamin Netanyahu: accepting a bribe, fraud, breach of trust and accepting favors under aggravating circumstances</p> \n<p>* Sara Netanyahu: accepting a bribe, fraud and breach of trust by association (since she is not a public servant, she is under suspicion in conjunction with the prime minister), obstruction of justice and of an investigation</p> \n<p>* Yair Netanyahu: similar suspicions to those of his mother, but no evidentiary basis was found for them</p> \n<p>* Shaul Elovitch: giving a bribe, obstruction of justice and of an investigation, offenses related to reporting to securities authorities and violation of anti-money laundering laws</p> \n<p>* Iris Elovitch: giving a bribe, obstruction of justice and violation of anti-money laundering laws</p> \n<p>* Or Elovitch, the couple’s son, who is CEO of Eurocom Communications (a private company at the top of a pyramid through which Bezeq is controlled) and is on the board of directors of several Bezeq subsidiaries: suspected of corporate fraud and breach of trust, and of securities-reporting offenses</p> \n<p>* Stella Handler, Bezeq CEO: corporate fraud and breach of trust, securities violations</p> \n<p>* Amikam Shorer, Bezeq's chief strategy and corporate development officer: involvement in bribery, and corporate, securities-related and money-laundering offenses</p> \n<p>* Zeev Rubinstein, a businessman who was close to Netanyahu and Elovitch, now vice president of Israel Bonds: mediating a bribery transaction and accepting a bribe (in association with someone else)</p> \n<p>* Eli Kamir, strategic consultant at Bezeq: no evidentiary basis found for an indictment</p> \n<p>* Eitan Tzafrir, former chief of staff at the Communications Ministry: no evidentiary basis found for an indictment</p> \n<p>The two others are Nir Hefetz and Shlomo Filber, who have signed a plea bargain, granting them immunity as state witnesses.</p> \n<p>What is the main evidence that's known at this point?</p> \n<p>Other than the two individuals who have turned state's evidence and are providing detailed testimony, key testimony has been provided by Walla CEO Ilan Yeshua. There is also much material evidence – including recordings, WhatsApp messages and other correspondence by those suspected of involvement in Case 4000, including between confidants of Netanyahu and of Elovitch – regarding the slanting of news coverage.</p> \n<p>There is also some correspondence between Elovitch and his wife Iris and Yeshua, in which they linked regulatory concessions to favorable coverage provided in exchange. According to sources involved in the investigation, the evidence reflects the fact that Netanyahu was aware of the reciprocal relationship between him and Elovitch.</p> \n<p>In July 2015, shortly after approval of the Bezeq-Yes merger, several instances of correspondence apparently implicated the people involved. When asking Walla staff to provide more positive coverage of the premier and his family, Elovitch apparently said something to the effect that &quot;I have to reward him,” meaning Netanyahu, and added that the prime minister had pleasantly surprised him and had done all he could for him. From time to time Elovitch allegedly sought to promote coverage of issues that were important to Netanyahu. One source familiar with the subject says there were hundreds of such instructions.</p> \n<p>What can we expect until state prosecutors decide whether to indict?</p> \n<p>Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit has said that the decision on all of the cases pending against Netanyahu cases will be made in one package deal. This is due to the apparent similarity between the cases, the fact that there are common witnesses and that some of the events under investigation overlapped in terms of the time they took place.</p> \n<p>Since the police recommendations to indict Netanyahu in Case 1000 and Case 2000 were handed down last February, there have been several complementary actions. The tax and finance department of the State Prosecutor's Office believes that a decision will be made to indict in those two cases, but there is a dispute regarding the nature of the offense allegedly committed by the premier: bribery or fraud and breach of trust. Over the last few weeks there marathon sessions have taken place in State Prosecutor Shai Nitzan’s office regarding these affairs.</p> \n<p>State prosecutors now have to file a legal opinion regarding Case 4000. In tandem, Mendelblit has set up another legal team, headed by one of his deputies, Amit Marari, which will render its opinion about the three cases. The legal briefs will be submitted to Nitzan and then to a broad panel of senior legal figures who will review them. Only then will the attorney general decide whether to indict Netanyahu and on what charges.</p> \n<p>Estimates are that this will take a few months, probably until mid-2019. Assuming that Netanyahu will be summoned to a hearing, his lawyers may ask for several months to study the briefs, such that a final decision may be made only in 2020.</p> \n<p>What is known about the testimony given by those who have turned state's evidence? Who are the key witnesses?</p> \n<p>Other than Yeshua, who is considered a key witness, Filber is the most significant witness against Netanyahu. In the past, Haaretz investigative journalist Gidi Weitz reported that a person familiar with the testimony given by the three state witnesses (Ari Harow, Hefetz and Filber) said that none of them has all the information – as Shmuel Dechner had in the Holyland corruption case against former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. However, each of them provides an angle that helps in putting the puzzle together.</p> \n<p>In contrast to Dechner, or to those who turned state's evidence in cases against Interior Minister Arye Dery or against former Minister Shlomo Benizri, none of the current three state witnesses is eager to do battle. They admire Netanyahu, each one in his own way, and do not want to be seen as the person responsible for terminating his political career. Filber has said that he worked for the benefit and good of Bezeq under instructions from Netanyahu, and that he was only a messenger.</p> \n<p>Hefetz described the frenzy that took hold of the premier during the last election campaign and the&nbsp;mission the &quot;boss&quot; gave him: to ensure positive coverage at Walla. Hefetz also said he was a messenger for Netanyahu, charged with slanting news coverage, and was asked to convey messages between other people ostensibly involved in Case 4000, regarding regulatory issues that affected Bezeq.</p> \n<p>What is Netanyahu’s line of defense?</p> \n<p>The narratives presented by Netanyahu and Elovitch are quite similar. Their main thrust is that there was no connection between the prime minister's actions with regard to Bezeq and what happened in the corridors of its Walla news site. Netanyahu’s decisions regarding the communications monopoly were reasonable and were supported by professional echelons. The presentation of news developments at Walla was unbiased, but accorded with the policy of its owner, who wanted balanced coverage.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu emphatically denies that he requested or obtained favorable media coverage, arguing that he was even sharply criticized on Walla shortly before the 2015 election. The prime minister denies that approval of the Bezeq-Yes merger was in any way exceptional, explaining that his approval of the agreement was similar to the signing of any other document passing over his desk.</p> \n<p>Elovitch and Netanyahu say they were unaware of the explicit text messages and apparently intensive phone traffic between their wives, Iris and Sara. Countering this line of defense are Hefetz’s testimony and the recordings he has, which show, according to sources familiar with the investigation, that Netanyahu was expecting Elovitch to serve him in some way.</p> \n<p>Can the prime minister remain in office if he is indicted?</p> \n<p>While the law does not oblige the prime minister to resign in the event that he is indicted, the High Court of Justice has ruled that a prime minister must remove any government minister who is the subject of a serious indictment.</p> \n<p>The usual interpretation of this is that if a minister in such a predicament cannot continue to serve due to loss of public trust in him, the same applies to a prime minister. But unlike in the case of a minister, there is no legal statute specifying who can remove a prime minister from office. Jurists believe this is a complex issue that is not clear cut, which will likely be resolved by the High Court.</p> \n<p>What are the suspicions against Netanyahu in other cases and where do they stand now?</p> \n<p>According to the police, in Case 1000 Netanyahu and members of his family received champagne, cigars, jewels and clothing from tycoon Arnon Milchan, on request and in a systematic fashion, to the tune of some one million shekels ($270,000). In exchange, Netanyahu allegedly helped Milchan in several ways, including by means of tax benefits and extension of a United States visa.</p> \n<p>In Case 2000, Netanyahu is suspected of having a reciprocal relationship with Yedioth Ahronoth publisher Arnon Mozes, whereby the two agreed that Netanyahu would promote a law that would restrict the circulation of Israel Hayom, the main competitor of Yedioth, and in exchange, Mozes would give Netanyahu favorable coverage in his paper. In both cases the police have recommended indicting Netanyahu on charges of bribery.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Montreal-based Saudi activist Omar Abdulaziz launched a lawsuit on Sunday against Israeli cyber company NSO, claiming that the company's software was used to hack his cellphone in order to track conversations with murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As revealed in Haaretz last month, the cyber firm sells its software to oppressive regimes,&nbsp;which is used to track dissidents.</p> \n<p>&quot;The hacking of my phone played a major role in what happened to Jamal, I am really sorry to say,&quot; Abdulaziz told CNN. &quot;The guilt is killing me.&quot;</p> \n<p>The lawsuit filed by Abudlaziz's lawyers in Tel Aviv alleges that the cybersecurity firm breached international law by selling this technology to oppressive regimes, knowing that it could be used to violate human rights.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israeli cyber firm negotiated advanced attack capabilities sale with Saudis, Haaretz reveals&nbsp;■&nbsp;Revealed: Israel's cyber-spy industry helps world dictators hunt dissidents and gays&nbsp;■&nbsp;The dark side of Israeli technology: Six takes on the sale of cyberattack firm NSO&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>This lawsuit comes on the heels of others that were filed against the Israeli firm in Israel and in Cyprus by citizens of Mexico and Qatar.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;NSO should be held accountable in order to protect the lives of political dissidents, journalists and human rights activists,&quot; the Jerusalem-based lawyer Alaa Mahajna, who represents Abdulaziz, told CNN.</p> \n<p>Abdulaziz first spoke publically about his correspondence with Khashoggi after researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab found that his phone had been hacked by military-grade spyware – adding that the software was created by the Israeli firm and deployed by the Saudi government.</p> \n<p>NSO responded to the accusations, calling the lawsuit &quot;baseless&quot; and saying that the lawsuit contains &quot;no evidence that the company's technology was used. Furthermore, it contains details that are not based in reality.&quot;</p> \n<p>NSO added, &quot;NSO is a technology company that is uninvolved with how our products are used once they are sold to our customers. This is a lawsuit based on sensationalist journalism that is unbound to reality in order to create headlines.&quot;</p> \n<p>In over 400 WhatsApp messages exchanged by Abdulaziz and Khashoggi a year before the murder, the journalist describes the Saudi crown prince as a &quot;beast&quot; and a &quot;pac-man&quot; devouring everyone in his path, including his own supporters.</p> \n<p>CNN was given exclusive access to the correspondence between the two by Abdulaziz, who shared the text messages, voice notes, pictures and videos that he had exchanged with Khashoggi.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The correspondence highlights the late journalist's unrestrained criticism of crown prince, as Abdulaziz told CNN: &quot;[Jamal] believed that MBS is the issue, is the problem and he said this kid should be stopped.&quot;</p> \n<p>The correspondence, which happened on a daily basis between October 2017 and August of this year, shows that Abdulaziz and Khashoggi planned to set up an online movement of Saudi youth that would fight the Saudi regime's propaganda on social networks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Making use of Khashoggi's established profile, the pair managed to garner 340,000 followers on Twitter. But in August, two months before Khashoggi's murder, the journalist began to suspect that the Saudi government had access to their correspondence. &quot;God help us,&quot; Khashoggi wrote, upon realizing that the Saudi government knew about their online movement.</p> \n<p>Abdulaziz's lawsuit against NSO comes after a Haaretz investigation revealed&nbsp;revealed that the company negotiated with Saudi Arabia the sale of advanced cyber attack capabilities.</p> \n<p>According to a complaint that currently being looked into, NSO offered Saudi intelligence officials the use of a system that would let them hack cellphones, several months before the Saudi crown prince began his purge against dissidents.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Around the time the report was published, Amnesty International Israel asked the Defense Ministry to revoke cyber firm NSO's defense export license, saying it had been proven that its software had been used in &quot;a series of egregious human rights violations.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>NSO responded to accusations of misuse, saying that their software is fully vetted and licensed by the Israeli government. &quot;Our products have a long track record of assisting governments in preventing suicide bombers, stopping drug lords and sex traffickers, and helping safely return victims of kidnapping,&quot; the statement said.</p> \n<p>&quot;If there is suspicion of misuse, we investigate it and take the appropriate actions, including suspending or terminating a contract,&quot; it adds.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin walked up to&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) at a summit of G20 world leaders, high-fived him and then shook his hand heartily. Moments earlier the prince had been pictured on the far edge of the traditional &quot;family portrait&quot; photograph, ignored by other leaders.</p> \n<p>The two moments captured the dilemma facing world leaders at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires this weekend: How to deal with the crown prince, who is dogged by controversy over the murder of a&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;journalist but is also de facto leader of a rich, oil-producing kingdom that is a major global investor.</p> \n<p>Twitter users were quick to weigh in on the interaction between Putin and MBS. Kremlin critic Gary Kasparov simply captioned the video of the exchange as, &quot;Murder Incorporated.&quot; While satirical account Darth Putin joked, &quot;'Dude! You kill journalists!!' 'Dude! Me too!' 'Dude...' 'Dude.........'&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To be sure Putin's exuberant greeting of the prince was seen as over the top and promptly went viral with many more memes on Twitter. But, while leaders appeared to ignore Prince Mohammed on stage during the &quot;family photo,&quot; many went on to have closed-door bilateral meetings with him during the two-day summit.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;government media office, in a statement responding to an earlier Reuters story about Prince Mohammed being sidelined in the &quot;awkward&quot; photo, said he was standing &quot;in the same proximity to the centre of the group&quot; as in a similar photo at the G20 summit in China two years ago.</p> \n<p>The crown prince, facing a global outcry over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;consulate in Istanbul two months ago, had conversations with at least 12 world leaders.</p> \n<p>Three of them, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron, said publicly they had pressed Prince Mohammed for a full investigation into the murder.</p> \n<p>Saudi&nbsp;Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of Khashoggi's murder. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the killing was ordered by the highest level of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;leadership but probably not King Salman, putting the spotlight instead on the 33-year-old crown prince.</p> \n<p>Trudeau said he had a frank conversation with the prince at a leaders' dinner on Friday, telling him there was &quot;a need for better answers on the killing of Khashoggi.&quot; May said she called for a full, credible and transparent investigation, while Macron insisted the crown prince allow international investigators to take part in any inquiry.</p> \n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump, who has defended U.S. ties with&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia, &quot;exchanged pleasantries&quot; with the crown prince, the White House said. Trump has said it may never be known if Prince Mohammed ordered the killing or not. Sources say the CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing.</p> \n<p>No discussion</p> \n<p>The crown prince also discussed investments and economic partnerships with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Readouts of those meetings did not say whether Xi and Modi had confronted the prince over the Khashoggi case.</p> \n<p>&quot;China firmly supports&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia in its drive for economic diversification and social reform, and will continue to stick together with&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia on issues involving their core interests,&quot; Xi said, according to China's official Xinhua news agency.</p> \n<p>Modi and Prince Mohammed discussed scaling up investments in India’s tech, farm and energy sectors, according to an Indian official and the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;news agency (SPA).</p> \n<p>Before the start of the gathering, Argentinian President Mauricio Macri had said it was possible that the accusations against the crown prince could be discussed when the leaders convened.</p> \n<p>In the end, they were not.</p> \n<p>Days before the summit, Human Rights Watch called on Argentina to use a war crimes clause in its constitution to investigate any involvement by the crown prince in possible crimes against humanity in Yemen, where a&nbsp;Saudi-led military campaign is underway, and Khashoggi’s murder.</p> \n<p>The federal prosecutor's office assigned to review the case had not announced whether a formal investigation would be opened by the close of the summit on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Unlike Haaretz editor Aluf Benn, the paper’s columnists Gideon Levy and Ravit Hecht, and others, I confess that I hate Benjamin Netanyahu. I’ve been hating him chronically for nearly two and a half decades.</p> \n<p>It’s one of the constants of my life. I’m not embellishing this. I’m not only against his polices and am uncomfortable with aspects of his personality – to me the man is detestable. Even though in this era of positive-thinking psychology it’s not customary to openly express negative feelings about others, I can say I feel no shame in my hatred of Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>On the contrary, I see it as something constructive. It’s a sentiment that’s not only required by circumstances, based on the facts, it also expresses something sane and whole in me, something that still cares, that hasn’t given up, that can still imagine a different kind of Israel without him. I’d be worried if these feelings passed.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Netanyahu's lewd pleasure in relations with authoritarian regimes is unforgivable | Opinion</p> \n<p>This hatred of Netanyahu is a vestige of other glorious leftist hatreds such as those against Ariel Sharon helping launch the first Lebanon war and Menachem Begin inciting people in city squares. These hatreds all had a point, but in many respects the one against Netanyahu is the most justified.</p> \n<p>It’s not a dybbuk. The fervor underlying my revulsion toward Netanyahu is bitter, but it’s not based on whim or envy. His character is inextricably linked to his political path, and in both dwell his immense cultural impact.</p> \n<p>I blame Netanyahu for the fact that during his term he has hurt me and at least hundreds of thousands of other sane people who detest him. The wound and insult are mortal, and they continue to fester.</p> \n<p>It’s not only his burying of prospects for peace, his entrenching of the occupation and settlements to the point that serious doubts about the feasibility of dividing the land have arisen – a division that for me and others seems a prerequisite for our existence here as a collective.</p> \n<p>It’s not only his role in the social deterioration and slide into selfish, alienated and violent behavior in a society riven by economic and identity rifts in which four or five classes and communities live in isolated bubbles.</p> \n<p>It’s not only the turning of Israel into an intolerant and racist country amid increasing religiosity, incitement against the left, corruption and an assault on the rule of law. It’s not just the memory, that never goes away, of his involvement in the process that led to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, his complete opposite.</p> \n<p>The thing for which we’ll never forgive Netanyahu is that more than any other leader he has managed to take away our love for our country. We’ll always love it, despite him, but we confess without fear of being branded that the Israel being created in his image is getting harder and harder to love. A love of one’s country isn’t a luxury – it can give you purpose in life. Its absence hurts like a lost limb.</p> \n<p>Even if there were prime ministers who made the situation here drastically worse, even over a shorter period, Netanyahu’s contribution to mutilating Israel’s image and diminising its humanity has had a worse effect, perhaps an irreversible one.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, the ugly Israeli, has made Israel uglier by shaping it based on a culture of lies, spin, deception, cynicism and avoidance of responsibility. He has gotten people used to incessant manipulation, he has hopelessly degenerated people’s ability to think for themselves, eroding our democracy as an arena of well-informed debate. Netanyahu has made us dwarfs; we can’t let this pass.</p> \n<p>It’s not personal. Well, actually it is. For so many years his spirit has accompanied us like a dark shadow. He has occupied and shaped a significant part of our lives. He has stuck in our bones.</p> \n<p>So, yes, I hate Netanyahu. Join me.</p>",

Chomsky told&nbsp;'Democracy Now!' last week that, &quot;Honduras—mainly Honduras, secondarily Guatemala, thirdly El Salvador—not Nicaragua, incidentally—three countries that have been under harsh U.S. domination, way back, but particularly since the 1980's.&quot;</p> \n<p>He continued, &quot;The most extreme source of migrants right now is Honduras. Why Honduras?&quot; Chomsky explained how in 2009 a military coup ousted a &quot;mildly reformist president&quot; and the Obama administration refused to condemn the transition for fear it would have to withdraw military aid.</p> \n<p>Chomsky then explains, &quot;A fraudulent election took place under the military junta—again, harshly condemned all over the hemisphere, most of the world, but not by the United States. The Obama administration praised Honduras for carrying out an election, moving towards democracy and so on.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Now people are fleeing from the misery and horrors for which we are responsible,&quot; Chomsky concluded.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump urges Mexico to send migrants home</p> \n<p>U.S. officials on Sunday reopened the crossing at the San Ysidro port of entry between San Diego and Tijuana, the most heavily trafficked land border in the Western Hemisphere after shutting it down for several hours.</p> \n<p>Trump has vowed the asylum seekers would not easily enter the country and on Monday threatened again to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border, which stretches 2,000 miles (3,200 km).</p> \n<p>The president repeated his call on Congress to fund his long-promised border wall as U.S. lawmakers return to Washington on Monday after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday break with federal government funding set to expire on Dec. 7. He has repeatedly threatened to shut down the federal government unless the wall is funded.</p> \n<p>The showdown on Sunday took place at part of the border where there is already a physical barrier.</p> \n<p>&quot;Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries. Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL!&quot; Trump tweeted.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of&nbsp;caravan&nbsp;members including women and children protested peacefully on Sunday with chants of &quot;We aren't criminals! We are hard workers.&quot; As they neared the U.S. border, they were stopped by Mexican authorities, who told them to wait for permission.</p> \n<p>The migrants who are mostly Honduran are fleeing poverty and violence and have said they would wait in Tijuana until they could request asylum in the United States.</p> \n<p>For weeks before the Nov. 6 congressional elections, Trump raised alarm about the&nbsp;caravan&nbsp;of Central American migrants headed for the United States and ordered some 5,800 U.S. troops to the border to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p> \n<p>Trump has just a few weeks left to push his fellow Republicans who control both chambers of Congress to make good on the wall before Democrats take control of the U.S. House of Representatives in January following their election gains.</p> \n<p>Democrats have urged more comprehensive immigration reform in addition to additional border security, but have fiercely opposed the wall.</p> \n<p>U.S. and Mexican negotiators on Sunday also discussed a plan to keep the migrants in Mexico while their asylum claims are heard.

        "text":["<p>Herzliya Magistrate’s Court on Sunday ruled that Roman Polanski must pay court costs of 20,000 shekels ($5,352) to Israeli journalist Matan Uziel, after the film director asked to withdraw the 1.5 million-shekel libel suit he had filed against Uziel last December.</p> \n<p>Polanski had filed the lawsuit in response to a website Uziel opened in which he called on women to tell their stories of sexual harassment and assault, and was quoted in the international press saying that Polanski had “sexually assaulted five girls and teenagers.”</p> \n<p>In his ruling Sunday, Judge Gilad Hess said the director “had withdrawn his suit at a relatively early stage in the process, before the hearing of the evidence and the summaries,” which is why the compensation he was imposing fell substantially below the 200,000 shekels that Uziel had demanded for legal expenses.</p> \n<p>Polanski’s request to withdraw the suit was actually filed three months ago, but Uziel demanded that the court not simply erase the filing, but to reject it – to prevent Polanski from suing him again in the future. The court accepted Uziel’s request and rejected the lawsuit without deleting it. Uziel added that he is currently working on producing a documentary film in which seven women from the United States and Germany will testify that they had been harmed by Polanski over the years.</p> \n<p>“The courageous decision by the honorable Judge Gilad Hess gives hope to many sex-crime victims and journalists who are being prosecuted and/or persecuted by the wealthy through no fault of their own,” Uziel told Haaretz in response to the ruling. Uziel described Polanski as a “serial rapist who winks at law enforcement, tries to trample complainants through threats and the use of private investigators, and spreads lies in the media. Polanski now tried to make a mockery of the Israeli courts but utterly failed.”</p> \n<p>In 1977, Polanski admitted to having sex with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer in Los Angeles. He was released after 42 days of the 90-day psychiatric evaluation he’d been ordered to undergo as part of a plea agreement. In 1978 he fled the United States, fearing that the judge who’d handled his case would cancel the plea agreement and send him to prison. Since then he has been a wanted man in the United States, which has tried but failed to extradite him twice – once from Poland and once from Switzerland.</p> \n<p>After he filed the libel suit, the Herzliya court ordered Polanski to come to Israel to appear in court, but the director refused.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Ukraine’s president demanded Monday that Russia immediately release Ukrainian sailors and ships seized in a standoff around Crimea that sharply escalated tensions between the two countries and drew international concern.</p> \n<p>The two neighbors have been locked in a tense tug-of-war since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, but the incident late Sunday in which Russian coast guard ships fired on Ukrainian navy vessels near the Kerch Strait directly pitted the two militaries, placing them on the verge of an open conflict.</p> \n<p>The Ukrainian navy said six of its seamen were wounded when Russian coast guards opened fire on three Ukrainian ships near the Kerch Strait and then seized them. Russia said that three Ukrainian sailors were lightly injured and given medical assistance.</p> \n<p>Ukraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko, chaired an emergency meeting of his Cabinet early Monday and asked parliament to introduce martial law in response to what he described as Russian aggression.</p> \n<p>“We consider it as an act of aggression against our state and a very serious threat,” the president said. “Unfortunately, there are no ‘red lines’ for the Russian Federation.”</p> \n<p>Martial law could entail a variety of measures including closing the borders, imposing restrictions on foreigners entering the country, a ban on gun sales, a ban of any political gatherings and rallies and even closing down media outlets if they are deemed a threat to national security.</p> \n<p>An emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council was also called for Monday. The European Union and NATO called for restraint from both sides.</p> \n<p>Poroshenko had a phone call Monday with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to discuss the situation. NATO later said that at Poroshenko’s request its ambassadors and Ukraine’s envoy will hold emergency talks in Brussels later Monday.</p> \n<p>NATO said Stoltenberg expressed the U.S.-led military alliance’s “full support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, including its full navigational rights in its territorial waters under international law.”</p> \n<p>Poroshenko said at a meeting of Ukraine’s national security council Monday that “we demand that (the ships and crews) are urgently turned over to the Ukrainian side” and called for a “de-escalation” of the crisis around Crimea.</p> \n<p>Russia and Ukraine have traded blame over the incident that further escalated tensions that have soared since Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and backed a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Ukraine said its vessels were heading to the Sea of Azov in line with international maritime rules, while Russia charged that they had failed to obtain permission to pass through the Kerch Strait separating Crimea from the Russian mainland.</p> \n<p>The narrow strait is the only passage between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. It’s spanned by a 19-kilometer (11.8-mile) bridge that Russia completed this year. While a 2003 treaty designates the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov as shared territorial waters, Russia has sought to assert greater control over the passage since the annexation of Crimea.</p> \n<p>“There is no doubt that it was done by blessing or, perhaps, even a direct order from the top,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “While planning that provocation, Ukraine had undoubtedly hoped to get additional benefits from the situation, expecting the U.S. and Europe to blindly take the provocateurs’ side.”</p> \n<p>He urged the West to “calm down those in Ukraine who are trying to unleash a military hysteria to get political gains in connection with the planned elections” — a reference to Ukraine’s presidential vote in March.</p> \n<p>A motion to introduce martial law requires a simple majority of votes in the 450-seat parliament, which Poroshenko’s party controls. If martial law is introduced as proposed for 60 days, it will derail the presidential election campaign, which was expected to start on Dec. 30 with the vote in March.</p> \n<p>Some lawmakers lashed out at Poroshenko’s move as an attempt to influence the vote. Polls show Poroshenko trailing far behind arch-rival Yulia Tymoshenko.</p> \n<p>“Martial law in Ukraine would present a wonderful chance to manipulate the presidential elections,” said Oksana Syroid, a deputy speaker of parliament who is a member of the Samopomich faction.</p> \n<p>She noted that martial law was not introduced in 2014 or 2015 despite large-scale fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in the east.</p> \n<p>President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that Poroshenko’s initiative to introduce martial law “clearly smacks of electoral intrigues.”</p> \n<p>“We believe that it’s wrong and dangerous to solve electoral tasks by waving a flag of war,” he said.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters from far-right party National Corps waved flares at a protest in the snowy streets outside the Ukrainian parliament Monday. They brandished yellow-and-blue flags with the Ukrainian national symbol, the trident, and a huge white banner reading ’Don’t back down!”</p>",

The clause is rarely cited in criminal investigations: Indeed, until now, only one person has been convicted under it.</p> \n<p>The recent wave of arrests, a result of an undercover police investigation, is part of a wider operation aimed at Palestinians who may be involved in preventing the sale of houses in East Jerusalem to Jews.</p> \n<p>On Monday, the suspects from East Jerusalem were transferred to the central unit of the Jerusalem District Police, which intends to ask for their further remand in custody.</p> \n<p>On Sunday night, the police extended Ghaith’s detention for five days, and in response dozens of Palestinians protested in, barricading Saladin Street near Jerusalem's Old City.</p> \n<p>Ghaith was previously arrested for alleged involvement in the arrest of an East Jerusalemite wanted by the PA for selling a house to Jewish settlers. Ghaith was released by the Jerusalem District Court, which rejected the police’s request to extend his detention.</p> \n<p>Ever since a public furor erupted two months ago following the sale of a large house in the Old City's Muslim Quarter to a Jewish buyer, Palestinian security forces have been searching for and pressuring Palestinian residents who may have sold property to Jewish Israelis.</p> \n<p>In early November, Border Police and the Shin Bet security service raided the offices of the PA governor in the A-Ram neighborhood, north of Jerusalem, seizing documents and computers.

        "text":["<p>Tunisia’s decision to invite Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for a visit had local journalists up in arms last week. “Inviting bin Salman to Tunisia is an insult to the revolution and its values,” the Tunisian journalists union announced, upon learning of the invitation. “He’s an enemy of freedom of expression.”</p> \n<p>Some 100 Egyptian journalists also issued a statement condemning the visit of bin Salman to Cairo, where he was received Monday with all the requisite flourishes.</p> \n<p>These protests were joined by human rights groups in both countries, while the social networks in Egypt, where he landed on Monday, and Tunisia and Algeria, where bin Salman is also expected to visit, were roiling against the visit of the “holder of the saw,” as one tweet called him, and not just because of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p> \n<p>The Algerian government on Monday was the only Arab government to issue a statement condemning the murder – 53 days after it occurred – but hastened to add that it accepted the Saudi version of events and respects that country’s judicial system.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israel's Iron Dome defense of Saudi Arabia aims to avert collapse of Trump and Netanyahu's entire Middle East strategy | Analysis</p> \n<p>Algeria is angry at bin Salman because he is seeking to lower world oil prices, undermining one of the country’s most important exports. In Egypt, opponents recall the role bin Salman played in the Egyptian decision to return the Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia, a decision that at the time led to violent demonstrations against the Egyptian government.</p> \n<p>But the public controversy over these visits did not prevent bin Salman from embarking on the journey to “purify his distorted image,” as one Egyptian tweeter said. These travels are indeed an effort to boost his legitimacy before the G-20 summit, to be held this weekend in Buenos Aires.</p> \n<p>The tour began last week in the United Arab Emirates, where he was warmly embraced by his colleague, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, who, like bin Salman, is actually running his country.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Haaretz investigation: Israeli cyber firm negotiated advanced attack capabilities sale with Saudis</p> \n<p>Prince Mohammad then flew to Bahrain, whose regime owes its life to Saudi Arabia, after the latter rescued it from collapse during the Arab Spring demonstrations in 2011 by dispatching tanks and armored personnel carriers that dispersed the violent protests by shooting and killing civilians.</p> \n<p>The crown prince needs the Arab handshakes to stop the domestic criticism, including within the royal family itself. He must prove that the Khashoggi affair did not harm Saudi relations with other countries and thus neutralize the claim that the murder has undermined the kingdom’s status in the Middle East and the world.</p> \n<p>He has already received the most important backing from U.S. President Donald Trump, who then praised himself for keeping oil prices stable through his cooperation with Saudi Arabia, which pledged to increase output in anticipation of the sanctions imposed on Iran earlier this month.</p> \n<p>The crown prince is now calling in the debts owed him by the Arab countries for the enormous investment and financial support that Saudi Arabia has given them. First and foremost among them is Egypt, which has received more than $15 billion in aid since Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi took power in July 2013.</p> \n<p>Since then, Egypt had to join the coalition Saudi Arabia established to fight the Houthis in Yemen, return the two islands to Saudi Arabia, and disagree on the question of resolving the crisis in Syria.</p> \n<p>But Egypt also received an important Saudi gift in the form of a commitment to invest billions of dollars in Egypt, including $1.5 billion for the development of the Sinai and the construction of the new administrative capital near Cairo. Egypt and Jordan will also be partners in the city being planned by the crown prince on the kingdom’s west coast at an investment of $500 billion.</p> \n<p>Just as Trump is concerned about the huge $110 billion defense deal Saudi Arabia has committed to, Egypt cannot give up Saudi aid and the development plans it will fund. Tunisia and Algeria are not as dependent on Saudi Arabia, but those countries were being pressured to receive the crown prince by the American administration, which has the power to approve, delay or even block loans granted by international financial agencies.</p> \n<p>Trump needs the Arabs to back Prince Mohammad in order to dig him out of the ditch he got himself into with his complete support of Prince Mohammad and the Saudi version of the Khashoggi affair.</p> \n<p>This way Trump can claim that he needn’t be more righteous than the Arab popes, and that his position is shared by major Arab states, and that it isn’t just because of Israeli interests, which he has already used to justify his support for the crown prince. Israeli interests certainly can’t be grounds for persuading Arab countries to support Trump’s position.</p> \n<p>Trump never explained what he meant when he said last week that, “Israel would be in big trouble without Saudi Arabia.” It could be he was referring to the Saudi efforts to curb the waves of protest against the transfer of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>But it is clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s support of the crown prince has already benefited Israel politically, as reflected in the prime minister’s official visit to Oman, the official visits of senior Israeli officials to the United Arab Emirates and in the strengthening of ties with Bahrain; now it seems that ties with Sudan are the next candidates for an “arrangement.”</p> \n<p>Sudan’s president Omar al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court for the crimes against humanity he committed in Darfur, but he is being rehabilitated by his decision to sever relations with Iran and join the Saudi coalition in its war against Yemen.</p> \n<p>It’s still too soon to say whether the visits of senior Israeli officials to Arab countries herald a process of normalization, but they are certainly promoting a new attitude toward Israel and there is no denying Saudi Arabia’s role in advancing this.</p> \n<p>But the kingdom itself has yet to contribute its full share directly. No Israeli official has visited Riyadh publicly and no official representative of the royal family has come to Jerusalem openly. Mohammad bin Salman wants a more significant Israeli shift in the political process with the Palestinians before he approaches the Israeli border.</p> \n<p>If no significant new details emerge that prove Prince Mohammad’s direct responsibility for the Khashoggi murder, he should be able to overcome the domestic pressures and deflect the proposals that have been floated to appoint him a “guardian” or to block his assuming the throne.</p> \n<p>However, the crown prince has put the kingdom in great debt to both Trump and Netanyahu, thereby changing Saudi Arabia’s historic status as the country dictating Middle East policy.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In a surprise move, the Bank of Israel said Monday it was raising its benchmark interest rate to 0.25% from 0.1%, marking its first increase in more than seven years and setting off a sharp reaction from the capital and currency markets.</p> \n<p>The central bank said it was raising the rate in response to the gradual increase in inflation to inside the government's target of between 1% and 3% annually. It also noted the economy’s “high level of demand” due to a tight labor market.</p> \n<p>“The committee believes that the path of rising rates in the future will be gradual and cautious,” the central bank said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Still, just two of the 12 economists polled by Reuters had forecast a rate hike, while 10 had expected no change at the meeting, which was led by Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg as acting central bank chief. Amir Yaron, the next governor, is due to start at the bank on December 24.</p> \n<p>In a video statement, Baudot-Trajtenberg defended the decision to act during an interregnum between two governors.</p> \n<p>“The committee was very aware that we are in a transition period, a period of changing governors ... but like in all previous decisions, the committee members believed decisions must be made based solely on data and economic analyses,” she said.</p> \n<p>The share and bond markets reacted strongly. The price of the government’s 10-year shekel bond dropped 0.6% to a yield of 2.33% while its inflation-linked bond due in 2045 fell 1% to raise the yield to 1.82%. In the stock market, banking and insurance shares rallied.</p> \n<p>The dollar and the euro both weakened about 0.5% against the shekel in late trading to 3.709 and 4.216 shekels, respectively.</p> \n<p>“The main risk to this is the possibility of a sharp appreciation of the shekel,” the central bank said.</p> \n<p>The Bank of Israel’s base rate has been at a record low of 0.1% since 2015 and the bank last raised the rate in 2011. The new level goes into effect Thursday.</p> \n<p>What made the decision particularly surprising was that at the last decision on October 8, the central bank’s economists pushed back expectations for a rate increase to the first quarter of 2019 from the current quarter due to lower-than-expected inflation.</p> \n<p>“The timing of the interest rate hike seemed somewhat puzzling,” said Gil Bufman, chief economist at Bank Leumi, noting that oil prices had slid 30% in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>While the 0.15-point rate hike is small, it has symbolic importance because it marks the start of what could be called “normalizing” monetary policy after more than seven years during which the Bank of Israel’s base rate was near zero. In practical terms, the impact of the rise isn’t very significant.</p> \n<p>One reason is that economic growth has been slowing, with the pace of the expansion in the third quarter coming in at an annualized figure of just 2.3%, according to a preliminary estimate by the Central Bureau of Statistics.</p> \n<p>“In the second and third quarters, there was some slowdown in the economy’s growth rate, but current indicators of activity support the assessment that the economy is at full employment, and in particular, the tight labor market data indicate a high level of demand,” the Bank of Israel said on Monday.</p> \n<p>However, a slowdown may well prevent the Bank of Israel from raising rates further.</p> \n<p>In any case, an increase to 0.25% still leaves the base rate well under the inflation rate, which rose on an annual basis by 1.2% in October. For now, the real rate remains negative and monetary policy remains expansionary. In another way, however, Monday’s rate hike is a daring act because it leaves Yaron with a fait accompli.</p> \n<p>When the monetary committee last met a month and half ago, two of its six members voted in favor of a rate hike. This time the panel met with just five members in attendance and the balance of the vote won’t be known until its minutes are released on December 10.</p> \n<p>The fact that the increase was approved on Baudot-Trajtenberg’s watch doesn’t mean she voted in favor.</p> \n<p>Theoretically, the vote could have been three in favor by the committee’s outside members with the two Bank of Israel insiders – Baudot-Trajtenberg and Andrew Abir, the director of market operations – opposing. As Stanley Fischer, the former Bank of Israel governor, once noted, no central banker is likely to vote against his or her boss without a very good reason.</p> \n<p>The Bank of Israel Law bars the monetary committee from consulting with Yaron before he officially joins the bank.</p> \n<p>With reporting by Reuters. &nbsp;</p>",

I saw [Chancellor] Sebastian Kurz in Austria, he just held a conference against anti-Semitism, and that’s encouraging.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the interview Thursday, Rivlin told CNN that neo-fascism is &quot;absolutely incompatible&quot; with Israel's principles and values. “You cannot say ‘we admire Israel and want relations with your country, but we are neo-fascists,’&quot; Rivlin said.</p> \n<p>“I meet leaders from all around the world – presidents and prime ministers – and they tell me that sometimes they need to work with movements like these to build coalitions and that although they are neo-fascists they are great admirers of Israel. I tell them that this is absolutely impossible,” Rivlin said.</p> \n<p>According to the president, rejecting neo-fascists movements is a way of fighting anti-Semitism. &quot;The fact that the President of Israel says to neo-fascist movements ‘you are persona non grata in the State of Israel’ is a statement that fights anti-Semitism in a concrete way. It is a statement that makes clear that memory is important and that we will not compromise on for the political expediency of the state of Israel,&quot; Rivlin said.</p> \n<p>CNN's poll, conducted in seven European countries, found that a quarter of Europeans believe Jews have too much influence in business and finance. Additionally, more than one-third of respondents said they have no substantial knowledge of the Holocaust. One-third of respondents also said that Jews use the Holocaust to advance their own positions or goals</p> \n<p>According to Rivlin, the problem can be fought by &quot;strengthening memory&quot; and sticking &quot;to the historical facts, not politicians’ talking points.&quot; Rivlin added that Israel must collaborate with other nations &quot;to fight against xenophobia and discrimination, of which anti-Semitism is a variant.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a woman with political power must be in want of a nasty, misogynistic social media pile-on.</p> \n<p>And according to research released in the UK last weekend, this fate is even more likely when you are &nbsp;a Jewish woman.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>The study released ahead of a conference this week in the UK Parliament on misogyny and anti-Semitism found that Jewish women MPs are 15% more likely to be the targets of bile on far-right website Stormfront than their male peers.</p> \n<p>The venom they receive is particularly noxious, too, given that it combines the hatreds of women and Jews. The likes of Dame Margaret Hodge, Luciana Berger, and Ruth Smeeth – all prominent Labour parliamentarians - are not just c**ts, they are Jewish c**ts, as their online detractors might put it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If Jews are the canary in the coalmine for society, a sign that all is not quite right in the world and that minorities, refugees, and immigrants need to be on their guard, women are the canary for the canary.</p> \n<p>One of the ongoing stories of Labour’s years-long anti-Semitism crisis has been the preponderance of hate and violent rhetoric directed at the party’s Jewish women MP’s in particular.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month, the UK police launched an investigation into violent anti-Semitic threats made against Berger, who had to attend Labour’s Party Conference this year flanked by armed police guards after receiving credible threats to her life on social media.</p> \n<p>Parliamentary Speaker John Bercow told the Sara Conference that his own experience of anti-Semitism, &quot;Dwindles into complete insignificance and nothingness in comparison with what female Jews have experienced and do experience.&quot;</p> \n<p>At a general parliamentary debate on anti-Semitism in April, Smeeth got a standing ovation after reading out her hate mail &quot;greatest hits&quot;. These included choice specimens like: &quot;First job for Jeremy Corbyn tomorrow expel the Zionist Bicom smearhag bitch from the party,&quot; and &quot;The gallows would be a fine fitting place for this dyke piece of yid shit to swing from.&quot;</p> \n<p>For Jews who wish to participate in political life in the UK, abuse is &quot;par for the course,&quot; Smeeth said.</p> \n<p>During the same debate, Berger described how the hate came from both far-right and far-left.</p> \n<p>Four people from the far right have been convicted for abuse against her; after one of those convictions, Berger noted,&nbsp;&quot;a far-right website in the United States initiated the #filthyjewbitch campaign, which the police said resulted in me receiving over 2,500 violent, pornographic and extreme anti-Semitic messages in just one day alone.&quot;</p> \n<p>She went on to point out that, &quot;in 2018, anti-Semitism is now more commonplace, more conspicuous and more corrosive within the Labour party,&quot; and the abuse she's received from the left includes accusations &quot;of having two masters. They have said that I am Tel Aviv’s servant, and called me a paid-up Israeli operative...suggesting that I am a traitor to our country. They have called me Judas, a Zionazi and an absolute parasite, and they have told me to get out of this country and go back to Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>According to the research, members of Stormfront not only hate Jewish women in power, they also see feminism as a Jewish plot, adding to the litany of anti-Semitic tropes that sees the Jewish people pulling&nbsp;invisible levers behind a curtain and controlling the world.</p> \n<p>This, along with the other findings, highlights the fact, often taken for granted, that women are on the front lines when it comes to society’s expressions of violence. Only in 2016, Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by a far-right extremist. Her killer shot and stabbed her in the street in broad daylight. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Anecdotally at least, we already know what this research shows: that women who stick their heads above the parapet are on the receiving end of a horrific cocktail of abuse. This abuse interweaves their identity and perceived weakness with a hatred of women.</p> \n<p>We saw it in the vitriol aimed at Hillary Clinton when she ran for president. We saw it in the barrage of hate U.S. Jewish journalist Julia Ioffe received after she profiled Melania Trump in 2016.</p> \n<p>Here in the UK, we have seen it in the abuse suffered by Jewish women in Parliament and in the combination of racism and sexism aimed at women of color and minorities. Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott, the first black woman to become an MP in the UK, received more abuse in the run-up to the general election in June last year than any other woman parliamentarian, according to Amnesty International.</p> \n<p>Ensuring women who participate in the national conversation do not fear for their lives because they are women should be a matter of urgency, not just for those who self-identify as feminists. And when it comes to those who do, feminists – men and women - need to unite around the need to guarantee women freedom from violence, not divide themselves along lines of identity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Figures released by the UN on Sunday, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, remind us that violence faced by the fairer sex is &quot;a persistent and devastating human rights violation,&quot; as the UN stated. These latest figures, showing 58 per cent of women murdered in 2017 were killed by partners or family members, prompted headlines that home is &quot;the most dangerous place for women.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Of course, there is a difference between anti-Semitic and (or) misogynistic trolling and physical abuse, but both are part of the same spectrum of violence. The Pittsburgh shooting only this month and Jo Cox’s murder are just two pieces of evidence, if anyone actually needed it, that violent rhetoric can and does end in bloodshed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Labour MP Yvette Cooper said at Monday’s conference,&nbsp;&quot;All of us have to do more to challenge&nbsp;the coming together of those two ancient hatreds.&quot;</p> \n<p>Until we deal with the pervasive hatred of women that rears its ugly head so regularly on social media, and which, for Jewish women, combines unpleasantly with that other ancient hatred, anti-Semitism, emanating from both side of the political spectrum, women trying to shape our society, women taking part in the national debate, will continue to be in the firing line.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Alona Ferber is a writer and editor based in London.&nbsp;Twitter:&nbsp;@paperdispatch</p>",

        "text":["<p>The suspected rapist and murderer of a 12-year-old Eritrean girl was brought to a Tel Aviv court on Thursday, where his custody was extended by a week. The suspect, an Eritrean asylum seeker, was arrested on Wednesday night near the Carmel Market after a two-day manhunt.</p> \n<p>Police told the court the suspect, Tesfebarhan Tesfasion, had been romantically involved with the murdered girl’s mother and that he was suspected of raping the young girl, Silvana Tsegai, before brutally killing her on Monday afternoon.</p> \n<p>Security footage from a camera at a business next to Silvana’s home, and taken the day of the murder, showed the suspect arriving at the apartment building at 1 P.M. and departing at 3:40 P.M. According to police suspicions, Tesfasion beat the girl to death during that time. Silvana’s mother found her body when she returned home at 9:30 P.M.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Murder of 12-year-old girl shows human rights in Israel are only for Jews&nbsp;■&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the murder comes as no surprise</p> \n<p>The girl was known to the welfare services as a victim of domestic violence, it was reported. On Saturday she had called the police to complain that Tesfasion had been to her home, but when asked she reportedly said he had left again.</p> \n<p>Two asylum seekers said this week that Silvana’s mother, Malay Guawi, told them Tesfasion had threatened to hurt her daughter a few days before the murder. A former neighbor said Silvana had told him her mother’s partner used to beat her. “She couldn’t go to the police by herself,” he said. “If they had complained in time, this wouldn’t have happened.”</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court Judge Daniel Beeri said the evidence gathered so far established “reasonable suspicion” of the suspect’s guilt, and referred him for a psychological examination at his lawyer’s request.</p> \n<p>Police representatives said Silvana’s body was taken to the Forensic Medicine Institute for examination.</p> \n<p>Tesfasion, who was interrogated for two hours during the night at a Tel Aviv police station, has reserved the right to remain silent and has not confessed to the charges against him, police said. His clothes were taken for a forensic examination, as well as a saliva sample – which was extracted forcibly, according to his lawyer.</p> \n<p>The suspect’s lawyer, public defender Shmuel Fleishman, said, “This is a grave incident, a tragedy, and we’re at the beginning of the investigation. He isn’t saying much. I understood he’s been in Israel for several years, had a regular job and was dealing with problems with language and communicating.</p> \n<p>“He explicitly agreed to having his fingerprints taken, but the saliva was taken from him forcibly to check for DNA traces,” he said.</p> \n<p>Tesfasion was captured after a citizen recognized him in the vicinity of Tel Aviv’s Carmel Market from the picture published by the police, and called the 100 police hotline. “I think I saw him here,” the caller reported. “He was walking on the sidewalk holding a bag. He wore the hood of his raincoat over his head, and it wasn’t cold enough for that. That’s what attracted my attention.”</p> \n<p>Tesfasion, 35, entered Israel via Sinai in October 2010, saying he fled from Eritrea after being asked to join the army. After evading military service for two years he was caught and imprisoned, but managed to escape and reach Sudan, where he lived for about a year, he said.</p> \n<p>Later he moved to Libya, where he stayed for two years, before going on to Egypt and then to Israel. His mother and three of his brothers remained in Eritrea, he said. The lawyers helping him with the asylum request said his freedom and life were at risk in Eritrea, due to his refusal to join the army and his escape from prison.</p> \n<p>Since he entered Israel, Tesfasion stayed in the central region and worked in sanitation for the Tel Aviv municipality, in a restaurant and in a supermarket in Petah Tikva, he said. In January 2014 he was convicted of driving without a license and sentenced to 14 days in prison. A few months later he was arrested for drunk driving and other traffic offenses and sentenced to a year in prison, which he served in Ela prison in Be’er Sheva.</p> \n<p>“I’m very sorry, I made a big mistake,” he told the parole board hearing his request to commute his sentence. “I’ll never drive again, I’ll never drink alcohol again in my life.”</p> \n<p>Although he had no discipline problems during his prison term, the board rejected his request for parole, as no rehabilitation program was prepared for him due to his status as an asylum seeker. “In these circumstances, when there’s a real risk to public safety from the prisoner, there’s no place to release him,” the board wrote.</p> \n<p>After his release from Ela upon completion of his sentence, it was decided to hold him in Saharonim detention facility for his illegal entry into the country. Tesfasion appealed to the Be’er Sheva District Court against the decision, but his appeal was denied. He then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted it.</p> \n<p>The Supreme Court ordered the state to pay Tesfasion 10,000 shekels ($2,700) in compensation by the state some two years ago for wrongful incarceration in Saharonim.</p>",

        "text":["<p>LEIPZIG – The Conne Island Club in Leipzig’s Connewitz neighborhood is one of the places most identified with the intellectual-left ideological movement known as Antideutsche (“Anti-German”). A sweet smell of marijuana hanging in the air, beautiful people, tattoos, graffiti, dreadlocks, a deejay, a skateboarding area. Nothing in the lightheartedness and joie de vivre suggests the ideological crisis and disagreements that are jolting the club.</p> \n<p>Sitting in the yard is a scholar, a student of history and political science, who wants to preserve his privacy. We will refer to him as “Andreas.” He amuses himself in his spare time by participating in political discourse with a small group of other intellectuals, but his eyes light up when he recalls how he took part in street fights with neo-Nazis in Leipzig both in the 1980s and ‘90s. Back then everything looked simpler, clearer.</p> \n<p>“There was a big fight with firebombs and people on both sides were wounded,” Andreas relates. “We wrecked all their [the neo-Nazis’] cars so they wouldn’t be able to get close to our projects. We set off [car] alarms across the city.”</p> \n<p>Antideutsche, a school of thought spurred by neo-Marxist theory that emerged against the background of German unification, never coalesced into a full-blown political movement, but, rife with critical journals and fashionable clubs, it has been going strong for three decades. The Anti-Germans are against nationalism – all nationalism, as such – with one exception: Jewish nationalism. The Germans and the world had that coming to them, they maintain.</p> \n<p>But the wave of refugees and migrants entering Germany over the past few years changed the country, boosted the extreme right and along the way derailed the left. Similarly, the ascension of Donald Trump to power in the United States and the growing strength of the BDS movement in Europe undermined the outlook that had characterized the left, particularly the pro-Israel left, in the years after the wall fell. If the Israeli left sometimes appears to be a complex-ridden, divided, self-conflicted lot, the situation among the German radical left is no less acute.</p> \n<p>Advent of the partisans</p> \n<p>In the autumn of 1989, the residents of Leipzig, then part of the German Democratic Republic, took to the streets to protest against the communist regime. To the international community, the demonstrations, which spread to other cities and anticipated the fall of the Berlin Wall, were a breath of fresh air. But a small group of punks, to which Andreas belonged, wasn’t happy with the direction they took. “The neo-Nazis participated in those demonstrations, and at a certain point they started to lead them,” Andreas recalls. “We saw that the slogan ‘Wir sind das Volk’ [We are the people] had morphed into ‘Wir sind ein Volk’ [We are one people].”</p> \n<p>For most Germans, that cry symbolized the demand for German unification. But for Andreas and his friends, its implications were far more acute: It was a sign of a resurgent German nationalism. “We thought we were heading into the Fourth Reich,” he says.</p> \n<p>Their fears were realized, in part. In the early 1990s, a wave of post-unification nationalism swept Germany, in both its eastern and western parts. The homes of migrants and refugees from Mozambique, Vietnam and elsewhere were surrounded by angry mobs and became targets for firebombs. In the aftermath of attacks in Saxony, the state where Leipzig is situated, local authorities evacuated refugees from the town of Hoyerswerda. In another incident, five girls from a Turkish family were killed when skinheads torched their home in the city of Solingen in North-Rhine Westphalia.</p> \n<p>“We thought we needed to be partisans,” Andreas recalls. “We talked about buying weapons to defend ourselves against the rising Nazism.”</p> \n<p>But by the end of the tempestuous 1990s, the wave of nationalist violence receded – due in part, according to Andreas, to the uncompromising policy of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The danger of a Fourth Reich no longer loomed on the horizon, and the left turned its attention to other struggles. Some activists took aim at American imperialism in the Middle East, others – Antideutsche – defended Israel and bourgeois society as a whole in the face of Islamic radicalization as manifested in the September 11, 2001, attacks.</p> \n<p>According to Andreas, Germany’s political situation is better today than it was in the 1990s, despite the rise of the far-right AfD&nbsp; (Alternative for Germany) party. “From my perspective, we have moved leftward, not rightward,” he avers. “If there are leftists who claim the opposite, that’s only part of the truth.”</p> \n<p>Coinciding with the transformations that have occurred in Germany and globally in the past few decades, Andreas’ worldview has also undergone a sea change. His take on things today is far more complex and less unequivocal. In the past it was clear that he was against the concept of the nation-state as such (apart from Israel, of course). Today he says that “the role of the nation-state is to defend, on the one hand, bourgeois society – with its built-in social inequality – but also, on the other, civil rights.”</p> \n<p>In a somewhat similar manner, the Conne Island Club, once a bastion of relentless battle against the right, has more recently been at the heart of serious internal ideological disputes, and now finds itself under attack from the left.</p> \n<p>No names, please</p> \n<p>Three of the people who run the club (which includes a library, a pub and a space for meetings of different groups) agreed to meet with me and talk about the problems and dilemmas they’re facing. None of them was willing to be named or have their photograph taken for the article. We’ll call them Richard, who is 36 and is in charge of the club’s concerts, Julia, 30, and Robin (a male), 29.</p> \n<p>I ask them about the principles of Conne Island, which is run by a nonhierarchical group that makes the important decisions at weekly “plenum” meetings. Julia answers simply: “Anti-sexism, anti-homophobia and anti-racism, equality, universalism, solidarity with Israel.” Of late, the club has found itself dealing with the mutual conflict between at least some of those principles, a situation that has subjected it to attacks from within the left-wing camp.</p> \n<p>It started in 2015 or 2016, Julia relates, when Germany began taking in large numbers of immigrants from the Middle East and Africa. Like many German citizens, the Conne Island management decided to welcome them, and set a special ticket price of just a half-euro for refugees and immigrants to all the club’s concerts. The club also offered German lessons and other activities. The initiative was successful – the newcomers were happy to attend the concerts and parties – until the problems began.</p> \n<p>“At that point we didn’t have professional security guards,” Robin says. “Suddenly, things changed. Suddenly, there were knives in the club, people who were drunk were banging their heads against the wall. We realized we didn’t know how to deal with it.” Julia adds: “There was a lot of sexual harassment – men touching women at parties.”</p> \n<p>“For me, as the person responsible for bookings, those were nightmare months,” Richard recalls. “One time we were six people against two or three guys who made trouble the whole night. We dealt with it for a few hours, but in the end we had to call the police – something we’d never done before.”</p> \n<p>The club toughened its entry policy for events, beefed up security and decided that only refugees who ordered tickets in advance would benefit from the subsidy, otherwise they would pay the full price. When that, too, failed to solve the problem, the club’s management decided to publish a text that was part manifesto, part confession.</p> \n<p>“Our plan to integrate young refugees by way of joint celebrations alone proved naive,” the Conne Island document asserted. The authors added, “The authoritarian and patriarchal socialization of some of the refugees in some of the countries of origin, on the one hand, and the Western-liberal culture of parties, on the other hand, has created a volatile mix and led to an increase in sexist comments and sexual harassment in Conne Island and in other clubs. As a result, women have chosen not to attend our parties in order to avoid attacks and confrontations. Against the background of these incidents, we must ask ourselves very clearly whether we expressed sufficient solidarity with the injured women, or whether we rested on the laurels of our earlier struggles against sexism.”</p> \n<p>The goal of the document, Conne Island’s people explain in retrospect, was to stimulate a frank and honest discussion within the left, particularly in the clubs identified with the left. But the experiment blew up in their faces. “It backfired really badly,” says Robin. AfD shared the text on Facebook and Twitter, as if to say, “Now even the lefties understand what the problem with the foreigners is.”</p> \n<p>“People told us we shouldn’t have published it – it gave the AfD tools [against us],” Robin says. Still, he notes, despite the backlash, the document also produced good results, such as a meeting between representatives of all the big left-wing clubs in Germany, held at Potsdam. “But we still missed the goal,” he admits. “The bad publicity lingered and all the rest was forgotten.”</p> \n<p>Now, more than two years after the document’s publication, refugees and immigrants still come to the club, but in lower numbers, as my three interlocutors explain. The reason, they say, is that in south Leipzig, where the club is located, there are simply fewer refugees than before.</p> \n<p>“We live in a very high-rent bubble,” Richard says, “and all those people live now in small towns where there are plenty of free apartments and where it’s much cheaper for the government to house them. I think that if many of them were still living in this area, we would still be having problems.”</p> \n<p>Voice of reason</p> \n<p>But the next storm was not long in coming – and this time it ended with calls for a boycott. In May, a group of activists, many of them with ties to Conne Island, organized a conference to honor Israel’s 70th birthday, in cooperation with Leipzig University. The speakers included the commentator and theater person Thomas Maul, whose scheduled topic was “Criticism of Islamic Anti-Semitism and its Trivialization.” Shortly before the event, Maul, in a Facebook post praised a speech by AfD leader Alexander Gauland in the Bundestag. Gauland called for “fighting and dying alongside Israel, in the event of a serious danger to its existence.” Gauland also imputed to the government responsibility for Germany’s growing anti-Semitism, calling it “collateral damage from the failed immigration and immigrant absorption policy.”</p> \n<p>Maul wrote that “AfD remained objectively the only voice of reason in the Bundestag” – and the gates of hell opened.</p> \n<p>“A shit-storm erupted,” recalls Robin, who says that over the next two weeks, left-wing activists circulated a demand online that, “Conne Island must not allow AfD supporters to take part in the [Israel anniversary] events.”</p> \n<p>Leipzig University cancelled Maul’s speech, but Conne Island decided to allow the wayward columnist to speak at the club.</p> \n<p>In an email interview, Maul reiterated the main points of his lecture. He said he doubted whether the pro-Zionist left should be part of the antifascist front created by the big parties against AfD. “That would mean a battle against right-wing solidarity with Israel alongside left-wing anti-Semites,” he wrote. Maul also maintained that when the big parties “declare as taboo statements about the real problems of mass Islamic immigration, and accordingly do not propose logical and humane solutions, they actually strengthen AfD.” The far-right party, he averred, “owes its popularity exclusively to the silence of the other parties and major media outlets about the worsening social problems.”</p> \n<p>Two weeks after Maul spoke, a call to boycott Conne Island appeared on the web, signed by something called the “Initiative for a Left Counterculture.” Conne Island, said the statement is “systematically pushing left-wing positions to the margins. They invite right-wing populists, whereas many left-wing speakers and artists never make it to their stage.” The statement called on artists not to appear at Conne Island and demanded that the city of Leipzig stop all its funding of Conne Island.</p> \n<p>The document also noted that Conne Island had banned the wearing of kaffiyehs on its premises – a prohibition that has been in place for years, as the head-covering is perceived as a statement of pro-Palestinian support. “Conne Island interprets every critique of the oppression of the Palestinian people as a form of anti-Semitism,” the text stated in this connection. “They display unconditional solidarity with Israel. That means, solidarity with half a century of military occupation and defense of an extreme right-wing government and its political agenda.”</p> \n<p>Issues related to Israel are indeed hampering management of the concerts and parties at Conne Island, particularly in the past few years, in light of the growing strength of the BDS movement in Europe. Last summer, the problem was aggravated by an internet campaign waged under the aegis of “#djsforpalestine,” in which musicians and deejays expressed support for the boycotting of Israel because of its oppression of the Palestinians. “Lots and lots of musicians who performed here and in other clubs joined the campaign,” Richard relates.</p> \n<p>Conne Island is committed to unconditional support of Israel, and is thus not inclined to give a platform to people who endorse a boycott. On the other hand, the club is proud to be home to diverse musical subcultures – from punk, hard-core and hip hop to house and techno. Forgoing prominent musicians for ideological reasons is liable to exact a formidable artistic – and reputational – price.</p> \n<p>“It’s not like we say that if you shared [the pro-boycott meme], you won’t perform,” Richard notes. “We ask why you shared it. And if the answer is bad, or if there is no answer, then maybe you won’t play here.”</p> \n<p>“I love Israel,” he adds. “I’m a little bit obsessed with it, but in a good way. Because of my own history, anti-Semitism is a subject that I’m very concerned about. I see a big problem with left-wing anti-Semitism – which no one seems to care about – and not only with right-wing anti-Semitism.”</p> \n<p>When I ask him if his family history ties him to the subject, he answers that this grandfather fought on the Eastern Front during World War II, but that in his family – as in the majority of families in Germany, certainly when he was growing up – the subject was not talked about.</p> \n<p>Gauging the threat</p> \n<p>The disagreements among the various left-wing camps, which has only intensified in recent years, has created new categories. These include “left Anti-Germans” and “right Anti-Germans” – a new division within a group that above all has defined itself as radical, neo-Marxist left. Does this division represent a wedge that the populist right has managed to drive into the ranks of the left? Or is it just another disagreement within a very narrow intra-left niche? I put this question to Sebastian Voigt, a historian and a longtime activist in the left pro-Israeli scene in Germany.</p> \n<p>In his view, there is no contradiction between the two. “There’s a tendency toward the strengthening of the right wing nowadays in Germany, and the radical left has been marginalized for a long time,” he says in a telephone interview. “These discussions take place among a very small group of people. But they reflect something bigger. The left, and Conne Island as a leftist cultural alternative center, need to find ways to speak about the new situation.”</p> \n<p>Still, according to Voigt, the difference between the “right Anti-Germans” (represented by Thomas Maul and the Bahamas journal, which emerged from the Marxist left, but now tends to be critical of many traditional left-wing positions), and the left-wing Anti-Germans boils down to exactly one controversy: “Which is the greater political threat – the Islamization of European society or the rise of rightist reactionary powers in Germany, in Europe and all over the world. I maintain that the right is the threat.”</p> \n<p>On the question of Israel, Voigt says that his concern is that anti-Zionism often serves as a cover for anti-Semitism: “ And that is what I fight against. I don’t support Netanyahu or the current Israeli government. But domestic politics in Israel are none of my business.”</p> \n<p>When I point out that most of the world doesn’t view the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a domestic Israeli issue alone, he says he believes it’s been politicized in a non-constructive way. He adds: “One problem of the left has been that it has always wanted to solve all of the world’s problems, particularly the Middle Eastern conflict. But I think the German left should leave the Middle Eastern conflict alone.”</p> \n<p>Voigt also argues that, even if the refugee question served as the trigger for the rise of the right, “the reasons go much deeper and are related to socioeconomic developments of recent decades.” The refugee crisis, he says, should be seen in a wider historical perspective. “Sometimes it’s worthwhile to take a step back, and then the situation doesn’t look so unsolvable. After 1945, millions of Germans were expelled from eastern regions – which had belonged to Germany in the past and were now annexed to Poland – and were successfully integrated into German society. One can claim of course that they were white and not all that different. But the discussions that were held in Catholic Bavaria when Protestant Germans from West Pomerania and Eastern Prussia wanted to build their church in a Catholic village, can be compared to those now being held about the mosques.”</p> \n<p>Voigt adds that “Maul, like Germany’s minister of the interior, Horst Seehofer, claims that immigration is the mother of all problems. This is not true. The truth is that Germany never wanted to be a country of immigrants, but it actually has been one for decades.”</p> \n<p>In the meantime, it looks as though the German left, too, hasn’t completely come to terms with that insight, nor has it decided what it thinks about a host of other issues.

        "text":["<p>Yadin Madar, 42, lives in Berlin and Moshav Geulim; arriving from Berlin</p> \n<p>Tomer, the photographer: Hi! Third time’s a charm.</p> \n<p>Fantastic, I’ve been stopped by Haaretz a third time.</p> \n<p>Liat: What?</p> \n<p>Tomer: Don’t you remember him?</p> \n<p>Liat: Vaguely. Sorry.</p> \n<p>Yadin: Four years ago, my wife and I returned from a trip and then we met and talked about my grandma, who has since died, may she rest in peace. We met a second time two years ago, and my wife talked about the dilemma of taking trips to the death camps.</p> \n<p>I remember! You had a virtual grocery store in Berlin for Israeli food. What’s going on now?</p> \n<p>Excellent. I’m happily married and the father of two gorgeous girls and a dumb dog.</p> \n<p>And the grocery store?</p> \n<p>I closed it. It was profitable and it was a great success, but it simply wasn’t worth the noise. Too little money for too many worries about being kosher and getting fresh food. It stopped being interesting.</p> \n<p>So you called it quits?</p> \n<p>Yes. Otherwise we’d get old and die. People are sometimes afraid to call it quits, but as an entrepreneur you need to know when it’s time to move on to the next cool thing.</p> \n<p>Why do I have the feeling there already is such a thing?</p> \n<p>This is a really hysterical project, the most hysterical you can imagine.</p> \n<p>No self-promotion, please.</p> \n<p>I’m going to establish a “capsule” hotel in Germany. It’s a futuristic concept, a Japanese thing.</p> \n<p>Like in the Luc Besson film “The Fifth Element”?</p> \n<p>Exactly. I did some research and saw that it’s made a lot of noise in London and Stockholm. I think it’s the right thing for crowded cities like Berlin, where hotels are always fully occupied and it’s hard to find a room.</p> \n<p>What does a capsule look like?</p> \n<p>Each capsule is 1.20 meters wide, 1.5 meters high and 2.20 meters long. It has a TV, an air conditioner, a safe, lighting, earphones and a small table; you can sit comfortably, but you can’t stand up. Basically, everything is managed from the bed. You have a smartcard and a locker and a code for a shared toilet and showers. I’m blown away by the idea.</p> \n<p>You seem to be.</p> \n<p>We have the place, an awesome location in terms of its centrality, like being on Rothschild [Boulevard in Tel Aviv]. On one side the Berghain [nightclub], on the other the offices of MTV, Universal and e-Bay, so it’s good both for people on short business trips and for tourists and clubbers. And we’re going to be feinschmeckers – excuse me for using the royal “we.”</p> \n<p>It’s all good, you know how to sell, go on with the pitch.</p> \n<p>Fifty capsules on two floors, and a great public area that invites people to hang out, with a coin-operated beer tap. For 45 euros a night, instead of the 100-plus at a hotel. Let’s say you’re in Berlin alone for a party or for work. Whom will you talk to? The area I have is relatively small; in the really hot locations there isn’t much room. It’s either building 10 hotel rooms or 50 capsules.</p> \n<p>At what stage are you?</p> \n<p>Recruiting investors. I need to raise 300,000 euros, I already have 60 percent from one of the big banks in Berlin, which believes in us, and in another three months the place will be ready. The capsules come from China, each one costs 3,000 euros. It’s prefab, made of tough materials; it won’t break and you can’t stick things into it. It’s anti-everything – anti-God.</p> \n<p>Was it hard getting financing from a German bank?</p> \n<p>No. They’re really into it. I believe that by the end of 2019 I’ll have a chain and there will be two more like these. There are a lot of Israeli investments in Berlin, but this isn’t the sort of business Israelis like, because it’s not an investment that finishes after two years.</p> \n<p>Have you ever slept in a capsule? Don’t you think it’s a little claustrophobic?</p> \n<p>No, it really looks cool to me. I did sleep in a hostel to get the commune experience, and it was nice but crowded. Shared rooms aren’t appropriate for people over 22, who want privacy. And I hear it can also be an unpleasant experience for girls.</p> \n<p>And what happens if you meet someone at the Berghain?</p> \n<p>The capsule is by definition for one person, but two can also fit.</p> \n<p>Yaniv Ben Ami, 39, lives in Tel Aviv; flying to Zanzibar</p> \n<p>Can I ask what you have in your small bag? A violin?</p> \n<p>It’s a bass guitar that’s meant for traveling. It has a body that can be separated from the neck and the frets. A nice concept, you can put it in the overhead without quarreling with the flight attendants.</p> \n<p>Are you going abroad to perform?</p> \n<p>I’m supposed to have one show, but overall it’s a week of fun. I’ve wanted to go for a long time, and suddenly I had a hole in my schedule, so I bought a ticket.</p> \n<p>Who do you perform with?</p> \n<p>Whoever comes with groove, I’m there. In Israel you have to spread out your gigs as a musician. I play with Tuna, with Shay Hertz, who’s very talented and will make a name for himself, and with a band called Gaberband.</p> \n<p>Geverband? Do you sing about the bewildered situation of men in the modern world? [“Gever” is Hebrew for “man.”]</p> \n<p>It’s a cover group on steroids. Our soloist is named Nir Gaber. And it wasn’t so long ago – well, actually it was quite a while – that Netta Barzilai sang with us. But now she’s a bit busy.</p> \n<p>Covers of what?</p> \n<p>We play everything, from Zohar Argov to Rage Against the Machine. Not long ago we did an homage to Amy Winehouse at Habima Theater, with her original guitarist. But mostly we do private events and we have a monthly gig in Tel Aviv, which is half-party.</p> \n<p>With dancing?</p> \n<p>Dancing, singing, going wild. We host Gal Toren and Esther Rada. We decide on the spot what to play, like deejays do. We play a song and in the last bar the singer shouts out to us what the next song will be.</p> \n<p>Without rehearsals?</p> \n<p>We’ve been playing together for more than 10 years, and the musicians are good enough, really high class. Our percussionist is from the Avihu Pinhasov Rhythm Club and is Beri Sakharof’s backup drummer. The bassist isn’t out front but if he makes a mistake, the whole stage shakes. It’s a thankless job, but it’s the best way for me to serve a song.</p> \n<p>Did you study music?</p> \n<p>No, I’m an autodidact, I came to music out of love. Over the years I realized that the fact that I didn’t study music is an advantage, because I developed a good ear. I don’t do scales. I’m preoccupied with how everything sounds together. I have about 3,000 records. If you listen to a lot of music for a long time, you know what your role is naturally.</p> \n<p>Do you make a good living from it?</p> \n<p>If it was money that was important to me, I’d work in a regular job. But I like to perform. With Tuna, for example, I love everything I do, and I’ve been there pretty much from the beginning.</p> \n<p>How long ago was that?</p> \n<p>Nine years. I remember when we had two people in the audience. It was frustrating, but I knew it was good, otherwise I wouldn’t have stayed on. I believed in something and stuck with it. Ultimately, when you’re proved right, it’s a dream fulfilled.</p> \n<p>How did that suddenly happen?</p> \n<p>YouTube changed the picture. When we were with Tuna we sent a lot of songs to the radio, but they never got played. The exposure came with the clip “This, Too, Shall Pass,” and after that the radio asked for songs. We also performed with Esther Rada in substandard conditions, on a tiny stage in a small bar on Ben Yehuda [Street in Tel Aviv]; even there she sounded incredible and gave me shivers. I also played with Nachi and Peled and with Netta Barzilai – I always knew she was phenomenal – and when there was the yes/no looper thing it made me laugh, because I knew she really didn’t need the looper.</p> \n<p>Your scene has exploded.</p> \n<p>It’s fantastic to see everyone doing well. I’m grateful for having the opportunity to know such talented people. And from my point of view, to play before tens of thousands of people means great personal and general satisfaction. Stories to tell my grandchildren.</p> \n<p>Is there still anything for you to dream for?</p> \n<p>With Gaberband we’d be happy to do a concert with a symphonette, so I’m throwing down the gauntlet here. And for me personally, I’d most like to play with Danny Sanderson. I grew up with his songs, and I think “Doda” is an amazing album that was ahead of its time.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Zionist left can’t deal with the most critical problem, the one that has shaped the face of Israel more than any other. It carries a great deal of guilt over the issue, it has no solution for it, and as a result it has lost its way. Aware of its situation, it has invented detours to divert attention away from what it’s incapable of addressing. The left has made up a narrative for itself that helps it to evade the main issue, which it also finds disturbing: After all, it is humane and moral. That way, it doesn’t have to confront the issue and to propose solutions.</p> \n<p>In light of its losing its way, its complexes, its guilt feelings, the left redirects the debate to two, related issues: Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination and the hatred for Benjamin Netanyahu. The insane obsession with both issues stems from the left’s suppressed guilt over having no answer for the occupation, the issue that defines Israel more than anything else.</p> \n<p>This fixation on Rabin’s murder and the no-less-compulsive hatred for Netanyahu are the refuge of the left from having to deal with Israel becoming a nation of occupation and apartheid, for which it has no answer. Neither Rabin’s murder nor the harm caused by Netanyahu should be taken lightly, but when they’re the main issue it’s a sign of a grave ideological crisis.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>In short, this is the narrative the left has invented for itself: Rabin was about to solve the problem of the occupation and to establish peace. Netanyahu came along exactly then, incited to and caused the murder.</p> \n<p>Rabin was murdered, Netanyahu inherited the position of prime minister from him and destroyed Israel’s hope. That was the moment “the country was finished for me,” in the language of the left.</p> \n<p>This narrative is not baseless, it is just very exaggerated. The exaggeration is meant to blur reality. Rabin’s murder was a difficult event, but less fateful than the left makes it out to be. Netanyahu is a harmful prime minister, but not as harmful as the left would have it. It is very doubtful that Rabin would have brought peace; the road to peace was still very long, he had barely begun to travel upon it and even the beginning was problematic.</p> \n<p>To attribute the occupation, the blockade, the terror and the wars to Rabin’s murder is a historical misrepresentation. It may be convenient for the left, because it acquits them of any guilt. The occupation, we must recall, did not begin with the right, and the settlements were not born with Likud.</p> \n<p>The hatred of Netanyahu is no less excessive. He deserves the left’s criticism and fierce opposition, but the demonization and the reflexive attacks on every single action says more about the left than it does about Netanyahu. The left would have taken some of the exact same actions as he did, and perhaps even worse ones at that. The worship of security, for example, is identical in both camps. The support for the settlements, too, is much more similar than it appears.</p> \n<p>Not all of Israel’s disasters began with Rabin’s murder, and not all of its ills will end when Netanyahu is replaced. But when there is nothing to offer, all the blame is placed on Netanyahu. He caused the murder, as a result the occupation was perpetuated, because of him Israel lost its way, only because of him.</p> \n<p>Such a balm to the tormented conscience, such relief without demanding courage, is it to wallow in the murder and to blame Netanyahu; to light a memorial candle in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv and to demonstrate against corruption.</p> \n<p>If that is the situation, then the left doesn’t stand a chance. When there is nothing to offer, it is impossible to win in the elections. It is of course possible to continue to talk about the two-state solution, at a time when there’s no longer anywhere to establish them — for which the left is partly to blame. It’s possible to continue to mutter “Jewish and democratic,” and to flee from the choice between these mutually contradictory principles, the meaning of one of which is unclear.</p> \n<p>It is also possible to continue to promise peace negotiations, as if that were the goal, and to know that the left has nothing just to offer in them. It is also possible to rely on another messiah from the house of David who says nothing and is victorious in the opinion polls — but when there is nothing to offer, there is no way to win.</p> \n<p>And of course, it is possible to do things in differently: to stop mourning for Rabin and hating Netanyahu, more than he deserves, and to propose a daring alternative, one that has never been tried. But that is too much for the Zionist left, the bogus Israeli alternative to the right.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon is feeling the heat. He wants elections now, the sooner the better, before his shame becomes evident to all.</p> \n<p>For him, early elections would be a lifesaver. The further we get into 2019, the more growth will slow, the more the deficit will rise and the worse the chaos will become. Therefore, it’s to his advantage to end the government’s term now. Since his party his 10 Knesset seats and he’s an experienced political fox, he’ll succeed in this mission. Thus elections will take place within the next six months or so.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Why the timing of the Israeli election matters so much to Netanyahu and his rivals | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One finance minister whose policy was the diametric opposite of Kahlon’s was Moshe Nissim. No additional funding was given to any pressure group in the 1980s. But the big question is how Nissim managed this without creating antagonism, anger and hatred among the people he turned down.</p> \n<p>One day, then-Education Minister Yitzhak Navon asked to meet with Nissim about the budget. On the appointed day Navon showed up together with 20 department heads and other ministry staffers. The conference room was completely full. Nissim opened with a few words about the Torah and then moved on to grammar, a subject on which Navon was a leading expert. The conversation flowed smoothly, and thus an hour and a half passed in learned discussion.</p> \n<p>After that, the Education Ministry staffers laid out their demands, and Nissim explained at length that staying within the budget was a necessary condition for growth and employment. The atmosphere was warm and friendly, and Navon left happy, together with his entire entourage.</p> \n<p>But then, about three minutes later, there was a knock on the door. Navon entered, stuck his hand in his pocket, pulled it out to show it was empty and said, “What did I get? Nothing!”</p> \n<p>Some time later, Navon’s wife ran into Nissim and told him warmly, “We won’t forget your respectful treatment of Yitzhak.”</p> \n<p>Later in Nissim’s term, nurses launched a prolonged, difficult strike. During the strike, Nissim traveled to Washington. Prime Minister Shimon Peres was feeling pressured and told him he had to return immediately “to end the strike.” It was clear that “end” meant giving in to some of the nurses’ demands.</p> \n<p>A few days later, Nissim returned to Israel. The moment he landed at the airport, he announced, “We have to stay within the budget; strikes won’t help.” But the days passed and the patients’ suffering increased. Finally Yisrael Kessar, who headed the Histadrut labor federation, got involved and requested an urgent meeting.</p> \n<p>At that meeting, Nissim began with a long discussion of the weekly Torah portion, and Kessar responded with anecdotes and jokes, until there was no time left to talk about the strike. Then Nissim said, “I have an idea. Yisrael, who’s your best man?” “Haim Haberfeld,” Kessar responded. Nissim replied, “I’m choosing my best man, David Boaz, and the two of them will meet and reach a solution.”</p> \n<p>And that was the end of the discussion. Boaz never called Haberfeld, and Haberfeld didn’t even try to call him. He knew Nissim wouldn’t give him anything.</p> \n<p>Yet Peres continued exerting pressure, and finally Nissim told him, “I can’t give in to the nurses’ demands and still remain finance minister.” Ilana Cohen heard this, understood who she was dealing with and sent the nurses back to work.</p> \n<p>Today, when Kahlon hears so much as a hint that Histadrut head Avi Nissenkorn might call a strike, he immediately capitulates without a fight and hands over billions of shekels. So is it any wonder that there are no strikes, but the deficit is exploding?</p>",

        "text":["<p>PARIS - A palpable shudder ran through the audience when the archivist in Paris took out the yellowing suicide note. Few of them had known its author, Robert Klein, but in the past year his very significant, albeit forgotten, contribution to Renaissance art history has been on the lips of everyone in the field. The note was a reminder of a complex life and a legacy that hasn’t yet been fully investigated.</p> \n<p>This year is the centenary of Klein’s birth and marks 51 years since his suicide in the hills near Florence. He typed the suicide note, which was addressed to his friend, Renzo Federici, and then made corrections by hand. “Postmortem letters are something very much hated… I know that,” he wrote, and quickly added a qualification that reads like a promise. “This is a business letter, written with fondness (for you). I am sorry to be causing you this embarrassment.”</p> \n<p>The two pages Klein wrote do in fact read like a list of businesslike instructions: whom to update, what to say, in what language and when. But amid all the seeming technicalities there is one appalling sentence, the only one that hints at the motives for a suicide that remains largely an unsolved riddle to this day. “I have many convincing reasons for getting off the train,” he wrote. For Klein, getting off the train was the last stop of human existence. That is a harsh and highly consequential statement by a Jewish survivor of the labor camps in Romania during the darkness of World War II.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month, scholars met at a weeklong conference to discuss Robert Klein and his legacy. The event was triggered by the donation, some five years ago, of the Klein archive to the library of the French National Institute of Art History (INHA) – and the resulting interest in Klein’s work. The conference took place at the National Institute of Art History in Paris (which holds the archive), the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies at the Villa I Tatti in Florence, and the Kunsthistorisches Institut (Max Planck), also in Florence. It was a birthday both happy and gloomy. Although after the war Klein’s doctoral advisor, Andr&eacute; Chastel, published a book-length collection of articles he had written, the scope and depth of Klein’s studies were to a great extent unknown to the broader scholarly community.</p> \n<p>The first step in the renewed interest in Klein was the publication in book form of his first doctoral thesis, which was never submitted for refereeing. The next step is intended to be a collection of articles about him, and probably also publication of his extensive correspondence with the most important art scholars of the 20th century, notably Erwin Panofsky, another Jewish immigrant who rewrote the history of art.</p> \n<p>Primo Levi of art history</p> \n<p>Who was Robert Klein, the forgotten genius? He was born in September 1918 in Timişoara, Romania. The breadth of his thought was apparent in the diversity of his studies before the war: medical studies at Cluj, philosophy at the German University in Prague and science disciplines in Bucharest. When the war broke out, he was drafted into the Romanian army, then held in forced labor camps and afterward fought on the Allied side in Czechoslovakia; upon his liberation he completed an undergraduate degree in Bucharest. He was awarded a French government scholarship to study in Paris, but when he declared himself a political exile, the Romanian authorities stripped him of his citizenship, whereupon he also lost the scholarship. To his last day he traveled from place to place only on the strength of laissez-passers, and despite a letter sent by his advisor to Gen. Charles de Gaulle, Klein remained stateless for the rest of his life.</p> \n<p>Despite his complicated legal and economic situation, Klein succeeded in integrating himself into French intellectual circles and, with great effort, in forging an academic career. The hub of his work was the study of the theory and art of the Italian Renaissance. He obtained his master’s, became a research assistant at the College de France and then embarked on writing his thesis at the Sorbonne, supervised by Andr&eacute; Chastel, one of the most influential scholars of art history in France in the second half of the 20th century. His economic distress, with which Klein coped in a variety of ways – from washing dishes to writing reviews – undoubtedly delayed the writing of his theses.</p> \n<p>The first two were never completed. His classmate Henri Zerner – afterward a professor of art history at Harvard – told the conference about the friendship that developed between his mother, a Jewish refugee from Austria, and Klein, who would borrow money from her to get through the month. Klein’s tangled emotional life did not make things easier for him. Zerner attested to the complex relationship Klein had with a Romanian immigrant widow with children, who committed suicide in the United States not long before Klein took his own life.</p> \n<p>From the distance of half a century, and with testimonies becoming increasingly hazy with time, it’s difficult to understand the reasons that led to Klein’s suicide. He committed the act at a time when his material situation seemed to be improving. He was awarded a prestigious research scholarship at Villa I Tatti, the Harvard center in Florence, and moved there in the autumn of 1966. The following April he overdosed on sleeping pills.</p> \n<p>Henri Zerner wonders whether “the inability to live got the better of Robert Klein just at the moment when his qualifications were recognized and his material existence was guaranteed.” He added, “After many years of poverty, perhaps the obligation of being (at last) happy was intolerable for him.” Even if Zerner didn’t mention the name Primo Levi, many of those at the conference could not help calling to mind the Jewish-Italian writer and thinker who survived Auschwitz and committed suicide in April 1987, exactly 20 years after Klein.</p> \n<p>It was Zerner who, with Andr&eacute; Chastel, went to Florence to take possession of the many documents Klein left behind. Five years ago, he decided to donate them to the National Institute of Art History. There they came to the attention of Dr. J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Koering, a scholar of Renaissance art at the Andr&eacute; Chastel Center at the Sorbonne. “I plunged into the archive and discovered a series of unpublished writings,” Koering said. “I thought immediately that there are extremely important works that should be published.”</p> \n<p>With painstaking work that necessitated cross-matching printed pages with handwritten index cards pinned to them, Koering edited Klein’s first thesis for publication, titled “The Aesthetics of Techn&egrave;” – which, in the word’s Aristotelian sense, refers to the process of artistic creation. Klein proposes a new model for thinking about Italian Renaissance art, which in the period when Klein was writing was perceived by scholars, led by Panofsky, as having been dominated by Neoplatonic thought with a premium placed on the idea of form and its realization in matter.</p> \n<p>Which art was nobler?</p> \n<p>The validity of Klein’s thought was put to the test at the conference, when scholars from around the world gathered to consider the place of his ideas today, more than 50 years after they were locked into a sort of time capsule. The angle from which I was invited by the organizers to examine the thesis – the question of the rivalry between painting and sculpture in the Renaissance – was one of the places where the strength of Klein’s work stood out most convincingly. That rivalry, which is known as “paragone” (comparative), is one of the key issues that occupied artists and philosophers in the Italian Renaissance: which art was nobler and imitated nature more closely – painting or sculpture?</p> \n<p>Until now, the theoretical underpinning for this confrontation lay in Neoplatonic thought, which sanctifies the supremacy of idea over matter. Klein, in his insistence on examining the question through the prism of Aristotelian thought, was able to impart importance to the question of the techn&egrave;: the way the artist creates, encompassing his technical – not only conceptual – skills. That perspective allows a far more precise grasp of one of the central questions in the philosophy of Western art. J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Koering believes that this is only the first step. In his view, publication of Klein’s research “will accelerate the transformation in the study of Renaissance art, placing the emphasis on the process of creation, and will spur new studies about the intellectual profile of an individual about whom much remains unknown.”</p> \n<p>A participant in the conference who knew Robert Klein personally was Carlo Ginzburg, one of the most important historians of the 20th century and a founder of the field of micro-history (and also the author of the book “The Cheese and the Worms”). Ginzburg, 79, is the son of Leone Ginzburg, a leading Jewish intellectual of the interwar years in Italy, who was tortured to death by the Nazis in Rome, and of the writer Natalia Ginzburg. He was clearly moved to be addressing an event that dredged up from the recesses of oblivion the young co-recipient – along with him – of a scholarship from the Harvard center in Florence.</p> \n<p>Ginzburg evoked their last meeting, which took place in the institute’s renowned Berenson Library. “We’re both standing and conversing. We talked about everything, even about Alain Resnais’ film ‘Last Year in Marienbad.’ I remember that he offered a phenomenological interpretation for it. There was something very intimate about the conversation, and then he said to me, ‘Can we dine together on Thursday?’ ‘I can’t make it on Thursday,’ I replied, ‘can we do it Sunday?’ – ‘Sunday is impossible,’ he said. On Sunday he committed suicide.”</p> \n<p>Ginzburg set forth this dolorous memory for the audience and admitted, “After 50 years, that moment doesn’t leave me. His tragic end pains me very much. That end did not erase my feelings for him, but did succeed in erasing the content of the conversations between us. I remember the tone, but the substance is gone. And now, through the thesis that has now been published, I am trying to renew the dialogue between us.”</p> \n<p>Many others, who did not have the privilege of knowing Klein, will try to hold a similar dialogue.</p> \n<p>Robert Klein’s book, “L’esth&eacute;tique de la techn&egrave;,” edited by J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Koering, is published by France’s National Institute of Art History.

I look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved!&quot; Trump tweeted after departing for the G20 summit.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Russian aggression against Ukraine may not start WWIII, but hints at troubled waters for Putin</p> \n<p>Trump's tweet was a sudden turnaround. Roughly an hour earlier, he had told reporters he would probably meet with Putin at the summit and said it was &quot;a very good time to have the meeting.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Trump had also said he would get a final report during the flight to Argentina on the tension in the region after Russia seized Ukrainian vessels near Crimea on Sunday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was reported saying in Interfax news agency that they have no official information of Trump's decision to cancel the meeting. The spokesman added that if the bilateral meeting is cancelled, Putin, who is currently on his way to Argentina, will have a couple of extra hours for &quot;useful meetings&quot; on the sidelines of the G-20 summit.</p> \n<p>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko praised Trump for canceling the meeting, tweeting &quot;This is how great leaders act.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Earlier on Thursday, Poroshenko accused Putin of wanting to annex his entire country and called for NATO to&nbsp;deploy warships to a sea shared&nbsp;by the two nations.</p> \n<p>Poroshenko's comments to German media were part of a concerted push by Kiev to gain Western support for more sanctions against Moscow, securing tangible Western military help, and rallying opposition to a Russian gas pipeline that threatens to deprive Ukraine of important transit revenues.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>His Western allies have so far not offered to provide any of these things, despite his warnings of a possible Russian invasion after Moscow seized three Ukrainian naval ships and their crews on Sunday near Crimea.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Moscow and Kiev blame each other for the incident, which took place in the narrow Kerch Strait off Crimea, the Ukrainian region annexed by Russia in 2014.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Don't believe Putin's lies,&quot; Poroshenko told Bild, Germany's biggest-selling paper, comparing Russia's protestations of innocence in the affair to Moscow's 2014 denial that it had soldiers in Crimea even as they moved to annex it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Putin wants the old Russian empire back,&quot; he said. &quot;Crimea, Donbass, the whole country. As Russian tsar, as he sees himself, his empire cannot function without Ukraine. He sees us as his colony.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Russia has charged that the Ukrainian vessels had failed to obtain permission to pass from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait between Russia's mainland and the Crimean Peninsula it annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine insisted that its vessels were operating in line with international maritime rules.</p> \n<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she plans to press Putin at this weekend's G-20 summit in Argentina to urge the release of the ships and crews.</p> \n<p>&quot;We can only resolve this in talks with one another because there is no military solution to all of these conflicts,&quot; she said.</p> \n<p>NATO said it already has a strong presence in the Black Sea region.

The company’s board, however, has not yet discussed raising capital. Shareholders have said they don’t expect it to exceed $15 million, half of what bondholders are demanding. Bondholders who spoke to TheMarker after a company presentation Wednesday said they were angry and confused over management’s plans.

Last year, subsidiary Delek Drilling recorded a one-time profit of $567 million from the sale of a 9.25% stake in Tamar, Israel’s main source of natural gas. Including that one-off gain, Delek’s profit in the third quarter of 2017 was 1.02 billion shekels. Delek said it hoped to sell its remaining 22% stake in Tamar next year by selling the shares on a foreign stock exchange. Revenue rose to 2.3 billion shekels from 1.8 billion, lifted by higher sales at Tamar and at its North Sea unit.

        "text":["<p>“I long for the day I can start eating meat again,” confesses Ido Savir. To be exact, he does taste meat from time to time, but no animal is harmed in its production.</p> \n<p>Savir, a conscientious vegan for the last 20 years, is the CEO and founder of Supermeat, one of the only start-ups in Israel or the world that’s developing cultured chicken meat for human consumption. Two years ago, his company took a different direction than most Israeli high-tech companies do, embarking on a crowdfunding campaign.</p> \n<p>“It was important for us to get a sense of how the public would respond to a product like this. Not through a survey, but in a wider context,” relates Savir. “One of the rewards for participating in the survey was a coupon for the product, an early order to be delivered five years hence. This enabled us to conduct the most faithful survey one could get. The aim was to raise $100,000. Everyone said there was no chance we’d succeed and that we should aim for $50,000 in order to reach our target.”</p> \n<p>In the end, Supermeat raised $250,000, with the support of 5,000 people. “Responses on social media were very favorable – I couldn’t believe it,” says Savir.</p> \n<p>Support for initiatives such as Supermeat derives, among other things, from a bitter truth which has become apparent to the industrialized world over the last few decades: Eating meat is disastrous, both morally and from an environmental perspective.</p> \n<p>According to UN figures, the meat and milk industries emits toxic gases that are equivalent to 7.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year – comprising 14.5% of all manmade polluting emissions. Sixty percent of these are a by-product of raising and slaughtering cows.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, unbearable suffering is inflicted on animals during the entire process. According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, 44.5 billion chickens, half a billion sheep and 280 million cows are slaughtered annually to meet the world’s appetite for meat. The world’s population is expected to rise to 10 billion by 2050, and this appetite is expected to grow in tandem.</p> \n<p>'High steaks'</p> \n<p>Despite horrific pictures from slaughterhouses and the efforts of avid vegetarian and vegan activists, as well as articles describing the precise costs involved in producing one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of meat, the global consumption of meat is on the rise.</p> \n<p>According to UN and OECD figures, in the year 2025 the average person will consume 35.3 kilograms of meat, 1.3 kilograms more than in 2010. This is despite the fact that the number of vegetarians and vegans is constantly growing.</p> \n<p>In order to find our way to a world without meat we must raise the supply of alternate sources of protein, instead of restricting the variety of foods that people consume. In order to break into the global meat market, valued at $1 trillion, there are people in Israel who are working on technologies to expand our menus and reduce animal suffering.</p> \n<p>Several local initiatives are promoting the next generation of Israeli food-tech. There are 311 local companies active in this area. Two months ago, the Innovation Authority announced its support, amounting to 100 million shekels ($27 million) spread over eight years, for a food-tech incubator near Safed. “In addition, we’re supporting another incubator in Ashdod, called The Kitchen, in collaboration with the Strauss Group,” says Ofra Lotan, who is one of the authority’s consultants and examiners.</p> \n<p>Even though the Innovation Authority supports food-tech entrepreneurs from the first stages of research and development, through the incubator stage and up to the mature stage, says Lotan, it does not help in matters relating to regulation. It does give grants to support the licensing stages, though. She emphasizes that Israeli food-tech companies also benefit from investments through other innovation channels.</p> \n<p>“For example, cultured meat for consumption is based on stem cell technology, which is also supported by the authority.” Lotan adds that the physical proximity of knowledge centers gives a relative advantage to this industry. According to the authority, 30 million shekels were allocated to food-tech initiatives over the last two years.</p> \n<p>One of the prominent entrepreneurs in this area, one who is trying to make the Upper Galilee a central food-tech hub, is former Knesset member Erel Margalit, the CEO of the Jerusalem Venture Partners venture capital fund and the head of the National Initiative organization. He spearheaded a government initiative to develop Israel’s outlying areas and to attract international food companies here. According to the plan, says Margalit,</p> \n<p>“If such a company wants to set up a development center in the Galilee, the state will finance 40% of employee salaries, up to $10,000 a month. Moreover, the state will grant free land for building such centers and will subsidize 90% of the cost of building them.”</p> \n<p>“This is going to be a big area, but it will take years to develop. Not everything that is intellectually interesting or is good for the world can turn into a big company. Venture capital funds must work together with the scientific community and with universities to put Israel on the map,” adds Margalit.</p> \n<p>'Proof of concept'</p> \n<p>Five years ago, Prof. Mark Post from Maastricht University produced the first cultured meat patty, a $300,000 proof-of-concept venture showing that producing meat for consumption was feasible under laboratory conditions. In brief, cultured meat is based on stem cells which can differentiate into different cell types: fat, muscle, bone, etc.</p> \n<p>A sample of muscle cells is taken from an animal, becoming a “bank” of cells that is kept in frozen liquid nitrogen, from which meat can be continuously produced.</p> \n<p>Some of these cells are seeded in a large vat that contains a liquid that includes all the ingredients required for cell proliferation: sugars, fats, proteins. The stem cells grow and proliferate up to the required mass, after which they can be turned into the muscle and fat tissue that make up meat.</p> \n<p>Can this product be called meat? According to Supermeat’s CEO there is no question that it can. “Ultimately, it’s the same raw products,” explains Savir, who’s been asked this question countless times. “Anyone who’s allergic to meat will also be allergic to this product. It’s like asking if ice that’s made in a freezer and not on an iceberg can still be called ice. Under a microscope, the two [meat] products are biologically identical.”</p> \n<p>In the common workspace in the Rehovot lab, which smells sterilized and looks like a hospital ward, there is another start-up down the hall working on producing the meat of the future. Before setting up Aleph Farms, Didier Toubia worked for 20 years as a biotechnology researcher at the Volcani Agriculture Institute. From there he moved into a medical area, managing IceCure Medical and an orthopedic start-up called NLT, which was sold in 2016.</p> \n<p>“I then decided to return to the food industry. I believe life is short and that it’s best to devote it to benefiting mankind. I realized that in order to make a real difference, the most suitable place is food. As an observant Jew, I see more and more religious leaders coming out against the eating of meat,” he says.</p> \n<p>When it was set up in 2017, Aleph Farms acquired a permit from the Israel Institute of Technology to use technology developed there previously for rehabilitative medicine.</p> \n<p>“They knew how to isolate cells from a human patient who has undergone a heart attack, to grow cardiac tissue from these cells and to transplant it back, like a patch. The tissue is reabsorbed by the original organ, with the aim of recovering cardiac function,” explains Toubia. “We take the ability of the tissue to grow in a completely different direction.” The Strauss Group partnered in setting up the company, now supporting Aleph Farms as part of the incubator it manages. Since its inception, Aleph Farms has raised $2.4 million.</p> \n<p>“There are two approaches to producing protein from living tissue,” says Toubia. “One says – let’s eat less meat and more protein from other sources, such as insects or plants. I think this approach is valid, but 90% of the world’s population still consumes meat. Meat substitutes have remained marginal. Meat consumption continues to grow by a few percentage points a year.</p> \n<p>Even if vegetarians reach 20% of the population, this won’t solve the problem,” he argues. “According to the Paris Agreement, in order to prevent a two-degree rise in the earth’s temperature, on average, the amount of beef we eat must be reduced by 75%, with pork consumption dropping by 95%.</p> \n<p>We say that instead of giving people something else to eat, such as grasshoppers or lentils, let them eat meat – we’ll solve the problems associated with it.”</p> \n<p>'A bug and fries?'</p> \n<p>In addition to cultured meat, there is another source of protein that will soon be available for consumption in Israel. This source lies in insects.</p> \n<p>Currently, two billion people around the world (equal to the number of people who own smartphones) are entomophagous, namely, insect-eaters. Throughout history, humans ate a wide variety of arthropods, starting with the ancient Greeks who ate cicadas and up to modern-day Korea, where one can eat the pupae of silkworms. Jewish communities in Yemen and Tunisia used to eat locusts.</p> \n<p>Thus, in some ways the Israeli start-up Hargol (grasshopper in Hebrew) is trying to revive old customs, introducing locusts to Israeli menus. Dror Tamir, founder and CEO of this company, vouches that “the locust is the best source of protein in nature. It contains 70% protein, many amino acids and Omega-3, but is low in saturated fats and cholesterol. They have a very mild taste.” He adds that locusts are one of the most suitable creatures for intensive farming.</p> \n<p>“Ultimately, we’re looking for something that can be grown in high densities. Producing a kilogram of beef requires 2,000 liters of water, while a kilogram of locust meat requires only two liters. Locusts also reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 98.8%, and the area required to raise them is much smaller. The process produces almost no waste.”</p> \n<p>Hargol’s CEO says that he and his deputy of operations Ben Friedman had been collaborating on some other project. The new venture was propelled forward when the two met Hanan Aviv, Hargol’s technologist. “When I met him, he was already raising locusts for food, making burgers. He believes that insects are the future of the human race. This link with him gave us our big push forward.”</p> \n<p>Hargol’s first farm is in the community of Elifelet, not far from Rosh Pina in the Galilee, says Tamir. “The next one will be on the Golan Heights, with a third one planned for the north as well.” He says that Hargol is placing the locust farms in abandoned chicken coops, thereby contributing to the environment. “We want to create new industries in the periphery. We stress this in our contacts with the state, which has yet to contribute a single shekel.”</p> \n<p>On the face of it, you couldn’t guess what the powder made by Flying SpArk is made of. It looks like white flour. This is another Israeli startup that’s managed to weave gold from insects, turning fly larvae into powder.</p> \n<p>Eran Gronich, the company’s CEO, vows that raising flies “is more efficient than producing cultured meat or plant-based meat. You don’t need hormones or antibiotics.</p> \n<p>“It takes only seven days from the time the fly lays eggs until we take the larvae,” explains Gronich. “The larva increases its size 250-fold. With our technology, in which we raise larvae on small trays, in towers with very narrow spaces, we can obtain 400 kilograms per square meter per month.” Gronich says they’re a year away from introducing their product to the market. “This will be the cheapest animal protein on the market,” he asserts.</p> \n<p>With that, Gronich adds that for reasons of kashrut they will not be selling their product in Israel, but in places where insects are consumed, such as the Far East and South America. “We’ve discovered that in Nordic countries it’s not a problem either,” he says.</p> \n<p>And what does it taste like? “Reactions are very positive. It’s as if you asked me about flour – it has no taste. You can make bread from it, or crackers and croissants. It’s the same, you put it in various other products.”</p> \n<p>Which will win, cultured meat or insects? “It depends on how the market responds over the next few years,” figures Supermeat’s CEO Savir. “We’re all into alternate sources of protein. When we talk to companies producing meat, they often say they’re not meat producers but protein producers. In many cases, this won’t be a zero-sum game, but an all-inclusive one.”</p>",

This is the only way that historic Palestine will be free.”</p> \n<p>Israeli officials and Jewish organizations in the U.S. denounced his speech and called on CNN to stop inviting him as to its studios. The Anti Defamation League said that “Those calling for ‘from the river to the sea’ are calling for an end to the State of Israel.”&nbsp;  Dani Dayan, Israel’s Consul General in New York, said that “Lamont Hill called for the elimination of the State of Israel from the map. Previously he expressed his admiration for antisemite Louis Farrakhan.“ He called Hill “a racist, a bigot, an anti-Semite.”&nbsp;  Michael Koplow of the Israel Policy Forum, which works to promote a two-state solution and is critical of Israel’s settlement policy, noted that “Hill, in his ardent zeal to consign Israel to non-existence, insists on a Palestinian maximalism that is not even embraced by the PLO itself, which is the official representative of the Palestinian people.”</p> \n<p>Hill received support from journalist Glenn Greenwald, who decried CNN’s decision to fire him. “Endless expansion of illegal Israeli settlements has made a two-state solution impossible,” Greenwald wrote on Twitter. “This is openly acknowledged in Israel.”</p> \n<p>He added that as a result of the settlements, the “only real possibilities” are either a one-state solution with equal right for everyone, or apartheid - and that the denial of this reality is why Hill has been attacked for his statement.</p> \n<p>Hill responded to the controversy on Twitter, writing, &quot;My reference to 'river to the sea' was not a call to destroy anything or anyone. It was a call for justice, both in Israel and in the West Bank/Gaza.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;I support Palestinian freedom. I support Palestinian self-determination. I am deeply critical of Israeli policy and practice,&quot; Hill wrote. However, he added, &quot;I do not support anti-Semitism, killing Jewish people, or any of the other things attributed to my speech. I have spent my life fighting these things.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON – The vote that took place Wednesday in the U.S. Senate over America’s involvement in the ongoing war in Yemen represented a stinging foreign policy failure for the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>A group of 63 senators – including every Democrat and 14 Republicans – voted to allow a debate over ending U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition's war against Iranian proxies in Yemen. The vote took place just hours after two senior Trump cabinet members, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense James Mattis, pleaded with senators not to take steps that could harm the U.S.-Saudi alliance.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Trump is expected to leave Washington for the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is also expected to attend the gathering, despite legal attempts in Argentina to hold him accountable for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. For both Trump and the young crown prince, Wednesday’s embarrassing defeat in the Senate could not have come at a worse time.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; HRW asks Argentina to investigate Saudi crown prince over Yemen war crimes and Khashoggi</p> \n<p>The vote showed growing dissatisfaction among senators over how the administration has treated both the disastrous war in Yemen and the Khashoggi crisis. In particular, senators expressed anger over the fact that the administration has been refusing to allow CIA Director Gina Haspel&nbsp;to brief Congress over the crisis with Saudi Arabia. This has caused even senators considered closely aligned with Trump, such as Lindsey Graham (Republican of South Carolina), to strongly criticize the administration.</p> \n<p>While it’s not automatically guaranteed that the Senate’s decision to allow a debate over ending U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen will actually lead to a cessation of that support, that certainly is a likely result at this point.&nbsp;Rep. Mark Pocan (Democrat of Wisconsin), an outspoken critic of the Saudi policy, said Wednesday that “it is now a matter of when, not if, the unconstitutional U.S.-Saudi war will end.”</p> \n<p>Pocan also added that the House of Representatives should follow in the Senate’s footsteps and hold its own vote on the continuation of American support for the war. Such a scenario is almost certain to happen once the new Democratic majority will take over the House in early January.</p> \n<p>If the biggest losers of the vote on Wednesday were Trump and the Saudi crown prince, perhaps the most obvious winner was Sen. Bernie Sanders (Independent of Vermont), who has made Yemen the top issue on his foreign policy agenda over the past year.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How Mohammed bin Salman put Saudi Arabia in debt to Trump and Netanyahu | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Wednesday's vote was pushed by Sanders along with Sen. Chris Murphy (Democrat&nbsp;of Connecticut) and Sen. Mike Lee (Republican&nbsp;of Utah). For Sanders, this vote was part of a broader focus on Saudi Arabia. He has publicly criticized the country’s leadership, and especially Crown Prince Mohammed, in speeches and articles.</p> \n<p>During a speech before the conference of the progressive Jewish group J Street in 2017, Sanders mocked the crown prince for his lavish spending on yachts and vacation homes, and wondered how many Palestinian refugees could have benefited from the sums of money he chose to spend on his luxurious lifestyle.</p> \n<p>Hours before Wednesday's vote, Sanders urged his fellow senators to support it, stating, “Do not forget: It was a U.S. bomb that killed 40 children on a school bus in Yemen in August – some of the many thousands of civilians who have died in this horrific, Saudi-led war.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Like Sanders, Murphy has also been a longtime critic of the ongoing war. He was one of the first lawmakers in Washington to criticize Saudi Arabia for its conduct in Yemen, as early as 2015. After the vote on Wednesday, Murphy said “this is a big first step, and it sends a message to this administration that they need to rethink their policy on Saudi Arabia, or Congress will do it for them.”</p> \n<p>The composition of the Senate will become slightly more favorable for Trump in January, since Republicans have gained two seats in the midterm elections and will hold a 53-47 majority. However, the fact that 14 Republicans voted alongside the Democrats on this issue doesn’t bode well for the president’s goal of continuing the alliance with Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>Even if 10 of those Republicans will eventually change their mind and be persuaded by the administration’s arguments&nbsp;– which is a very high bar to pass&nbsp;– that still won’t be enough to stop the Senate from limiting Trump’s support for the war in Yemen.</p> \n<p>Among the most senior Republicans who defied Trump and voted in favor of the motion were senators Bob Corker (also chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee), Rob Portman, Lamar Alexander and Susan Collins. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader, voted against the motion, as did senators and former presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rubio tweeted after the vote that “Pressuring for [a] stronger response to Khashoggi murder right thing to do, but pulling support from Saudi’s [sic] on Yemen wrong way to do it. Pulling support will result in more civilian casualties, make peace less likely and increase chance of broader regional war.”</p>",

The baby's middle name, Melvin, is in honor of his great-grandfather Melvin Weinshall, who was a cab driver in New York City.  Schumer tells Jewish Insider:&nbsp;&quot;In the Old Country, they would have called me 'zayde,' but here I want to be called 'grandpa.'&quot;  DRIVING THE DAY — President Trump departs this morning for the G20 summit&nbsp;in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he will engage in a handful of high-level meetings with foreign leaders. Trump is not expected to sit down with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, although the White House has not ruled out &quot;any interaction” with MBS at the summit.  ON THE HILL —&nbsp;Senators, Furious Over Khashoggi Killing, Spurn President on War in Yemen — by&nbsp;Gardiner Harris,&nbsp;Eric Schmitt,&nbsp;Helene Cooper&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nicholas Fandos:&nbsp;&quot;The Senate voted 63 to 37 to bring to the floor a measure to limit presidential war powers in Yemen. It was the strongest signal yet that Republican and Democratic senators alike remain vehemently skeptical of the administration’s insistence that the Saudi crown prince cannot, with certainty, be blamed for the death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi... It took place hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis briefed senators about the Yemen conflict in a classified discussion.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;The final vote in the Senate is likely to be scheduled for next week — giving the Trump administration time to win back Republicans and hold on to a Middle East strategy that has been largely built around a blossoming partnership with Prince Mohammed... Mr. Mattis and Mr. Pompeo had urged senators against withdrawing military support and warned that doing so could embolden Iran and endanger the United States.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  Jewish groups&nbsp;urge Congressional action on bills related to Israel and anti-Semitism before end of session:&nbsp;The ADL and coalition partners sent a letter to Congressional leaders earlier this week urging the quick passage of two bipartisan bills aimed at targeting anti-Semitism abroad. “We believe action on these bills before Congress ends its session would send an important message that America will not remain silent as international Jewish communities are threatened,” wrote the 72 signatories.  The Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act would see a new envoy appointed to the position, left empty since January 2017, while the Combating European Anti-Semitism Act “declares that it is in the U.S. interest to combat anti-Semitism at home and abroad.” The letter was sent to Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer, House Speaker&nbsp;Paul Ryan&nbsp;and Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.  At the same time, lawmakers are hoping to push through votes on several Israel-related bills in the current Congress. Four bills await action: legislation pressuring Hamas to halt the use of human shields against Israel; an act formalizing the 10-year Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. and Israel, which Senator Rand Paul is currently blocking; an anti-BDS bill; and the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, which has yet to gain the backing of likely 2020 contenders in the Senate —&nbsp;save for Cory Booker, who&nbsp;recently announced in Jewish Insider that he will back it.&nbsp;  Halie Soifer,&nbsp;Executive Director of the&nbsp;Jewish Democratic&nbsp;Council of America (JDCA), tells us...&nbsp;&quot;In blocking legislation that would formalize the historic MOU agreement&nbsp;Senator Paul is standing in the way of something that is in not only Israel's security interests but also that of the United States because we have shared security interests, and our relationship and the Memorandum of Understanding is mutually beneficial.&nbsp;This is a long-standing effort by Senator Paul to oppose foreign aid against many countries. But this&nbsp;instance is particularly egregious because what he's doing is not just blocking the vote. He's blocking something that would otherwise pass by unanimous consent.&nbsp;This is a very strong obstructionist move that could potentially be very damaging to our national security interests.&quot;&nbsp;  Soifer on concerns about Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez:&nbsp;&quot;The three Democrats, we haven't actually seen what that will look like in terms of whether it will translate into any sort of legislative reality or have any real implications. We don't know. And you know, these three women have views on Israel that the Jewish Democratic Council of America has publicly come out against. But we are hopeful that once they arrive in Washington in January and become fully versed in not only U.S. foreign policy but U.S. national security interests, and the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship, especially the military relationship with Israel, that their views may change and they may not translate into any sort of specific legislative action.&quot;&nbsp;  RJC's Norm Coleman emails:&nbsp;&quot;One&nbsp;Republican Senator who opposes foreign aid is impacting aid for Israel. The Democrat Party leadership, however,&nbsp;supported&nbsp;giving over $150 billion to Iran to support its terrorism in the Mideast. The Democrat Party leadership supported an Iranian nuclear deal that represented an existential threat to Israel.&quot;  &quot;In January, a Pew poll found the widest partisan gap ever between how Republicans and Democrats view the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Self-described liberal Democrats’ sympathies for Israel have plummeted from 48 percent at the beginning of the century to just 19 percent today. (Coleman quoted a Roll Call report). The lack of support for Israel is not limited to a few Democrat backbenchers. By every measure, the Democrat base is markedly less supportive of Israel today. I lament that reality. Unfortunately, support for Israel is not an applause line at a Democrat party function today.&quot;  RAND’S ITINERARY —&nbsp;On Friday, Sen. Rand Paul will be speaking at an event hosted by right-wing think tank Frontiers of Freedom. The Koch-backed group’s Washington event, entitled “Saudi Arabia and UAE: Regional Adventures and US Interests,” will focus on wars in Yemen and Syria, terrorism funding, and human rights violations. It will also feature remarks from Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, formerly Chief of Staff to Colin Powell and a recent Bernie Sanders foreign policy adviser. Wilkerson is known for making controversial statements about Israel and has frequently argued that Jewish groups have too much influence in Washington. Last March, Wilkerson suggested that Israel was trying to “suck America into” a war with Iran.

Stewart,&nbsp;Rachel Abrams&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ellen Gabler:&nbsp;&quot;Saturday, April 28, 2018, was Marv Dauer’s 75th birthday...&nbsp;More than 100 friends, sports figures, casting directors, actors, golf and bridge partners... had gathered to celebrate at a friend’s Los Angeles home. At a V.I.P. table were the biggest names Mr. Dauer could muster: the actor-turned-polemicist James Woods; former Senator Norman Coleman; and Bruce McNall...&nbsp;Then, at about 8 p.m., a star arrived: Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS and one of Hollywood’s most powerful people... Mr. Moonves had never attended Mr. Dauer’s previous parties. So what was he doing there? Four months later, Mr. Moonves was pushed out by CBS’s board after 12&nbsp;women&nbsp;told&nbsp;The New Yorker&nbsp;that he had sexually harassed or assaulted them... Mr. Dauer says the mogul told him before and after the birthday party, only one woman could bring him down: “If Bobbie [Phiilips] talks, I’m finished.”  &quot;Mr. Moonves... had crossed paths with Mr. Dauer on golf courses and tennis courts. After a mutual friend introduced them, they had lunch, and Mr. Dauer arranged for Ms. Phillips to meet Mr. Moonves...&nbsp;On Dec. 4, six days after The Times contacted him, Mr. Dauer emailed Mr. Moonves: “Leslie — it’s very important you call me.” Moments later, Mr. Moonves was on the phone. It was the first time in years that the two men had spoken...&nbsp;They discussed the possibility of getting Ms. Phillips an acting gig to keep her happy...&nbsp;On May 14, CBS sued its largest shareholder, Shari Redstone, trying to weaken her control of the company. It was a declaration of civil war that meant Mr. Moonves’s conduct would face intense scrutiny from Ms. Redstone’s camp. That made it even more important to keep Ms. Phillips quiet.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  DEEP DIVE — Prosecutors worked to cut&nbsp;Jeffrey Epstein&nbsp;a break — by Julie Brown:&nbsp;&quot;Facing a 53-page federal indictment, Epstein could have ended up in federal prison for the rest of his life.

        "text":["<p>Archaeologists digging at ancient Megiddo, in today’s northern Israel, have unearthed the remains of two brothers who survived into adulthood even though they were born with congenital anomalies and were hit by debilitating diseases later in life. The researchers found evidence that the men were cared for by their family or the community, to the point that a complex medical procedure was performed on one of them at the end of his life in a desperate – and unsuccessful – attempt to save him.</p> \n<p>The discovery points to the existence of a social support system for disabled people in Canaanite settlements of the late Bronze Age, archaeologists say. More broadly, it also highlights that while we may often think of antiquity as a time of brutality and survival of the fittest, it isn’t necessarily so.</p> \n<p>By caring for the weak, the Canaanites were merely obeying a social imperative that seems to have predated humanity. Even the Neanderthals are thought to have significantly helped their disabled brethren. Also Homo erectus, who evolved some 2 million years ago, may have noticed each other's pain, and helped each other out, based on the discovery of an aged, toothless erectus individual found in Dmanisi, Georgia who likely couldn't have survived on its own.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>My brother's keeper</p> \n<p>The Canaanite tomb, dated between the late 16th and early 15th centuries B.C.E., was found in 2016 underneath a building on the ancient site. This was not a surprise: it was common at the time to bury the deceased under the floor of the family home, says Rachel Kalisher, a bio-archaeologist and PhD student at Brown University.</p> \n<p>What was surprising was the condition of the skeletons inside the burial, says Kalisher, who presented the results of her study of the bones earlier this month at the annual meeting of the American Schools of Oriental Research in Denver.</p> \n<p>One skeleton displayed multiple anomalies, including what is described as a metopic suture – meaning the bones of the forehead had not fused in infancy as they should have. The person also had a rare fourth molar (most adults have three molars in each quadrant of the mouth, the third being the wisdom tooth).</p> \n<p>Most intriguingly, his skull was missing a square chunk of bone right on the forehead. He had undergone trephination, a surgical procedure not rare in the ancient world, that involved drilling a hole into the patient’s skull, Kalisher explains.</p> \n<p>Both skeletons showed signs of cribra orbitalia, which are lesions on the upper eye sockets that are likely connected to anemia in childhood.</p> \n<p>The two men also suffered from a condition that caused severe damage to their entire skeleton, resulting in lesions and porous holes in their bones. The condition would have been extremely painful and may have impacted their mobility, Kaslisher says. In contrast to the extra molar, for instance, this was not a congenital problem but an infection they both contracted at some time in life, though genetic predisposition may have played a role, she says.</p> \n<p>The disease may have been leprosy, although tests seeking bacterial DNA in the bones are still pending, she says. It is also still unclear what cognitive or developmental problems may have been linked to the congenital anomalies found on the bones.</p> \n<p>So far , DNA analysis of the two skeletons has shown that the two men were brothers, the archaeologist says.</p> \n<p>Her analysis concluded that the first man, the one with trephinated skull, died between the age of 20 and 40, while his brother, who is believed to have died much earlier, survived only until his early twenties.</p> \n<p>While neither lived to a ripe old age, they obviously survived for many years despite their health problems. This is also confirmed by the analysis of the teeth, which can reveal if a person has been malnourished in childhood.</p> \n<p>Poor nutrition is commonly found in human remains from Megiddo, even among healthy individuals. But this was not the case for the two brothers, Kalisher reports. There were also comparatively few signs of dental wear on the teeth, suggesting they ate non-abrasive food and didn’t use their choppers as tools – as many people commonly did at the time.</p> \n<p>“There was some kind of support mechanism in place, they were well fed and taken care of throughout their lives,” Kalisher tells Haaretz. “There was also some sort of medical care, since someone came and performed surgery on this person, and the surgery was well done.”</p> \n<p>When drilling a hole in the skull is a good idea</p> \n<p>Trephination was practiced by cultures all around the globe, from ancient Greeks and Romans to the pre-Columbian societies of South America.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the ancient Middle East it was not particularly common, says Kalisher, adding that that only about a dozen other cases have been found in the region, dating from the Neolithic to the Hellenistic period. This was the first evidence of trephination (also called trepanning) at Megiddo, she said.</p> \n<p>Throughout history, reasons for performing trephination have ranged from the medically sound to purely ritualistic and irrational. The procedure could be used to &quot;clean&quot; a skull fracture or relieve pressure on the brain caused by the swelling and fluid buildup that can follow a head injury. But it was also seen as a way to release evil spirits that were believed to afflict people with some mental or neurological disorders.</p> \n<p>While skull surgery in a time without antibiotics and anesthesia may sound like a death sentence for the patient, some people did survive the procedure, as demonstrated by the bone regrowth found on many trephinated skulls around the world. Some studies have suggested the survival rate of this dramatic surgery could have been around 80 percent.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the case of the Megiddo skull, no bone regrowth can be seen, indicating that the man died within a week of the operation, Kalisher says.</p> \n<p>The archaeologists also found most of the bone pieces that had been removed from the skull because they had been buried with the patient.</p> \n<p>The surgery may have failed because it was performed on the forehead, right over the metopic suture. Ancient people knew better than to drill holes into the sutures of the skull because these areas are directly above large blood vessels, increasing the chances of the patient bleeding out, Kalisher says.</p> \n<p>In this case, the local surgeon could not have known that this patient had an additional, anomalous suture on the forehead.</p> \n<p>“Obviously, it didn’t end well, but we can’t say whether the surgery killed him,” Kalisher notes. “This person had lived with disease for a long time and things must have been escalating for there to be a need for this surgery, so he may have been already dying at the time.”</p> \n<p>Not all researchers are convinced the procedure can be described as a trephination. Had it been done for medical purposes, a round hole would have been drilled into the skull, because this facilitated healing, postulates Israel Hershkovitz, a Tel Aviv University physical anthropologist who did not participate in the study. The fact that the hole in this case was roughly square, suggests it was done for ritual or even violent purposes, he suggests..</p> \n<p>A good 'hood</p> \n<p>While the exact cause of death for both brothers remains unclear, what is clear is that in death they continued to be respected and cared for. The two men were found buried close to the city’s Late Bronze Age palace, in an area where archaeologist have found remains of solidly-built houses and evidence of higher-quality food, says Israel Finkelstein, the Tel Aviv University archaeologist who directs the dig at Megiddo.</p> \n<p>The tomb of the brothers was dug almost exactly above a recently-discovered elite burial which included three skeletons adorned with silver and gold jewelry.</p> \n<p>This so-called “royal tomb” predated the brothers’ burial by about a century, though it is likely that the two were linked, says Finkelstein: “It is not a coincidence that [the brothers] were buried so close: they must have known that this previous important tomb was there and they tried to connect to it, either for ritual purposes or because there was some dynastic link.”</p> \n<p>In the case of the brothers, the funerary offerings were dignified if not as lavish as in the older tomb. Archaeologists found pottery vases, including a bichrome jug imported from Cyprus decorated with the image of a fish and a bird, and a single bead decorating one of the skulls.</p> \n<p>Some 3600 years ago, Megiddo was one of the most important and prosperous Canaanite cities, controlling one of the main international trade routes running through the Levant. Shortly after the brothers’ death, in the mid 15th century B.C.E., it was conquered by the Egyptians and would later feature prominently in the biblical narrative. It was the site of numerous bloody battles throughout the centuries, likely spawning the prophecy that the final conflict between good and evil would take place there, at Armageddon (a Greek corruption of the Hebrew name Har Megiddo – Mount Megiddo).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But the tomb of the Canaanite brothers is a reminder that Megiddo was not just the site of biblical stories and apocalyptic prophecies: it was a spot that was inhabited for some 6,000 years by real people with real lives.</p> \n<p>It’s impossible to say what exactly motivated the people of Megiddo to support the two brothers during their difficult existence. But Kalisher notes the apparent universal drive in human and even, as said, pre-human civilizations to care for those who cannot provide for themselves. The Neanderthals line split off from Homo sapiens around 700,000 years ago, it seems. If they cared for their disabled kin as we do, it indicates that our ancestors may have as well.</p> \n<p>In fact, archaeologists have recently confessed to some surprise at the apparent prevalence of disability in the prehistoric and ancient world. One possible explanation for the high rate of prehistoric disability, suggested by Erik Trinkaus of Washington University who identified 75 malformations in 66 sets of ancient remains over 200,000 years, is inbreeding.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>As for the Canaanites who cared for the malformed brothers, we can't know anything about&nbsp; their emotional motivation, Kalisher says. &quot;We can’t say for a fact that this was done out of compassion and that they loved their disabled babies as much as their other babies. But they were definitely cared for and I would be very surprised if there wasn’t also an emotional bond involved.”</p>",

The cabinet approved the resolution granting national priority status to some isolated West Bank settlements, among other locations.</p> \n<p>Mendelblit wrote in an unusually strongly worded letter that Galant submitted to the cabinet resolution without having it reviewed and approved by the attorney general's office, and without giving the members of the cabinet time to study it.</p> \n<p>The Housing Ministry’s new National Priorities Map is a list of locales eligible for funding to cover planning and development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In his letter, the existence of which was initially reported by Army Radio and which was also obtained by Haaretz, Mendelblit said he only learned about the resolution from his office's representative at the cabinet meeting, even though Galant had been advised that he was required to get advance approval before introducing it. Galant's office declined to comment for this report.</p> \n<p>The resolution will benefit West Bank settlements including Migron, Kerem Re'im and Shvut Rachel.

        "text":["<p>One of Avigdor Lieberman’s last actions before resigning as defense minister was an abortive attempt to place the ministry’s own security department under his direct authority.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is also the defense minister, is reviewing the affair.</p> \n<p>The Defense Ministry’s security department is among the state’s most highly classified units; little has been disclosed about it over the years. Known by its Hebrew acronym, Malmab, and under the authority of the ministry’s director general, the department is responsible for the security of the ministry itself and its facilities, Israel’s arms industry, the nuclear research center in the Negev and other security bodies.</p> \n<p>Malmab officials visit installations and investigate corruption and leaks of classified material. The Defense Ministry does not disclose the activities or budget of Malmab, which has been headed for the past three years by Nir Ben-Moshe.</p> \n<p>Over the years Malmab has amassed powers and status. Some have described it as an intelligence agency in addition to Military Intelligence, the Shin Bet security service and the Mossad. But the public knows even less about Malmab than it does about these agencies.</p> \n<p>External oversight of the department is mainly by the State Comptroller’s Office and meetings of the intelligence subcommittee of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.</p> \n<p>In recent years Malmab has been mentioned as having investigated aspects of the Defense Ministry’s actions after the so-called Harpaz affair blew up.</p> \n<p>The department was also mentioned as warning journalists not to release details of a planned attack in Syria against its nuclear facility in September 2007.</p> \n<p>Lieberman initiated a number of meetings in the past few months on bringing Malmab under his direct authority. A senior security official involved in the matter told Haaretz that Lieberman believed that Malmab should report directly to the defense minister rather than to the ministry’s director general, like the ministry’s other administrative departments.</p> \n<p>According to Lieberman, shortening the chain of command would make Malmab more efficient.</p> \n<p>Defense Ministry Director General Udi Adam opposed the decision, saying that removing Malmab from his authority would put the department in disarray.</p> \n<p>Although it was never said outright, as far as is known, it seems that the professionals in the ministry were also against the idea that a body with such extensive intelligence and investigative capabilities would be directly under the authority of a political official, the defense minister.</p> \n<p>Although discussion of the matter ended with Lieberman’s decision to take direct control of Malmab, and a document was apparently issued on the matter, the decision was not implemented.</p> \n<p>Shortly thereafter, Lieberman announced his resignation in protest against the government’s policies vis-a-vis the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>When he announced his resignation, about two weeks ago, he called the cease-fire arranged with the Gaza Strip “surrender to terror.” Lieberman noted a number of disagreements that had emerged recently between him and Netanyahu on issues like brining fuel and money from Qatar to the Strip and the postponement of the evacuation of the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Lieberman also called Israel’s conduct with regard to Gaza “weak,” and said: “What we are doing now as a country is buying short-term quiet at the cost of our long-term security.”</p> \n<p>According to Lieberman, the security cabinet and the government were responsible for this. “I have no complaints against the security establishment – the political echelon failed,” he added.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Seeing the president of Chad, Idriss Deby, shaking hands with Netanyahu and touring Yad Vashem&nbsp; while in Israel this week did little to arouse emotions like, say, Sadat’s address to Knesset or Rabin and Arafat at the White House.</p> \n<p>It’s not just that Chad ranks among the bottom three countries in the world for democratic rights. After all, Israel happily maintains relations with human rights sinkholes like China, Russia and Egypt because economics or the politics demand it. There’s a strategic logic for getting cozy with Saudi Arabia to face off their common Iranian enemy.</p> \n<p>But Israel doesn’t need to succumb to realpolitik vis a vis Chad, an impoverished landlocked country of little importance in the world community.</p> \n<p>The only argument that can be made for making friends with Chad and others like it reportedly waiting in the wings, such as Sudan and Bahrain, is that they are Muslim countries. Israel is sending the world the message that the Palestinians are of no consequence even to their Arab and Muslim brothers. If so, as Bibi asked a year ago, why should Europe care either?</p> \n<p>Palestinians who?</p> \n<p>In fact, the Palestinians have been knocked off the top of the world’s agenda, and not just because of Donald Trump. After 70 inconclusive years, fatigue has set in for much of the world, and the chaos that resulted from the Arab Spring and Iranian ambitions have created much more serious problems for the Middle East.</p> \n<p>Bibi’s diplomatic drive to diminish the Palestinians’ standing in world priorities is wasted energy and it is generating rapidly diminishing returns as we curry favor with countries that offer little back.</p> \n<p>Are there bigger reasons to pursue relations with the Arab and Muslim world?</p> \n<p>Theoretically, it could eventually lead to diplomatic relations and usher in an area of peace and stability. But the reality is that we’re unlikely to see anything like that in our lifetimes, unless Israel were to reach an agreement with the Palestinians – which is exactly what Bibi is trying to avoid with his campaign for closer ties. Arab leaders like Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed Bin Salman may see a strategic logic in doing business with Israel, but the Palestinians cause remains sacred to the Arab public. It would take a courageous leader to risk defying it, and there would have to be tangible benefits.</p> \n<p>Secrets and ties</p> \n<p>One of those could be economic. The argument goes that as Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf oil countries seek to diversify by turning themselves into service-based, high-tech economies, Israeli technology could play a major role. A Brookings Institution report on “Why everyone loves Israel now” published earlier this year suggested that has been one of the factors moving Israel and the Gulf states closer together.</p> \n<p>In fact, there is a surprisingly large amount of trade between Israel and the Gulf. A study by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change estimates that Israel exported $1 billion just to Gulf Cooperation Countries alone in 2016, all via third countries.</p> \n<p>We don’t know for a fact what Israel is selling these countries since official trade figures don’t reveal anything.</p> \n<p>However, we can get a hint from leaks to the media, like the story about the Israeli firm NSO’s offering to sell the Saudis cellphone-hacking technology or the approach made to former prime minister Ehud Barak for the Saudis to acquire Israeli cybersecurity equipment. Those deals apparently never happened, but the $1 billion shows that others no doubt did. The Saudis aren’t buying a billion dollars’ worth of Bamba peanut puffs and Ahava skin treatments.&nbsp;Even Chad reportedly sees purchasing Israeli weapons as a key to its new-found friendship with Israel.</p> \n<p>The Tony Blair Institute says that “under normal trading conditions” (presumably meaning diplomatic relations and direct trade links), Israel could be exporting as much as $25 billion a year to the GCC countries and Iraq. Now, that’s real business.</p> \n<p>But it isn’t going to happen anytime soon. Besides the fact that none of the Gulf countries have shown much inclination to engage in an open and public dialogue with Israel, much less to normalize ties, you have to make two assumptions that that kind of trade can happen.</p> \n<p>One is that the Gulf countries need specifically Israeli technology. It’s true that Israel specializes in the kind of tech the Arab world needs, in water, agriculture and renewable energy. But it’s not as if these technologies aren’t available elsewhere from companies and countries that have long been present in the Gulf, know the system and know which hands to grease. Even if Israeli companies were welcome, they would struggle to compete.</p> \n<p>The other assumption is that the diversification Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries aspire to will actually get off the ground. No doubt they need to do something, but the kind of advanced economy MBS and others are envisioning won’t be easy to pull off.</p> \n<p>Making the transition from a rentier economy based on oil profits into one based on entrepreneurialism and innovation isn’t the kind of thing you can order from the top by putting into place a few reforms and spending hundreds of billions of dollars. It requires the kind of human capital and political freedoms the Gulf doesn’t have and won’t have anytime soon.</p> \n<p>The region has changed a lot since Shimon Peres articulated his grand vision of a “New Middle East” generation ago, but it hasn’t changed that much. The beautiful friendship of Israeli technology and Arab capital is a long way off and may never happen.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The ultra-Orthodox political leadership is destroying the State of Israel. Literally.</p> \n<p>It is dismantling the economic foundations of the Jewish state by preventing Haredi Jews from becoming productive citizens in a modern, developed economy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It is humiliating these Jews by depriving them of the dignity of earning a living and supporting their children and families.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel Is Not Becoming a Jewish Fundamentalist State</p> \n<p>It is alienating non-Haredi Israelis, who must bear the burdens of taxation and army service that the Haredim have forsaken.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And if all this were not enough, it continues to insult and offend Diaspora Jewry by engaging in non-stop name-calling and creating a malignant alliance between the institutions of government and the institutions of religion.</p> \n<p>Of course, it professes to be acting in the name of Jewish tradition, but is actually distorting and besmirching that tradition for its own narrow purposes. Lovers of Torah can only weep.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These are harsh words. But it is too late for delicacy or euphemisms.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israelis know how to deal with security problems. They know what to do when Hezbollah, Hamas, Syria, and Iran threaten Israel with military action. But what happens when they are attacked from within, by corrupt religious parties known for their lies and political horse-trading, camouflaged by a thick layer of religious sanctimony?</p> \n<p>In such cases, Israel’s political elites - Haredi and non-Haredi alike -generally prefer not to confront the problem at all.</p> \n<p>Neither side can imagine a historic cataclysm that will finally end the massive machinery of religious coercion that the Haredim have established,&nbsp;which is the cause of the mess Israel is in. Both sides assume, fatalistically, that the status quo can continue forever. Even when, as is now the case, it clearly cannot.</p> \n<p>Consider the following: Professor Dan Ben-David of Tel Aviv University, President of the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research, has issued a&nbsp;report entitled &quot;Overpopulation and demography in Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>Ben-David is worried that in 40 years, Israel will be more crowded than any country in the world, except for Bangladesh. He notes that it is already the fourth most crowded country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of 34 developed countries.</p> \n<p>And why this worry? Because Israel has a very high birthrate, which is usually a blessing.</p> \n<p>But this high birthrate&nbsp;comes alongside a long list of deeply troubling conditions: Israel’s rate of poverty is exceedingly high when compared with other OECD countries; its labor productivity is disturbingly low, and continuing to fall; its dependency rate is the highest in the OECD - meaning that it has the highest ratio of non-working adults to working adults; and most distressing of all, its public education is a resounding failure.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The literacy and mathematical skills of its students, as measured in international exams, are far below&nbsp;those of&nbsp;the vast majority of OECD students. Indeed, the overpopulation crisis is really an education crisis. Israel is a developed country and the so-called &quot;Start-Up Nation,&quot; but as the Shoresh report shows, a substantial segment of its citizens receives a Third World education.</p> \n<p>To say that this picture is a grim one is an understatement. But the report is thorough and the data are compelling. And the most important conclusion that emerges is that two communities - Haredim and Arabic-speaking Israelis - are key to the educational and economic crisis in which Israel finds herself.</p> \n<p>Of course, this conclusion is not really news. Israelis have long known that the Haredi and Israeli Arab communities have the highest percentage of poorly skilled adults, the lowest percentage of employed people, and the most sub-par outcomes in the educational testing of their children.</p> \n<p>What is new, as Ben-David demonstrates, is that as poverty deepens, inequality in Israeli society is growing dramatically worse. The huge gaps between Israel’s various population subgroups have reached shameful levels, unacceptable by any moral, civic, or political standard.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Also new, and very important, is the fact that things are getting better among Israeli Arabs and worse among Israeli Haredim.</p> \n<p>Israel’s government, to its credit, is in the midst of a five-year plan for economic improvement in the Arab sector. And while there is much yet to do, government figures published last week in the financial newspaper&nbsp;Calcalist showed a dramatic increase in the employment of Arab women over the past year.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the second quarter of 2017, 35% of Arab women were employed; a year later, the number was 40%. Since the underemployment of women is the major economic problem for the Arab sector, these figures are indicative of a significant turnaround. The&nbsp;shrinking of the Arab birthrate from 4.5% to 3.1% in the last 20 years also indicates educational and economic progress for Israeli Arab women.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Among Haredim, the opposite is happening.</p> \n<p>There, the problem is not the employment rate of women but of men, who are directed by their rabbis to forsake the labor market for full-time Torah study. In the 1980s, the employment rate for Haredi men was 64%.&nbsp;In 2015, slightly less than 54% of Haredi men were employed. Two years later, that number had dropped to 51%.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;What the Radicalization of Israel's ultra-Orthodox Community Looks Like From the Inside</p> \n<p>Some suggest that statistics notwithstanding, there are reasons for optimism. Various observers have argued that turmoil in the Haredi world is certain to generate change, sooner rather than later. In this view, access to the internet and smartphones has liberated young Haredi men and women from the isolation to which they had long been condemned.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Even more important, the argument goes, the current rabbinic leaders lack the spiritual authority of their predecessors. They are seen more as political hacks than giants of Torah. And the Haredi parties, once able to articulate common values, have collapsed into an endless cycle of petty bickering and internal upheaval.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The result is that the masses of young Haredi men are challenging the rabbis whose edicts are keeping them in desperate poverty. Why, these young men wonder, must they be confined to the four walls of the yeshiva?</p> \n<p>It has begun to occur to them that they can remain fervently religious and still be productive, contributing members of society. They can have careers, make a living, support their families, and still find time for study of Torah. And it also has occurred to them that the politicos in religious garb who are directing their lives may be doing so more out of self-interest and a need for control than&nbsp;out of&nbsp;reverence for tradition.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, while all of these things are true, it is also true that actual change is impossible without government intervention.</p> \n<p>If you are Haredi, dissatisfied with your lot, and want to enter a profession, how are you to do so without an education? As Professor Ben-David makes clear, the only answer to Israel’s economic woes is &quot;opening the education floodgates and letting the knowledge already existing in its best higher education institutions flow to every school in Israel - with particular emphasis on the areas currently receiving a Third World education.&quot;</p> \n<p>What this means is that Haredi schools in Israel must be obligated to do what every other school in Israel does: Teach the &quot;core curriculum,&quot; consisting of English, math, civics and science. Such studies, of course, would be alongside traditional Torah study.</p> \n<p>In fact, regulations now exist mandating this requirement, but the Haredi schools&nbsp;ignore them, and are allowed to do so.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And enforcing these regulations will not happen through pleading or persuasion, but only through compulsion, with every cent of government funding to be forfeited if the requirement is ignored. The argument that schools will get there on their own is ridiculous. Unless arms are twisted, the rabbinical bureaucrats running these schools will resist at every turn, and decades will pass before the required changes are introduced.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But as Dr. Ben-David makes abundantly clear, Israel cannot wait that long. Israel is a country at war, and the existence of &quot;Third World education&quot; in Israel is an existential threat, no less serious than the one posed by hostile neighbors and Iran.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And this too: Torah study is not in any sense inconsistent with secular learning. The greatest rabbinic scholars of all eras and of all camps have always combined their Torah learning with secular studies.</p> \n<p>Maimonides studied astronomy, medicine, mathematics and philosophy. The Vilna Gaon, a proponent of Haskalah,&nbsp;or education,&nbsp;studied history, philosophy, literature, and science. &quot;The Rav&quot; - Rabbi Joseph Ber Soloveitchik - was a titan of Talmudic learning who completed his Ph.D. in philosophy in Berlin, with a thesis on the epistemology of Hermann Cohen. And the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, both took courses at the Sorbonne and completed a degree in mechanical and electrical engineering in Paris.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For all of these rabbis, their Torah studies were, of course, primary. But they also saw secular and humanistic studies as being of real importance and as promoting the service of God. When we add to that the practical consideration that, in every period of Jewish history but our own, religious Jews - except for a tiny elite of brilliant scholars - were expected to work and provide for their families, the case for secular studies is overwhelming.</p> \n<p>But Israel’s government pays no heed. Instead, they make the absurd claim that the problem can be addressed through&nbsp;a bill to draft ultra-Orthodox&nbsp;youth now being negotiated with the coalition parties and the courts. More Haredi young men will enter the army, they suggest, and then will build on their army training to acquire professional training.</p> \n<p>It is not clear if this bill will ever pass, but what is clear is that it is a joke. Haredi enlistments will be increased a tiny bit, if at all.</p> \n<p>And more important, for those who finish the army, it will be too late. Serious secular education must begin at age 5, not at age 25. But fearing the wrath of the ultra-Orthodox parties, the government refuses to insist on core studies in the Haredi sector.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Professor Ben-David has performed an important service for the State of Israel. He has reminded all Israelis of the existence in the Jewish state of &quot;Third World education,&quot; which is both a profound embarrassment and a threat to security.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And he has reminded ultra-Orthodox authorities that they have allowed their isolationism and defensiveness to deprive their young people of what they need and what tradition allows. It is now up to Israel’s secular parties, on both the right and the left, to take action - before it is too late.</p> \n<p>Eric H.

        "text":["<p>When it comes to symbolism, Jerusalem gets the Israeli government’s attention. In the past year alone, it has lobbied for the United States to move its embassy to the capital, helped arrange to have a leg of the Giro d’Italia bicycle race held there, and unsuccessfully sought to move a high-profile soccer match between Israel and Argentina to the city.</p> \n<p>But while the government never forgets Jerusalem when it comes to symbols, the city’s socioeconomic ranking has been falling steadily. On Wednesday, the Central Bureau of Statistics said it slid another notch to Cluster 2, the second-lowest group out of 10.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The latest decline follows a rapid descent for Jerusalem on the CBS rankings. Two years ago it fell from fourth lowest decile to third lowest, in 2004 from fifth lowest decile to fourth lowest.</p> \n<p>The CBS ranking is not about the city’s finances but about its residents. It measures a host of factors like average levels of education, standard of living, rate of employment, percentage of families with four or more children and percentage of elderly getting income support.</p> \n<p>The CBS even looks at obscure data like the number of days a year residents spend on vacations or business abroad, and how much they pay on average to renew their car registration. The latter figure gives an indirect indicator of family wealth because the fee goes down with the age of the car. That, says the CBS, helps detect unreported income.</p> \n<p>The CBS rankings, which are published every two years, have become a sort of status symbol for residents of the 255 local authorities and 982 other communities covered in the survey. Savyon, the tony Tel Aviv suburb, ranked the highest in the latest survey while the Bedouin local authority Midbar Hanegev was the lowest.</p> \n<p>Jerusalem wasn’t the only city to see its ranking fall; seven others did as well, while 26 raised theirs. Moreover, Jerusalem’s parameters haven’t declined so much as others have improved more quickly. For instance, the city’s median income level rose since the last survey.</p> \n<p>Status or not, for municipal officials, there is a practical incentive to push for a lower ranking. Local authorities get more government aid for things like daycare subsidies the lower their socioeconomic profile.</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv-Jaffa, which was ranked right, has sought to get the CBS to counts its big population of asylum seekers in its survey, which would give a more accurate picture of the city’s population and entitle it to more aid. Menachem Leibe, the city’s director general, said when the last survey was released in 2016 said its eight ranking was “a serious distortion of reality.”</p> \n<p>The CBS answered that it couldn’t gather quality data on asylum seekers and that was why it had left them out.</p> \n<p>When Jerusalem’s ranking fell to three in 2016, the city expressed satisfaction. “Putting Jerusalem in Cluster 3 more faithfully reflects the city, as we have sought for some time, and will enable us to get bigger budgets for Jerusalem and improve distributive justice,” it said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This week, however, the city was less happy with its downgrade, saying the index contained “serious distortions” and “even partial data from 2015.”</p> \n<p>It said programs by the city has led to a decline in unemployment and poverty and a rise in the labor force participation rate, including in the high-tech industry. Fewer young families are leaving the city and money has been invested in infrastructure and public translation.</p> \n<p>“Mayor [Nir] Barkat has an uncompromising campaign with the Finance Ministry to increase budgets to Jerusalem to maintain these positive trends,” a city spokesman said. “Unfortunately, the writing has been on the wall for years, and the treasury… has never presented a strategic plan for the capital. Increasing the budget to the capital is a national interest of the highest importance.”</p> \n<p>With reporting by Hagai Amit</p>",

        "text":["<p>In a ruling that could make it easier for investigators to use harsh interrogation tactics against Palestinians, the High Court of Justice said this week the severe tactics used against one Palestinian were legitimate because he was suspected of knowing the location of a weapons cache.</p> \n<p>The court therefore rejected Fares Tbeish’s petition against the closure of an investigation into Shin Bet security service interrogators whom he accused of torturing him.</p> \n<p>Tbeish, a 40-year-old resident of the West Bank, was arrested in 2011 on suspicion of membership in Hamas and arms dealing. He was kept in administrative detention, or arrest without trial, for a year. Investigators believed he knew the location of an arms cache containing at least 10 weapons, including rifles.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The Shin Bet told the judge it wasn't torturing Palestinians. The scene next door proved otherwise</p> \n<p>After harsh tactics were used in his interrogation, he disclosed the cache’s location. This information also led to the arrest of other Hamas operatives, including one who confessed to having planned to kidnap an Israeli.</p> \n<p>Tbeish and the state ultimately reached a plea bargain in which he admitted to being a member of Hamas’ military wing, hiding weapons for the organization and transferring seven weapons to other Hamas members. He was sentenced to three years in prison.</p> \n<p>After his conviction, Tbeish filed a complaint with the Shin Bet ombudsman, aided by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. He said his interrogators had threatened to harm him, his family and his home. They also deprived him of sleep, hit him, kept him in the “banana position” – with his back bent over a chair and his hands and feet cuffed together – shook him so hard he lost consciousness, and kept him on a chair with his hands cuffed painfully behind the chair back.</p> \n<p>The ombudsman, Col. (res.) Jana Mudzgurishvilly, investigated the complaint, but in 2016 she closed the case. Tbeish then petitioned the High Court with the help of the Public Committee Against Torture.</p> \n<p>But justices Yosef Elron, Isaac Amit and David Mintz rejected the petition, in a ruling that could have far-reaching implications for the way Shin Bet interrogations are conducted.</p> \n<p>Elron, writing for the court, said that even though harsh tactics were used against Tbeish, he had failed to prove that they constituted torture. The petition presented medical evidence that Tbeish suffered from toothache, swelling, constricted movement in his knee, vision problems and leg pains. But Elron said these were not enough to prove that he had been tortured.</p> \n<p>'Special methods'</p> \n<p>The Shin Bet acknowledged using “special methods” to interrogate him, but it detailed these tactics in an ex parte hearing, without Tbeish or his lawyer present.</p> \n<p>“These methods didn’t include using violence against the petitioner in the manner he described in the complaint and the petition,” Elron said. “Under the circumstances, and after examining the classified material submitted to us, I was convinced that the use of these special methods in the petitioner’s interrogation is covered by the necessity exception.”</p> \n<p>That was a reference to the High Court’s famous 1999 ruling barring the Shin Bet from using torture, which included one exception – an investigator who used violent tactics would not be criminally liable if these tactics were necessary to save a life.</p> \n<p>The metaphor the court used in that ruling was a ticking bomb. If the Shin Bet captured a suspect who knew where a bomb was but refused to tell, investigators would not be guilty of a crime if they used violence to get him to reveal its location before it exploded.</p> \n<p>The 1999 ruling stressed that harsh tactics were permissible only if it was important to obtain answers quickly. But Elron said necessity should be interpreted “in light of Israel’s complex security situation.”</p> \n<p>“The petitioner is active in a terrorist organization that had committed and continued to commit serious terror attacks,” he wrote. “In this context, the petitioner was party to a plot to amass many dangerous weapons with the intent to use them to perpetrate terrorist activity. The planned attack, had it been carried out, could have claimed lives.”</p> \n<p>Elron added: “This fear of a tangible risk of serious harm to human lives ... created, in his interrogators’ view, a need to use special interrogation tactics to thwart the danger immediately.”</p> \n<p>In Amit's concurring opinion, he acknowledged that this case “isn’t the classic case of a ticking bomb that could explode within minutes,” but he agreed with Elron that the need to find the cache before it was used justified the harsh tactics.</p> \n<p>'Letting the Knesset avoid responsibility'</p> \n<p>Prof. Barak Medina, rector of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and one of the country’s leading experts on constitutional law and human rights, told Haaretz that the ruling was liable to expand the security services’ ability to use violence when interrogating suspected terrorists.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t a formal permit, but in practice, yes. In any case where special methods are used, it’s necessary to ensure that they don’t amount to torture,” Medina said.</p> \n<p>“But there’s no open discussion about the severity of these methods. The use of special methods is permitted only when there’s prior knowledge – for instance, because the interrogee confessed – that he has relevant information that he’s concealing.”</p> \n<p>But Medina said the new ruling could be interpreted as allowing these methods against anyone connected to a terrorist organization who is suspected of possessing arms.</p> \n<p>“There’s a significant expansion here of the circumstances in which it’s permissible to use special methods, because there’s no demand for high probability that these methods will indeed be necessary to obtain this information,” he said.</p> \n<p>Harsh tactics “aren’t a punishment but a means to obtain information, so the issue of the interrogee’s direct involvement in the expected attack isn’t necessary per se as a justification for using these methods,” Medina added. “This shows the very problematic nature of this whole doctrine because it means the severity of the act attributed to the interrogee isn’t important in justifying [tactics that] cause him great harm.”</p> \n<p>Moreover, Medina said, the court is essentially letting the Knesset avoid responsibility for regulating this issue in legislation. The 1999 ruling said the use of harsh tactics in interrogations was an issue on which the Knesset should decide – “not the attorney general, not the Shin Bet director and not the interrogators. But this ruling allows the Knesset to continue remaining silent and the Shin Bet to use investigative powers that it doesn’t have officially.”</p> \n<p>The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel is also deeply concerned about a remark by Mintz in his concurring opinion in which he referred to “the rule stating that torture is forbidden except in extremely exceptional cases.” This phrase might suggest that even harsher tactics than those used today could be legitimate in “extremely exceptional cases,” the committee warned.</p> \n<p>The court’s decision, said attorney Efrat Bergman-Sapir of the committee, “is liable to be interpreted as a significant retreat from the moral, ethical and legal stance laid down in the foundational ruling on torture from 1999, which held that the ban on torture is absolute, with no exceptions.”</p> \n<p>No less worrying, she added, was the court’s expansion of the term “ticking bomb” to include cases in which interrogators know “that there is no ticking bomb in the sense of certainty and immediacy.”</p> \n<p>Tbeish himself was upset that the court rejected his account of the harshness of the tactics against him.</p> \n<p>“I thought there was justice in your court,” he said. “But in the end, what can I say? I raise my hands to heaven. Justice, it seems to me, doesn’t exist in this life, only in heaven.”</p> \n<p>Referring to the military judge to whom he showed the marks on his legs and other parts of his body after his interrogation, he added, “Why didn’t the judge say back then that I was lying? They hurt me.”</p> \n<p>Finally, he denied the accusation – to which he confessed in the plea deal – that he stored weapons for Hamas. He admitted that he has ties to the organization but said the weapons were meant for his personal defense in violent conflicts in his village.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Quentin Tarantino has only ever featured one wedding in his movies – and that ended in a bloodbath. Luckily, things passed more quietly when Daniella Pick walked down the aisle to exchange vows with the filmmaker in Los Angeles on Wednesday evening.</p> \n<p>In the Tel Aviv studio of up-and-coming bridal gown designer Dana Harel, a mannequin in Pick’s measurements had been awaiting this very moment for a year.</p> \n<p>“I have an old vintage mannequin that’s exactly her measurements,” Harel says. “I usually have to pad the mannequins with acrylic and wrap them in cling wrap, like schnitzel. But Daniella has an old-fashioned body, with a small torso and very long legs – a little like the pinup girls of the 1950s; compact and feminine proportions. She carries dresses really well.”</p> \n<p>Over the past year, Harel’s studio sent no fewer than four different white dresses to Pick in Tinseltown. Two of them were worn at her engagement parties in Tel Aviv and Hollywood, while the other two were revealed on the wedding day. Like most of her new husband’s films, the dresses have attracted positive reviews.</p> \n<p>“Daniella likes clean and classic designs, which is also what suits her,” Harel says. The designer, speaking to Haaretz before Pick’s big day, explained how she designed an outfit for the wedding ceremony with a small, shiny bodice and an A-line skirt. A second dress, worn at the wedding reception at an L.A. restaurant, featured straps studded with Swarovski stones and a deep open back. The designer promised that the bride would be “able to dance freely in it.”</p> \n<p>Pick and Harel’s relationship actually predates that of the bride and groom, with the singer-model one of Harel’s first customers while she was working out of her home in Ramat Hasharon, north of Tel Aviv, some eight years ago.</p> \n<p>“I love Daniella,” says the designer. “She’s a one-off, a real character. We vaguely kept in touch since that sale, and then she met Quentin. That was like, WTF! I couldn’t believe I had some connection to him – it’s like that game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. The connection to Tarantino was only two steps away. It’s wild!”</p> \n<p>Harel met the director in person during a trip to Los Angeles earlier this year. “I cleared a place in my schedule for dinner,” she recalls, laughing. “We went out to dinner – Quentin, Daniella and I. Of course, I took a tranquilizer beforehand because I adore his work. ‘Reservoir Dogs’ is my favorite movie.” She didn’t receive an invitation to the wedding, though, which was by all accounts an intimate affair.</p> \n<p>Under the radar</p> \n<p>Dana Harel is not your typical bridal gown designer. In jeans, sweatshirt, septum ring and a line of piercings in her ear, she welcomes me to her new studio in Kikar Hamedina, the center of Tel Aviv’s high fashion scene even if it has known better decades. Until it opened two months ago, she had been working from her Ramat Hasharon home – mostly under the radar of the local fashion scene.</p> \n<p>“Since first grade I’ve been an outsider, but I don’t know if ‘typical’ is what it takes” to succeed, she says. “I am me. I don’t know how to define the ‘scene’ in order to distinguish myself from it. Since childhood I’ve been dressing Barbie dolls and tying the dresses on them differently – a total clich&eacute;.</p> \n<p>“I always feel I’m an alternative to what exists because I don’t like bridal gowns that much myself,” she confesses. “So I do my thing – an alternative to lace materials and ‘mermaid’ styles. If I were getting married now, I would want to come to me. I feel uncomfortable at industry events; I’m a quiet and shy person, I prefer to simply work and be behind the scenes. And my clients allow me to do that.”</p> \n<p>The Tel Aviv native is 36, married and a mother of three. She studied psychology and literature at Tel Aviv University, with mentors like local poets Nurit Zarchi and Dory Manor. “I thought I would be a psychologist, but after five years I realized it would be better if I weren’t a therapist,” Harel recounts. “My level of identification was so high that if someone told me he was the Messiah, I would have told him, ‘Wow, that’s great! We’ve been waiting for you!’”</p> \n<p>It was at university that she met the renowned mentalist Nimrod Harel (he prefers the term “perception artist”), who was studying for a master’s degree in literature at the time, just for fun. The designer admits their first meeting was “pretty terrible.”</p> \n<p>She recalls: “I had a really good friend and we wanted to read each other’s minds – she would think of a number and I would try to guess it. We were bored and wanted to study under Nimrod Harel, who at the time had a television show on which he read minds. I googled him and found some short stories he had written, so emailed him. I said I’d be happy to learn from him, and I also critiqued his stories. He, of course, emailed me back, asking what I wanted from his life.” That was the start of a “half-hostile, half-sexy” correspondence between the two. “When we realized we studied at the same place, we decided to meet at the university. There was an immediate click,” she says.</p> \n<p>Like Grandma</p> \n<p>Upon graduation, Harel started to seriously consider fashion as a possible career. It wasn’t such a left-field choice as her studies made it seem. “My grandparents had a factory, Lego, in the German town of Hof, on the border with Czechoslovakia,” she says.</p> \n<p>“It was named for my grandfather, Leon Gonczarowski. My grandmother was an image consultant and fashion designer. She didn’t study it, but she was good at it. The two of them had nothing but were very resourceful. They started making socks and gradually expanded to skirts, dresses, pants, everything – and they became a really big factory that manufactured for all of Europe. As a girl we would go to Germany to visit them in the factory. I grew up with it.”</p> \n<p>It was her life partner who first encouraged Harel to study fashion, and she enrolled on a fashion design course at the Shenkar School of Engineering and Design, Ramat Gan, a decade ago. (Nimrod and Dana Harel married in 2010, with the bride wearing a ready-to-wear Christian Dior gown.) Harel was studying alongside the three women who would launch the fashion brand Tres and a future bridal gown designer Lee Petra Grebenau. But she knew she wouldn’t finish the course.</p> \n<p>“The studies were very theoretical and wonderful in their own way, but it wasn’t really connected to the woman’s body and what she wants to wear,” Harel says. “In a cold and very unglamorous calculation, I realized that if I wanted children [then], I had to start working with someone to understand how things worked, so that later I could start my own business.”</p> \n<p>So she started working under designer Lilach Elgrably and her Lilamist brand. She also designed evening dresses on the side, until she had enough to form a collection. The next step was holding home sales. One of her earliest customers was actress Yael Poliakov, who chose Harel to design her wedding dress – the first wedding gown she ever designed.</p> \n<p>“At first, the field of wedding dresses seemed very limited,” she admits. “Everything is white, there’s no range to work with, and what can you even say with it? Now, I know that these narrow constraints are good for me, because I naturally go off on tangents.”</p> \n<p>Israeli teenager Sofia Mechetner, who became the face of Dior in 2015, has become Harel’s muse and model. Harel has also designed dresses for actress Yaara Benbenishty, while supermodel Bar Refaeli has sported her designs on the Israeli version of “X Factor.” Another Israeli model, Ilanit Levi, will soon be getting married in a Harel gown.</p> \n<p>“I clicked right away with Yael Poliakov – she was pregnant and decided to get married at home, which is less formal, so we went for an Egyptian-style djellaba,” Harel recalls. “Ilanit Levi goes with the flow more than others. She trusts me.”</p> \n<p>Things were a little less straightforward with the future Mrs. Tarantino. “Daniella was very involved. It was drawn-out ping-pong,” Harel admits. “She knew exactly what was right and worked for her, up to the very last waistline inch. Anyhow, none of them was a difficult bride.”</p> \n<p>Given the media coverage given to the Tarantino wedding, Harel should expect a busy time in the coming year. “Every time a celebrity wears one of my dresses, I get a wave of brides seeking my designs,” she says. “Bar Refaeli’s impact was the strongest here, but globally the one who exposed me to a wider audience was a Philippine bride called Martine Ho [n&eacute;e Cajucom]. She’s a big reality show star over there, with millions of followers [online]. Currently, most of my followers are American, followed by Israelis and then Filipinos. I assume this will also happen with Daniella.”</p> \n<p>Harel thinks long and hard when asked who she dreams of designing for. Finally, she settles on Israeli model Noam Frost, who is soon to be married, and French actress-singer-director M&eacute;lanie Laurent, best known for her roles in “Now You See Me” and Tarantino’s “Inglorious Basterds.”</p> \n<p>Leaving the basement behind?</p> \n<p>The bridal gown market in Israel is thriving, an outlier in an otherwise beleaguered fashion scene. Designers such as Galia Lahav and Lihi Hod are enjoying great success overseas, displaying their designs at Bridal Fashion Week in New York and designing bridal gowns for major international stars (including Beyonc&eacute; and another Philippine star, Solenn Heussaff).</p> \n<p>Harel is taking small and measured steps in the market, after deciding to concentrate solely on bridal gowns only three years ago. Last April, she participated in Barcelona’s Bridal Fashion Week for the first time, and since then her designs have been sold at bridal salons in South Korea, Hong Kong, L.A. and New York. And, of course, she only relocated her studio and its eight employees out of her basement in September.</p> \n<p>She was scheduled to attend this fall’s New York Fashion Week with her father, businessman Zigi Gonczarowski. However, his sudden death in June derailed that plan. “He was on a business trip to the Czech Republic and felt unwell, and then he had an aortic rupture,” Harel recounts. “He was flown to Prague for a six-hour operation and for a while it seemed he would survive. You tell yourself, ‘OK, he’s weak, he’s not talking properly, but he has to recover.’ Then you realize he’s not recovering. He hovered between life and death for a while, until it was over – one night his heart stopped working.</p> \n<p>“That was a turning point for me,” she reflects. “I’d planned my studio with him, we’d searched for a location together, and he accompanied me during all the stages – from signing contracts to renovations. Now I’ve started there without him. In short, I’m trying to move on and do things slowly, in a way that’s pleasant for me. Life goes on.”</p> \n<p>Harel’s employees are still not seeing much daylight, since the new studio in Tel Aviv is also underground, designed by Sigal Baranowitz and Irene Goldberg. The warm, twisting space is designed with circular lines, like a rolling canvas. A row of mannequins at one end model her designs. These are feminine, minimalist, cool and clean, rich in original bead embroidery, but not too heavy. Prices range from 6,000 shekels (about $1,600) for an off-the-rack number to 22,000 shekels for a bespoke design.</p> \n<p>“There is a correlation between my style and the brides who come to me, who are generally cooler and less capricious,” Harel observes. “I’m an underdog – I always have been – and that’s how it is with my team as well. I don’t write poems any more, but the ones I did write came from the same place the dresses come from. For example, I named the last bridal collection Morning Star, since I feel everything I do describes those points between – some elusive, very atmospheric moment that mustn’t be interfered with.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel's National Water Carrier has an outsize place in the national consciousness.</p> \n<p>The formidable system of pipes, tunnels, reservoirs and open canals, one of the country’s largest infrastructure projects, was built over half a century ago to transport water from Lake Kinneret in the north to the central and southern regions.</p> \n<p>Now, as a result of the&nbsp;historically low water levels in the lake and the introduction of desalination as a major source of water, it is part of a backup system that is barely used.</p> \n<p>Soon, water will be brought from the center of the country to Lake Kinneret, also known as the Sea of Galilee. It will provide water to northern Israel and&nbsp;to Jordan, whose own drought situation is much graver than Israel’s.</p> \n<p>Work has begun recently on a pipeline and pumping facilities that in around two years’ time will bring water to the Kinneret and to the Netofa reservoir, in the Lower Galilee. At its maximum planned output, the system will be able to send 100 to 120 cubic meters (about 3,530 to 4,240 cubic feet) into the lake annually, raising the water level by nearly one meter each year. The desalination plants that have been built along the Mediterranean shore, and those that are slated to be built, should supply the required quantity of water.</p> \n<p>The infusion of water flowing into the Kinneret will help stabilize the lake’s ecosystem. However, according to Israel Water Authority chief Giora Shama the project has a strategic aim: to ensure the supply of water from the lake to the Jordan.</p> \n<p>“Lake Kinneret,” he says, “will fill up again when there is a rainy year, and then they will open the Degania Dam again,” enabling water to flow into the Jordan River. “However, Jordanians are thirsty now, and we have to abide by our commitment to provide them water from the lake.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Dead trees and dry springs: Impact of drought felt in Israel</p> \n<p>There is already an agreement between Israel and Jordan to build a desalination plant in Aqaba, on the Red Sea across from the Israeli city of Eilat. It will supply water to Jordan and to Israel’s Arava Desert. In return, Israel will increase the amount of water it provides to Jordan in the north, from Lake Kinneret. The brine discharge from the Aqaba plant, created during the desalination process, will be pumped into the Dead Sea. That, as the first stage in the Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal project, aimed at helping to reverse the decline in the Dead Sea’s water level. Current plans, however, will slow the decline in the water level at most from 1 meter to 70 centimeters annually. Its future expansion is in doubt because of its high cost.</p> \n<p>This week the water level of Lake Kinneret was 1.64 meters below the lower red line, despite the fact that there has been only minimal pumping from the lake for two years, the result a number of consecutive years of low rainfall in the north. The increased demand for water due to population growth and the fear that the rainfall will only get sparser due to climate change add to the concerns of those who are responsible for this resource.</p> \n<p>The state comptroller has severely criticized the preparations for facing these challenges. In a report issued in October, he slammed the Israel Water Authority and the National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Ministry for not doing enough to preserve the country’s natural water sources and allowing them to be overused between 2013 and 2017. It failed to build additional desalination plants in a timely manner, in particular a plant in the parched Western Galilee. Moreover, the Water Authority allowed desalination plants to suspend operations for long periods due to economic considerations dictated by the Finance Ministry. (Shaham was not the water chief during the period discussed in the report).</p> \n<p>The Water Authority argues that in no field is it possible to prepare for the most extreme situation because of the huge investments that requires. “Desalination plants take up land and also cause the emission of greenhouse gases,” Shaham noted this week.</p> \n<p>In a letter he sent to Water Authority employees after the publication of the State Comptroller’s Report, he wrote that it had created ridiculous headlines: “Why ridiculous? Because after a sequence of five years of drought, the fact that water supply in all of Israel operated flawlessly throughout the summer isn’t due to magic. The reliability of the supply in extreme situations like that cannot happen only with help from heaven. It’s a matter of large and costly infrastructures that were set up in time, preceded by planning.”</p> \n<p>He agrees that there were a number of failures. One of them was allowing for stoppages of desalination plants even when it was already clear that there are years without rainfall. “I won’t let the desalination plants stop working on my watch.” The upshot of the desalination stoppages was too much reliance during those periods on the natural water sources, including the lake. Another problem was the failure to build a desalination plant in the Western Galilee, largely due to objections from residents who did not want it near their homes. This past year, a suitable alternative site was located.</p> \n<p>Demand for compensation</p> \n<p>Another problem is the supply of water for agriculture. This week the farmers’ organization held an emergency conference at the Knesset following cuts to their water quotas and demanded monetary compensation for the damages that will be caused them. “The real problem isn’t five years of drought but rather the cynicism that is destroying Zionism,” said Kibbutz Movement Chairman Nir Meir.</p> \n<p>Meir Zur, the Moshav Movement chairman, added: “We demand compensation for the water cut so we can continue to work, before tens of thousands of dunams of land are abandoned.”</p> \n<p>Shaham says that 70 reservoirs for treated waste water are being set up around the country for agricultural irrigation. More efficient wastewater use will also help save some of the most important streams in Israel from serious pollution. In Gush Dan they have found an efficient way to treat wastewater and use it for irrigation instead of sending it into the nearby stream.</p> \n<p>“We are also making progress in dealing with the environmental disgrace of the Kidron,” says Shaham, referring to the most polluted stream between the Jordan and the Mediterranean due to the flow of waste from Jerusalem neighborhoods and Palestinian communities. The treated water will benefit both Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank.</p>",

        "text":["<p>An Israeli television channel has sparked controversy by announcing that it would broadcast videotaped remarks on Sunday by Yigal Amir, the convicted assassin of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.</p> \n<p>According to Channel 20's website, in his comments to personal associates, Amir spoke about the assassination and said: “I don’t regret it. If I regretted it, I would get a lot.&quot; If he were to express regret, Amir reportedly said, he had been offered a wedding ceremony and conjugal visits.</p> \n<p>&quot;The simplest thing is to say ‘so-and-so incited me,’ [to kill Rabin], ‘that so-and-so dispatched me, but I didn’t consult with anyone; not rabbis, not officers and not Avishai Raviv,&quot; Amir reportedly said, referring to a Shin Bet agent who was working undercover among right-wing activists around the time of the 1995 assassination. &quot;Raviv was...a problematic personality. He is not a person who can influence anything. The whole story that the Shin Bet influenced [me] is foolishness.”</p> \n<p>According to the website of Channel 20, which bills its programming as &quot;Zionist and pro-Israeli&quot; and is due to broadcast the comments at 7 P.M. on Sunday, Amir added: “This is the left wing tainting the doormat right. All along the way, I have said that I did this on my own and that nobody sent me — and only because of the silence at the time, to stop Oslo,” a reference to the peace process with the Palestinians that was underway&nbsp; when Amir assassinated the prime minister.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Netanyahu’s current politics reopen 23-year-old wound of Rabin’s assassination | Analysis ■&nbsp;Rabin’s man in Oslo analyzes what went wrong – and right – with the 1993 accords</p> \n<p>“I wasn’t even a settler. I stopped the establishment of a Palestinian state,” Amir declared, according to Channel 20 .</p> \n<p>In an apparent attempt to reduce criticism of the station, which also recently took heat for hosting Yitzhak Gabai, convicted of an arson attack at an Arab-Jewish bilingual school in Jerusalem, the Channel 20 website noted that it “condemns and takes exception to the vile murder of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.”</p> \n<p>In the past, Channel 2 News and Channel 10 News conducted an interview with Amir, but broadcast of the interview was scrapped at the last moment.</p> \n<p>In response to the scheduled airing of Amir's comments on Channel 20, the Israel Prison Service said: “In light of the reports regarding an interview to be made public with prisoner Yigal Amir, the prisoner was interviewed this morning by the commander of the wing in Rimonim prison where he is being held in solitary confinement. The prisoner denies the reports regarding an interview he gave and said he does not intend to be interviewed.” According to the prison service, “Yigal Amir has access to a telephone, a lawyer and family visits. It is unlikely that a camera was brought in without our knowledge.”</p> \n<p>On the Channel 20 program last month with Yitzhak Gabai, the school arsonist, Gabai said: “I don’t regret setting fire to the school. I regret that I sat in jail, but I have paid the price.”</p> \n<p>That sparked protests from many quarters on social media, including right-wing figures and people who have worked at the station.</p> \n<p>The Second Television and Radio Authority said it would take action against the station, and the following day, the station’s editors apologized for the interview, which had been light-hearted in tone. They acknowledged that it had “exceeded all acceptable norms.”</p> \n<p>Last week, Channel 20 was fined 100,000 shekels ($26,800) for refusing to feature Reform and Conservative Jews on the station, in violation of the terms of its broadcast license.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The High Court of Justice granted on Sunday the state a six-week extension fo rthe annulment of a law allowing an exemption from the national military draft for ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students, which was slated to expire at midnight on Saturday night.</p> \n<p>The government, which sought an extension until the end of the Knesset's winter term on March 31, now has until January 15 to pass new legislation on drafting ultra-Orthodox men to the military.</p> \n<p>In September 2017, the court ruled that the existing law, which was crafted by the Defense Ministry, was unlawful, but said it would remain in force for another year to give the government time to enact new legislation. In July 2018, the government requested an extension until March&nbsp;&nbsp;31, but the court agreed to push the deadline back only until December 1.</p> \n<p>So far, the coalition has failed to find a legislative solution that all the parties it includes can support. Two of the three ultra-Orthodox parties – Degal Hatorah, which comprises half the United Torah Judaism joint ticket, and Shas – have agreed not to oppose the bill in exchange for a promise that far-reaching changes will be made to it after next year’s elections.</p> \n<p>That means the bill, which has already passed its first Knesset vote, could theoretically be enacted with support from either Yesh Atid or Yisrael Beiteinu opposition parties.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: Explained: Why Israel's draft bill Is stirring up Netanyahu's government&nbsp;■ After draft law passes first vote, the data: ultra-Orthodox soldiers getting younger</p> \n<p>But Agudat Yisrael, the Hasidic wing of United Torah Judaism, has threatened to quit the coalition immediately if the bill passes in its current form. That would bring down the government and force early elections.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Prime Minister&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu doesn’t want to change the bill, for fear that any changes would lead another coalition party, Kulanu, to oppose it. Until now, Kulanu hasn’t shown much interest in the bill, but has recently adopted a policy of delaying legislation on most issues in order to force early elections.</p> \n<p>Agudat Yisrael Chairman Yaakov Litzman promised Netanyahu over the summer that the ultra-Orthodox parties would find it easier to reach a compromise on the bill after municipal elections on October 30. However, that promise has yet to be fulfilled, and currently, nobody in the coalition is concentrating on finding a solution.</p> \n<p>The bill overturned by the High Court last year was meant to encourage more ultra-Orthodox men to enlist in the army. Although it allowed ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students to defer service until the age of 26, at which point they could receive full exemption, it also said that if the number of ultra-Orthodox draftees would not increase over time, sanctions would eventually be imposed.</p> \n<p>The proposed sanctions, however, would not kick in for another six years, whereas all other men are already subject to sanctions if they do not enlist. That time lag was cited by the court as the main reason for its ruling overturning the law.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Leaders of the world’s largest economic powers have agreed to overhaul the global body that regulates trade disputes, but they faced resistance from U.S. President Donald Trump over the Paris accord on climate change.</p> \n<p>Here are some of the main developments at the Group of 20 summit, which wrapped up Saturday:</p> \n<p>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION</p> \n<p>All G-20 leaders called for reforming the World Trade Organization and the issue will be discussed during the group’s next summit in Osaka, Japan, in June. The gathering’s final statement, however, did not mention protectionism after negotiators said the U.S. objected to the wording. Trump has criticized the WTO and taken aggressive trade policies targeting China and the European Union.</p> \n<p>TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR</p> \n<p>Several of Trump interactions with world leaders made headlines. His clear anger at Canada's prime minister calling him &quot;Donald&quot; and his wandering off after shaking the Argentine president's hand both became viral video fodder.&nbsp;Argentine President Mauricio Macri was left bewildered after Trump left him in what was meant to be a photo-op.</p> \n<p>U.S.-CHINA TRADE WAR</p> \n<p>Financial markets will be cheered by the announcement that Trump and Chines President Xi Jinping agreed at a dinner after the summit to have a 90-day truce in their trade battle.</p> \n<p>Trump agreed to hold off on plans to raise tariffs Jan. 1 on $200 billion in Chinese goods. Xi agreed to buy a “not yet agreed upon, but very substantial amount of agricultural, energy, industrial” and other products from the United States to reduce America’s huge trade deficit with China, the White House said.</p> \n<p>The cease-fire will buy time for the two countries to work out their differences in a dispute over Beijing’s aggressive drive to supplant U.S. technological dominance.</p> \n<p>PRINCE UNDER PRESSURE</p> \n<p>There were some awkward moments for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as some leaders called him out over the gruesome October killing of dissident Saudi newspaper columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the country’s consulate in Istanbul.</p> \n<p>French President Emmanuel Macron was captured on video seemingly lecturing bin Salman, at one point being heard saying “I am worried,” you never listen to me,” and “I am a man of my word.” Macron said the crown prince only “took note” of his concerns.</p> \n<p>British Prime Minister Theresa May also said she pressed bin Salman.</p> \n<p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was the only G-20 leader to raise the issue during the official session. Erdogan called bin Salman’s response — that the crime had not been proven — “unbelievable” and complained that Saudi authorities have been uncooperative.</p> \n<p>But it wasn’t all bad for bin Salman. He was not shunned, and on the gathering’s first day, he and Russian President Vladimir Putin engaged in a hearty grip-and-grin as the two seemingly reveled in their shared status as relative outcasts.</p> \n<p>U.S. intelligence agencies concluded the Saudi prince was behind the killing. Saudi Arabia denies he played a role.</p> \n<p>UKRAINE CONFLICT</p> \n<p>Western leaders confronted Putin over Russia’s recent seizure of Ukrainian naval vessels and crews, but the diplomatic pressure didn’t seem to bring either side closer to solving the conflict. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of being responsible for the standoff.</p> \n<p>Trump cited Russia’s actions as the reason that he canceled a planned meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the summit. EU Council President Donald Tusk sharply criticized “Russia’s aggression” against Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Putin tried to convince Trump and the leaders of France and Germany that Russia’s actions were justified — even pulling out a piece of paper and drawing a map of the disputed area to make his point.</p> \n<p>CLIMATE CHANGE</p> \n<p>The final communique signed by all 20 member nations said 19 of them reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris climate accord. The only holdout was the U.S., which has withdrawn from the pact under Trump.</p> \n<p>Still, environmental groups praised the statement as welcome news.</p> \n<p>“That G20 leaders signed up to the Paris Agreement reaffirmed their commitment to its full implementation in the resulting communique is important,” the World Wildlife Fund said. “It is also a reflection of the Argentinian government rightly making climate an important topic on the agenda.”</p> \n<p>Greenpeace said that “the necessity of the U.S. being part of the effort to fight climate change cannot be denied, but this is a demonstration that the U.S. is still the odd one out.”</p> \n<p>NAFTA</p> \n<p>After two years of negotiations, Trump signed a revised North American trade pact with the leaders of Canada and Mexico on the sidelines of the summit. The deal is meant to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump long denigrated as a “disaster.”</p> \n<p>The new pact won’t take effect unless approved by the legislatures of all three nations, and there are questions about the pact’s prospects in the U.S. Congress, especially now that Democrats will control the House. Democrats and their allies in the labor movement are already demanding changes.</p> \n<p>But Trump said on the way back to Washington that he plans to formally terminate NAFTA, so Congress will have to choose between accepting the new pact or going without a trade accord.</p> \n<p>LOW EXPECTATIONS\\LOW OUTPUT</p> \n<p>Even the host country had lowered expectations ahead of the summit, saying before the gathering started that it might not be possible to reach a consensus for a final statement.</p> \n<p>After sleepless days of round-the-clock talks by diplomats, a communique was produced, but analysts said leaders merely signed a watered down statement that skirted trade and other contentious issues.</p> \n<p>“The G20 veered all over the road” at the summit and the leaders failed to fix trade, which is widely seen as a priority for boosting growth in jobs and economies, said Thomas Bernes, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation who has held leading roles with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Canada’s government.</p> \n<p>“Leaders buried their differences in obscure language and dropped language to fight protectionism, which had been included in every G-20 communique since the leaders’ first summit. This is clearly a retrograde step forced by United States intransigence,” Bernes said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The conflict over Israel-Palestine has claimed another professional casualty: Marc Lamont Hill, a Temple University professor and a television commentator, was fired by CNN after he gave a speech at the United Nations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the speech, he spoke of the “irony” of this being the 70th anniversary of the issuing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights given that the Palestinian people have been deprived of these same rights. He went on to paint a grim picture of life for Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli military and political apparatus: torture, administrative detention, a 99 percent conviction rate when facing military courts, settlement expansion, the recent demotion of Arabic from an official language in Israel, restriction of movement, settler colonialism, and the nation-state law.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But none of this — not even his tacit support of the use of armed force (when he said that “we must advocate and promote non-violence at every opportunity. But we cannot endorse a narrow politics of respectability that shames Palestinians for resisting, for refusing to do nothing in the face of state violence and ethnic cleansing”)&nbsp; — raised the ire of those on social media and elsewhere like his closing phrase did. There, he called for “a free Palestine from the river to the sea.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;In U.S. media, Israel is untouchable&nbsp;| Gideon Levy</p> \n<p>I’m going to leave aside the question of whether or to what extent speech should be policed by employers. It’s an important question for another piece. (Readers may want to dig into another broadcast firing the same week, this for an ill-conceived Twitter joke that NPR’s Fresh Air film critic David Edelstein apologized for.)</p> \n<p>On Twitter, Hill explained his closing remarks this way: The “call to free Palestine from river to sea….means that all areas of historic Palestine —e.g., West Bank, Gaza, Israel— must be spaces of freedom, safety, and peace for Palestinians.”</p> \n<p>But two days later, Hill had issued an apology:&nbsp;“Rather than hearing a political solution, many heard a dog-whistle that conjured a long and deep history of violence against Jewish people. Although this was the furthest thing from my intent, those particular words clearly caused confusion, anger, fear, and other forms of harm. For that, I am deeply sorry.”</p> \n<p>Hill concluded his apology this way: “I remain open to learning, growing, and struggling together toward freedom.”</p> \n<p>In that spirit, here is where I think the problem lies, followed by a modest suggestion, one that I think forces people of good will to consider what is most urgent in Israel/Palestine.</p> \n<p>Aside from environmental imperatives perhaps, rights are not vested in land. Rather, rights are vested in people. And human rights, in particular, are vested in individuals. So to say that Palestine — the place — deserves to be “free” is confusing and distracting. Too many Israeli and Diaspora Jews hear the phrase as a desired replacement of Israel by Palestine, something they understandably bristle at.</p> \n<p>Even the democratic binational model that Hill has said he favors would not be a replacement of Israel by Palestine. It would be a reimagined state that would nurture universal rights and equality rather than being one that has swapped out one kind of ethno-national supremacy for another. (And if it weren’t, then it wouldn’t actually be binational.)</p> \n<p>Most importantly, the phrase diverts attention from what should be a focus on people to a fetishizing of territory. As we know all too well, framing political struggles in terms of land — rather than in terms of individual and collective freedoms — has served to harden attitudes and intensify some of the thorniest issues of the conflict. The many problems brought about by what some groups see as being holy space are among the starkest examples.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>What, then, if we focused on the people who deserve freedom? What if we focused on those Palestinian minors who are detained by the IDF; those Palestinian residents of Hebron who can’t leave by their front doors; the Bedouin communities that face military demolition; and the Palestinian protestors in Gaza who run the risk of being shot by IDF snipers? And what if we broadened the conversation more regularly to discuss Palestinian refugees?</p> \n<p>It is the people living in that troubled land — and those who are still stateless outside it — who deserve freedom: freedom of movement, freedom from violence, freedom from military occupation. A better phrase would remind us that Palestinians desire and deserve exactly what Jews worldwide who sing Hatikvah, Israel’s national anthem, do: “to be a free people in our land.” A better phrase — one focusing on souls rather than soil — would remind us that in that troubled space between the river and the sea, none are truly free until all are.</p> \n<p>Mira Sucharov is associate professor of political science at Carleton University in Ottawa.

In a speech last week at a United Nations conference he called for “international action that will give us what justice requires and that is a free Palestine from the river to the sea.”</p> \n<p>In a matter of hours, the skies collapsed into well-orchestrated hysteria. Seth Mandel, editor of the Washington Examiner, accused Hill of having called for Jewish genocide; Ben Shapiro, an analyst on Fox News, called it an anti-Semitic speech; Consul Dani Dayan tweeted that Hill’s remarks were like a “swastika painted in red,” the Anti-Defamation League said they were tantamount to calling for Israel to be wiped off the map. The inevitable outcome was not long in coming and CNN fired the rebel analyst on the very same day.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>How dare he? What was he thinking? Where did he think he’s living, in a democracy with free speech or a country where dialogue about Israel is under the serious censorship of the Jewish establishment and Israeli propaganda? Hill tried to claim that he’s opposed to racism and anti-Semitism and his remarks were intended to support the establishment of a binational, secular and democratic state. But he didn’t stand a chance.</p> \n<p>In the heavy-handed reality that has seized control over dialogue in the United States, there’s no room for expressions that may offend the Israeli occupation. On a liberal day it’s permissible to say “two states” as long as you do it in a whisper.</p> \n<p>What would have happened if Hill had called for the establishment of a Jewish state between the Jordan and the sea? He would have safely continued holding down his job. Rick Santorum, the former senator, said in 2012 that “no Palestinian” lives in the West Bank. Nobody thought of firing him. Even Hill’s critic, Shapiro, has called in the past for ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in the territories (he backtracked on it a few years later) and nothing happened to him.</p> \n<p>You can attack the Palestinians in America uninterrupted, call to expel them and deny their existence. Only don’t dare to touch Israel, the holy of holies, the country that exists above suspicion. And the height of chutzpah? Israel and the Jewish establishment keep on accusing the media, including CNN, of being slanderers of Israel. There’s no worse joke than that. Try to publish a critical article about Israel in a mainstream newspaper in the West – it’s getting more and more difficult, more often than not, impossible. But nothing will satisfy the lion’s hunger: The more he complains, the stronger he gets.</p> \n<p>The key word of course is anti-Semitism. A lot has been written about the use Israel and its supporters make of anti-Semitism. And it works wondrously, it’s a magic word that silences people. There has not yet been a single critique of occupation that isn’t tagged as anti-Semitism. Everything is anti-Semitism: Hill is anti-Semitic because he favors a one-state solution, Roger Waters is an anti-Semite because that’s how Gilad Erdan described him at a conference last week about propaganda in Germany, UNRWA is anti-Semitic, and of course, BDS. The whole world is against us.</p> \n<p>Last week there was a lot of fuss over a world survey of anti-Semitism conducted by CNN. It turns out that the Jews are not as hated as Israel would like: Only 10 percent said they had any negative feelings about them. Nearly four times as many people said they don’t like Muslims. Along with its worrisome aspects, the survey points up more than a few truths you can’t deny. Twenty-eight percent of those questioned said that anti-Semitism in their countries is a result of Israeli policy. A third believe that Israel takes advantage of the Holocaust to advance its positions. One in five thought the Jews have too much influence in the media.</p> \n<p>Fire more analysts who dare to criticize Israel or suggest just solutions to the occupation – and more people surveyed will say what everyone knows: The Jews and Israel have an incredible degree of influence in Western media. Now you can call me an anti-Semite, as well.</p>",

        "text":["<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Battle between Israel and Iran shifting from Syria to Lebanon</p> \n<p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman embarked this week on a victory tour of defiance in the Arab world. Although posters in Tunisia reminded the guest of his involvement in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudis' Istanbul consulate, in Egypt – whose economy depends on Saudi generosity – Mohammed enjoyed a royal reception. The pyramids were even illuminated in green in his honor.</p> \n<p>The excuses and evasions by senior U.S. officials are making it clear that for Washington the affair is already over. President Donald Trump, who isn’t known for his affection for the media, including The Washington Post that employed Khashoggi, now has other things on his mind.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Erdogan may help Trump and absolve MBS, but not for free&nbsp;■&nbsp;How Mohammed bin Salman put Saudi Arabia in debt to Trump and Netanyahu&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The president, in a series of statements whose high point was a letter that sounded like a middle-schooler's work, explained his considerations. Saudi Arabia is important because of its huge deals with U.S. defense contractors, it’s crucial for continuing the battle against Iran, and it’s a positive factor because it “helps Israel.”</p> \n<p>These arguments were worded with greater fluency by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Speaking with Israeli journalists at a summit in Bulgaria in early November, Netanyahu said that “what&nbsp;happened in the Istanbul consulate&nbsp;was horrendous and it should be duly dealt with. Yet ... it is very important for the stability of the world, for the region and for the world that Saudi Arabia remain stable.”</p> \n<p>As Netanyahu put it, “I think that a way must be found to achieve both goals. Because the larger problem is Iran, and we have to make sure that Iran does not continue the malign activities that it has been doing over the last few weeks in Europe.”</p> \n<p>Not that Trump needed any arm-twisting, but we can cautiously assume that Netanyahu tried to ensure that Washington wouldn’t abandon Riyadh in its time of trouble. The timing of the visit to the Saudi royal family by a delegation of evangelical Christians, which was actually organized by an Israeli citizen in early November, doesn’t seem entirely coincidental.</p> \n<p>Not for the first time – and not unrelated to the injustices Israel is responsible for in the West Bank – Israel is willing to ignore many injustices by its new friends in the Middle East. The extent of the Saudi regime’s horrifying behavior was clarified this week in a piece by veteran Washington Post foreign affairs columnist David Ignatius. He wrote that the regime is undergoing a brutal period of paranoia, persecuting real and imaginary rivals to the point of eliminating them.</p> \n<p>Over a year ago a special team operating for the crown prince kidnapped and tortured opponents of the regime and others suspected of corruption. For example, it misled the Chinese government into believing that a Saudi businessman was a wanted terrorist on his way to carrying out an attack at the G-20 summit.</p> \n<p>Ignatius portrays the crown prince’s associates as a gang of moronic thugs, while Prince Mohammed is described as a hotheaded reformer leading his country close to the abyss. Ignatius calls on the Trump administration to force the kingdom to halt the bloody quarrels among the various princes before even more damage is done to Saudi Arabia and the world.</p> \n<p>But such intervention apparently won’t take place. Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said this week he sees no point in listening to the Turks’ recording of Khashoggi’s murder because he doesn’t understand Arabic. (The way Turkey, which imprisons and abuses journalists and opponents of the regime, manages to present itself as the epitome of righteousness is an achievement in itself.)</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Will Saudi crown prince, under the specter of ordering Khashoggi's murder, be a pariah at G-20?&nbsp;| Explained&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Isolating Iran</p> \n<p>Trump is apparently invested personally in relations with Saudi Arabia. In the past he boasted that he sold buildings to the Saudis for tens of millions of dollars. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is friendly with the crown prince and met with him last year a week before the wave of arrests began in the kingdom. The bottom line is that Prince Mohammed will probably retain his position despite the shocking affair.</p> \n<p>That’s the impression one gets in Jerusalem and Washington, and according to Ignatius, among the Saudis he has spoken to. The only countermove, which was initiated by the U.S. Senate this week, is a condemnation of Saudi Arabia for its role in Yemen’s appalling civil war. The condemnation is embarrassing to Riyadh but won’t keep the crown prince off the throne.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s regional perspective is still focused mainly on Iran. In conversations with his counterparts from abroad, the prime minister continues to warn about Iran and its frozen nuclear program. On occasions like the conference in Bulgaria, Netanyahu often mentions Iranian conspiracies that have been prevented with the help of Israeli intelligence, including attempts to assassinate regime opponents who found refuge in Denmark and France. (Saudi Arabia didn’t invent anything.)</p> \n<p>For Netanyahu, the Saudis are providing an important anchor to implement U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s 12-point plan to isolate the regime in Tehran in the hope of toppling it. The prime minister also needs the Saudis if he wants to keep improving relations with Gulf countries. The visit to Oman was the first stop, which he hopes to continue with contacts with Bahrain as well.</p> \n<p>And Israel, like the Americans, also fears that an attempt to remove the crown prince could topple his government. The collapse of the Gadhafi regime in 2011 flooded the Middle East with weapons looted from the Libyan dictator’s arsenals. If Libya was a boutique, Saudi Arabia is a huge supermarket of advanced weapons systems – which in the wrong hands are also a major threat to Israel.</p> \n<p>The complementary aspect of Netanyahu’s steps is closely related to the tightening relationship with Africa. Chad’s president visited Israel at the beginning of the week, and now there are hopes of upgrading relations with Sudan. Israel wants to sell the Africans weapons and technology, and perhaps to shorten the air route to Brazil (and reduce ticket prices) by flying over Chad and Sudan.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Israel's Iron Dome defense of Saudi Arabia aims to avert collapse of Trump and Netanyahu's entire Middle East strategy&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>In the background is North African countries’ fear of the spread of the jihadi terror group Boko Haram, which was inspired by the Islamic State to be extremely belligerent. It’s not only a problem for Nigeria and Niger, but for Chad and to a slight extent even for Egypt. That’s why the Africans are very interested in whatever Israel can teach them about fighting terror – and Egyptian President Abdel-Fatah al-Sissi will probably also approve of closer ties between Israel and his neighbors.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Trump is repeating the argument that his efforts in the region stem from his desire to benefit Israel. Within a week he made the claim twice – to justify his forgiving attitude toward Saudi Arabia and the doubling of the number of U.S. troops in Syria to 4,000.</p> \n<p>This line of thinking may convince good Jews (at the moment there are fewer and fewer) to vote for the Republicans in 2020. But it’s also a very damaging statement for Israel because it confirms the anti-Semitic fantasies about Jewish control of U.S. foreign policy. Such declarations will eventually boomerang on Israel.</p>",

In light of these three recommendations to indict him for bribery, it is inconceivable that he remain in office.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Unable to charm the media, Netanyahu sought to control it&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Case 4000 and the abuse of the Israeli public&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>Opposition leader Tzipi Livni, Zionist Union chairman Avi Gabbay, Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid and Meretz chairwoman Tamar Zandberg all urged Netanyahu to resign. They are right. Netanyahu must resign immediately and new elections should be held.</p> \n<p>By law, Netanyahu isn’t obligated to resign, and judging by his reaction, he intends to remain in office and fight to clear his name. Every citizen has the right to be presumed innocent, and this shouldn’t be taken lightly. But Netanyahu’s insistence on being presumed innocent even as police recommendations have piled up against him in several different cases goes beyond the bounds of the reasonable.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu himself, when he was opposition leader and Ehud Olmert was prime minister, declared, “A prime minister up to his neck in investigations has no public or moral mandate to make fateful decisions for Israel.” That’s a perfect description of his own situation.</p> \n<p>The crimes with which the police recommend charging Netanyahu and his wife are extremely serious. According to the police, the main suspicion is that the prime minister “intervened and was actively involved in regulatory decisions that benefited Shaul Elovitch and his Bezeq corporation, and at the same time demanded, directly and indirectly, to intervene in the content of the Walla news site in ways that would benefit him.”</p> \n<p>The attempt by members of Netanyahu’s Likud party to minimize the gravity of the police recommendations is a badge of shame for Likud. There’s a limit to how many times it’s possible to play the “putsch” and “conspiracy” cards.</p> \n<p>Following their leader’s example, Netanyahu’s acolytes have once again volunteered to smear the law enforcement system and the outgoing police commissioner, Roni Alsheich. Their automatic defense of the serial suspect currently heading the government is evidence in itself of the damage Netanyahu’s continued tenure under these circumstances is doing to the rule of law, the country and Israeli society.</p> \n<p>When garden-variety criminals deny the charges against them and lash out at the police and the legal system, it’s understandable. But such behavior is completely unacceptable from the prime minister, who is attacking agencies of the very government he heads. The aggressive, inflammatory, slanderous responses by Netanyahu and those close to him prove that when it comes down to a choice between his own welfare and that of the country, he prefers his own.</p> \n<p>The only decent and responsible thing for Netanyahu to do is resign immediately. Since he has no intention of doing so, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit must speed up his legal review and make a decision on the numerous cases against the prime minister.</p>",

Too often, this privacy is violated by eager nature photographers, whose number is increasing in Israel.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>To prevent such interruptions, a code of ethics for nature photographers who document birds has been drawn up which, among other things, calls to avoid being present while they are nesting.</p> \n<p>Under the code, taking pictures of nesting birds is unacceptable and such photographs will not be accepted by online bird-watching forums or competitions. The code also calls on photographers to respect animals’ natural habitats, to avoid digressing from marked paths or riding in all-terrain vehicles into natural areas.</p> \n<p>Photographers are also asked to avoid gathering in large groups, particularly near rare attractions like migrating birds that stop to eat or drink during their journey. &quot;The presence of many photographers and bird-watchers in the same place causes ongoing damage,&quot; states the code.</p> \n<p>The document also states that birds should not be fed, nor should their habitats be altered in any way to get a more interesting picture.</p> \n<p>The code of ethics was prepared in cooperation with ornithologists at the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel and the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. It will be presented for the first time next Monday at Tel Aviv University, during the 39th Bird-Watching Workshop that the SPNI organizes with the university.</p> \n<p>&quot;Photography is a positive activity that contributes to exposing the importance and beauty of nature to the general public,&quot; says Dan Alon, the head of SPNI’s Israel Ornithological Center. &quot;But in recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of photographers in Israel, and there are instances in which their activity creates significant disturbance to animals, so the code of ethics was needed.&quot;</p> \n<p>In one case, which Alon described as extreme, photographers blocked a nest of bee-eaters and put a stick on top of it. A bee-eater that came to the nesting site could not get in; instead, it sat on the stick and began to issue distress calls, which made for a more dramatic and interesting photograph.</p> \n<p>In other cases, photographers would chase birds with their vehicles and exhaust them. The most routine but most problematic interruption, Alon says, is the tendency of photographers to approach nesting sites and disrupt the process of protecting and feeding chicks.</p> \n<p>&quot;There are people who don’t know they are causing damage,&quot; Alon says. &quot;This code is aimed at helping them. It is common in many countries.&quot;</p> \n<p>In addition to general recommendations, the code also includes specific restrictions. Photographers should not enter quarries from March to July, when some of them are used as nesting sites. Owls should not be photographed near the nesting boxes installed for them, and the rare Houbara bustard should not be photographed other than from the main roads during the first half of the year, so as to avoid harming the birds that are incubated and hatched on the ground during this period.</p> \n<p>&quot;The code imposes restrictions that I can definitely live with,&quot; says Moshe Cohen, a nature photographer and co-author of the document. &quot;In the end, I do not want to be part of an activity that hurts something that I love and is important to me. It’s a translation of right and wrong into professional language. It’s not a division between good and bad photographers in terms of their relationship with nature, but a call to take responsibility.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Great things happen in a single moment of a spontaneous uprising, accompanied by a declaration that enough is enough, and we’re not playing any longer. For example, during Culture Minister Miri Regev’s bizarre press conference.</p> \n<p>Regev makes a mockery of herself with every passing day, and who I am to disturb he? But in one moment of fury, when they were told that they couldn’t ask questions at the end of the press conference, journalists rose and said, that’s it, we aren’t extras in your show. And Regev gave in and allowed questions.</p> \n<p>From now on, the journalists announced, the rules are changing – no more press conference without room for questions. One moment of anger at an unacceptable custom gave rise to a protest that changed it.</p> \n<p>A formative event is, as we know, one of the dramatic foundations that everyone likes, which is missing in the conduct of the opposition, which is more like a story without a punch line.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Despite his recent triumphs, Netanyahu is terrified of elections | Analysis</p> \n<p>Here is an example of a hypothetical moment that could have been such a formative event, but as usual crumbled into dust:</p> \n<p>Opposition members from Meretz and the Joint List, in cooperation with the human rights organizations B’Tselem and Breaking the Silence, organized a conference called “Hebron First,” dealing with the Jewish settlement in Hebron. Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein cancelled the conference, claiming that all the conference halls in the Knesset would be occupied due to the delegation of the president of the Czech Republic being present.</p> \n<p>MK Dov Khenin did not stand around idly, and photographed at least one empty hall during the visit. What happened afterwards, you will ask, where is our formative moment in this story and when does one get all excited and feel a sense of satisfaction?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Rabin memorial rally organizers don’t understand they're living in a divided country | Analysis</p> \n<p>I must disappoint you. Those who occupy the most distant back benches in the Knesset, those whom we would like to see as courageous fighters, are also the most downtrodden. They are forced to keep their heads down for fear that their draft bills won’t pass and they won’t receive cooperation, and therefore they won’t risk a quarrel with the Knesset speaker.</p> \n<p>The organizers had the option of turning to their colleagues in the opposition and asking them to join in a protest activity in response to the cancellation. For example, informing the Knesset speaker that none of them would enter the plenum during the Czech president's speech if he didn't reverse course.</p> \n<p>But the opposition is disintegrating. Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid is afraid that someone will identify his party with the losers in the Zionist Union, so it is clear that this is a parliamentary aristocracy that is unwilling to mingle with the Arab riffraff.</p> \n<p>The Zionist Union is afraid of its own shadow and of being identified with the (Arab) Joint List, and Meretz is afraid of blurring the differences between it and the Zionist Union. Instead of granting its electorate moments of catharsis, the opposition is exhibiting depression and weakness.</p> \n<p>The farce of recent days, when important opposition draft bills fell because one Zionist Union MK (Robert Tiviaev) voted with the coalition and another (Hilik Bar) has disappeared without a trace in China and refuses to listen to pleas for his return, is reminiscent in reverse of how Likud, when it had 12 pathetic seats, embittered the life of the government week after week and provided additional proof that size doesn’t necessarily matter.</p> \n<p>In the vacuum that has been created, the public is resorting to outsourcing, and the alternative opposition is alive and kicking – outside the Knesset.</p> \n<p>That’s why the big names of the coming election – Gabi Ashkenazi, Benny Gantz and Ehud Barak – did not emerge from the benches of the opposition. Perhaps if the public saw its MKs fighting fearlessly, declaring that enough is enough, embittering the life of this fragile coalition, it would not be so eager to vote for generals, and my fellow columnists wouldn’t be picking off flower petals as they play “he loves me, he loves me not” with our one and only leader at present, whom nobody is able to threaten.</p>",

Still, truly corrupt people have an interest in all politicians being portrayed as corrupt. If everybody is corrupt, then no one is corrupt.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Benjamin Netanyahu is focusing his efforts on an attempt to vilify Yair Lapid. I have a lot of criticism for Lapid, for his repugnant attempt to dress up as something else, more right-wing, a hater of leftists, sensitive to Jewish tradition. When Lapid sharply attacks human rights organizations, it is impossible not to feel one’s skin crawl before such profound cynicism.</p> \n<p>Still, one thing I have never found in Lapid: A fault in his incorruptibility. Almost cruelly, Lapid cut his very friendly ties with Olmert (he used to call him “Abbaleh”) and with Shlomi Lahiani in the wake of their trials.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Netanyahu may not have to resign, but he should | Analysis</p> \n<p>The height of absurdity was reached in regard to Arnon Milchan, who had employed Lapid for some 20 years before he became finance minister. Milchan sought to meet with Lapid about the so-called Milchan Law, which gave a tax incentive to businessmen moving their activity and capital to Israel. Milchan wanted to extend the law. Lapid met with him, heard his request, passed it on to his officials, they recommended rejecting it, and Lapid accepted the recommendation. It was a lesson in good government.</p> \n<p>Somehow, this was translated by Netanyahu into “If it’s not Bibi, there’s no investigation.” Netanyahu accepted gifts from Milchan worth hundreds of thousands of shekels; by comparison, Lapid sent Milchan back a bouquet of flowers he had sent him on the occasion of his appointment. Netanyahu tried to help Milchan in a host of ways; Lapid informed Milchan that his request was denied. In what world are they equals on this score?</p> \n<p>The police gave a bizarre briefing to reporters on this issue, describing Lapid as a “key witness” in the affair. In fact, Lapid was not a key witness. In another police briefing, reporters were told that there was a “large gap” between what Lapid had said publicly on the submarine affair and his testimony to the police. This was another false assertion. Lapid never claimed he had inside information about the affair. He was involved at a certain point, when he got a discount from the German government on the missile ships.</p> \n<p>On the Egyptian submarine affair, he what others were saying, and he testified about this to the police. In public, he insisted repeatedly that Netanyahu should be investigated in the matter, and this was popularly interpreted to mean he was calling for Netanyahu to be investigated as a suspect. It’s totally legitimate for Netanyahu supporters to criticize Lapid, but what’s the police’s excuse? Where is the “gap” in Lapid’s statements? Why was it so urgent for police to badmouth him to reporters at two press briefings?</p> \n<p>Now Netanyahu has a new line of attack – Lapid’s meetings with Arnon Mozes of Yedioth Ahronoth. Lapid does need to explain how many times he met with Mozes, and if any connection was made between funds in Yesh Atid-controlled ministries that went to Yedioth, and Yedioth’s treatment of Lapid. Lapid’s explanation, that the meetings were just like any others between a publisher and the press, does not hold water. Lapid’s relationship with Mozes is not just like others, especially if they met so many times (associates of Lapid said there were only four or five meetings).</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, even when the attorney general had in its possession a recording of a conversation between Netanyahu and Mozes that was clearly about bribery, it took months until an investigation was opened. You don’t open investigations over question marks and journalists’ suspicions, just as no investigation was ever opened over the nature of the prime minister’s relationship with Sheldon Adelson and the enormous contribution of Israel Hayom to Netanyahu the politician. There is much more to investigate in the 10 years of the Israel Hayom story than what happened in the Lapid-Mozes meetings.</p> \n<p>The media tends to say who is corrupt. These days, we should also say who is not corrupt.</p> \n<p>Lapid is not corrupt.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The offices of Nutrino Health in Tel Aviv have a spacious kitchen, with fresh produce laid out on a table and jars of nuts and dried fruit on shelves. There’s also a bottle of Champagne, left over from last month’s celebration when the medical device giant Medtronic announced that it was acquiring the Israeli startup after a successful two-year collaboration.</p> \n<p>Medtronic, a company with a market cap of $125 billion, didn’t reveal what it paid for Nutrino because the amount wasn’t big enough to require it. But the estimates are around $80 million, eight times the capital invested in the startup since it was founded a decade ago.</p> \n<p>Nutrino’s guiding principle is that food affects people differently, and cookie-cutter diets aren’t sufficient. Its first product was a free app for creating a personalized food plan. It offered menu plans based on each user’s personal goals — such as eating more healtful foods, losing weight or building muscle — and taking into account each user’s physical activity and medical profile.</p> \n<p>Over time, Nutrino assembled a valuable database for medical device companies on the links between diet, personal habits and physiology. The other half of its database comes from 400 information sources — academic papers, information from food companies, data from wearable devices such as insulin pumps.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Locust schnitzel? Israeli high-tech firms cooking up the future's meat alternatives&nbsp;■ No longer just innovation, Israeli tech moves up a step</p> \n<p>Another top source is photographs of the food eaten by users and stored on their cellphones.</p> \n<p>&quot;We needed to document food. It could be in speech or writing, but in practice we discovered that people like to photograph their food,&quot; says Yael Glassman, Nutrino’s CEO. “It’s easier for users and it also adds a personal context — you don’t even have to open the app when you take pictures. You can add the pictures afterward and important data such as where and when you eat. We automatically extract data about your diet from the images on your device.”</p> \n<p>Nutrino’s algorithms rate the foods that were photographed according to how the user’s body has reacted to eating them.</p> \n<p>The company established partnerships not only with Medtronic but also with Abbot Laboratories and Dexcom. The goal of the cooperation with Medtronic was particularly ambitious: the development of an artificial pancreas for people with Type 1 diabetes — formerly called juvenile diabetes — by monitoring blood sugar levels and introducing insulin as needed.</p> \n<p>Today, people with Type 2 diabetes typically use an insulin pump to supply fixed amounts on a continual basis. The drawback is that users have to test their blood sugar levels throughout the day and the pumps can’t adjust themselves automatically to the body’s changing demand for insulin.</p> \n<p>Buying Nutrino will give Medtronic’s artificial pancreas the ability to know what foods the user is eating and adjust insulin levels automatically. Apart from that, Medtronic is interested in helping health care systems to reduce patient care costs, a task that information and artificial intelligence companies such as Nutrino can help achieve.</p> \n<p>“Food is something that interests the employees here, even when they are out of the office,” says Glassman. “Among our employees we have vegans, diabetics and athletes, and it’s one of the things that helps us to recruit staff — mission-driven companies that create an emotional connection can be more competitive.”</p> \n<p>Diet is also personally important to Nutrino’s two founders. Yaron Hadad, its chief scientist, was one of the first recruits to win recognition as a vegan by the Israel Defense Forces. Jonathan Lipnik, Nutrino’s president, has his own family history.</p> \n<p>“My grandparents didn’t reach a ripe old age because of heart problems; I’ve been taking blood pressure medication since the age of 30 and have been under the supervision of a nutritionist since I was 8, so the topic is close to my heart,” he said.</p> \n<p>Hadad and Lipnik met in the army, where they served in the research unit of the personnel division and first encountered the world of statistics. They won an award for helping to cut the drop-out rate for combat troops by 50% by their statistical research on what candidates make the best soldier.</p> \n<p>When they founded Nutrino in 2011 it was with the idea of using those same kind of methods in the realm of diet. Glassman, who joined as CEO in 2015, brings business experience to the venture after a career at various U.S. startups and an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was Glassman who brought Nutrino to Medtronic three years ago.</p> \n<p>Nutrino made the transition from a consumer app for wellness to a digital health company that provides data to medical devices with a focus on chronic diseases, diabetes in particular.</p> \n<p>“The idea and the product behind Nutrino could have been adapted to all kinds of purposes, like dieting, for example,” Glassman said. “But in the end you have to decide on a route and a goal that are commercially viable.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>A regional election in Spain saw a surge of support for a far-right party and dealt a major setback to the ruling Socialists, prompting the prime minister on Monday to vow to defend democracy from fear.</p> \n<p>The anti-migrant, anti-feminist and euroskeptic Vox party won 12 seats Sunday in the 109-member parliament of Andalusia, Spain’s most populated region and a bastion of the Socialists for the past 36 years.</p> \n<p>The four-year-old Vox party, which had not previously held any seats in Spain, could now be a kingmaker and oust the Socialists from Andalusia’s regional government if they strike a deal with conservatives and the center-right to assemble a 59-seat majority.</p> \n<p>Those leaders on Monday began talks to form a regional government, which both parties said would include contacts with Vox.</p> \n<p>The surprising win — the most favorable polls ahead of the election predicted Vox would win about five seats — also launched the party’s strategy to make a dent in national politics and the European elections next year. It’s also a blow to those who had felt that sour memories of Spain’s 20th-century dictatorship and a consensus over the European Union’s benefits had inoculated the country from a global wave of rising populism.</p> \n<p>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen was one of the first to celebrate Vox’s success, congratulating the party’s national leader, Santiago Abascal, in a&nbsp;tweet&nbsp;for what she said was “a very significant result for a young and dynamic movement.”</p> \n<p>In a sharp contrast, Spain’s Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez,&nbsp;tweeted&nbsp;Monday that “my government will continue working on a regenerating and pro-European project for Spain.” He said the result will “strengthen our pledge to defend the Constitution and Democracy against fear.”</p> \n<p>The Socialists saw their support plummet to just 33 seats, compared to 47 in 2015 and far from the majority of 55 needed to govern even if they could get the backing of Adelante Andalucia, the local brand of the anti-establishment Podemos party, which took 17 seats.</p> \n<p>The conservative Popular Party came second with 26 seats — down seven from previously — and the center-right Citizens party more than doubled its presence in the regional assembly, capturing 21 seats.</p> \n<p>Still, analysts said that having Spain’s right-wing side themselves with the far-right could backfire, especially with local, other regional and European elections next year and a possible general election that could come any time before 2020.</p> \n<p>That’s the limit of the legislative term for Sanchez, who toppled former conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in June with a no-confidence vote. Sanchez now leads Spain’s weakest minority government in four decades of democracy and there is increasing speculation that he could be calling an early election.</p> \n<p>The acting regional president in Andalusia, Susana Diaz, blamed the Socialists’ loss of support on the high rate of abstention, which has been interpreted as punishment by traditional center-left voters to the corruption scandals marring her party.</p> \n<p>“We have understood the message and we take note,” said Diaz, who also called on other parties to “build a firewall against the extreme right in Spain.”</p> \n<p>“Each party must decide if they are against the extreme right or if they will rely on their support to enter into government,” Diaz said.</p> \n<p>Abascal, a 42-year-old scion of a family targeted by the separatist militant group ETA in his native Basque region, celebrated Vox’s victory saying the support came from those disgruntled and neglected in Andalusia who wanted to hear a party speak about “issues that they felt and no other party represented.”</p> \n<p>He also rejected the criticism from mainstream parties and media. “You haven’t understood anything,” Abascal told them during a news conference. “Every time you insult us, you are insulting the millions of Spanish people who listen to us and identify with our message.”</p> \n<p>A 100-issue Vox manifesto calls on building a Spanish nation where its 17 autonomous regions have limited powers, starting with education and health policies, and wants Catalonia to lose its self-government after last year’s attempt to split from Spain.</p> \n<p>The party also advocates outlawing separatist parties, lowering taxes, reforming laws on domestic violence, restricting abortion and closing doors to undocumented migrants.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The police and Israel Securities Authority on Sunday recommended indicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyau and his wife, Sara, as well as media mogul Shaul Elovitch and his wife, Iris, for bribery and other corruption charges in the investigation dubbed Case 4000.</p> \n<p>This is the third case in which the police have recommended charging the prime minister with bribery.&nbsp;The statement recommending charges against Netanyahu in the case were published on the last day in office for Commissioner Roni Alsheich, who is stepping down after a three-year term.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read the Haaretz investigation that started it all: The Israeli news site in Netanyahu's pocket&nbsp;■&nbsp;Opposition calls on Netanyahu to resign</p> \n<p>In a statement, police said that Netanyahu is suspected of taking bribes and of conduct involving a conflict of interest when he made decisions that benefited Elovitch, who controlled Israel's largest telecommunications firm, Bezeq, and the Walla News website, one of two leading news sites in the country.</p> \n<p>Case 4000 involves suspicions that Netanyahu, in his role as communications minister from 2014 to 2017 (while he was also prime minister), intervened with regulators to help Bezeq with a deal worth to Elovitch some 1 billion shekels (. In exchange, Elovitch, a long-time friend of Netanyahu’s, allegedly ordered Walla to provide favorable coverage of the prime minister and his wife, Sara.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The alleged quid pro quo between the Netanyahus and Elovitches was first revealed by Haaretz's Gidi Weitz in November 2015, in an expose titled &quot;The Israeli News Site in Netanyahu's Pocket.&quot;</p> \n<p>Police said they found evidence that &quot;Netanyahu and those close to him blatantly intervened, sometimes on a daily basis, in content published on the Walla news website, and sought to influence the appointment of senior employees (editors and reporters), while using their ties to Shaul and Iris Elovitch.&quot;</p> \n<p>The police are recommending that the prime minister be charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust as well as aggravated fraudulent receiving of an item. The recommended charges against Sara Netanyahu are bribery, fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of justice.</p> \n<p>The police announcement also links a new figure to the case – Zeev Rubinstein, a businessman with close ties to the Netanyahu and Elovitch families, who is a vice president of the Israel Bonds Organization. He is suspected of serving as an intermediary in the alleged bribery.</p> \n<p>In response, Prime Minister Netanyahu issued a statement saying that the recommendations to indict him and his wife &quot;don't surprise anyone, nor does the transparent timing of the announcement.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;These recommendations were decided on and leaked even before the investigations began. The police recommendations have no legal standing. Only recently, authorized officials totally rejected police recommendations regarding a number of public figures. I am certain that the authorized officials, after considering the matters, will reach the same conclusion in this case as well -- that there was nothing because there is nothing.&quot;</p> \n<p>The police had already recommended charging Prime Minister Netanyahu with bribery and breach of trust in two other cases: Case 1000, in which&nbsp; he is suspected of receiving champagne, cigars and other gifts from billionaire friends, and Case 2000, in which Netanyahu is suspected of negotiating favorable press coverage with Yedioth Ahronoth publisher, Arnon Mozes.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit has said that he will reach a decision on whether to charge Netanyahu in all three cases together.</p> \n<p>The investigation in Case 4000 against Yair Netanyahu, the prime minister's son, who was also a suspect in the affair, was closed. The findings in Case 4000 have been&nbsp;transferred to the State Prosecutor's Office.</p> \n<p>In response to Sunday's police recommendation, Shaul Elovitch's lawyer, Jacques Chen said: &quot;For an extended period, the police, through their leaks, have been preparing us for this recommendation.&quot; The recommendations are a rehash that present nothing new, said Chen, who expressed the hope that those handling the case will look at it from a &quot;legal and professional&quot; perspective divorced from &quot;the huge pressure being exerted on them and that has accompanied this investigation from the beginning and has tainted it. Mr. Elovitch insists that he has not committed any offense.&quot;</p> \n<p>Iris Elovitch's lawyer, Michal Rosen-Ozer, said the police recommendation are &quot;part of the bias in the investigation and arrest of Mrs. Elovitch from the beginning.&quot; She added: &quot;We hope that the members of the prosecution are able to free themselves of this bias and consider the evidence. We have no doubt that such an evaluation would show that Mrs. Elovitch has not committed any offense.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Good news for connoisseurs of food and restaurants in Israel and abroad: In a ceremony held over the weekend in Paris, La Liste, the full list of the 1,000 best restaurants, was unveiled.</p> \n<p>The news is particularly good for Israeli restaurateurs, who may be surprised to find their restaurants on the list. If three years ago only four Israeli restaurants were included, and last year 10, there are now 11 with good ratings, which were determined with algorithms this time too.</p> \n<p>This is the third year in which the leading Israeli restaurant is Meir Adoni’s Blue Sky, with a weighted score of 96.75 (ranked in 108th place with an additional 11 restaurants, including Maido, ranked the best in South America). That ranking placed it higher than highly regarded restaurants such as Thomas Keller’s Per Se, with three Michelin stars, and Heston Blumenthal’s The Fat Duck.</p> \n<p>The next Israeli restaurant on the list is also Meir Adoni’s: his second kosher restaurant, Lumina (which improved its score to 96.25). These are followed by Yossi Shitrit’s Mashya (91); Herbert Samuel in Herzliya (88.75); Manta Ray in Tel Aviv, which has been on the list from the start; David Biton’s La Regence in Jerusalem (86.25), followed by Pastel, Claro, Popina, Chakra and Dinings. If the list sounds familiar, it’s no wonder. It’s almost the same as last year’s.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The 20 best restaurants in Israel right, according to Gault &amp; Millau&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Early in December 2015, the French Foreign Ministry announced that it was working on the preparation of a new global ranking of restaurants, which would provide a more reliable and comprehensive answer than the Michelin guides and the San Pellegrino listing of the 50 best restaurants. They claimed that these lists alone are not only tainted by business interests and corruption, but also ignore other guides, trends and food critiques, and therefore fail to reflect the global culinary situation.</p> \n<p>Accordingly, the ministry preferred that the choice of the leading restaurants be conducted with an algorithm that would factor in about 300 guides (including Michelin and Zagat) and restaurant reviews in newspapers such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, as well as important online food magazines such as Eater, according to criteria determined by a panel of experts. These criteria include service, ambience, value for money and flavor.</p> \n<p>The weighted grades were sent to thousands of chefs all over the world so they could express their opinion and rate the sources for La Liste’s “trustworthiness index.” In the end, the French Foreign Ministry hoped to provide a less archaic solution as well as an opportunity for 135 countries, the majority of which are rarely visited by Michelin critics. In effect, a somewhat fossilized list with very slight changes.</p> \n<p>A few days ago the committee behind La Liste revealed the 10 top restaurants. It turned out that the French Guy Savoy restaurant headed the list again, for the third consecutive years. It was followed by the American restaurant Le Bernadin and Ginza Kyubey in Japan.</p> \n<p>Alain Ducasse took fourth place again, followed by the Swiss Hotel de Ville that was in first place four years ago, while in sixth place was the restaurant ranked the best in the world in 2017 by San Pellegrino: New York’s Eleven Madison Park. Next was the French restaurant La Vague d’Or, whose chef was chosen as the best in the world last week.</p> \n<p>The list indicates that Japan has the greatest number of good restaurants, but China is the rising star. Japan leads with 135 restaurants (a decline of three since last year) and China closed the gap with 117 restaurants (a decline of six). It is followed by France with 115 restaurants (an increase of six), with the United States in fourth place with 89 restaurants (a jump of 19).</p> \n<p>The best restaurant in America is Le Bernadin in New York (second place). In fifth place is Spain with 66 restaurants, followed by Italy with 54. Germany improved nicely with 52 restaurants, and England was next with 40. Russia, which was at the bottom of the list last year, jumped from one restaurant to 20. Turkey also improved its ranking with six restaurants this year.</p> \n<p>With all due respect to Japan, China, France and the United States, which may have the largest number of restaurants, it was Switzerland, with 39 top restaurants in a population of 8 million, that has the highest ranking per person.</p> \n<p>Also in the ranking: Belgium (24 restaurants); the Netherlands and Mexico (22 each); Austria (19); Sweden (14); Denmark (13); Morocco and South Africa (12 each); Israel (11); Thailand and South Korea (10 each); followed by Portugal, Peru, Brazil, Turkey and Qatar, which closes the list with four restaurants.</p>",

A march will leave Levinski Park in south Tel Aviv to Rabin Square in solidarity with the asylum seeker population that resides heavily in that area and with the murder of Tsegai. At 10 AM 24-minutes of silence will be held in protest of the 24 women murdered this year.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Arab voices raised as local Israeli authorities join nation-wide women's strike to protest violence&nbsp;■&nbsp;Murder of 12-year-old girl shows human rights in Israel are only for Jews | Analysis</p> \n<p>On Monday, activists dyed the water in fountains across Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa in protest of the government's disregard for women's lives.</p> \n<p>On Sunday morning, several demonstrators blocked traffic in Tel Aviv, saying that the government was indifferent to the abuse of women.</p> \n<p>Another rally took place outside the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem, during a cabinet meeting. Ten women held up banners with the following words: “Prime Minister Netanyahu, wake up! The blood of women is not cheap, don’t allow us to die. Violence starts in the corridors of power.”</p> \n<p>The demonstrators poured red paint on the road leading into the ministry and lay on it. Policemen arrived and wrote the women up for violations of the law before removing them.</p> \n<p>Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein instructed that women employees who want to strike on Tuesday be approved to do so. &quot;I have instructed the Knesset committees to hold discussions on the topic of violence against women this week and to allow women to strike,&quot; he said. &quot;The Knesset will do everything it can to raise awareness to this issue and fight against it.&quot;</p> \n<p>Histadrut Chairman Avi Nissenkorn announced that he was allowing employees wishing to attend Tuesday’s rallies to miss work without losing a day’s wages. He called on other employers to do likewise.</p> \n<p>The Social Workers’ Union is joining the protest as well, with its members expected to attend the rally in Tel Aviv. The union’s chairwoman, Inbal Hermoni, called on the government to immediately transfer the 250 million shekels ($67 million) it had committed to allocate to an emergency plan for prevention of violence against women.</p> \n<p>President Reuven Rivlin said on his Twitter account that female employees of the President’s Residence will be able to join the strike. Harel Toubi, director general of the residence, said he viewed the campaign for ensuring the safety of women as a necessary and worthy one, and that “the presidential residence sees itself as a partner in taking steps necessary for the protection of the dignity and status of women.”</p> \n<p>Interior Ministry Director-General Mordechai Cohen asked the Civil Service Commissioner to approve a strike by female employees. The ministry called on local authorities to abide by the law and wait for the opinion of legal advisers before approving a strike without docking anyone’s pay. “The ministry identifies with the women’s protest against violence,” said an announcement on the ministry’s behalf.</p> \n<p>Many local authorities announced that they would join the strike, including Kiryat Yam, Rehovot, Sderot, Ashdod, Zichron Yaakov, Nesher and Acre.</p> \n<p>Microsoft Israel announced that its employees would wear black “in solidarity with all women suffering from violence, in Israel and around the world.” The Superpharm drugstore chain announced that it would allow its employees to join the strike without losing a day’s pay, as long as its operations aren’t damaged.</p> \n<p>The strike was initiated by a group called “I’m a woman, I’m striking” and a “Red Flag” coalition numbering more than 50 feminist groups. According to protest organizers, “This is our time for taking to the streets and giving voice to the problem. On Tuesday we’re all striking. We’re in the midst of a show of force by women, one which gives hope, and we won’t remain quiet until women’s lives are put at the top of the national agenda.”</p>",

They join the bloodstained list of 22 women and girls murdered since the beginning of the year. The latest wave of violence cannot be taken off the agenda, say Dror Sadot, Stav Amnon and Ruti Klein, who have organized the protest against violence against women, which will be held across Israel on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>The main event will be the march from Tel Aviv’s WIZO House, joined by families of the victims from past years. With the Red Flag coalition, which numbers over 50 feminist organizations, they are demanding that the government allocate the 250 million shekels ($67 million) that it approved last year for a program to prevent violence against women.&nbsp;At 10 A.M., 24 minutes of silence will be observed across the country in memory of the 24 women killed in domestic-violence incidents in the last year.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'We Are All Sexually Harassed in the Israeli Army, Almost on a Daily Basis'&nbsp;■&nbsp;How anti-femicide protest is uniting women in Israel's Arab and Jewish communities&nbsp;■&nbsp;Arab society is ripe for action against violence. Now its leaders must act | Analysis ■&nbsp;Murder of 12-year-old girl shows human rights in Israel are only for Jews&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>Not only women’s organizations should be leading this fight. It belongs to all Israeli citizens. Therefore, women and men across the country will strike on Tuesday in protest against the government’s ignoring of the murder of women and violence in the family. The Knesset actually had an opportunity to prove that it is the address for dealing with this ongoing tragedy, but its members, male and female, chose to vote against establishing a parliamentary investigative committee on the subject of femicide in Israel. Parliamentary discipline is more important than human lives. The female MKs had excuses, even those for whom the struggle for women is a defining part of their activities.</p> \n<p>There are 200,000 physically abused women in Israel, and this figure will not change unless the government wakes up. The forced visit of the prime minister and his wife to some random battered women’s shelter will not help when government funding does not go to finding and rescuing the victims. Women and men are taking to the streets on Tuesday because it looks like no one in the government, including its head, is in a rush to do everything in their power to rein in the phenomenon. Two weeks ago, the Council for Higher Education approved gender separation on campuses. With a deceptive cover of pluralism and a desire to integrate Haredi men into the workforce, the Council for Higher Education is denying the fact that separation only prepares the ground for the exclusion of women down the road.</p> \n<p>The High Court of Justice, which is supposed to be the beacon of equality in Israel, also failed. By a majority of two justices, the status of women was pushed back last week. The court reinforced built-in discrimination in the religious courts when it decided not to intervene in the religious court ruling by which a woman has no right to half of marital property if she “cheated” on her husband. Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked found nothing amiss in the ruling.</p> \n<p>A great cry will be heard on Tuesday, when women and men across the country strike in protest against the characteristic contempt for women’s lives. Women will demand change at work, on campuses and in the public square. Women’s lives are not cheap, and a country that calls itself democratic cannot continue perpetuating institutional inequality that has fatal consequences for women.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz’s lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>&gt;&gt; UPDATE:&nbsp;Israel launches operation to destroy Hezbollah cross-border tunnels from Lebanon</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s unusual trip to Brussels – the announcement in the morning and the flight in the afternoon to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo – is an Israeli attempt to quickly utilize this diplomatic channel to deal with the increasing security problem in Lebanon. If this had been a meeting to coordinate positions before a military move, one assumes Netanyahu would have sent one of the security professionals (the Mossad chief, or the head of Military Intelligence) to speak with his American counterparts, and the meeting would not have been publicized.</p> \n<p>But the prime minister has started the diplomatic clock. His trip signals to Iran, Lebanon and Hezbollah, through the Americans (and perhaps also the French), that there’s an urgent need to deal with the problem before Israel considers using military means.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For two years Israel has been warning about the construction of Iranian weapons factories in Lebanon. In September, in his address to the UN General Assembly, Netanyahu revealed the location of three such sites, in which Iran and Hezbollah are allegedly improving the precision of the Lebanese organization’s missile and rocket arsenal. It certainly may be that Israel is worried about other possible developments, such as Hezbollah moving its focus from Syria, where the civil war is waning, back to a confrontation with Israel in southern Lebanon.</p> \n<p>The changes in Lebanon, and to some extent the increasing Iranian activity in Iraq, are the result of developments in Syria. Russia is seeking to stabilize the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad, and has exploited the accidental downing of its reconnaissance aircraft by Syrian air defenses on September 17 to restrain both Iran and Israel. Moscow is pressuring the Iranians to stop smuggling weapons to Lebanon through Syria, and at the same time is warning Israel against continuing its broad attacks against the smuggling convoys and Iranian bases in Syria.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These new circumstances forced Iran to changes its method of operations. But Gen. Qassem Suleimani, commander of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, is pushing the envelope. The repeated reports of Iranian planes unloading precise weaponry in Beirut are posing a new challenge to Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Israeli dilemma is familiar. During Syria’s civil war, the Israel Air Force operated almost freely in Syrian skies. After the fact, it emerged that there had been over 200 attacks on targets across the border just from the start of 2017 until this past September. But Israel now has less room to maneuver in Syria, and Lebanon is a whole different kind of problem.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Battle between Israel and Iran shifting from Syria to Lebanon</p> \n<p>Hezbollah has already warned several times that it would view any offensive action in Lebanon as a casus belli. This past weekend the organization posted a propaganda video on social networks in which it warned that it had the ability to launch precise attacks on Israeli infrastructure sites and military bases if the Israel Defense Forces attacked in Lebanon. The question before the cabinet and the security cabinet is, as in the past, whether to take a short-term risk (an attack that could provoke a response) to deal with a long-term danger (such as a weapons project).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The increased tension in the north is coming on the backdrop of other regional developments: the American effort to exert additional economic pressure on Iran; the U.S. support, albeit delayed, for Saudi Arabia following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul; the somewhat tense relations between the United States and Russia in the region; and the American decision to reinforce the special forces helping the Kurds in northeastern Syria. In Lebanon itself, tensions between Prime Minister Saad Hariri and Hezbollah are intensifying the political crisis there.</p> \n<p>Israel approaches this new battle with a rather significant advantage: the uncontested support of the Trump government, at least until now. U.S. President Donald Trump coordinates with Israel and is taking a tough stance against the Iranians. And since it’s difficult to predict what Trump might do, Tehran and Beirut must also consider the possibility that Washington will back Jerusalem even if Netanyahu – in contrast to his recent caution – decides to initiate a military action while risking confrontation.</p>",

It has to be one state. Separate but equal does not work. I’m only 42-years old but my teachers were of that generation that marched with Martin Luther King. This whole idea of a two-state solution, it doesn’t work.&quot;</p> \n<p>Representative-elect Ilhan Omar has also come out in support of boycotting Israel in remarks after her election, leaving many of her future constituents confused given that she said in August that the boycott movement was &quot;not helpful in getting that two-state solution.&quot; She has also drawn criticism for calling Israel an &quot;apartheid regime&quot; that had &quot;hypnotized the world&quot; to ignore its &quot;evil&quot; policies.</p> \n<p>In November, Tlaib and Omar became the first two Muslim women to be elected to Congress.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The name of the man who ordered Jesus crucified and ran his trial, the ancient infamous Roman governor of Jerusalem, Pontius Pilate, has been deciphered on a bronze ring found in excavations at the site of Herodion near the West Bank’s Bethlehem, some 50 years ago.</p> \n<p>The ring was found during a dig led by Professor Gideon Forster from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, a short time after the Six-Day War in 1968-69, as part of preparations to open the site to visitors.</p> \n<p>Findings were recently handed over to the current team that works at the site, led by Dr. Roee Porath, also from Hebrew University.</p> \n<p>The ring was one of thousands of items found in the dig. The famous name on it was discerned after a thorough cleansing, when it was photographed with the use of a special camera at the Israel Antiquities Authority labs. The inscription on what was apparently a stamping ring included a picture of a wine vessel surrounded by Greek writing translated as saying “Pilatus.’”</p> \n<p>The name Pilatus has been linked to that of Roman governor Pontius Pilate, mentioned in the New Testament as Jesus’ executioner. Pilate was the fifth of Roman leaders in Judah, and apparently the most important of them. He ruled in the years 26 to 36, and some say even from the year 19. The name was rare in the Israel of that era, says Professor Danny Schwartz.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know of any other Pilatus from the period and the ring shows he was a person of stature and wealth,” Schwartz said.</p> \n<p>A stamping ring of this type is also a hallmark to the status of the cavalry in Roman times, to which Pilate belonged. The ring is quite simple, therefore researchers believe it was used by the governor in day to day work, or belonged to one of his officials or someone in his court, who would use it to sign in his name.</p> \n<p>There has been one other find in Israeli archaeology with the name Pilatus on it, which is also attributed to the infamous Roman. In the 1960s, Prof. Forster found a stone with the name inscribed on it as well.</p> \n<p>The Herodion fortress was built by King Herod who also gave it its name. Following his death in the first century, it became a huge burial site. But the upper part of the complex continued to be used by Roman officials ruling over Judea at that time. It is likely that Pilate also used the Herodion as a central government administrative headquarters.</p> \n<p>Pilate is a well-known historic figure, whose image was one of a powerful ruler. The historian Josephus says he moved iconic medallions bearing the imperial bust of Caesar into Jerusalem against Jewish law which forbade such idols in the holy city. There was a huge outcry after this act was discovered, which ended when Pilate threatened the protesters with mass slaughter.</p> \n<p>“The Jews seemed to have rehearsed it ahead of time, falling to the ground as one, craning their necks to proclaim how they would sacrifice their lives not to violate the teachings of the Torah.” Pilate responded by immediately ordering the statues taken out of Jerusalem, Josephus wrote.</p> \n<p>In another instance, Josephus tells of how Pilate used treasures from the holy temple to pay for renovations of the water system Herod had built in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Researchers point at stories in the New Testament about the Bethlehem region where Herodion later became the site of a large Christian village.</p> \n<p>“You can see he had a natural link to the Herodion,” Porath said. “Even for Herod it was more than just a tomb site with a palace. It was also a significant site of government. You can see the unusual significance this site had. “</p> \n<p>The research into the ring was led by Professor Shua Amurai-Stark and Malcha Hershkovitz, and an article about it appeared last week in the Israel Exploration Journal.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Vlad, 12, has been jailed with his mother, Ira, 36, for five days at the Givon prison. They’re being held in inmate block 2, where the women are held.</p> \n<p>At first they were confined to their cell for 21 hours a day because he’s a male in a female prison. He was permitted to use the yard for just three hours a day. Due to his youth, the Prison Authority is now permitting Vlad to roam freely in the lockup like all the other inmates. He faces roll call four times a day.</p> \n<p>The Population, Immigration and Border Authority is holding him in custody until his mother agrees to deportation, which could take weeks. If they refuse to get on a plane to Ukraine, they will be forced to fly there under official escort.</p> \n<p>“I’m fine,” the boy says over and over again in an interview with Haaretz on Monday. He smiles a lot and seems to understand where he is. The cell is a typical one, with board games scattered across the table, next to some coloring books and colored pencils. Each day Vlad colors another page. He wears pajamas and black shoes, and his mother tries to create as homey a feeling as she can.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Fingerprinted, jailed and deported 'like criminals': Israel is turning away tourists from the former Soviet Union</p> \n<p>The boy says he watches movie videos but would be happy to return to school in Israel. His mother says, “We don’t want to return to Ukraine. I’m alone there and under threat. I hope we can stay in Israel.”</p> \n<p>The Ukrainian citizens spent the last three months in Rishon Letzion. Vlad began the seventh grade there. They lived with the mother’s brother, an Israeli citizen by virtue of his marriage to an Israeli. Ira, who entered Israel on a tourist visa, asked an attorney to file an asylum request on her behalf. She says she has received threats to her life in Ukraine because of a relative’s political actions.</p> \n<p>The attorneys have not finished gathering all the paperwork they need for the request, and she was arrested on Thursday for remaining in the country illegally. The authorities rejected her attorney’s request to leave the boy at the uncle’s home while his mother was in custody.</p> \n<p>Ira’s attorney, Orian Sahar, said: “This is an outrageous case that shows the bureaucratic snags of the state’s authorities that land a young boy behind bars, fences and barbed wire, only for seeking safety in Israel after being forced to leave his homeland for fear of his and his mother’s life. It’s all the more incomprehensible given that the minor’s uncle is an Israeli citizen providing full protection for the minor and his mother. Instead of allowing the uncle to have custody of his nephew, the authorities have chosen to jail the minor at the Givon prison. Beyond the moral and humanitarian issues, the violation of basic human rights and the psychological damage done to the minor by jailing him, the state’s decision is extremely unreasonable given the documentation provided at a hearing on their incarceration.”</p> \n<p>The court was expected to hear the case again on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>There are 30 female candidates for deportation in the prison by immigration authority orders. Men are men held in a separate cell block, as are criminal inmates.</p> \n<p>Prison wardens have brought toys and clothing for the children a number of times.</p> \n<p>Data obtained by Haaretz shows that since August, 16 women and children have been held at Givon.</p> \n<p>A woman and son were deported last month, also Ukrainian citizens, who had spent three weeks at Givon. In October a Filipina and her 9-year-old son were jailed there for a week before being deported. A few days earlier, a Filipina with her 4-year-old son spent four days at the prison; in September an Indian woman spent time there with an 11-month-old baby. In August two Filipinas spent time there with a girl of 2 and a boy of 11. A mother of a two-month-old infant was jailed there in August, along with the mother of a 4-year old girl from Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Israel customarily jailed children in rough conditions for years and faced criticism by the state comptroller and the United Nations Commission on Children’s Rights until 2011, when the Population Authority avoided deporting women with children, preferring to deport only the fathers so that the women and children would follow in their footsteps. Most minors imprisoned were of African origin whose families had crossed into Israel from Egypt and were jailed. In 2007-2012, 1,547 alien minors spent time in prisons.</p> \n<p>The population authority said in response: “The case involves a woman tourist who was arrested with her son for an illegal stay in the country. She will face a judge in the court tomorrow [Tuesday] in accordance with procedures and afterwards, a decision will be made about the case.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman on Monday implied Israeli Arabs are spreading measles, contrary to fact.</p> \n<p>During a meeting of the Knesset State Control Committee on how the state was handling the measles outbreak, Litzman said, “Measles came to Israel from abroad, from people who were not vaccinated there. This infected populations in Israel that do not vaccinate, some in the Arab sector and some in the Haredi [ultra-Orthodox] sector.</p> \n<p>“In the Haredi sector we dealt with the problem; we got to rabbis and the matter was taken care of. With regard to the Arab sector, I must distinguish between the regulated communities and the unregulated communities. I’m prepared to send mobile units anywhere which is why I am calling on the MKs from the Arab sector to call on the Arab public to be vaccinated.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Vaccinate your children&nbsp;| Editorial</p> \n<p>But Litzman’s remarks, which quickly became a headline on the Makor Rishon website (“Litzman: Measles coming primarily from the Arab sector”), do not correspond to reality. While in Haredi communities there are indeed lower-than-average rates of vaccination, vaccination rates among Arabs are actually very high. For example, in Nazareth and Iksal the vaccination rate for measles is 96.9 percent; in Taibeh, 96.5 percent and in Jaljuliya 95.9 percent. In comparison, the vaccination rate in Tel Aviv is only 92.5 percent; in Bnei Brak 92.8 percent; in Safed 93.7 percent and in Katzrin 88.9 percent.</p> \n<p>Moreover, when it comes to the measles infection rate, Jews are getting measles at a far higher rate than Arabs, which testifies to the Arabs’ higher vaccination rate. According to the Health Ministry’s own data, of the 2,040 cases of measles reported to date, Jewish cities top the list. Jerusalem, (a mixed city), has had 874 cases, Beit Shemesh, 266 cases; Safed, 149; Bnei Brak, 97; Betar Ilit, 95; Tel Aviv, 52, Modi’in Ilit, 31, and so on.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; U.S. authorities accuse Israel of measles outbreak in Haredi communities</p> \n<p>If one goes by Health Ministry districts, then the Jerusalem District ranks first with 1,304 cases, followed by Safed with 234; Tel Aviv with 171, and Petah Tikva with 95. In last place is the Nazareth district, with only one case.</p> \n<p>Prof. Nadav Davidovitch, chairman of the Public Health Association of the Israel Medical Association, told Haaretz, “Coping with epidemics requires cultural sensitivity. The Arab population has been getting vaccinated at high rates for many years. As a result, there are almost no cases of measles in Arab communities.”</p> \n<p>Litzman’s office responded by saying, “Deputy Health Minister Litzman made it clear several times that when it comes to health there is no difference between communities and that all Israeli citizens have an equal right to health services.</p> \n<p>“Litzman’s remarks on the issue were aimed at communities where there is a problem with vaccinating due to a lack of manpower and medical staff, particularly in the south, and the need to offer medical services, like vaccinations, there as well. The deputy minister did not mean to say that the Arab sector supposedly doesn’t vaccinate. The deputy minister regrets if his remarks were not properly understood.”</p>",

Ignore my gender assignments – he is Israel, she is American Jews – though I happen to think that in this case, they’re apt. No matter which side of the family you come from - or identify with – no one can deny that their union is in trouble and going from bad to worse.</p> \n<p>For many years it seemed like a love story from a fairy tale. He was brave, brash and handsome, like Paul Newman. She was rich and smart, a Jewish American princess, and what she lacked in beauty she made up for in unbridled worship for the very ground he marched on. It took them awhile to warm to each other – they kept at arm’s length for their first 19 years – but after June 1967 they fell into each other’s arms like long lost lovers. It was a match made in Jewish heaven, people said, with pride or with enmity, but mostly with envy.</p> \n<p>For 30-40 years they were one of the world’s foremost power couples. He was the knight who couldn’t bother to shine his armor; she was his Queen Esther in the king’s court. The dynamic duo put on a show like no one else: His every whim was her command, and both of them liked it that way. She knew that her attachment to him elevated her in the eyes of her peers. He knew that without her he’d have to stand in line in Washington like everyone else, instead of cruising on the fast lane to unparalleled power, money and influence.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israel's solidarity with diaspora jews died well before Pittsburgh | Opinion ■ Israel's rupture with American Jewry evokes Biblical story of Cain and Abel | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He’d always been cocky, with good reason, but over the years his attractive self-confidence morphed into obnoxious arrogance. Despite periodic failures and tragic accidents, 70 years of overall success went to his head. He turned holier than thou, rebuffed reproof, wallowed in victimhood, labeled his critics anti-Semites and was mortified when she, of all people, seemed to echo some of their sentiments. He wanted her to remain dutifully compliant, to do exactly as she’s told and to keep the checks coming, as always.</p> \n<p>He couldn’t hide his disdain for her newfound independence. He rejected all her appeals and requests to change the fundamentals of their relationship. She demanded equality and recognition, but soon after he met her half way, he changed his mind and reneged. It’s not appropriate now, he told her: The status quo will do just fine.</p> \n<p>Her liberal friends protested his crude behavior and he, in turn, reacted with scorn, finding new allies to take their place. He was increasingly seen in the bad company of his thuggish buddies, Viktor, Rodrigo, new-kid-on-the-block Jair and worst of all, Donald, the real estate tycoon. He can’t resist Donald. Donald showers him with gifts, promises the world and takes on his enemies, especially that constant complainer, Mahmoud, who doesn’t know how lucky he is to be locked in his basement.</p> \n<p>She detests Donald. She thinks he is a bully, a racist and a closet anti-Semite. She can’t stand any of Donald’s friends, either, whether they are attracted to him by nature or are simply kowtowing to find his favor. Even though it’s been going on for at least two years, she can’t stand the fact that her own mate, the darling of her youth, is Donald’s best friend in the whole wide world, He lauds him at every opportunity as his best mate ever and tells the world that Donald is the best thing that’s ever happened to him.</p> \n<p>Donald and my friends like me for what I am, he responds, and what’s more, they never complain. They can tell black from white, with no grey between them. They stand up for me. They’re more of a family to me than you can ever be, he once shouted. And if that wasn’t bad enough, when they badmouthed her hoity-toity values, he turned a deaf ear and pretended not to hear. When she raised the alarm, and even after her relatives were gunned down in Pittsburgh by a murderer who lived in Donald’s back yard, he said she was being hysterical.</p> \n<p>He no longer bothers to keep up appearances. I don’t need you anymore, he tells her. To add chutzpah to the insult, he started going out in public with his Evangelical mistress, her long time nemesis, who he’d courted on the sly. He’s not ashamed to strut around town with his new lady; they are the new toast of the town now, while she stays home and sulks. My girlfriend does everything I ask her to, he explained. She’s intimate with Donald just like his wife once was with Barack and George and Bill. And she never complains of headaches. Some people say he promised his lady-love that he’d eventually convert and they’d be married, though that could be only a rumor, spread by his girlfriend.</p> \n<p>His friends say it’s all her fault. She was a hippie in the 60’s but forgot to grow up. She’s turned into a tiresome knee-jerk liberal, supporting whatever noble cause comes her way, even those espoused by his worst enemies. She is hopelessly naive, clueless about the tough neighborhood he lives in and the rough and tumble ways needed to survive in it. After years of behaving like a good wife should, he tells his underlings, she’s turned shrill and demanding, nagging and complaining, expecting him to change instead of accepting him for what he is.</p> \n<p>Her friends are having none of it. He’s like the proverbial wunderkid, they say: The wunder is gone, but the juvenile remains. He expects her undying devotion to remain intact, as if he hadn’t changed completely.&nbsp; Sure, he’s still ingenious and enterprising and making a mint off his hi-tech investments, and he can still ward off house invaders like no one else, but he no longer aspires to be a model citizen, or champion of justice and human rights, as he was perceived before. Instead, he’s turned into a self-aggrandizing macho man who lashes out at anyone who dares question his behavior. He even has a special friend, Gilad, who prosecutes those whose criticism goes too far.</p> \n<p>Both of them are living in the past. She dreams of the suntanned pioneer and dashing sabra dream-boy of her youth. He yearns for their days of yore, when she marveled at his every word and delighted in throwing money at his every whim. But those days are long gone, never to return. They were like ships passing in the night, as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote, heading for silence and darkness.</p> \n<p>If there is a fleeting ray of light in the gathering clouds, it comes from the mutual recognition, after years of denial, that their marriage is on the rocks. Both are going through the motions of inviting intervention that might lead to reconciliation. &nbsp;But it’s a pipe dream, because without changing fundamentals – which both are loath to do - they are bound to grow ever more estranged from each other. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>If all else fails, a trial separation might help. Instead of trying to resuscitate a marriage that’s on life support, a clean break could help them get over their past and deal with their present. He could hang out with his new friends and see where it gets him. She could finally devote her time and efforts to herself: Years of unselfish dedication to his needs made her neglect herself and her own core values.&nbsp; Instead of catering to his whims, she could nurture her ties with those, including his own tenants, who share her views.</p> \n<p>If it won’t help, at least it can't hurt. Israel and American Jews are living on borrowed time. Their relationship is based on memories of a glorious past, fear of an uncertain future and a firm but unfounded conviction that a break-up is unthinkable. If he gets into serious trouble, as he’s wont to do with alarming frequency, she’ll still be there for him, misgivings and all, but that will only postpone their inevitable crash. Their differences are irreconcilable. The end might be nigh. If they were a married couple, they would already be consulting with their lawyers and preparing to file for divorce.</p>",

        "text":["<p>El Al Airlines will compensate all 400 passengers on its November 16 flight 002 from New York to Tel Aviv, which was rerouted due to delays to Athens, in order to avoid desecrating the Sabbath.</p> \n<p>The passengers will get free round-trip tickets to Europe as compensation for the “inconvenience” caused them, the company reported on Monday. The exact terms pertaining to use of these tickets have yet to be clarified.</p> \n<p>The flight earlier this month was beset by a series of delays. If, despite them, the pilots had continued on to their planned destination in Tel Aviv, the plane would have landed after Shabbat started. They opted to land instead in Athens, where all the passengers were asked to disembark.</p> \n<p>The El Al plane then continued on to Israel, with luggage but no non-crew members on board, and two smaller Israir jets were sent to pick up the non-observant passengers in Athens and fly them to Tel Aviv. The rest of the passengers were flown to Tel Aviv only after Shabbat. Thus all of the passengers were inconvenienced to some degree.</p> \n<p>The airline stressed again on Monday that it was not casting blame on anybody – observant or otherwise – for what happened. “El Al does not make distinctions between its customers by community, gender or nationality,” it stated.</p> \n<p>El Al is the only airline in the world that grounds its planes for 24 hours a week, on the Sabbath.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, following the debacle, the ultra-Orthodox community has been threatening to boycott the national carrier. Among those issuing the boycott threat was a passenger on the November 16 flight, Sholom Ber Sorotzkin, head of the Ateret Shlomo Yeshiva. In a letter, he gave the company until Sunday night to issue a formal apology and to find a way to make amends to the greater community of Sabbath-observers.</p> \n<p>On Monday morning Sorotzkin, an El Al frequent flier, flew to New York – on an El Al plane.</p> \n<p>In light of the uproar that has ensued, it's apparent that El Al regrets the decision to allow the plane to Tel Aviv to depart, after delays on the ground in New York. The alternative would have been to delay the flight until after the Sabbath and to accommodate all the passengers in hotels.</p> \n<p>In late 2006 the airline was boycotted by the ultra-Orthodox community, which cost the company about a million shekels a day, according to industry observers.</p> \n<p>El Al can ill afford to alienate this community, or any other potential passengers. Just last month the company signed a new employment agreement with its air crews, jacking up annual wage costs to about 635 million shekels (about $170.3 million) a year, an increase of 82 million shekels compared with 2018. This comes at a time when the airlines' share of passenger traffic has been diminishing, despite the uptick in tourism to Israel and Israeli travel abroad.</p> \n<p>Moreover, El Al is now heavily leveraged after purchasing seven Dreamliner jets at a cost of $1.2 billion, in addition to paying leasing fees totaling $922 million for nine Dreamliners.</p> \n<p>Estimates are that the ultra-Orthodox community constitutes 20 percent of all passengers on the Tel Aviv-New York line, El Al's most profitable, and the carrier can ill afford to lose such a substantial a chunk of its customers.</p> \n<p>The rub is that to get returns on its massive investment, El Al would have to operate its planes all the time – which is how low-cost companies operate. By comparison, EasyJet planes aren’t supposed to have more than 25 minutes' turnaround time on the ground.</p> \n<p>It bears mention the ultra-Orthodox have ignored the fact that El Al’s subsidiary, Sun D’or, flies on Shabbat.</p> \n<p>In his letter to the company, Sorotzkin had written that if his conditions were not met, he and the entire ultra-Orthodox community would be forced to change their allegiance to an airline that “does not come between a man and his devotion, does not ridicule the value and the holiness of the nation of God, its institutions or its principles.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Jerusalem Rabbinical Court has ordered children to be placed in the custody of their father, although the father is suspected of sexually abusing the children and is facing criminal charges. The court’s ruling went against the recommendation of welfare authorities in the city where the family lives to place the children with their mother.</p> \n<p>The court awarded custody to the father about a month ago, and according to attorney Batya Kahane-Dror, who represents the mother, it did so without a hearing, without allowing the mother to make a statement and without giving its reasons. The rabbinical court wrote that its recommendation was “temporary, until the mother fully cooperates with the court’s decisions and those of the doctor. The more the mother cooperates, the more the visitation arrangements between her and the children will return to what they were before.”</p> \n<p>The rabbinical judges also told the woman she should not go to the authorities if more suspicions were raised against the father, until she had received approval to do so from a private psychologist who was brought into the case, and who is being paid by the father.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Kahane-Dror called on the legal adviser to the Welfare Ministry to take action on the case, saying that the rabbinical court had exceeded its authority and made an unreasonable ruling, and the children would be seriously harmed as a result.</p> \n<p>The father, who has been divorced from the mother since early 2017, was arrested a few months ago on suspicion of committing indecent acts on his children. The welfare authorities at the time had placed the children with the mother, allowing the father visits at a family visiting center. However, the city where the family lives does not have such a center, so it was decided that the father could see his children at the office of a private psychologist hired by the father.</p> \n<p>The rabbinical courts administration responded: “This is a complex case in which hearings have been held and detailed rulings issued, and naturally the details cannot be gone into. At this time it is a matter of temporary custodianship of the father over the children, after in the opinion of three experts he is not dangerous, and their opinion was accepted by six judges in the regional [religious] court.”</p> \n<p>The rabbinical courts administration said that there were “essential flaws in the treatment by the welfare authorities that necessarily reflected on [the way] the court related to its recommendations,” and said that the court acted “only in keeping with the good of the children and in keeping with the entirety of evidence presented to it.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'It's not racism, it's Jewish law'</p> \n<p>Kahane-Dror wrote in her letter to the Welfare Ministry’s legal adviser that the psychologist had determined that the father was not endangering the children and had recommended unsupervised visits.</p> \n<p>A few months ago the psychologist determined that the father could have custody of the children. However, according to Kahane-Dror, the psychologist’s reports were not made part of the file or discussed, and the mother was not permitted to see them.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the father was suspected of another indecent act, but the psychologist instructed the mother to lodge a complaint only if he approved her doing so, a position the rabbinical court adopted.</p> \n<p>Kahane-Dror said in response that the court had “placed itself above the law, the police and the prosecution, and before a ruling had been made on the sexual assault case, it ruled that the father can have custody over his daughter, whom he had allegedly abused.”</p> \n<p>The court was using the children, risking their well-being and safety, “to bend the woman to its authority,” Kahane-Dror said.</p> \n<p>Kahane-Dror said she had asked the Welfare Ministry’s legal adviser to intervene because the rabbinical court had violated the principle of the good of the child being paramount. “There is no argument that as long as the father is under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting his children, he cannot be a custodial parent until proven otherwise,” she said.</p> \n<p>The fact that the rabbinical court had instructed the mother not to lodge a complaint unless the psychologist hired by the father told her she could “was in complete opposition to the position of the authorities, which encourages reports and complaints to the police in order to combat family violence, especially in the Haredi [ultra-Orthodox] community, which rarely lodges complaints,” said Kahane-Dror.</p> \n<p>She also noted that the High Rabbinical Court “had not intervened to stop this scandal,” and called on the Knesset to enforce Israeli civil law on the rabbinical monopoly on marriage and divorce and act immediately to at least its authority in matters relating to children.</p>",

        "text":["<p>I am among the survivors of the infamous El Al flight 002, with whom I spent quite a bit of the Sabbath a week and a half ago in a hotel near the airport in Athens. There’s no doubt that this disturbing incident requires proper compensation to passengers from the national airline. But from the lively exchanges on the WhatsApp group of religiously observant victims of the incident, it appears that they ascribe no less importance to lessons being learned so that such incidents do not repeat themselves.</p> \n<p>Many conflicting versions of the events have been aired over the past few days, but now that the fog is beginning to lift, it turns out that there is no truth to reports that passengers were physically violent with the crew. El Al’s CEO himself said this. The truth is that this was an unfortunate chain of events that should become a case study in management schools. I’ll present a few issues in the hope that the airline’s management will heed constructive criticism.</p> \n<p>I’ll begin with the weather. There’s no argument that a particularly powerful snowstorm hit New York that day and caused unusual delays. It took my wife and me two and a half hours to reach Kennedy Airport from Manhattan – but we and all the other passengers managed to make the flight on time; only the El Al crew was late. El Al’s planning was faulty. The meteorologists had warned of the upcoming snowstorm. El Al’s obligation to its customers is to prepare accordingly, even for such circumstances.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Moving on to the lies and half-truths that the crew told the passengers. Businesses rise and fall on the products they offer, but also on their credibility and their reputation. In this case, insult was added to injury with the crew’s lateness paving the way for a series of announcements that “we’ll be moving in another five minutes,” and “we’re the first in line.” Passengers, who already felt El Al was demeaning them – without reference to the Sabbath issue – stopped believing what they were hearing.</p> \n<p>Another issue is the lack of understanding of the target audiences, which manifested itself in the superficial way the events were presented. There were various kinds of Sabbath observers on the flight. When the ultra-Orthodox were accused of being the hostile element in the story, things started to slide into stereotypes. In El Al’s decision to land specifically in Greece it opened up a front against everybody: its ultra-Orthodox and Orthodox passengers fumed over the enforced stay away from home without insurance and without their suitcases, and the secular passengers over another delay.</p> \n<p>There’s no denying that the situation was fluid and the captains had to make quick decisions. But the situation almost certainly promised failure, and El Al stubbornly refused to implement the simple, obvious solution when it refused to let off the passengers who were concerned over desecrating the Sabbath. The enormous creativity it showed in the name of making a business decision to get the plane close to Ben-Gurion International Airport could end up costing the airline dearly, if some of its devoted customers abandon it.</p> \n<p>The passengers were informed of the Athens plan only two hours before landing, but it was clear that the crew knew about it much earlier. Instead of taking the time for necessary organizing, the crew cut off contact and even announced that it was suspending service. This led to chaos. Without any attempt to understand how many passengers intended to stay in Athens – about 180 in the end – they gave the local Chabad representatives the numbers of everyone who ordered the strictest form of kosher food – about a third of all the Sabbath observers on the flight. There were not enough rooms in the hotel. With the assistance of the wonderful Chabad people, the food was stretched to cover what was missing.</p> \n<p>When the flight ended, the pilot said the stop in Athens was “out of consideration of the Sabbath-observant passengers,” but he was very wrong. He is also to blame, perhaps unintentionally, for slandering the Sabbath observers. The flight was suspended not for the “good” of any passenger, but because that is El Al’s clear policy. The Israeli airline keeps the Sabbath for its own reasons, among them because it earns the company quite a bit of money and passenger loyalty.</p> \n<p>Rules of Sabbath observance are not a code that means pulling out the claim of pikuah nefesh – saving a life – whenever one wants to break them. And claims by El Al officials are also a bit ludicrous: that people who are concerned over desecrating the Sabbath should not take flights that ask for trouble. If an airline proudly states it is a “Sabbath-observant company” then there should be no problem to board a flight that is supposed to land four hours before the Sabbath starts. What did the Sabbath do to deserve being exploited to justify this negligence?</p> \n<p>The Greek Sabbath was spiritually uplifting and all the passengers and their luggage returned home. Hardly any of them have heard a word from El Al since the incident and they are still waiting for an explanation and compensation.</p> \n<p>The author filled a variety of positions in the Prime Minister’s Office from 1990 to 2016.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The moment it became clear the Bank of Israel would have a long period between governors – more than a month between Karnit Flug’s departure and Amir Yaron’s arrival on December 24 – the question was whether the bank would try to project an image of business as usual.</p> \n<p>In its surprise move Monday, Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg did just that. As acting governor she presided over a meeting of the monetary policy committee that raised rates 0.15 percentage point – the first rise in more than seven years and the first change at all in nearly four years.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to find a clear reason why rates are being raised now instead of two months ago or two months from now. There have been no dramatic developments over the past month to justify the step – unemployment remains low, economic growth has weakened a bit and inflation is completely under control.</p> \n<p>But two bits of data convinced the monetary committee to act.</p> \n<p>One is the increase in inflation in the middle of 2018 to inside the government’s annual target of between 1% and 3%. The rate has been below the target for several years.</p> \n<p>The other is rising U.S. interest rates, which have weakened the shekel and saved the Bank of Israel the trouble of intervening in the market to prevent the Israeli currency from strengthening too much.</p> \n<p>When economic-growth prospects are unclear, central bankers don’t raise rates. The fact that the Bank of Israel did so signals that it believes the economy’s outlook is bright. That’s based on strong data for the labor market – low joblessness and rising wages – pointing to continued strong demand.</p> \n<p>Israelis are in a good situation. Not only is pay rising, but the spike in housing prices has leveled off and there don’t seem to be any clouds on the horizon at the moment. Under the circumstances, it makes sense for monetary policy to be “normalized.”</p> \n<p>The base rate of 0.1% the Bank of Israel has preserved since 2015 was a historical low and not normal at all. It created an environment of cheap money and could have produced an asset bubble. Indeed, the soaring home prices of the past decade were in no small part due to low mortgage rates,</p> \n<p>No one predicted that in September 2008, when the global financial crisis was gathering steam, all the world’s central banks would lower their rates to near zero and rates would stay there for years.</p> \n<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve signaled three years ago that it was returning to normalcy by starting to raise rates to 2.125% today. In Japan and the eurozone, central bank rates are still negative, which is abnormal to say these least.</p> \n<p>The Bank of Israel’s next rate decision in January will be taken under Yaron. He’ll have to decide whether to continue Flug’s policies and keep the base rate stable for some time or follow Baudot-Trajtenberg’s policies and preserve the rate differential between Israel and the United States.</p>",

        "text":["<p>There was ostensibly no reason for the so-called cultural loyalty bill to meet its demise in the Knesset. Some 70 percent of the public supports it. All the right-wing parties in the government coalition — and now in the opposition as well — voted for it in the initial stage of the legislative process, and even Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit gave it his blessing.</p> \n<p>We have seen bills pass into law that were more controversial and harder to stomach. Moreover, the cultural loyalty bill, which would give the culture minister the authority to retroactively suspend government funding for cultural activities that “contravene the principles of the state,” already exists in the form of the so-called Nakba Law, which confers similar authority upon the finance minister to cut state funding to entities that openly reject Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, or that mark Israeli Independence Day as a day of mourning.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Regev's cultural loyalty law represents the Israeli patriotism of cowards | Opinion</p> \n<p>Miri Regev, the culture minister and retired military censor, has been seeking to have those powers transferred to her ministry so that she can sow fear among artists, writers and heads of cultural institutions on the eve of the Likud primaries. But a week ago, the coalition underwent an amputation and was left with a razor-thin 61-seat majority. This presents a new situation requiring new demeanor: the caution of a brain surgeon, the delicateness of a lace embroiderer and the emotional intelligence of an educational psychologist. Not exactly the epitome of the lady who happened into the Culture and Sports Ministry.</p> \n<p>Passing laws during such an unstable period and with such a small majority, when people have their sights set on elections that are not so far off, requires sensitive and secretive work behind the scenes. Based on Regev’s spectacle in the Knesset, it seems that somebody there hasn’t changed their way of thinking — and hasn't noticed that the coalition now controls 61 seats rather than 66.</p> \n<p>Knesset member David Bitan expressed it well when he was recorded as saying: “We want a government [to last] until May,&quot; while Regev is calling press conferences and inflaming matters. &quot;We don’t need to spark antagonism.”</p> \n<p>Regev’s unbridled assault on Netanyahu’s most important coalition partner, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon of the Kulanu party, whom she accused of nothing less than “transferring money to terrorists and Jew-haters,” is a symbol of total loss of control. If there was still the slightest chance of breathing life into the dead body of the cultural loyalty bill, she thrust a dagger into the heart of what was the apple of her eye.</p> \n<p>We will never know if she made her comments with Netanyahu's blessing. It is only infrequently that she acts independently, without instructions from the Prime Minister's Residence. There are unpopular bills that the Knesset passes by virtue of the political and personal abilities of the relevant cabinet minister. When the sponsor is Regev, whose art is castigation, whose coarseness is her flagship and argumentativeness her trademark, her partners don't go out of their way to help her. It's possible that if it had been a calmer and more affable minister, the result would have been different.</p> \n<p>Regev’s defeat prompted mainly schadenfreude in the government and the Knesset. Her term will be remembered mainly as a cacophony, and the press conference characterized her better than any newspaper article could have. On Monday, in an act of unparalleled cynicism, she explained the necessity of the bill as being the will of “the bereaved parents” and terror victims. This woman, who just a week ago dragged the case of a child — Daniel Tragerman, who was killed by a mortar shell on the Gaza border in the 2014 Gaza war — presents herself as a martyr to mourning.</p> \n<p>About an hour after her press conference, in which she basically conceded her failure while hurling accusations at Kahlon and former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, as if they work for her, the Likud Knesset faction held a meeting. Prime Minister (and Defense Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu reported on his encounter with newly inducted soldiers, a ritual every defense minister carries out. He didn’t mention a word about his political colleague's failed flagship bill.</p> \n<p>He doesn’t like to be associated with failure. If the bill had passed, we would have heard victorious boasts.</p> \n<p>It wouldn't be entirely fair to place all the blame for the legislative fiasco on Regev. The failure has another father named Netanyahu. At a news conference that Avigdor Lieberman called, before Regev, he revealed the deal: The Prime Minister's Office had been prepared to commit that the Likud faction would support a bill on the death penalty for terrorists, the apple of Lieberman's eye, in exchange for Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu faction's support for the so-called Gideon Sa'ar bill. That bill would require the president to call on the leader of a party rather than a junior faction member to form a government.</p> \n<p>That's the story. Right-wing, ideological bills are not important to Netanyahu. They bore him. He has his sights only on the bill that would purportedly require the president to call on him to form the next government.</p> \n<p>&quot;It's not ideology. It's seatology,&quot; Lieberman said, and just for the fun of it added: &quot;We know Miri Regev,&quot; whom he said spoke with the same enthusiasm as army spokeswoman at the time about the 2005 Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p>",

On Facebook the new mayor, Avi Elkabetz, proudly stated that he had closed the city park the day before to everyone but city residents. Elkabetz is keeping his election promise. After all, he pledged to maintain this northern city’s Jewish character and fight the “conquest of the park.”</p> \n<p>This isn’t the first attempt to “maintain the Jewish character” of Afula. A protest once arose in the city after Arab families won the bidding process to have dozens of housing units built. And Afula isn’t alone. A few months ago, Kfar Vradim in the Western Galilee hills tried to halt a bidding process after it emerged that half the winners of the previous tender were Arabs.</p> \n<p>Israel has a long history of insularity, exclusion and discrimination – in allocating land and other resources, in distributing the population around the country, and in residential screening committees – not only toward the Arab minority but also toward Mizrahi Jews and other groups.</p> \n<p>The ceremony in Afula is another warning sign against dangerous processes underway in the Jewish community under the most right-wing government in the country’s history and a prime minister who, at the ballot box, feeds on incitement against Israel’s Arab citizens.</p> \n<p>This swearing-in ceremony is a direct continuation of the nation-state law. This legislation, contrary to what people say on the right, expresses a breakdown of the ideology crafted by the country’s founders. It’s a betrayal of the Declaration of Independence’s values and a renunciation of equality as a fundamental value.</p> \n<p>Against the backdrop of the enshrining of Jewish supremacy and Arab inferiority, and the racist incitement that has become typical of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, not only should we not be surprised at shows of nationalist insularity and incitement, we should get used to the terrible idea that these will only spread.</p> \n<p>Citizens in a democratic country have the right to live wherever they want. No local authority has the right to prevent any person from living in its jurisdiction, or to close a park to Arabs on the pretext of promoting an “atmosphere of Afulaites.”</p> \n<p>Hopefully this racist, inflammatory government will pass away soon. Until then, the only hope to stop the illness’ spread is in the opposition that, against all odds, will spring everywhere Jews and Arabs live side by side in peace, Afula included.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz’s lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

The benchmark TA-35 index finished 1.5% higher at 1,622.23 points while the TA-125 added more than 1.3% to 1,458.90 on turnover of 1.2 billion shekels ($320 million). Bond prices fell, with the Tel-Bond 20 and Tel-Bond 60 indexes both closing about 0.3% lower. Among insurers, Migdal surged 7.8% to 4.15 shekels and Clal 5.1% to 63.90. Menorah Insurance rose 5.6% to 42.04, helped by an 87% rise in third-quarter profit to 193.5 million shekels. Bank Leumi advanced 3,7% to 24.51 and Bank Hapoalim 2.8% to 25.63. Fox added nearly 1% to end at 84.49 after Leumi Capital Markets tagged the stock a Market Overweight and said the share could rise another 22%.

Matomy shares plunged 44% Sunday and another 4.4% Monday to close at 35 agorot (9 cents), while its bonds fell to 52.3 agorot, raising their yield to a junk level of 41%. The selling came after the company said Friday it was in talks to delay an agreement to buy out minority shareholders in its Team Internet unit by November 30 and revise the terms. The company also said it has approached Matomy bondholders about “recent developments and [to] assess the possibility of adopting agreed revisions to the terms of the bond.” Matomy also included a “flash report” of its financial results for the third quarter, which showed earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of just $2 million on revenues of $103 million.

The Israeli private equity firm FIMI Opportunity Funds will be selling its 50% stake in the company in an offering of shares and warrants in the company. Once part of the global G4S security provider, G1 was sold – reportedly under pressure from the BDS movement – to FIMI last year. G1 provides security services for business and government customers. The company had revenues of 599 million shekels in the first nine months of this year, generating a net profit of 32 million. It has a policy of paying dividends equal to 50% of annual net profit. The initial public offering will be the 15th for FIMI on the TASE.

The chain, which is owned by its 13,000 members, said its assets of about 250 million shekels ($67.3 million) exceeded its debts by about 50 million but it was experiencing short-term cash-flow problems in part due to one-time expenses. Nationwide the society operates 42 stores directly and 30 through franchisees, but industry sources say they doubt Co-Op’s problems would affect competition. “They haven’t been real competitors for years,” one industry executive said. “On the contrary, they hurt competition by buying [from suppliers] at any prices and preventing prices from falling.” Judge Alexander Ron scheduled a hearing on the petition for Wednesday. Union leaders at Co-Op declared a labor dispute, which could lead to a strike in two weeks. (Efrat Neuman, Hadar Kane and Gabriela Davidovich-Weisberg)</p>",

        "text":["<p>Luckily, centrist and left-wing voters stopped believing opinions declared by pundits and prominent media personalities in Israel a long time ago. The recent hollow talk by senior Haaretz writers, lauding the many qualities of their newfound hero Benjamin Netanyahu, not only insults the good judgement of many people, who feel that under his leadership the country is going off the rails, but once again imposes chaos on people’s basic opinions.</p> \n<p>Most voters of the center-left know Habayit Hayehudi is a marginal party that governs affairs here only because Likud pathetically handed over the keys. The main culprits behind the vast majority of revolting laws being passed one by one in the country are the prime minister and his Likud cronies.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The stories now making the rounds about Netanyahu’s efforts to select the new Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, and if not him then at least his deputy, show yet again how the organizations that should be overseeing fateful decisions such as the acquisition of submarines take fright at Netanyahu or his representatives, timidly dropping any criticism of their actions.</p> \n<p>In spite of the credit due the premier in light of his objection to the nuclear accord with Iran, there is no sane person of conscience in Israel who does not know that Netanyahu is the true source of the venom that has been disrupting our life for the last 20 years – the wellspring from which the poison has seeped into Israeli society.</p> \n<p>Telling Israelis now that Netanyahu is actually not that bad, and that he may be preferable to opposition leader Tzipi Livni – not to mention Yair Lapid – constitutes a betrayal of trust.</p> \n<p>Livni is finding increased favor among center and left-minded voters since she expresses their most profound beliefs in a clear and unambiguous fashion. Instead of abandoning them to the embarrassing choir that’s suddenly singing the praises of Netanyahu from the left wing, Livni is confirming the basic values of democracy and of Zionism, values which have always driven centrist-leftist voters.</p> \n<p>After many years of confusion surrounding the basic values embraced by a public that always supported security and peace, Livni articulately and accurately expresses their deepest and truest convictions. This is why people support her.</p> \n<p>The same is true with regard to Lapid. Despite media scorn in response to his ambitions of becoming prime minister, there is no doubt that he expresses authentic and deeply felt public views. The statement “I love Israel” expresses a true value, one that drives most moderate left-wing voters after years of undermining by post-Zionists. It’s not surprising that polls are showing that most of these voters continue to support Lapid as the candidate with the highest chances against Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>The real facts – not the imagined ones – show that his party Yesh Atid, which was badly bruised in the 2015 elections, is nevertheless the only political party currently capable of standing up to Likud. Apparently, no other party, in the opposition or the coalition, including the Zionist Union – which won 24 seats in 2015, but is currently polling at half that number – can pose a realistic threat to Netanyahu, according to recent surveys.</p> \n<p>Maybe former Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, or another miraculous candidate who crops up, will win the next election and beat Netanyahu. For now, however, Gantz, just like Moshe Kahlon before the last elections, has been propelled forward mainly thanks to the media. His chances, in effect, are lower than those of Lapid, who’s already out there. Thus Lapid, with important support from Livni, Gantz, Ehud Barak and others, is the only one capable of finally ending the Netanyahu saga.</p>",

This is one of the biggest deals in Israel’s weapons sector to date.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Elbit will be paying 1.8 billion ($495 million) or 1.9 billion shekels to the state.</p> \n<p>The amount that the state will save following the sale is part of what helped the Finance Ministry officials to convince the Defense Ministry to give the deal the go-ahead.</p> \n<p>Finance officials presented data indicating that IMI is losing an average of 250 million shekels a year, and that the state has needed to inject 5 billion shekels into the company to keep it alive over the past few decades.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some sources familiar with the company say that in practice, the state has actually injected closer to 10 billion into IMI over the years.</p> \n<p>Of the money Elbit is paying for IMI, only 500 million or so is expected to go into state coffers. The remainder will go to covering IMI’s obligations.</p> \n<p>The deal was carried out a week after Avigdor Lieberman resigned as defense minister, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took up the post. Lieberman had been hesitant to approve the deal, and delayed it, citing security considerations. Plenty of defense officials failed to understand Lieberman’s reasoning, and speculated that the deal would only go through after he left office.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu favors privatization as a matter of principle, and pushed through the deal quickly after taking over from Lieberman.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is also a longtime acquaintance of Elbit controlling shareholder Michael Federmann, who, like Netanyahu, went through the Israel Defense Forces elite Sayeret Matkal unit.</p> \n<p>The acquisition was approved last week, shortly after Lieberman’s resignation.</p> \n<p>Elbit is slated to pay 1.4 billion shekels now, and another 400 million shekels in 2020 and 2022. The company may pay an extra 100 million shekels depending on IMI’s financial results.</p> \n<p>The deal calls for vacating IMI’s operations at its Ramat Hasharon and Tirat Hacarmel complexes, thus enabling that land to be used to build more than 30,000 homes in high-demand areas. IMI’s operations will be moved to Ramat Beka, in Israel’s southern Negev desert.</p> \n<p>“The synergy between the capabilities of the two companies ... will enable us to offer an enhanced portfolio and to realize the potential of the technologies of IMI in the international arena, making this acquisition significant to our long-term growth strategy,” Elbit CEO Bezhalel Machlis said.</p> \n<p>The government announced in 2013 its intention to privatize IMI, a manufacturer of military systems best known for being an early maker of the Uzi submachine gun. Elbit was the last remaining bidder among five that had shown interest.</p> \n<p>Defense Ministry Director General Uzi Adam noted that IMI’s acquisition by an Israeli company insured that its defense know-how would stay within the country, while improving Israel’s defense exports.</p> \n<p>With reporting by Reuters.</p>",

Shufersal last year agreed to buy New-Pharm Drugstores, which operates dozens of branches in Israel, for 130 million shekels. Expenses rose to 763 million shekels from 664 million due to the integration of New-Pharm and to costs associated with the launching of a new credit card as well as a rise in salary expenses.

But disputes between different ministries are preventing the recommendations from being approved.</p> \n<p>The proposal, which was submitted to the interior and social affairs ministers, suggests allocating 26 million shekels ($7 million) for this purpose.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Currently, municipal welfare departments provide no services to asylum seekers unless the asylum seeker’s life is in danger. ASSAF, the Aid Organization for Refugees and Asylum Seekers, has petitioned the High Court of Justice over this issue, arguing that the state is obligated to provide welfare services to everyone who needs them, including people with no legal status in Israel.</p> \n<p>Following a 2014 state comptroller’s report on the issue, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit set up a task force to look into it, headed by Prof. Shlomo Mor-Yosef, director of the Interior Ministry’s Population, Immigration and Border Authority. The panel also included officials from the social affairs, housing, interior, health and justice ministries.</p> \n<p>The task force decided that welfare departments should help five categories of asylum seekers – battered women, the homeless, children at risk, the disabled and people who are particularly distressed for some other reason. But other asylum seekers who need welfare assistance – for instance, those who are simply poor – would not be entitled to aid.</p> \n<p>So far, however, disputes between ministries have prevented these recommendations from being approved. Social Affairs Minister Haim Katz has demanded that if the budget allocated to local welfare departments for helping asylum seekers runs out, the Finance Ministry be required to make up the shortfall rather than having the extra money come from the Social Affairs Ministry.</p> \n<p>Another unresolved issue is whether the Health Ministry will pay for medical care for asylum seekers entitled to welfare services.</p> \n<p>A source in the Social Affairs Ministry said his ministry “is in favor of resolving this issue and opening the departments, something we sometimes do even today, without getting a budget for it. We’re in favor of giving them welfare services. But we insist on making sure that it won’t come at other people’s expense.”</p> \n<p>There is a High Court of Justice hearing on the issue scheduled for Monday. Last week the state had asked the court for a 90-day extension to complete its work on the issue.</p> \n<p>The petition, filed in 2016, states, “Asylum seekers live in Israel legally, based on the residency permits give them by the Population and Immigration Authority. Many of them are coping with numerous difficulties after they’ve been through very harsh events like rape, kidnappings, and abuse, and as a result they are suffering from post-traumatic stress. Many of them are in constant survival mode as the result of deliberate policies of the State of Israel, which defines their stay in Israel as temporary, without eligibility for benefits. Many of the asylum seekers are employed at odd jobs, with no job security and at low wages. These men and women constitute one of the weakest and neediest populations in Israel. … We are talking about a policy that defies the wording of the law, an administrative decision made without any authority that is discriminatory and contravenes international law and [Israeli] Basic Laws.”</p> \n<p>Back in 2014, the state comptroller determined that the policy of not treating asylum seekers contravenes the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty, and raises difficulties regarding international conventions Israel has signed. “It’s doubtful if welfare services can identify foreigners who are at risk, because foreigners’ access to social services is extremely limited,” the comptroller wrote at the time. “There is a real concern that the response given to these weak and vulnerable groups as a result of implementing said policy does not meet the provisions of the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty.”</p> \n<p>According to Michal Pinchuk, director of Assaf, “The new recommendations from the highest echelons in the government ministries are breaking the lock on doors that have been locked to one of the country’s neediest populations. The opening of welfare bureaus to asylum seekers, including victims of violence, people with disabilities, and victims of torture – all of whom have lived in Israel legally for many years – is the only right, just and moral step.”</p> \n<p>She added, “We regret that the recommendations of the professional team, which worked hard to reach an optimal solution, are being delayed because the political echelon does not have the courage to do the right thing and adopt these important recommendations.”</p> \n<p>According to attorney Elad Kahana of the Refugee Rights Clinic at Tel Aviv University Law School, which filed the petition, “The Welfare Services Law is meant to assist every person in need and the decision to deny welfare services to asylum seekers is improper. The state’s decision to reexamine the matter is welcome, but this examination has been going on for two years, the result is as yet unknown and meanwhile people who are entitled to assistance by law are in serious distress and aren’t getting help.”</p>",

City council members swore allegiance to the State of Israel and its laws, as stipulated by law, but then also promised to preserve the Jewish character of Afula as well as the religious status quo in the city.</p> \n<p>Itai Cohen, a city council member from the Habayit Hahevratit (Social Home) faction, told Haaretz: “It was very touching, and it is a legitimate right.” Cohen said he is now proposing that all educational institutions in the city fly the Israeli flag at the entrance to their buildings, and suggested “proudly flying” the Israeli flag at all of the entrances and exits in an out of Afula, the main city in the Jezreel Valley, in the north of the country.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>&quot;We must proudly identify with the State of Israel, its values, its Declaration of Independence,” said Cohen, who in the past was one of the leaders of the protests after all of the successful bidders for the purchase of dozens of lots in 2015 sold through a public bidding process were Arab.</p> \n<p>In another development, the new mayor of Afula, Avi Elkabetz, who was elected last month after running a campaign promising residents to preserve the Jewish character of the city, closed Afula's municipal park to non-residents last Saturday. The Facebook page for the park said only city residents would be given access to the park last Saturday. The post suggested that residents seeking to come to the park then bring their identity cards with them, which shows their address. Hanukkah holiday events in the park next week will also be open only to Afula residents.</p> \n<p>Elkabetz was the city's mayor from 2013 to 2015 and the municipal park was built during his tenure. In this year’s municipal election campaign, he participated in demonstrations against the sale of homes to Arabs in the predominantly Jewish city.</p> \n<p>In August, as part of Elkabetz’s election campaign, he wrote the following on Facebook: &quot;The occupation of the municipal park must end. It is not a political issue. It is not an election issue. It is simply a fundamental matter of principle. A park that was built for the residents of Afula needs to remain theirs .… We must proudly wave Israeli flags through the entire park and play music in Hebrew,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>Elkabetz wrote that the park should be closed for maintenance on days when large numbers of non-residents planned on coming. “We need to stop being exploited! It can be done. We just need the will. Don’t surrender in advance and certainly don't encourage the admission of non-residents to our park,” he warned on Facebook.</p> \n<p>In response to a question from Haaretz as to whether closing the park to non-residents was racist, Cohen, the councilman, said: “I don’t see any racist element [in the policy] because [those who live] outside [Afula] cannot enter even if they are Jewish. There is no issue of Jews and Arabs here .… Arabs have businesses in Afula. If there is something inappropriate about calling Afula a Jewish city, then I need to pack my bag and move abroad. The State of Israel was carved in blood, its values and Jewishness.”</p> \n<p>In recent years, including the period of the protests against the sale of homes in the city to Arabs, some residents complained that Arabs from the surrounding areas make substantial use of the park.</p> \n<p>In an interview with Chaim Hecht on Radio Kol Rega in March, Elkabetz said: “This issue of coexistence has come up more and more recently, and I have a sort of suspicion — and call it whatever name you want — that we are not protecting the Jewish character of Afula enough. It begins at home, it moves into the neighborhood and it moves on to the park, and we need to stop it as soon as possible.”</p> \n<p>Later, after Hecht told him he was riding a racist tiger, Elkabetz said: “God forbid. There is no issue of racism here.” Referring to the largely Arab region to the southwest of Afula, Elkabetz added: “I agree with you that we need to build a park for Arabs in Wadi Ara, whether it’s from state funds or from the towns' money, but the park in Afula was not built by the state. The park in Afula was built by the Afula municipality with money from Afula residents and it would be proper for the residents of Afula to benefit from it first.”</p> \n<p>The Afula municipality said it has had excellent commercial relations that cut across population sectors and this will continue. &quot;The city of Afula, like the State of Israel, was Jewish and will remain Jewish, and all the members of the city council, coalition and opposition, have committed to preserving the Jewish nature of the city.”</p> \n<p>The municipality said the municipal park is “the center of activities in the city and the lively heart of the city.” The city's statement explained that the network of local community centers, which holds activities in the park, asked to allow only local residents to attend special events that it was organizing for last Saturday and during Hanukkah. This was permitted to enable Afula residents and their families to enjoy the activities, the municipality said. The decision was made based on legal advice, and the city does not intend to apologize for it, the municipality stated.</p> \n<p>&quot;The park belongs to the residents of Afula and any attempt to link that to the Arab-Jewish issue is divorced from reality. No outsiders were allowed to enter. It does not matter where they live, and it will be the same during Hanukkah, when the local community center will hold activities in the park,” the city's statement added.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Sometimes it’s hard to understand why Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan aren’t good friends. Both are more paranoid about domestic political rivals than about external enemies, both despise the free press and both have a common enemy: George Soros, the Hungarian-born Jewish billionaire who supports human rights organizations.</p> \n<p>The Turkish human rights activist Osman Kavala was arrested in October 2017 and held on the charge of attempting to upset the constitutional order and attempting to bring down the Turkish government. This is a generic charge that is leveled at anyone suspected of having a connection with the organization of the Muslim Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan blames for the attempted coup in July 2016; or against anyone associated with the mass protests of 2013 against a plan to destroy Gezi Park in Istanbul.</p> \n<p>At a meeting that Erdogan held with local leaders last Wednesday, he announced that “one of the financiers of the protest [Kavala] is already in prison, and behind him is the infamous Hungarian Jew George Soros, who sends his people all over the world to divide and topple nations, while using his fortune for that purpose.” For Erdogan, declarations are not enough. Last week, 13 academics were arrested on suspicion of belonging to Gulen’s group.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Turkey: The one place Trump's bullying is actually working | Opinion ■ Erdogan takes aim at MBS: What's driving Turkey in the Khashoggi scandal | Explained</p> \n<p>In addition, the campaign of persecution against officials, teachers and civil servants continues with full force. According to a recent survey among Turkey’s teachers, about 70 percent said that they were afraid of losing their jobs due to the threatening atmosphere imposed by the government on the education system and in over the dismissal of about 41,000 school employees who were among 140,000 civil servants dismissed from their jobs since the unsuccessful coup.</p> \n<p>On another occasion, Erdogan complained that Turkey lags behind when it comes to university scientific research and that Turkish citizens read an average of only three to four minutes a day, but watch television for six hours a day. It would interesting to know whether there’s a connection here, since when thousands of lecturers left or were fired from academic institutions, we can assume that their research also ground to a halt. Incidentally, in raising the issue, Erdogan admitted that he doesn’t read books. His aides provide him with summaries. Maybe he hasn’t read Anton Chekhov either.</p> \n<p>Not only teachers, but also judges and business people fear the long arm of the regime. Journalists continue to be targets of the Turkish intelligence service despite the fact that of 29 major media outlets, 21 are owned by Erdogan’s associates. The most recent blow was sustained by the newspaper Hurriyet, which was sold in March to the Demiroren conglomerate, which has very close ties to the president.</p> \n<p>The difference between the old Hurriyet and the new version was immediately evident with the change in ownership. The critical articles became wishy-washy commentaries, the investigations and expos&eacute;s disappeared, and the home page of its English edition, Hurriyet Daily News, features cheery articles about vacation spots in Turkey and food and entertainment venues in the country.</p> \n<p>As the traditional media outlets toe the line, the walls of buildings fill the void, as graffiti artists paint their protest messages there. One of them is Adekan, the 29-year-old son of a railway worker, who under cover of darkness, paints impressively beautiful graffiti depicting figures of people and animals in vivid colors, symbolizing, in a less than blatant manner, the relationship between the government and the citizenry and between rich and the poor. The symbolism is understood mainly by Turkish intellectuals, but when Adekan draws pigs, there’s no need for much commentary to understand whom he’s referring to.</p> \n<p>Critical literature is gradually fading to the point at which even the most famous Turkish writer, Orhan Pamuk, a Nobel Prize laureate for literature, who was prosecuted in 2006 for his statements regarding the Armenian genocide, refrains from speaking out publicly against the regime. Although the charges against him were dropped following international pressure, mainly from the European Union, Pamuk is still a government target. This year, apparently under Turkish pressure, the city of Sarajevo refrained from granting him honorary citizenship after the honor had already been approved by a committee.</p> \n<p>A few years ago, at his own expense, Pamuk built a museum on the European side of Istanbul called the Museum of Innocence, a reference to the title of a novel that he wrote in 2008. The museum displays items representing life in the 1970s. Some of the items are arranged in a way that could imply criticism of the regime. There is, for example, a typewriter above which there is a picture of a boxer, symbolizing the fight against censorship. Like the graffiti art, the museum creates a new critical language that is reminiscent of the artist protests during the Arab Spring in Egypt and Tunisia, where walls became a media outlet. In Turkey, protests of this kind can’t be compared to those in Egypt in terms of quantity, but they are steadily expanding.</p> \n<p>With suspicion and persecution prevailing in Turkey, it’s hard to take the declarations of Erdogan and his ministers very seriously regarding the murder of Saudi journalist of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. Last week Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu expressed anger at U.S. President Donald Trump, who casually dismissed the conclusions of the CIA, which has concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder.</p> \n<p>“Trump’s statements amount to him saying ‘I’ll turn a blind eye no matter what,” the foreign minister said. “Money isn’t everything. We must not move away from human values,” Cavusoglu said. But in the same breath, he announced that there is nothing preventing a meeting between Erdogan and the crown prince at the G20 summit at the end of the month in Buenos Aires. Apparently, after all, money is everything.</p>",

        "text":["<p>One day last July, two police officers paid an unexpected visit to the home of John D. Miller, 59, in the town of Grabill, Indiana. Finding Miller outside his house, where he lived alone, they asked him to accompany them. Miller, gray-haired and with a slight weight problem, didn’t resist. Not until they arrived at the police station, about a half-hour’s drive away, did the officers ask him if he knew what they wanted to talk to him about. Miller, the police report states, looked at the detectives and said, “April Tinsley.”</p> \n<p>He was right.</p> \n<p>Tinsley, a blond, smiling girl of 8, disappeared in the spring of 1988. She left the home of a girlfriend and vanished. Police were called in immediately, and three days later, a passerby came upon her body lying in a ditch about 20 miles from her home. She had been sexually assaulted and then strangled. Traces of the suspect’s DNA were found on the girl’s underwear, but the killer was never caught.</p> \n<p>The case of April Tinsley became a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre in the United States. Off and on, over three decades, a team made up of personnel from the FBI and other federal agencies checked tips and examined numerous scenarios. The popular television program “America’s Most Wanted” devoted an episode to the murder in 2009, and in the internet era bloggers reported on developments in the case.</p> \n<p>And developments there were. About two years after April’s death, police were called to a barn not far from where Tinsley’s body was found. Scrawled on the door was a message: “I kill 8 year old April Marie Tisley… ha ha I will kill agin [sic].”</p> \n<p>In 2004, used condoms were found hanging from three separate girls’ bicycles in Fort Wayne, not far from Grabill, along with ominous notes: “Hi honey… I been watching you… I am the same person that kidnapped an rape an kill april tinsley... You are my next victim.”</p> \n<p>But the killer didn’t strike again. In fact, that was the last time he was heard from. The investigation hit a dead end.</p> \n<p>But then, early last May, 30 years after the murder, Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, which was working in tandem with CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist, approached the Fort Wayne police, offering their services in investigating the case. Within a few days, they received authorization from the police to upload a DNA sample from the murder scene to GEDmatch, a genealogical site created by two enthusiasts from Florida and Texas. From there things moved quickly. All in all, Moore said, “It was rough. Afterward I was just totally beat. But I was determined to find him.”</p> \n<p>Over the years, the police had narrowed down the list of possible suspects to about 100, but Miller, a recluse, wasn’t one of them. But Moore’s methods don’t require interviews with neighbors or potential witnesses. She compares DNA profiles uploaded to the web and reduces the number of potential suspects with the aid of other, open databases. It’s painstaking work but it can produce results relatively quickly – certainly when compared to three decades of fruitless searches.</p> \n<p>Within 50 days, Moore gave police the names of two brothers. One of them, she said, speaking with Haaretz by phone, was their man. “It was challenge after challenge,” she said. “When the threads finally converged in Indiana, I knew I had got him.”</p> \n<p>An arrest warrant requires evidence that’s admissible in court, so detectives scoured Miller’s trash for DNA samples and found what they were looking for in three used condoms.</p> \n<p>At the station, the police told Miller that they had two DNA samples – one that was his, the other from the crime scene. And they match, he was told. Miller didn’t argue. That same day he confessed that he had kidnapped April Tinsley, raped her in his trailer and then strangled her to death so she wouldn’t tell anyone. He said it took him about 10 minutes to kill the girl.</p> \n<p>“It’s amazing,” Detective Brian Martin, who heads the cold cases unit of the Fort Wayne police department, told me, in a phone interview. “We were able to do in less than 60 days what we were not able to do in 30 years. He was out there living in our community and we had no idea about him.”</p> \n<p>Double murder</p> \n<p>In the past year, genealogical search engines have been used to solve complicated murder and rape cases, ones that had stumped police in the United States for decades. Vast sums had been spent on investigations, generations of detectives toiled on the cases, and the victims’ families lost hope.</p> \n<p>Until CeCe Moore entered the picture. Moore, who was born in 1969 and previously performed on stage as an actor and singer, cracked the overwhelming majority of cold cases that were solved – within six months, and usually without even leaving home. All she needs is DNA from the crime scene, access to the GEDmatch site – which allows people who are searching for relations to upload DNA profiles at their own initiative – and a fast-internet connection.</p> \n<p>The secret to unraveling the April Tinsley case, and many others like it, lies in the integration of tools from the realms of both genealogy and genetics. Genealogical research is a form of historical detective work that’s based on population records; media reports; marriage, birth and death certificates; archival research and so on. But recent developments in DNA-based technology have expanded the horizons of possibilities: Labs can now pinpoint information about familial origins and links for people even if they lack access to conventional documentation and records.</p> \n<p>Moore’s gateway to the world of genealogy was a family tree she decided to create as a wedding present to a niece. Subsequently she became a well-known figure in the world of genealogy. She has helped draft ethical rules for proper usage of data, has often appeared on television to explain what she does, and she manages a Facebook group of 100,000 people, by means of which she teaches followers how to become “genetic detectives” and locate previously unknown relatives.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“I mostly worked with unknown parentage cases in the last few years,” she says, “helping people find their biological families when they don’t know who they are.” However, the challenge in such efforts eventually wore off. At some point, Moore came up with the idea using GEDmatch&nbsp; to try to solve cases of unidentified crime victims. That prepared her for the moment when she began to help law enforcement agencies, in partnership with Parabon NanoLabs, which specializes in DNA technology and had already been hired to help such authorities.</p> \n<p>The results were not long in coming. Last June, police in Pennsylvania arrested Raymond Rowe for the rape and murder of Christy Mirack, a schoolteacher, in 1992. That same month, Gary Hartman was arrested in connection with the rape and murder of 12-year-old Michella Welch in Tacoma, Washington, in 1986. A month later, police in Utah used GEDmatch in investigating a more recent case: Spencer Monnett was arrested for the rape of a 79-year-old woman 14 weeks earlier. And the so-called “Ramsey Street rapist,” who had perpetrated serial assaults in Fayetteville, North Carolina, from 2006 to 2008, was identified as Darold Wayne Bowden, a white man with a large swastika tattooed on his chest.</p> \n<p>All told, 19 cases were solved in this way, 17 of them by Parabon NanoLabs and CeCe Moore, the other two by different detective teams. Not one of the detainees had been considered a suspect.</p> \n<p>One of the most complex cases Moore dealt with was that of the double murder of Jay Cook and Tanya Van Cuylenborg. The young couple from Canada – she was 18, he was 20 – was murdered in November 1987. The two were on their on their way to Seattle from Saanich, British Columbia, in the Cook family’s 10-year-old Ford Club van. They set out on November 18, and the last time they were seen was when they bought tickets for the ferry to Seattle, a little after 10 P.M. that day.</p> \n<p>Five days later, Van Cuylenborg’s body was found in a wooded area in Skagit County, Washington; she had been raped and shot in the head. The next day, the empty van was found, and a day later all hope was lost when Cook’s body was located in a neighboring county, wrapped in a blue blanket. Jim Scharf, the detective who worked on the case in Snohomish County, Washington, said at the time of the arrest that over the years the police had received tips in connection with more than 350 people who might have been involved in the murders, but that none had shed any light on the events.</p> \n<p>It took Moore just three days to give the police the suspect’s name.</p> \n<p>Moore uploaded a DNA sample from one of the crime scenes to the genealogical search engine of GEDmatch. She was able to identify two distant relatives of the murderer, and with the use of traditional genealogical methods traced ancestors who were common to the suspect, and to every one of the relatives who had been found. At this stage, she started to build a family tree forward in time – in other words, she began to identify all the descendants of the ancestors right up to the present day and to clarify the relations between them – in a process known as “reverse genealogy.” The aim is to locate a descendant of the ancestor who matches the presumed suspect’s profile.</p> \n<p>“The significant matches were at about the second-cousin level,” says Moore, adding, “I built family trees of people who were sharing DNA with the perpetrator, back to great-grandparents.”</p> \n<p>It’s here that the significant difference from previous investigative methods lies, and where ethical problems arise. The search is not for the actual criminal – it’s unlikely, for example, that a serial rapist will upload his DNA to an open database – but for people who may have a certain genetic relationship to him but who may not even be aware of those ties and/or the suspicions against him. Moore has perfected this technique, and her recent successes have kept her very busy. Two months were needed to arrange an interview with her, but in the end she explained her work method to me, in a phone interview.</p> \n<p>The starting point – the degree of the connection between the crime-scene DNA and the match on GEDmatch – is critical. This is because GEDmatch does not reveal the exact family relationship between the target of the search and the database, but offers a range of possibilities. “For any amount of shared DNA,&nbsp; there are multiple numbers of possible relationships,” Moore notes. “It could be a second cousin. It could be a second cousin once removed, a first cousin twice removed,” and so on.</p> \n<p>Accordingly, Moore must first make an intelligent prediction of the nature of the connection between the suspect’s DNA and the results from the website. Most GEDmatch users upload their genetic information together with their full name and email address. Thus, when Moore identifies the correspondence bearing the strongest family relationship to the murderer or rapist, she has something substantial to work with.</p> \n<p>In the case of the Canadian couple, Moore related that the family trees of two of the closest results did not share DNA. In other words, she knew that the place where the two trees overlapped would point to the killer. In fact, she discovered that the two trees converged in a marriage that produced one son. At that moment she had cracked the case: Last May, a 55-year-old man, William Earl Talbott II, was arrested for the two murders.</p> \n<p>Talbott denied the charges, but the police are certain they have the right man. He was 24 in 1987, apparently lived about 35 kilometers from Seattle, and fresh DNA samples taken from him match the DNA found at the scene.</p> \n<p>“If it hadn’t been for genetic genealogy, we wouldn’t have been standing here today, and if it hadn’t been allowed to be used in law enforcement, we would have never have been able to solve this case,” Detective Scharf stated in a press conference called to announce the arrest.</p> \n<p>Retiring detective</p> \n<p>The reason that all these suspects were caught with the aid of GEDmatch and not through the FBI’s DNA database, known as CODIS, is related to the technology underlying each. CODIS has 17.6 million profiles, far more than the one million of GEDmatch, but the FBI’s goal is to compare samples and find a full match between them. This is accomplished by comparing short sequences called STRs (short tandem repeat) at about 20 locations along the genome. What it can’t do is identify with high probability ties between family members who are not first-degree relatives. The commercial companies, and thus also GEDmatch, use tests that examine genetic variants called SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) at 600,000 to 700,000 points on the genome. This technology makes it possible to detect distant family ties, and it’s precisely here that the sleuthing of amateur genealogists intersect with Moore’s skills and the world of criminal identification.</p> \n<p>According to Dr. Steven Armentrout, the founder and CEO of Parabon NanoLabs, it’s difficult to calculate accurately the size of the net that GEDmatch casts. However, he says, 55 percent of the DNA profiles that Parabon has uploaded to GEDmatch since May have to date produced a lead sufficient to work with. His company, he notes, cooperates with law enforcement authorities across the United States and has so far uploaded about 200 DNA profiles.</p> \n<p>Moore was not the first to use GEDmatch to solve murder cases. Its use began last April, with the arrest of Joseph James DeAngelo – the so-called “Golden State killer,” suspected of murdering 13 people and raping more than 50 women in California between 1974 and 1986.</p> \n<p>Paul Holes, now a retired detective from the office of the Contra Costa County’s district attorney, spent 24 years pursuing the serial killer and rapist. When he was only months away from retirement, he decided to upload the DNA profile of the killer to GEDmatch.</p> \n<p>What happened next could have been taken from a true-crime movie. The day before he was slated to turn in his badge and pistol, Holes found himself outside the home of a person named Joseph DeAngelo, wondering if he should simply knock on the door. He needed a DNA sample for comparison to the one that had been collected at one of the murder sites.</p> \n<p>Holes ended up outside DeAngelo’s home after four months during which his team built family trees: On the basis of matches of second and third cousins, via GEDmatch, a team of five investigators, aided by genealogist Barbara Rae-Venter, put together a genealogical chart going back to the 1840s. On that day, the eve of his retirement, Holes saw DeAngelo only as a possibility, albeit an interesting one. In the end, however, he decided to leave without speaking to the suspect.</p> \n<p>“I realized I didn’t know enough about him. If I had knocked on that door, things could have turned bad,” he told me in a conversation from his home in Colorado.</p> \n<p>Holes’ experience exemplifies the fact that genetic genealogy is not a substitute for traditional police work. If he hadn’t gone on questioning witnesses, looking for DNA samples and seeking patterns in the killer’s mode of operation, the requisite evidentiary foundation for embarking on the final stage in the hunt for the killer would probably not have existed. “This is obviously a revolutionary technique,” Holes said. “But it won’t solve every case; nor should it be used in every case. It’s really almost like a last-resort tool.”</p> \n<p>Anne Marie Schubert, the district attorney of Sacramento County in California, where DeAngelo, now 73, will face trial, also used the term “revolutionary” when I spoke to her about genetic genealogy.</p> \n<p>Today Holes attends conferences of detectives and investigators, where he advises his former colleagues on the potential uses of genetic genealogy in their work.</p> \n<p>Murderer’s daughter</p> \n<p>The cofounder of GEDmatch, the internet tool that deserves credit for the recent wave of murder-case solutions, is Curtis Rogers, 80, a professional court-appointed legal guardian from Florida.</p> \n<p>Until it emerged that his search engine had helped bring about the arrest of the Golden State killer, he had no idea that police were even using it. Rogers told me that reports of the suspected serial killer being arrested made him slightly suspicious. “I wonder if we were involved,” he said to his wife that day, April 25, which by chance also happened to be International DNA Day. The answer came a day later, when he arrived at his office and found TV-broadcasting vans waiting outside.</p> \n<p>“It came as a big surprise, no question,” he said, although it was clear from his tone that the initial astonishment had passed and that he’s now proud of his role in solving the cases.</p> \n<p>Rogers founded GEDmatch in 2011 together with John Olson, 67, an electrical engineer from Texas. Rogers still works almost nonstop, he says, but recently decided to retire from his day job and devote himself full-time to the website.</p> \n<p>The basic idea of GEDmatch is simple. A commercial breakthrough in 2009 – the sale of autosomal DNA tests directly to the public – enabled genealogists to locate living relatives and not only those who died long ago, as earlier techniques had made possible.</p> \n<p>“Suddenly you had this mass of people you knew you were related to,” Rogers says, adding that the enthusiasts began bombarding each other with emails in order to decipher the family ties between them. The process was long and tedious, and Rogers asked Olson to build an algorithm that would computerize the search. The two developed what turned out to be GEDmatch, and decided to invite the world to use it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are significant differences between GEDmatch and similar, commercial sites. First, Rogers and Olson offer their service for free, apart from a few features that cost $10 a month. The two men obviously operate the site out of love for genealogy. They also do not do DNA testing and don’t have a lab. Instead, users upload to their site the genetic data they have received from commercial testing firms. GEDmatch also makes it possible to upload DNA sample from every one of the firms, provided it comes in the right type of file, and to compare profiles, something that cannot be done in the case of people who were tested by different companies.</p> \n<p>In addition, the commercial firms have a tough policy about opening their databases to legal authorities. The 23andMe genetic testing service, for example, reported that it had rebuffed all five requests it received from authorities for information. GEDmatch, however, is open to all, including law enforcement agencies. “We realized quickly that we have no control over that. Law enforcement can put the information on our site and we would never know,” Rogers explains. Accordingly, he and his partner revised the site’s terms of use, and announced that they would&nbsp; allow the police to use it only for solving rape and murder cases.</p> \n<p>According to Rogers, visitors to the site were now apprised that the authorities had access to it and that they were invited to delete their information if they wished. “We became very open and honest, and we try to educate our people that that’s a possibility,” he says, referring to the possibility of law enforcement using the site.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rogers was apprehensive about users’ reactions, following the arrest of the Golden State killer. After all, though the police were already using the site, those who had uploaded their DNA profile weren’t necessarily aware of that. So he was relieved to get many messages of support.</p> \n<p>One of the more dramatic examples of such support came from Carol S., whose father murdered her grandfather in Detroit in 1979. Carol’s father had been in and out of mental institutions throughout his life. She told me that he had been tried for his father’s murder, found insane and sent to an institution again, this time for a lengthy period.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“I felt and I do feel that my father was responsible for many crimes,” she related. “I asked [the site]: How do I make sure that my GEDmatch profile is available publicly for law enforcement purposes.” She hopes her decision to allow the authorities to access her DNA profile will bring some comfort to victims’ families: “Suffering when your loved one is murdered is hard enough, and that’s why I feel it’s so important,” she says.</p> \n<p>CeCe Moore wasn’t involved in the Golden State killer case, but the way it was solved made her uneasy, too. She now accepts Rogers’ new policy, and thinks that the major publicity the case received has changed users’ perception of privacy.</p> \n<p>“Once everyone in GEDmatch was made aware that their data might be used that way, it really gave me the freedom to do my work,” she notes.</p> \n<p>According to Moore, in light of the worldwide publicity the Golden State killer case has received, it can be assumed that everyone whose information appears on the GEDmatch site has voluntarily technically consented to allow the authorities to use it. Some experts dispute that and say that legal problems are liable to arise. But for CeCe Moore and GEDmatch, the decision has already been made.</p> \n<p>“I had a lot of sleepless nights, when a district attorney would write to me asking for help in catching this serial killer, who might kill more people. I know I have the skills to do it, and it was very painful to have to say no” for ethical reasons, Moore relates.</p> \n<p>Exploiting genetic info</p> \n<p>Last October, the journal Science published a study done by a team headed by Prof. Yaniv Erlich, chief science officer of the Israeli company MyHeritage (also involved in the research were Dr. Shai Carmi, Prof. Itsik Pe’er and Tal Shor). The online genealogy platform, known here mostly thanks to the family trees that can be created through it, also has a genetic testing unit. In the wake of developments in America, Erlich and his team examined the genomic data of 1.28 million people and “project that about 60 percent of the searches for individuals of European descent will result in a third cousin or closer match,” according to the study. This figure is in keeping with the data reported by Parabon, and the MyHeritage team estimates that the number would rise considerably, as more people upload their profiles to GEDmatch. They also predict that with the aid of genealogical tools, it will be possible to locate almost every one of the search targets</p> \n<p>In regard to Israel, Erlich told me that the MyHeritage genetic database includes only a few thousand Israelis, because regulations bar companies here from offering genetic testing for “recreational” purposes. The company, he says, will go to court to fight any order to open the database to the police, though that hasn’t yet happened. GEDmatch is of course accessible to the Israel Police, but is not especially useful as long as no Israelis are availing themselves of it. Asked about the services it may take advantage of in its work, the Israel Police told Haaretz that it doesn’t not answer questions about investigative procedures or cooperation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Moore had reservations about the unequivocal character of the study that was reported in Science. In most cases, she says, it’s quite difficult to create a family tree and locate a target person. Adoption, migration, endogamy, common names, restrictions on document access or cases in which the biological parentage is ascribed to the wrong person – all these make it hard to follow the elusive DNA trail. Dealing with the April Tinsley case, with many variables, was “like fighting a battle through a dark jungle,” she recalls.</p> \n<p>In any event, the study has stirred considerable interest in the U.S., where DNA databases are springing up rapidly. All together, the large commercial genealogy companies have about 17.5 million profiles. Haaretz was told by 23andMe that it has more than 5 million, Ancestry.com claims to hold 10 million, and MyHeritage reports 1.4 million DNA profiles. Family Tree DNA didn’t respond to an inquiry, but reports indicate that it has another million profiles. According to GEDmatch’s Roger Curtis, half of their million profiles are from the United States and the others from elsewhere around world, and the database is growing at the rate of 1,000 to 2,000 new users per day.</p> \n<p>The question now is: What’s next? As things stand now, anyone with the means and the right skills can utilize GEDmatch to locate people of interest. Theoretically, both individuals and authorities in foreign countries will be able to do the same when the database contains profiles of enough of their citizens. The question of what will prevent U.S. authorities from exploiting the information in other cases – with respect to drug or property offenses, or, pessimists worry, even to track down holders of particular political views – remains unanswered. Is it a good thing that at police stations across the United States they are gradually building maps of people’s family relations, including relatives of whose existence those people are unaware?</p> \n<p>Prof. Erlich, from MyHeritage, noted that the motivation behind the study his team conducted was the desire to draw the world’s attention to the developments in the realm of genetics and to offer solutions for supervision and legislation that will protect users’ privacy. We are only at the start of a revolution in genetics, says Erlich, who predicts that entire population groups will undergo genetic sequencing. “What’s happening now is the building of the foundations for the future, which will serve us for the coming decades.”</p> \n<p>Cynics might detect an economic threat to the commercial companies if the police suddenly depart from the limits of the public consent they received because of the Golden State killer case, and the advantage MyHeritage may have in being seen as a leader in the struggle for privacy. Still, it’s impossible to ignore the fact that information databases leak, that DNA is a powerful tool and that Erlich’s comments carry weight.</p> \n<p>“There are huge companies in Silicon Valley that say the writing was on the wall for years and nothing was done,” he notes. “So, if the writing is on the wall, let’s be practical and try to see how we can help this field and move it forward. What we’re trying to say is that it’s not too late yet.”</p> \n<p>One idea proposed by Erlich and his colleagues is to develop a cryptographic key that will mark every DNA test carried out by one of the large commercial companies, and to have GEDmatch accept only profiles with that marking. Anyone who tries to upload an unmarked profile will have to answer questions relating to his identity. Another idea is to impose restrictions on law enforcement authorities when they try to collect genetic information.</p> \n<p>Echoes of Erlich’s forecasts are also discernible in the views of Erin Murphy, a New York University law professor who specializes in technology and forensic evidence in the criminal justice system. “We’re hurtling into a world where genetic information is going to become incredibly useful and powerful for employers in regard to life insurance, health insurance and so forth,” she told me. “The bottom line is that it will be cross-applicable because it’s the genome.”</p> \n<p>More concretely, there is a concern that at some point, various bodies – whether governmental or private – will make decisions about our lives on the basis of genetic information we provided unthinkingly.</p> \n<p>Anne Marie Schubert, the Sacramento district attorney, says she has built a model for supervising the use of genetic genealogy, similar to the one used to oversee the FBI’s database. (To gain access to the latter, police officers must sign a statement declaring that the crime under investigation was violent and that all other possible avenues of investigation have been exhausted.) Murphy sees this as a step in the right direction, but adds that far more comprehensive legislation is required.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“I think people fail to appreciate exactly what law enforcement is doing when they use those searches,” adds Murphy, “what’s called SNP testing [used by the commercial testers for recreational genealogy]. These are really the keys to a person’s identity and existence.”</p> \n<p>On this point, Paul Holes, the retired detective, notes that the police can only have access to matches between profiles, and do not get access to the complete genetic code itself.</p> \n<p>Murphy rejects assurances from Curtis Rogers and CeCe Moore concerning voluntary consent and changes in the terms of use of GEDmatch. She explains that the activities of people who use GEDmatch affects others who are not members of the service, and therefore the consent is invalid.</p> \n<p>“Why can someone I don’t even know exists give away my genetic information?” she asks, adding that there are legal precedents supporting this stance. “If you’re a joint occupant of a space – for example, I live in my home with my husband, and police show up to search the place. I tell them to go ahead and my husband says no. My go-ahead can’t override my husband’s no. I think we can think of the genome in the same way.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The question of whether terms of usage can guarantee protection of privacy hasn’t yet been decided in the United States, Murphy says, but notes that there are many difficulties in this approach. Nor, she adds, does it provide a solution to the problem of consent – moreover, GEDmatch can change its terms of use at any time, so that the argument is flimsy from the outset.</p> \n<p>Finally, Murphy explains that there is very little supervision in the field of genetics in the United States, and says that she supports the idea of a comprehensive regulatory structure in regard to genetic information. Given that political battles will probably prevent agreement on such legislation, she says that “the likeliest outcome is that this Wild West situation will continue. We will also see more of those cases [of crimes being solved by means of genetic genealogy], because one of the major impediments now&nbsp;is cost and technological limitation,” barriers that are constantly dropping. And because it’s unlikely that people will drop their leisure-time interest in genetics, she adds, they must at least think more seriously about how the law enforcement system uses genetic information.</p> \n<p>Moore has a different take. “Most family members said you can never find closure. But they want justice. They want answers – and I can give them that,” she asserts, and goes on: “Maybe some of the people who commit these crimes will&nbsp;realize that it will be a lot harder to get away with them in the future. Maybe it will save one life, maybe it will save hundreds of lives. It’s worth it.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Let me begin by agreeing with Benjamin Netanyahu. I'm speaking here about one of the prime minister's most fervently stated positions:</p> \n<p>Double standards are wrong. When they are applied to Israel, they undermine and de-legitimize the state in the eyes of the world.</p> \n<p>So, in Israel's own words, let's see how this works in practice:</p> \n<p>1. THE STANDARD: Israel maintains complete bipartisan neutrality regarding American politics. It neither takes sides nor interferes with the U.S. electoral process, nor with governance at the state and federal levels.</p> \n<p>THE PRACTICE: During Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Netanyahu's right-hand man, Israeli Ambassador to Washington Ron Dermer – a GOP operative prior to his moving to Israel – acted as a key adviser to&nbsp;Trump's speechwriters.</p> \n<p>Earlier in the campaign, Netanyahu took the rare step of addressing a joint session of Congress, excoriating then-President Obama's signature Iran nuclear deal, and by extension, the Democratic Party as a whole.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu remains joined at the Republican hip through his crucial media and funding ties to GOP uber-donors Sheldon and Miriam Adelson. (See also: Number 7 on this list.)</p> \n<p>2. THE STANDARD: Israel utterly rejects the intervention of foreign governments in efforts to affect policy within the country.</p> \n<p>THE PRACTICE: Israel is spending tens of millions of dollars on an overseas-targeted campaign to combat perceived threats of anti-Israel activism within the U.S., the EU, and elsewhere. Massive government resources and in-house and outsourced intelligence have been marshaled into fighting organizations and activists abroad, including backing for campaigns to name and shame campus figures.</p> \n<p>Israel has also vigorously promoted state-level legislation to ban as anti-Semitic, boycotts against Israel and/or boycotts of settlement-linked businesses. The laws have sparked a backlash from rights groups and others, who argue that the legislation violates First Amendment free speech guarantees.</p> \n<p>3. THE STANDARD: In Israel's view, boycotts are inherently discriminatory and are, in practice, a form of &quot;awareness terrorism.&quot;</p> \n<p>THE PRACTICE: Netanyahu government officials frequently boycott individuals and organizations, often in direct defense of the settlement enterprise.</p> \n<p>Last week, when Airbnb announced that it would remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are &quot;at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians,&quot;&nbsp;Israeli ministers responded by urging boycotts and sanctions against Airbnb.</p> \n<p>In one of countless cases, Netanyahu last year boycotted a&nbsp;scheduled meeting&nbsp; with German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel –&nbsp;who was visiting Israel to take part in Holocaust Remembrance Day events – because Gabriel met with members of the anti-occupation NGOs Breaking the Silence and B'tselem.</p> \n<p>In another, Dermer, a staple guest of right-wing groups, has consistently refused to meet with or snubbed a number of liberal&nbsp;American Jewish organizations&nbsp;that openly describe themselves as supporting Israel, among them J Street and its campus arm J Street U, Americans for Peace Now, and the New Israel Fund.</p> \n<p>4. THE STANDARD: Israel maintains that it is the only democracy in the Middle East, and treats its non-Jewish citizens with equality and full respect.</p> \n<p>THE PRACTICE: Where to begin? Perhaps with the nation-state law, passed in July, which gratuitously and explicitly demotes the Arabic language, formerly an official language of the state. The law also infuriated and dishonored the nation's Druze citizens, who serve in the army and have sacrificed greatly for the country, only to see a law which, in their words, renders them second-class citizens.</p> \n<p>5. THE STANDARD: Honoring the memory of the Holocaust and its watchword, Never Again, Israel stands opposed to genocide in any form, by any nation, against any people.</p> \n<p>THE PRACTICE: Just this week, Netanyahu effusively welcomed the visit of President Idriss Deby of Chad, who&nbsp;has been accused&nbsp;of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and torture.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is also said to be actively seeking ties with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who oversaw the genocidal war in Darfur and is the first sitting head of state ever to be indicted by the International Criminal Court. The charges include&nbsp;&quot;genocide by killing, genocide by causing serious bodily or mental harm, and genocide by deliberately inflicting on each target group conditions of life calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction&quot; in three separate counts.</p> \n<p>6. THE STANDARD: Israel is the welcoming homeland for all Jews, regardless of their race, denomination, or politics.</p> \n<p>THE PRACTICE: Uh, no. In the last year alone, Jews have been rejected, detained at the airport, interrogated, humiliated, and in some cases deported, for the following factors:</p> \n<p>They came from Uganda&nbsp;and were converted to Judaism by the Conservative movement; they were vocally and profoundly pro-Israel&nbsp; but advocate a boycott of the settlements; they want to immigrate to Israel&nbsp; but are leftist in outlook; or they were anti-occupation activists,&nbsp;and as such were actually asked how they felt about&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>7. THE STANDARD: Israel is committed to protecting Jews from Jew-hatred and anti-Semitic attacks anywhere they may live in the world.</p> \n<p>THE PRACTICE: When American neo-Nazis, KKK members and other white Americans marched in Charlottesville in 2017, chanting &quot;Jews will not replace us!&quot; and Trump signaled that they included &quot;very fine people&quot; – which is to say, people who voted for him – Netanyahu was silent.</p> \n<p>As he has been regarding anti-Semitic campaigns mounted by the right in Hungary and elsewhere in Europe, and about an anti-Semitism-tinged meme posted by his own son. He's even gone one better than anti-Semites – slandering the Jew-haters' favorite target, Holocaust survivor and philanthropist George Soros, blaming him for a pro-asylum seekers protest campaign.</p> \n<p>When, this year, eleven Jews were murdered in a mass killing by a white supremacist in Pittsburgh, Netanyahu's efforts at aid were&nbsp;directed at supporting Trump.</p> \n<p>He hailed the president despite Trump's callously victim-blaming remarks about an under-protected shul. He dispatched Dermer to Trump's side, and the envoy turned out to be the only public official to receive Trump at the synagogue.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, cabinet Minister Naftali Bennet appeared as well, to tell everyone who would listen that – despite the waves of anti-Semitism unleashed by Trump – U.S. anti-Semitism was not as bad as it was pictured, and besides, the White House had moved the embassy and scuttled the Iran deal. End of story – except for Israel's chief rabbi, who couldn't quite bring himself to call the Conservative Tree of Life an actual synagogue.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Two medical marijuana companies on way to Tel Aviv Stock Exchange listing</p> \n<p>Two medical marijuana companies are due to start trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange by merging with existing public companies rather than in the wake of an initial public offering. Herodium Investments said Tuesday it had signed a memorandum of understanding under which the medical cannabis operations of Panaxia Pharmaceutical Industries will be merged into the company. The all-share deal would leave Panaxia shareholders with 85% of the merged company. In a separate announcement, the TASE-traded shell company Whitesmoke Software said it was buying Better, a grower and supplier of medical marijuana, by allocating 80% of its shares to Better shareholders. Panaxia is unusual among TASE-traded marijuana companies in that it doesn’t grow the plant but makes oils and chewable tablets containing cannabis. Better is one of eight authorized suppliers in Israel of medical marijuana, with a 10,000-square-meter farm serving 5,000 patients. Herodium shares powered higher by 135%% to end at 2.70 shekels (72 cents). Whitesmoke rose 33% to 36 agorot. (Guy Erez)</p> \n<p>Histadrut labor federation threatens&nbsp;strike at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange</p> \n<p>Avi Nissenkorn, the chairman of the Histadrut labor federation, threatened Tuesday to call a strike at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange unless CEO Ittai Ben-Zeev agrees to negotiations with the bourse’s shop committee. “So long as management continues to act irresponsibly and ignore the workers’ representatives, we will have no choice but to act on the labor dispute [that’s been declared] to the point of striking,” Nissenkorn said in a sharply worded letter to Ben-Zeev. Angry that the union declared a labor dispute shortly after signing a contract with TASE management in May 2017, Ben-Zeev has refused to reopen negotiations on their demands, which include a one-time bonus equal to five monthly salaries that would cost the bourse some 50 million shekels ($13.4 million). The demands come at a difficult time for the bourse, which is contending with declining trading activity and stagnant revenues, while wage costs have risen sharply. (Shelly Appelberg)</p> \n<p>IDB begins process of selling Israir unit&nbsp;at expected price tag of NIS 225 million</p> \n<p>The IDB group has begun shopping its Israir airline subsidiary to potential buyers with the help of investment banks Epsilon and Giza. Controlled by Argentine property magnate Eduardo Elsztain, IDB is counting on the proceeds from the sale to help it pay down debt. Its third-quarter financial report estimated that Israir would fetch 225 million shekels ($60.2 million) and that a deal would be completed by the end of next year. Israir’s strong financial performance should make the sale easier. In contrast to its bigger rival, El Al Airlines, whose profits sagged 15% in the third quarter from a year earlier, Israir boosted its net by one-third, to $15 million, despite higher fuel and wage costs. Revenues rose 11% year on year to $144 million. Israir has benefited from increased seating capacity on its domestic flights to the southern resort town of Eilat and the fact that rival Arkia dropped its Haifa-Eilat route. (Yoram Gabison)</p> \n<p>Drone maker Aeronautics Limited&nbsp;sees further deterioration in its results</p> \n<p>Aeronautics Limited, the Israeli maker of military drones that is being investigated by police, saw a further deterioration of its financial performance in the third quarter. The company said Tuesday that its operating profit slid into a loss of $3 million, versus a profit of $6.5 million a year earlier, while sales continued to decline, by 24% to $30.5 million. Aeronautics attributed the decline to delays in completing projects on its order books and in signing new contracts. The Defense Ministry froze some of Aeronautics’ export licenses in the wake of allegations that Aeronautics representatives demonstrated a kamikaze drone in Azerbaijan by attacking a manned position of the Armenian army. The company denies the accusations. Police are meanwhile pursuing a criminal investigation as well, and 10 of its top executives face charges including fraud. Aeronautics shares, which have fallen by one-third since the start of the year, ended up 0.7% at 7.40 shekels. ($1.98). (Guy Erez)</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv shares extend post-rate rise gains</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv shares extended their Monday gains into Tuesday, but lost steam by early morning and closed well off their high for the day. The benchmark TA-35 index close up 0.2% at 1,625.88 points, while the TA-125 added nearly 0.15% to 1,460.89, on turnover of 1.18 billion shekels ($320 million). Gainers in the TA-125 were led by Perrigo, which climbed 3.4% to close at 233.50 shekels. Sapiens gained 3.2% to 42 and Israel Chemicals added 1.9% to 22.57. Teva Pharmaceuticals dropped 2.1% to 80.60. On Tuesday it launched its generic version of Mylan’s EpiPen at the wholesale price of $300, the same price as Mylan’s generic version of the emergency allergy shot. Elco Holdings fell 1.7% to 65.05 after reporting a 24% decline in third quarter net from a year ago to 31.5 million shekels. Other big losers were Super-Sol, which fell 2.7% to 24.13, and Gazit Globe, which lost 2.2% to 29.89. (Shelly Appelberg)</p>",

Amazon Web Services, the unit of the giant online retailer that provides cloud computing services, unveiled the AWS Graviton Processor at a Las Vegas conference Monday night. Using technology developed by ARM, the new processor could cut the costs for applications like web servers by 45% versus alternatives, said Peter DeSantis, AWS’s vice president of global infrastructure and customer support. Amazon bought Annapurna, which was founded by Avigdor Willenz, in 2015 for $360 million and turned it into AWS’ chip-development group. The company, once based in Yokne’am, is now in Haifa and Hod Hasharon, with a research and development team in the United States.

The 2016 figure reflects a rise from 5.7&nbsp;to 6.2 suicides per 100,000 people.</p> \n<p>The statistics were published after the Education Ministry said a month ago that it was halting its suicide prevention program in schools because it had not received the necessary funding from the Health Ministry.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;What Drove a Record Number of Israelis to Suicide in the '60s?</p> \n<p>“I hope it will be enough to permit the continuation of a plan that brought dramatic change in the handling of suicide prevention in the school system,” Oshrat Orgad-Katz, an educational psychologist at the Movement for Public Psychology, told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>She said that because of the frozen budget, schools had stopped training people to handle at-risk students.</p> \n<p>“Before the program began we had to send every child who said something about suicide to an emergency room. There were no mental health experts who could provide a solution and take responsibility,” Orgad-Katz said.</p> \n<p>“The program has provided a solution; for example, by talking to the child and family while referring only emergency cases to the emergency room. I hope the budget will be transferred so we can continue this program.”</p> \n<p>In recent years children and teens have been the focal points of suicide prevention programs, in part due to online bullying and shaming, amid an increasing sense of loneliness.</p> \n<p>In 2016, five children below 15 committed suicide, compared with three in 2015. The National Council for the Child said that in 2017 there were 861 suicide attempts by children under 17; of them, 292 were between 10 and 14.</p> \n<p>A representative of the police unit for preventing online violence against minors said she had only recently taken up her position and had already been inundated with appeals for help. Some of the appeals stem from children's suicidal tendencies expressed on social media.</p> \n<p>Before 2016 there was a decline in suicide rates. From 2012 to 2014 the suicide rate for boys 15 to 18 decreased by 63 percent. For the age group 19 to 21 the decline was 65 percent, and for 22 to 24 it was 38 percent.</p> \n<p>But experts say Israel has not done enough.</p> \n<p>“The number of deaths from suicide is higher than in traffic accidents, but only 4 million shekels is budgeted for handling suicide problems,” said Prof. Haggai Hermesh, a psychiatrist.</p> \n<p>&quot;Suicide is a complex behavior, caused by several personal and environmental factors,&quot; explained Prof. Gil Zalsman, chairman of the National Council for Suicide Prevention and director of Geha mental health center, stressing that &quot;it is difficult to link suicide rate trends to any particular factor.&quot;</p> \n<p>According to Zalsman, the data for the past decade shows overall gradual decline, reaching &quot;rates relatively low, comapred with Europe and the OECD countries.&quot; The recent statistics, he said, may be due to greater reporting of suicide cases, or random.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Prof. Zalsman also claimed the rise &quot;may point at a reversal in trends, as has happened in the United States in recent years, particularly among young people.&quot;</p> \n<p>The number of attempted suicides is also rising. In 2016, there were 6,527 attempts treated at emergency rooms, compared with 6,409 in 2015. Last year the number of attempted suicides jumped to 6,731. The police have not yet released a figure for actual suicides that year.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the year 1564, a spanking new Swedish warship named Mars was overcome in its very first naval engagement, albeit after two days of fighting, and was blown to bits. The enemy, the Hanseatic town of L&uuml;beck allied with Denmark, crowed at their adversary's humiliation and lost no opportunity to boast of their maritime achievement.</p> \n<p>The Mars, a Swedish man-of-war, was also nicknamed “Matchless”, and indeed there was apparently nothing else its size sailing the Baltic Sea. Also, it was heavily armed with large cannons on two gun decks.</p> \n<p>The total number of guns was just above one hundred, though some sources claim as many as 200 and the ship carried a crew of about 700.</p> \n<p>No question, Mars would have been a formidable foe for any navy of the time. Now it lies at a depth of 75 meters off the island of &Ouml;land in the Baltic Sea.</p> \n<p>&quot;Mars was one of the largest warships in the world when it sank. Sinking it became a celebrated triumph among the allied fleet,&quot; says Dr. Niklas Eriksson of Stockholm University.</p> \n<p>But archaeologists exploring and studying the shipwreck since its discovery in 2011, under the auspices of S&ouml;dert&ouml;rns University, have found not only a large number of bronze cannons, hand grenades, coins and personal armor belonging to its long-dead sailors. The researchers found that its length had apparently been exaggerated, both by its builders, the Swedish; and its vanquishers, the Danish allied with the people of Lubeck.</p> \n<p>“The wreckage and human remains also provide unique insight into the battle itself, and the violence that took place at the scene of battle,” Prof. Johan R&ouml;nnby of S&ouml;dert&ouml;rns University and scientific leader for the Mars project told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>'Larger than a church'</p> \n<p>The maritime battle was an episode in the Northern Seven Years War which began in 1563, pitting Sweden against an alliance of Denmark, Poland, and the German port of L&uuml;beck (the hub of a powerful trading federation). The war was fought out on land and at sea.</p> \n<p>Definitely, sinking the Mars was a triumph for the Danes and their allies, who used it for propaganda purposes, printing pamphlets and singing songs that described the gigantic warship's flaming demise.</p> \n<p>And a feat it was, but how large was the Mars?</p> \n<p>A L&uuml;beckian chronicler, Die Herren von H&ouml;vel, states that the ship was 3 meters longer than the church of St Peter in L&uuml;beck. That would have made it 52.6 meters in length.</p> \n<p>If this measurement refers to the lengths between stem and sternpost, which some researchers have suggested, it would make Mars a monster of the waves (for the time. Today's supertankers can reach 450 meters in length.) Some reports even suggested that the Mars had been almost 61 meters in length.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It is hard to know exactly how long the Mars had been because the forward part of the hull is missing, says Eriksson. &quot;But by measuring the preserved hull structure and using proportions from other ships, one may conclude that the length between stem and sternpost must have been somewhere between 43 to 45 meters,&quot; he says.</p> \n<p>After its demise, warship length did increase. For comparison, another renowned but equally ill-fated Swedish ship, the Vasa,&nbsp;which set sail and immediately sank in August 1628, measured 47.5 meters from stem to stern (between the perpendiculars) and the Kronan, which measured 53 meters.</p> \n<p>However long it was exactly, the Mars definitely was a very large ship by 16th century standards, and it offered certain innovations to maritime battle. “Mars gives an opportunity to document a large warship from a transitional time in shipbuilding,” R&ouml;nnby observes.</p> \n<p>Land battle fought at sea</p> \n<p>One of the most spectacular recent finds in the Mars wreck was a large claw anchor, aka grapnel. That was an anchor-like device that hung from the bowsprits of warships and was used to grip another ship in order to board it.</p> \n<p>Grapnels are illustrated in historical sources from the 16th&nbsp;century, but this is the only known surviving example</p> \n<p>“Medieval sea battles are sometimes described as field battles that went to sea,” says Eriksson. &quot;The warships would sail up next to each other and the sailors would fight hand to hand.&quot;</p> \n<p>Only come the Renaissance period (14th-17th century C.E.) and ships like Mars, would artillery be used and the enemies could injure each other from a greater distance, he adds.</p> \n<p>The transition away from hand-to-hand fighting influenced naval architecture. Late medieval warships had heightened fore and stern castles, from which the sailors would leap to board the enemy. Early modern ships have gun ports along the hull-side.</p> \n<p>As Eriksson points out, Mars interestingly has both two rows of gun ports&nbsp;along the hull; and&nbsp;the ship had a high stern castle for boarding the enemy during combat. Unfortunately for posterity, the forecastle blew up when the ship sank.</p> \n<p>The divers also found including helmets and swords, tools used to repair and maintain the ship, and rolls of lead, which would have been used to repair leaks in the hull.</p> \n<p>Investigations of the remains of unfortunate sailors that followed the Mars to the depths, as well as other contemporary shipwrecks such as the Vasa, reveal that sailors at the time were simple men. They had no official uniforms but wore the same cloths as a worker on land: a thick coarse grey cap with matching pants, a jacket and a simple shirt as well as a pair of leather shoes. Not much to match the bitter, raw Baltic Sea weather.</p> \n<p>A pile of bricks revealed the remains of the galley, which still contained pottery and cooking utensils. A large number of silver coins have been found scattered over the wreck site.</p> \n<p>'Matchless' meets its match</p> \n<p>In late May 1564, the Swedish fleet was scattered after a severe storm. The old admiral Jakob Bagge, on board the newly built flagship Mars, had only two ships with him when he spotted the Danish fleet off the Swedish island of &Ouml;land.</p> \n<p>&quot;Matchless&quot; was one of the largest ship that had ever sailed in the Baltic Sea up to that point. The battle that ensued lasted for three days and ended with &quot;Matchless'&quot; rudder being shot off; the ship was boarded, and blown up.</p> \n<p>The Swedish chronicler Erik Johansson Tegel described the ship's sorry end:&nbsp;“When the fire reached the powder-magazine, the foremast flew as if one had fired an arrow into the sky, and the ship broke in two and sank” - Konung Erics den XIV:des historia</p> \n<p>The findings at the wreck site seem to confirm that account, says Eriksson. The foremost part of the hull is nearly annihilated. The remaining portion of the hull has broken up below the waterline into three more or less coherent portions. All over the wreck are traces of fire and splintered holes from gunshot.</p> \n<p>But shortly before, it had been boarded by Danish and L&uuml;beckian warships, according to the written sources and the fighting was fierce. Between 800 and 1,000 men are estimated to have been on board during the heat of the battle.</p> \n<p>That is comparable to the population of an entire medium-sized town at the time. Most of them died in the explosion or when the ship sank into the watery depths.</p> \n<p>“We have found several bones, including two femurs and several legs with traces of trauma, and also burned bones,” R&ouml;nnby told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Among the traumatized body parts found are a femur with damage to the knee, which could have been caused by a sharp-edged weapon. The next phase of the research will focus on the osteological remains, R&ouml;nnby says.</p> \n<p>The underwater archaeologists also found a hand grenade. But the most conspicuous objects on the wreck site, the hull pieces aside, were scattered cannons.</p> \n<p>“The size of these cannons varies considerably, from the really large ones placed on the lowest gun deck weighing several tons to the small ones placed in the fore- and stern-castle, and even in the masts. We know from written sources that longbows were still in use aboard ships during the Nordic Seven Years War. But we have not found them yet,” Eriksson says.</p> \n<p>Your tax kroners at work</p> \n<p>The new examination of the Mars shipwreck provides new insights into the events that took place between Denmark and Sweden during the Northern Seven Years’ War, between 1563 and 1570.</p> \n<p>The construction of the Mars marked a transition in Swedish tactics from close-quarter combat to long-distance fighting. The ship bore cannons up to 4.8 meters long.</p> \n<p>How and why Sweden could build and equip a ship like the Mars in the mid-16th century should be seen within the wider societal context. Among other things, various European states were forming formal naval institutions; and Sweden pulled out of the so-called Kalmar union with Denmark and Norway.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As state administration evolved, kings like Sweden's Erik XIV could gather more funding, through for instance taxes, that could be used to build state-of-the-art warships equipped with extremely expensive muzzle-loaded bronze cannons. The armament was often as costly as the rest of the ship.</p> \n<p>Note that as said, the advent of long-distance killing, by rifle or cannon, did not immediately end the use of grapnels, boarding and hand-to-hand fighting.</p> \n<p>Despite the large cannons, the Swedish crew still had to contend with close-quarter combat with the enemy. In order to obstruct assault from a boarding enemy, fighting ships were usually equipped with nets that placed to protect people on deck. The nets made it more difficult for the boarding party and helped to ward off projectiles thrown at the defenders as well as falling rigging parts, Eriksson explains.</p> \n<p>Although the Mars went down, and so did at least some of its crew, the old Swedish admiral Bagge would survive. He himself recounts being wounded in the shoulder by a javelin thrown from one of the attacking ships. He furious returned fire with an arquebus, hitting enemy sailors, who fell into the net. Yet Bagge was captured and remained a prisoner in Denmark for seven years.</p> \n<p>Though the Mars was lost, the other two Swedish ships that participated in the naval engagement escaped and rejoined the Swedish fleet, and continued to fight. Among the fleet's exploits were the capture of 26 Lubeckian merchants off the island of Bornholm; and later that summer they destroyed a Danish fleet outside the northern tip of &Ouml;land.</p> \n<p>The war at sea would continue for six more years, and took a toll on the Scandinavian populations because of the disruption to sea trade.</p> \n<p>One item that fell badly short was communion wine, a matter taken seriously at the time. Fearing spiritual anxiety in the realm, the Swedish king, appointed the reformer Dionysius Beurreus to present a substitute. He found out that beer, apple juice and other beverages worked just as well.</p>",

        "text":["<p>ROME&nbsp;– Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Qatar, listed the Middle East’s main problems at the MED 2018 conference in Rome last Thursday. Naturally, at the top of the list he put Saudi Arabia’s ongoing blockade of his family’s little kingdom. Next were the bloody wars in Yemen and Syria, the chaos in Libya and the political unrest in Lebanon. That was it.</p> \n<p>Missing was another regional conflict in which the Qataris have been deeply involved: The Palestinian issue, and more specifically the question of Gaza’s future, in which the emirate is now investing $15 million a month, in cash.</p> \n<p>Al Thani wasn’t the only one to downgrade the Palestinian issue at the conference. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, secretary-general of the Arab League, also began his talk by listing possible reasons why the region is still broken, saying it could have been the Iran-Iraq war, Iraq’s 1990 occupation of Kuwait, 9/11 or the American invasion of Iraq. According to Gheit –&nbsp;who served as foreign minister in Hosni Mubarak’s regime in Egypt until 2011 –it was most probably “the so-called Arab Spring that caused the destruction of the Arab world.” &nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The Omani sultan welcomes Netanyahu to the '22 Arab States Club' | Opinion ■ Has Hamas sold out Gaza for cash from Qatar and collaboration with Israel? | Opinion ■&nbsp;How far can Netanyahu take Israel's romance with the Arab world?&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>At first, he didn’t mention Israel-Palestine, though later he said that along with Iran’s “encroachment” on the Arab states, the Palestinian issue was still one of the two problems haunting the region and that “without a settlement to [the Palestinian issue], the turmoil [in the region] will continue.”</p> \n<p>But listening to other representatives of Arab League member states at the conference, who either ignored or downplayed the Palestinian issue, Gheit’s words sounded like lip service.</p> \n<p>Instead, on the stage and behind the scenes, there seemed much more appetite for normalization with Israel. Oman’s foreign minister said it quite clearly when he called on the Arab world to “come to terms with the reality that Israel is a fact of life in the region,” and therefore should have its share of “rights as well as obligations.”</p> \n<p>The degree to which Israel and the Palestinians were no longer a central issue was evident even in the appearance of Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who focused his criticism on the Saudis and the United States, and refrained from mentioning Israel in his speech. Even Zarif seemed to realize this wasn’t a venue for Israel-bashing.</p> \n<p>A veteran editor of an Arab news organization explained that he simply no longer had the strength to deal with the issue. “It’s fatigue, fatigue. It’s been going on since I was born, it’s coming out of my ears. There’s no progress on the issue, there’s nothing we can do about it. [Israel is] a fait accompli, it’s Realpolitik, it’s the reality. We have bigger fish to fry.”</p> \n<p>“The only reason now not to speak publicly with Israelis,” said one Lebanese pro-democracy activist at the conference, “is social media. It’s bullshit, but a selfie with an Israeli on Instagram can still get you in trouble. There will be a pile on with people saying nasty things. But everyone knows that is just another stage toward normalization.”</p> \n<p>The conscientious organizers of the annual conference, which is hosted jointly by Italy’s Foreign Ministry, the Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) and public broadcaster RAI, devoted a couple of sessions to the Palestinian issue. But even those had an air of quiet desperation to them.</p> \n<p>The onstage interview with the Palestinian Authority’s foreign minister, Riad Malki, was a long and barely concealed rebuke of the international community and the Arab nations for forsaking the Palestinians. It could be summed up with his warning that the Palestinian issue “will stay there knocking on the door of each and every one of you.”</p> \n<p>Malki promised that the Arab states would not “normalize” with Israel as long as there was no end to the occupation of the Palestinian Territories. But at MED 2018, there was as much chance of hearing about potential cooperation with Israel on energy and desalination, as of the enduring conflict.</p> \n<p>One senior Middle Eastern diplomat listening to Malki commented that “the basic fact is that, for better or worse, the world isn’t bothering Israel anymore about the Palestinians. It’s a total change of paradigm.”</p> \n<p>This was borne out by the interview with the senior Israeli representative present, Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein. It contained just one question tangentially connected to the Palestinian issue, regarding his expectations of the Trump peace plan (pretty low). The rest of his speech revolved around how Israeli technology can help the region, and the threat of Iran – what else?</p> \n<p>At a small side session devoted to the future of Gaza, speakers seemed more focused on the need for a rapprochement between Hamas and Fatah as a way of solving Gaza’s multiple crises, than on pressuring Israel on the matter.</p> \n<p>One leading European expert on the Middle East, who has spent decades writing about Israel and the Palestinians, echoed the widespread underlying feeling. “It’s hard for me now to convince editors and think-tank directors of the need to write papers on Israel and Palestine. No one can see any point&nbsp;– and, quite frankly, I’m not sure I can either.”</p> \n<p>“It looks like Netanyahu’s dream come true,” observed a former Israeli diplomat at the conference. “He always tried to get the Palestinians off the agenda. But careful what you wish for. The Palestinians aren’t going away, and this issue will come back to haunt us with a vengeance,” he warned.</p>",

        "text":["<p>More than 2,200 years after it sank beneath the waves, diving archaeologists have possibly found a missing piece of the Antikythera Mechanism, the fantastically complicated, advanced analog &quot;computer&quot; found in a shipwreck off a Greek island. Scanning shows the encrusted cogwheel to bear an image of Taurus the bull.</p> \n<p>The Antikythera Mechanism was discovered in 1901, technically speaking. An encrusted lump was salvaged by Greek sponge divers in clunky metal diving suits from the Mediterranean seabed. Not that anybody realized what it was at the time. It would take decades and advanced x-ray technology for scientists to realize that the &quot;rock&quot; was a wondrously advanced sophisticated analog calculator consisting of dozens of intermeshed gears.</p> \n<p>The Mechanism could do not only basic math: with dozens of exquisitely worked cogwheels, it could calculate the movements of the sun and moon, predict eclipses and equinoxes, and could be used to track the solar system planets, the constellations, and much more.</p> \n<p>We may never know how many cogwheels the original Antikythera Mechanism had. Assessments based on its functions in predicting the behavior of the cosmos range from 37 to over 70. For comparison, the most advanced Swiss watches have four cogwheels.</p> \n<p>As for the ship bearing the Mechanism, it had been a huge one, laden with precious cargo. Happily, even a century of looters and incautious explorers who combed the site since the ship's original discovery didn't find everything.</p> \n<p>It was probably a dark and stormy night</p> \n<p>The cargo ship carrying the Mechanism and other treasures sank near the island of Antikythera, hence the Mechanism's soubriquet. &nbsp;It likely succumbed to the wild weather typical of the waters in the western Aegean Sea between Greece and Crete.</p> \n<p>In 1901, the divers found one skeleton with the remains of the ship. Later investigation of the wreck in 1976, by a team led by the famous underwater explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, found various bones that have been interpreted as four individuals.</p> \n<p>Come 2012, a new team, led by Dr. Brendan Foley of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (and after 2017, Lund University), returned to the waters by Antikythera to relocate and resurvey the original wreck site, armed with the latest technologies. They found it, with its cargo scattered down a 55-meter downward slope, and also found the remains of a sixth person who had gone down with the ship.</p> \n<p>Much of the hull had been literally eaten up in the centuries followed the shipwreck, consumed by marine animals such as the shipworm. In the 1970s, more than two decades after his first survey of the site, Cousteau and his team salvaged some hull bits, including planks, Dr. Brendan Foley of Lund University told Haaretz. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the process, some of the rest of the hull was destroyed.</p> \n<p>A half-century later, starting in 2012, underwater archaeologists uncovered hundreds of artifacts, including two massive bronze spears, the life-size bronze representation of an arm, other pieces of marble and bronze statues, mosaic glassware, pieces of bone-inlaid furniture, blue game pawns, a sarcophagus lid, gold rings, and silver coins.</p> \n<p>They also found an encrusted, corroded disk, which was pulled from the seabed in 2017.</p> \n<p>Like the original Antikythera Mechanism, after nearly 2,100 years underwater, the disk resembled greenish rock. About eight centimeters in diameter, the object still has four metal arms standing proud of the corners, with holes for pins. X-ray analysis shows the disk to bear the engraving of Taurus the bull.</p> \n<p>It will be difficult to prove what exactly the Taurus disk is: part of the original Antikythera Mechanism, part of a second such mechanism, if one existed, or something else entirely.</p> \n<p>Based on the evidence so far, it looks exactly like other parts of the Mechanism, which had clearly been found incomplete. Based on the etching of the bull that can be seen with scanning, it may well be the gear that predicted the position of the zodiac constellation of Taurus.</p> \n<p>Retro taste for Homeric heroes</p> \n<p>The merchant ship that sank sink off Antikythera carried a cargo of about 50 life-size marble statues and bronze statues, some based on heroes in Homer's masterpieces, the Iliad and the Odyssey, including Odysseus and Achilles.</p> \n<p>That discovery has rather puzzled archaeologists, because the Homeric motif was believed to have gone out of vogue before the first century B.C.E., when the ship set sail – and such statues were not being produced any more. Yet this ship that went down by Antik&yacute;thera had a whole set of such statues. Perhaps the Homeric motif had not gone out of fashion after all; or a person with the means to order such statuary had retro tastes.</p> \n<p>In 2014 and 2015 the diving archaeologists found two bronze spears, two meters in length, but they hadn't been weapons of war. They had been part of the sculptures. Interestingly, the two spears are different in style: one is armor-piercing and the other is lightweight.</p> \n<p>“These are the two only archaeological examples of spears that belong to sculptures that have ever been found,” says Foley.</p> \n<p>Right by where the bronze disk was found in 2017, the archaeologists found several new statue parts, including marble feet attached to a plinth, part of a bronze robe or toga, and a bronze male arm, with two fingers missing but otherwise beautifully preserved. Based on these finds and others recovered in 1901 and 1976, the excavators suspect that at least seven more bronze statues remain buried under the seabed.</p> \n<p>Speaking of unsuspected technological prowess, recent X-ray imaging of a bronze statue discovered in the Antikythera wreck by Cousteau’s team in 1976 revealed a mechanical device inside its circular base, that apparently rotated the statue when a key was turned. This has yet to be confirmed. The statue dates from the second century B.C.E., contemporary or possibly older than the Antikythera Mechanisms. It could well be the earliest known example of a geared device.</p> \n<p>Lucius Lucullus grows greedy</p> \n<p>Who made the Antikythera Mechanisms remains a mystery. But historians suspect they can guess who commissioned this cargo: &nbsp;the brilliant Roman commander Lucius&nbsp;Licinius Lucullus, who had humble beginnings but developed a keen appetite for spiritual and physical pleasures. Today Lucullus is better known for his lavish dining habits than his military skills, thanks to a few funny anecdotes by Plutarch, who wrote his biography with his tongue rammed firmly into his cheek.</p> \n<p>Anyway, in 60 B.C.E., after an illustrious career in pursuing war, Lucullus retired to a spectacular villa that he had built along the bay of Naples, which he decorated with paintings and sculptures collected during his many military campaigns. After he had defeated the king Mithridates, who ruled over Pontus, a small kingdom south of the Black Sea in today's Turkey, a great deal of bounty befell him, including the Pontiac kings' library. Some scholars suggest that the Antik&yacute;thera cargo was one of Lucullus' loot ships.</p> \n<p>There could be another explanation altogether. Around 70 B.C.E, when the Antik&yacute;thera ship sailed, the senatorial class, who had become the nouveau riche of the time, loved to decorate their villas with Greek artworks. They commissioned thousands of ships to bring them treasures from territories around the eastern Mediterranean.</p> \n<p>The wealthy roman Cicero, who by the way was a close friend of Lucullus', sent out a curator to procure statues for his villas and mansions.</p> \n<p>In Roman times the greatest imperial ships were grain freighters, with a capacity of 340&nbsp;tons. But merchant ships could run to 1,300&nbsp;tons, possibly more. According to a description penned in the second century C.E., the Alexandrian grain carrier&nbsp;Isis&nbsp;was over 55&nbsp;meters long, about 14m&nbsp;wide, had a hold some 13m&nbsp;deep, and could probably carry over a thousand&nbsp;tons of grain as well, perhaps, as a few hundred passengers.</p> \n<p>All well and good, but in shipping, to maintain the stability of the vessel, the volume needs to be filled with mass. In other words, the ship needs to be weighted down. However, the bronze and marble statuary, albeit life-size, occupy a lot of space for their volume.</p> \n<p>“The theory is that they were stored in the cargo room with sacks of grain around them,” Foley says.</p> \n<p>Caligula's pleasure boats</p> \n<p>What can be said of the ship that was wrecked at Antik&yacute;thera carrying this immense cargo of heavy statues, the extraordinary Mechanism, and, possibly, hundreds of passengers on board?</p> \n<p>It was a Greek grain ship &nbsp;from the Hellespont that was sailing for Italy, Foley avers, adding that the ship's planks are by far the biggest ever recovered from any other ancient shipwreck. &quot;Even in their shrunken state, they are ten or eleven centimeters thick,” he says.</p> \n<p>In fact, the only surviving comparable vessels are the &quot;Nemi ships&quot; that that the crazed Roman emperor Caligula had built as floating pleasure palaces in Lake Nemi the first century C.E. Two were discovered when Italian dictator Benito Mussolini had the lake drained in the 1930s and divers have since been searching for a possible third.</p> \n<p>“These were pleasure barges with a shallow draft but were 70 to 80 meters long,&quot; says Foley. &quot;I don’t think the ship that sank off Antik&yacute;thera was that long, but the planks on these floating pleasure platforms are smaller than on the Antik&yacute;thera shipwreck.”</p> \n<p>Other ship components retrieved from the original wreck off Antik&yacute;thera include a bilge pipe, hull planking, Corinthian roof tiles, bronze nails, and rigging rings. The exterior surface of the hull was sheathed with thin sheets of lead. Parts of lead pipes the divers found have been associated with the water drainage pump. The discovery of roof tiles suggest the deck had a covered area, which probably served for preparing and loading hatches.</p> \n<p>A second Antikythera wreck</p> \n<p>While surveying the seabed, the divers found a second shipwreck, from about the same era.</p> \n<p>Like the first wreck, the second one is also scattered its bits and cargo down a steep slope, extending from 35 meters below sea level to more than 55m.</p> \n<p>In 2012, the divers recovered a lead anchor stock and collar, and in 2016, a lead pipe, a tile that may have come from the hearth in the galley, bronze nails, a lagynos (Hellenistic-style vase) with an elaborate handle that looks like twisted rope, and several fragments of amphoras and one intact amphora. The styles of these ancient ceramic jars are similar to those found on the first Antikythera wreck.&nbsp;  More amphoras of different types still lie on the sea floor, as well as a large, concreted pile that seems also to consist of amphoras. There is also a very large lead anchor collar awaiting salvage.&nbsp;  “We've only dedicated a couple of dives to investigation of this site, but what we've seen and recovered offers the possibility that the vessel sank in roughly the same time period as the Antikythera wreck,&quot; Foley said. &quot;Comparing stamps on the handles of the Rhodian amphoras may help us narrow down the date of the sinking. Whether the two ships were associated directly is not yet known, and may never be known.”</p> \n<p>Greeks supplying Rome with grain</p> \n<p>The Romans called the Mediterranean&nbsp;Mare Nostrum—Our Sea. Control over sea-lanes was imperative to the empire for more than military reasons. Just one reason is that the city of Rome itself depended upon the shipping industry for its food supply.</p> \n<p>With a population of about one million, Rome needed &nbsp;250,000 and 400,000&nbsp;tons of grain a year. Where did all that grain come from? The Roman-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus quotes the vassal king of Judah, Herod Agrippa&nbsp;II, remarking that North Africa fed Rome for eight months of the year, while Egypt sent enough grain to support the city for the other four.</p> \n<p>Thousands of seagoing vessels, probably including the Antik&yacute;thera ships, were involved in supplying grain to that city.</p> \n<p>The grain fleets were privately owned by Greeks, Phoenicians, and Syrians, who commanded and equipped them. However, the ships were hired by the State. As in the collection of taxes, the government found it easier to outsource the work.</p> \n<p>The archaeologists suspect that the Antik&yacute;thera ships were privately built and owned by Greeks.</p> \n<p>Chemical analyses of the ship's material, such as its lead sheeting, show that they were mined in Chalkidiki, in northern Greece. There is also a drinking cup inscribed with a Greek name, indicating that at least part of the crew was Greek.</p> \n<p>Why would grain ships have passengers on board, if they did?</p> \n<p>In the first century B.C.E., there was no such thing as a passenger ship. Travelers had to use merchant ships. Preliminary examination of the skeletons show they originated from the Aegean region, and some were apparently well off, being found in proximity to gold jewellery and silver coins. The archaeologists also found bowls made of delicate coils of turquoise, yellow and purple glass, and a miniature golden figure of Eros hanging from an earring set with garnets, an emerald and 20 tiny pearls that may have belonged to aristocratic passengers</p> \n<p>However lofty their fares, since the ships were principally for cargo, the passengers were secondary. Only water would have been provided: they would have had to bring their own food and supplies, and bedding. They would sleep on deck, perhaps under tentlike shelters erected at night and taken down each morning.</p> \n<p>Shiver your timbers</p> \n<p>The preponderance of evidence is that Poseidon brought the ships down, not pirates, though wouldn't have been unthinkable.</p> \n<p>In antiquity and certainly during the 1st century B.C.E., the seas of Asia Minor were crawling with pirates. Desperadoes and refugees of all nations and creeds united with Silician and Cretan pirates. The well-organized pirate endeavor was a constant drain on Rome’s maritime trade. Arming the merchant’s fleet with dolphins was one way to protect your investment.</p> \n<p>Another find with the Antikythera wreck is a &quot;dolphin&quot; - a 100-kilo lead bulb tipped with an iron spike. The dolphin would have been dropped from the ship's yardarm through the deck and hull of an attacking vessel.</p> \n<p>The dolphin was in use for around 400 years, and was described by the 5th century B.C.E. historian Thucydides in the context of the Peleponnesian War:</p> \n<p>&quot;At last, fighting hard in this fashion, the Syracusans gained the&nbsp;victory, and the Athenians turned and fled between the merchantmen to their&nbsp;own station. The Syracusan ships pursued them as far as the merchantmen,&nbsp;where they were stopped by the beams armed with dolphins suspended from&nbsp;those vessels over the passage.&quot; (Thucydides, 7th book, translation by Richard Crawley)</p> \n<p>“Weapon systems don't stay around for 400 years if they are not effective,” Foley points out.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Benjamin Netanyahu’s foreign policy has been, by his lights, a resounding success. The United States is in his pocket, at least until Donald Trump presents his “deal of the century.” Europe is mostly engaged with itself, Brexit and immigration, and in the meantime Netanyahu is forging a formidable pocket of resistance with the four Visegrad countries, in exchange for an Israeli pardon for past and present anti-Semitism of some of its members. His idyll with Vladimir Putin may have been marred by the downing of a Russian plane over Syria, but the astounding progress in ties with Saudi Arabia, Gulf countries,&nbsp;and even Chad more than makes up for it.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu must be proud of his achievements, but his pleasure is compounded by the refutation of the dire predictions of his rivals and critics. The diplomatic catastrophe that they envisaged failed to materialize. Instead of the world forcing Netanyahu to change his views, it has embraced them. Whether he is a sagacious prophet or simply lucky beyond his wildest dreams, Netanyahu’s stars have aligned perfectly: A U.S. president who thinks, speaks and acts like a ruffian fan of the notorious Beitar Jerusalem football club, an adventurous if not megalomaniac Saudi crown prince and a wave of nationalism, ethnocentrism and barely-disguised anti-Muslimism, in which Netanyahu swims like a fish in the water.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;The seven worst double standards undermining Israel</p> \n<p>Pushing Trump and his administration to abandon the Iran nuclear deal is Netanyahu’s most prominent accomplishment but his efforts to diminish the Palestinian problem are, from an ideological point of view, far more significant. Netanyahu believes that he has arrested the “reversal of causality” which he pointed to a quarter of a century ago in his book “A Place Among the Nations”: He has undercut the clich&eacute;s instilled in Western public opinion by “Arab propaganda” about the Palestinians being the crux of the Middle East problem and the one that held that only by resolving it will Israel be able to find its place in the region. “Our relations with Arab countries, which are predicated on Israel’s strength and worth, are actually stronger and more stable,” Netanyahu told the Knesset on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Isolating the Palestinians and rendering them irrelevant is a central pillar of Netanyahu’s campaign to push them into a corner, crush their aspirations, smash their expectations and bring them back, with a thud, to a reality in which they must make do with the status quo for the time being and with an administrative autonomy, at best, as a permanent solution. In order to weaken the Palestinians further, Netanyahu is playing divide and rule between Gaza and the West Bank, even if this requires an accommodation with Hamas that disappoints his right-wing base.</p> \n<p>The fatal flaw in the Netanyahu doctrine is the assumption that the Palestinians will stick to the script he’s written, that they will come to accept the destruction of their dreams and that the pressure cooker into which they have been pushed won’t blow up in Israel’s face. The relative lack of the violence that was expected to break out in the wake of the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in May has emboldened Netanyahu to believe that the Palestinians are under control. The fact that both intifadas broke out against a backdrop of frustration and resentment among Palestinians doesn’t faze him. On his watch, the Palestinians will remain docile.</p> \n<p>Everyone is now waiting for the publication of Trump’s ultimate peace plan. Even if he won’t like it, Netanyahu is banking on his ability to maneuver Palestinian President&nbsp;Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian leadership to reject the plan first. Only then, when it becomes clear that the peace process is irrevocably moribund, we’ll be able to ascertain whether Netanyahu has confounded his critics once again or opened up the gates of hell instead. If Netanyahu happens to lose the elections as well, it will be left to his successor to try and clean up the mess.</p>",

Middle East experts won’t convene in 2018:&nbsp;For the past 13 years, come December in DC this invite-only gathering of top Jewish and Middle East leaders has been the hottest ticket in town. Held a block away from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, it’s not the White House Hanukkah party with long lines and random guests, but the exclusive Saban Forum. Hosted by media mogul Haim Saban, the Forum has served as an annual off-the-record convening of key Middle East movers and shakers since it was launched in 2004. Think AIPAC’s Policy Conference — if only the speakers’ lounge was invited. The Saban Forum has included conversations with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Jared Kushner respectively over the last four years.  The Forum’s featured guest speaker in 2018? There’ll be none. In fact, there will be no gathering at all, organizers revealed in a letter to past attendees. Is the Saban Forum another casualty of the Trump effect on DC’s establishment? Perhaps, but organizers say they are taking this year off to reassess and refresh the format.&nbsp;[JewishInsider]  In a letter to frequent attendees earlier this year, Haim Saban and Natan Sachs of Brookings wrote:&nbsp;“We wanted to let you know that we have decided to take a year off to rethink and reformat the Saban Forum. This will allow us to ensure it can live up to its mission while adapting to the new realities in the Middle East and in the United States.”  Martin Indyk, formerly the Executive Vice President of the Brookings Institute, said the Saban Forum was cancelled simply because the content had gone stale.&nbsp;“The context needed to be renovated or reinvented. It was the same conversation with the same people, more or less,” Indyk told Jewish Insider. “It tended to devolve to the same conversation, especially because there were the same figures for all intents and purposes, on the Israeli side. On the American side, of course, it changed. We went from Obama and Kerry, to Trump and Jared Kushner. That was all different. But it really felt like the conversation wasn't going anywhere. We were basically ships passing in the night.”  The Trump Effect? — Some believe that the makeup of the Trump administration’s foreign policy team and the fact that the current Israeli government has established its own very close ties with the White House could have played a factor in the decision.  Dennis Ross tells us:&nbsp;“I do believe the Forum would have been held this year if Hillary had been elected.”  Elliott Abrams:&nbsp;“I think that the Saban Forum has suffered from the fact that it was almost entirely center-left to left. There were very few Republicans, there were very few Likud or Yisrael Beitenu people. It’s basically a progressive club, and that’s just not smart because it does not reflect the political reality in either country.”  Indyk says the cancellation of this year’s gathering wasn't influenced by the Trump administration.&nbsp;“We were able to engage with the current administration. Last year we had Jared Kushner come, which I think was the first time he appeared publicly,” he pointed out. “We had quite a few other officials there from the Trump administration who were not speaking publicly. It wasn't a problem of attracting the high level people. There was a question of whether there was really anything productive coming out of it.”  Haim Saban emails us:&nbsp;“The Forum not taking place this year had nothing to do with Trump, Hillary or anything else. Been holding the Forum for 14 years. Time to rethink and refresh.&quot;&nbsp;  Missed Opportunity? —&nbsp;“You can’t make the argument that there’s nothing to talk about,” Aaron David Miller of the Wilson Center told Jewish Insider. “Absolutely, there’s a need for such a gathering.&nbsp;On the cusp of what may be the first effort by the administration to lay out a ‘comprehensive’ solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I would have thought that now would be an intriguing, fascinating time to hold this gathering. I think the issue is pregnant with all kinds of material, fascinating politics, security issues and personalities. At a time where there’s so much of consequence occuring, at a time when Israel faces so many security challenges, and at a time when Bibi faces a momentous year, why not have the Saban Forum? This could’ve been one of the more intriguing Saban Forums.” </p> \n<p>According to Susie Gelman, Chair of the Israel Policy Forum:&nbsp;“Given how strained our political discourse has become, the opportunities for dialogue provided by the Saban Forum are needed now perhaps more than ever.”  Former U.S. Ambassador Daniel Shapiro:&nbsp;“The relationship is always more than just a few people around the president and the prime minister. I hope we will resume the Saban Forum, or something like it, in the years ahead.”  Indyk and Saban say they are in the process of reevaluating the Forum, with plans to relaunch in the future. “We might bring it back in 2019,” said Saban.&nbsp;  Last week, the Israeli-American Council (IAC)&nbsp;announced that top Democrats — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and soon-to-be House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — will be interviewed by Haim Saban on stage at the group’s conference in South Florida this upcoming weekend. Is this a makeup of sorts for not having a Saban Forum this year?  According to Indyk, the answer is no. “The IAC and the Saban Forum are two different things. I don't call them apples and oranges. The IAC is for former Israelis living in America. Haim is very much part of that community. That's his chevra. It's not an either-or&nbsp;proposition.”  CNN&nbsp;poll&nbsp;reveals&nbsp;depth&nbsp;of&nbsp;anti-Semitism&nbsp;in&nbsp;Europe — by&nbsp;Richard&nbsp;Allen&nbsp;Greene:&nbsp;&quot;More than a quarter of Europeans polled believe Jews have too much influence in business and finance.&nbsp;Nearly one in four said Jews have too much influence in conflict and wars across the world...

[for] telling her to “take a tour of the Holocaust Museum” after she compared Central American migrants to Jewish families fleeing Nazi Germany. “This administration has jailed children and violated human rights.

The Jewish community must be careful not to politicize every reference that may touch our community. Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez did not compare the Central American situation to the Shoah. She did not trivialize the Holocaust. She compared the two people who became refugees fleeing their homes due to danger or fear. There is nothing inappropriate in that comparison.

Yet he never really felt at home there… Midburn has given Abd El Hay hope for what lasting peace in his home country might look like. &quot;In this one place, I get a taste of what Israel, my home, could be.” [PacificStandard]  LONG READ — Five Countries Slow to Address Nazi-Looted Art, U.S. Expert Says — by&nbsp;William Cohan:&nbsp;&quot;In 1998... 44 nations agreed to the&nbsp;Washington Principles, a treaty of sorts that committed its signers to making best efforts to return the [Nazi] looted art. But speaking Monday in Berlin... the man who negotiated the principles on behalf of the United States delivered a blunt rebuke to what he characterized as foot-dragging by five countries. “We have made giant strides,” said Stuart E. Eizenstat, an advisor to the State Department, “toward achieving the goals of identifying, publicizing, restituting and compensating for some of the looted art, cultural objects and books, and in so doing, providing some small measure of belated justice to some victims of the Holocaust or their heirs.”&nbsp;But, he continued, “We must candidly confront the unfulfilled promises we solemnly made.” Mr. Eizenstat... said an estimated 600,000 paintings had been stolen during the war and that 100,000 remain missing.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  TRANSITION — Rabbi Benjamin Berger&nbsp;is joining Hillel International as Vice President for Jewish Education.

He will serve under Einat Kalisch Rotem, the first woman to ever serve as mayor of a major Israeli city. Rotem defeated the incumbent, Yonah Yahav, in a landslide victory in last month’s municipal elections.</p> \n<p>Haiyun, 56, is a member of Meretz, the left-wing Zionist party, and headed its list in the Haifa election. Under a rotation agreement, he is scheduled to serve as deputy mayor for only half a term. He will be one of five deputy mayors serving the city.</p> \n<p>The new city council in Haifa, which is a mixed Jewish-Arab city, will include representatives of parties from across the religious and political spectrum, including ultra-Orthodox parties. Rotem received considerable support from the ultra-Orthodox community in her mayoral bid.</p> \n<p>For the past 10 years, Haiyun has served as the spiritual leader of Congregation Moriah, one of the oldest Conservative synagogues in the country. Six months ago, he made headlines after he was detained by police for performing weddings outside the confines of the Chief Rabbinate. Soon after his release, Attorney General Amichai Mendelblit ordered police to suspend the investigation.</p> \n<p>Under a law passed several years ago, rabbis who conduct traditional Jewish weddings outside the confines of the Rabbinate could face jail-terms of two years. The first time this law was ever tested was in the case of Haiyun.</p> \n<p>Last week, a move to repeal this law and eliminate the sanctions was defeated in the Knesset.</p> \n<p>“As someone who knows Rabbi Haiyun personally, I am confident that the residents of Haifa will gain a top-notch public servant who will do all he can for their benefit,” said Yizhar Hess, director of the Conservative movement in Israel. “He is a devoted public servant who has been active for years in connecting people to Judaism, as they wish to practice it, without any coercion.”</p>",

He talked about a meeting that took place with the Saudi government seven weeks earlier in the UAE’s largest city, Dubai.</p> \n<p>The Saudis came to see presentations on cyberwar and interception technology; the man said he had won the trust of the two men in line behind the king, the defense minister and his brother.</p> \n<p>He was referring to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who serves as Saudi defense minister, and his brother Khalid.</p> \n<p>&quot;For this to work, His Highness would like it done a certain way,&quot; the man said. &quot;I assume you know where this is going, there is always an economic advantage for people in deals of this scale.&quot;</p> \n<p>The man then asked if Barak indeed understood where this was going. Barak said he did.</p> \n<p>he interest shown toward former Israeli army officers and politicians is nothing new. But this time the circumstances are particularly interesting.</p> \n<p>First, Barak is a former prime minister. Second, the connection was being made in the name of a country, not a company. Third, the country was Saudi Arabia, whose strategic, diplomatic and security interests have been linked with those of Israel.</p> \n<p>Finally, a person the man said he was representing was none other than one of the most influential figures in the Arab world, and beyond.</p> \n<p>The man added that the deal would be financially advantageous to people close to the royal family; the structure of the deal would be very special, and he would be happy to sit with Barak and explain.</p> \n<p>The following response was issued on behalf of Barak: “By his own choice, Barak never dealt in weapons, military systems or defense systems at any stage of his business activity. Of course, dozens of people approach him each week in writing or orally with various ideas.”</p> \n<p>According to the statement, “If it turns out, as in the case in this article, that these are people he should not work with in areas not relevant for him, the meeting or conversation ends politely and with no results. This is how the case in this article went, and as it happens that’s a good thing.”</p> \n<p>Barak often expresses views touching on political, social and diplomatic topics, both in the traditional media and on social media. He’s also a businessman, after having left politics early this decade.</p> \n<p>Some of his interests are known publicly; for example, he is chairman of the medical marijuana company InterCure. But many of Barak’s interests are hidden from public view.</p> \n<p>The recording helps reflect Barak’s expertise in Israel’s cyberindustry and his familiarity with its products and distribution system. Most of this industry’s clients are governments, including some that represent Arab countries that have no official ties with Israel.</p> \n<p>In recent months Barak has said more than once that the entities that are warming ties with countries in the region are private companies. As he sees it, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to package these achievements as a policy asset.</p> \n<p>Even though the 2015 deal did not come to pass, the Saudis kept showing an interest in similar cybersolutions. As Haaretz reported this week, in 2017 the Saudis negotiated with the company NSO Group Technologies, whose development headquarters is in Herzliya near Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>The middleman said that in the 2015 phone call with Barak he was conducting the matter with an attorney representing the Saudi defense ministry, a British citizen of Jewish origin.</p> \n<p>The middleman said he had won the confidence of the other side’s attorney, who wanted a formal invitation to come to Israel see the systems at work. He would be the eyes and ears of the Saudis in the deal.</p> \n<p>Barak asked about who the middleman worked for, and provided the names of a few cybercompanies he guessed the middleman was working for. The middleman said he worked only for himself, or to be more accurate, for his wife. Then he said her full name and broke out laughing.</p> \n<p>The middleman said he had received advice from people close to him, recommendations from friends. He added that he had even met with the representatives of one of the companies.</p> \n<p>He said he knew that its technology was installed in countries that they could not discuss over the phone.</p> \n<p>The companies mentioned by Barak and the mediator develop eavesdropping and monitoring capabilities for telephone conversations. It’s a technology whose aim is to provide a mass listening capability to a massive number of phone calls at the same time, while using a smart algorithm that monitors the calls for “hot words” defined ahead of time.</p> \n<p>Barak was not involved in providing any “economic advantage” to the Saudi authorities as part of the deal. As far as is known, no deal came about.</p> \n<p>But Barak met with the middleman after he mentioned the idea of providing an “economic advantage” as requested by the kingdom. This may be a detail worth remembering the next time Barak talks about the seriousness of the “submarine affair” in which Netanyahu aides are suspected of providing an “economic advantage” as part of a large security deal.</p>",

Typically, such certification is provided by their congregational rabbis back home. Overseas congregational rabbis also provide letters of certification for converts and divorce.</p> \n<p>For such individuals, therefore, knowing which rabbis appear on the approved lists is critical. Until now, though, these lists have been kept under wraps.</p> \n<p>Spearheading the campaign to force the Rabbinate to publish them has been ITIM – an Israeli organization that helps individuals challenged by Israel’s religious bureaucracy. ITIM has demanded on numerous occasions over the past six years that the Rabbinate hand over the lists, going so far as to threaten it with legal action if it did not comply.</p> \n<p>Two years ago, ITIM represented an American woman whose conversion by a prominent New York rabbi, Haskel Lookstein, was rejected by the Rabbinate. Lookstein had also converted&nbsp;Ivanka Trump, the daughter of President&nbsp;Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>The new list of rabbis recognized for conversions does include Lookstein. It does not, however, include the Vaad Harabanim of Flatbush – a rabbinical court that has converted thousands of individuals over the years.</p> \n<p>Most of the rabbis on the two lists reside in the United States. The lists also include rabbis who are not members of the Rabbinical Council of America, the main organization representing Orthodox rabbis in the country.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Seth Farber, the founder and executive director of ITIM, called the publication of the lists “a victory for transparency.”</p> \n<p>At the same time, he said, they were “far from perfect.” For example, he said, the lists do not make clear whether individuals converted by rabbis who do not appear on the lists will be stripped of their Jewish status. Neither is it clear whether rabbis or rabbinical courts that do not appear on the list can appeal.</p> \n<p>The lists contain the names of rabbinical courts around the word that are recognized by the Rabbinate, as well as the names of the individual rabbis in each rabbinical court.</p>",

The minister instructed the head of the Culture Administration, Galit Wahba-Shasho, who was the liaison to the joint French-Israeli cultural season, to represent the Culture Ministry and to convey greetings from the minister and the ministry.

Its attempt to punish the company throughout Israel with a new tax, and potential legal challenges, and even to tap allies in America to punish them here, reflects its doubling down on their insistence that there must be no distinction between Israel and the West Bank settlements.</p> \n<p>Those settlements are, of course, nearly globally viewed as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel’s own authorities know that too, as was first formally noted in a secret memo written for the prime minister by the Foreign Ministry’s legal adviser in 1968. Even in today's Israel the settlements are deliberately considered to be outside the State of Israel,&nbsp; territory where Israeli civil law does not apply, lest Israel formally lose its democratic status by formally annexing the territory without granting its Palestinian inhabitants full civil rights.</p> \n<p>This insistence on erasing the Green Line, the 1967 borders, is hardly new.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;I'm Not the 'Right Kind of Jew' for Israel's Current Government – and I'm Proud of It</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s government has long worked to conflate Israel with the West Bank settlements, insisting that support for the former must include support for the latter. For example, its anti-BDS law permitting Israel to deny entry to any advocate of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement includes vocal Zionists who support Israel but boycott the settlements. One vocal exponent of exactly this position, Peter Beinart, was detained and interrogated on entry into Israel this summer.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Indeed, for those who reject the international consensus on the illegality of the settlements, this could only be an act of anti-Semitism – for, in their eyes, it discriminates against Jews &quot;for the sole reason that they are Jewish,&quot; an ironic statement considering the homes often sit on stolen land in all-Jewish communities that local Palestinians cannot enter, let alone rent in.</p> \n<p>The settlements are equated with Israel, and Israel with the Jewish people. Ergo, opposing the settlements is anti-Semitism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What about the Zionist center? For so-called liberal Zionists in the United States who support, or even demand, a two-state solution and oppose the settlements as illegal and/or self-defeating, this should have been a moment to push back against the right-wing argument. Israel still deserves our support despite their current government, such voices should argue, but the settlements are both wrong and self-destructive.</p> \n<p>While a few progressive Zionist voices such as J Street and T'ruah rightly pushed back against this erasure, the majority of American Jewish liberal Zionists - or at least, its most prominent representatives - seem to be in full support of the rightwing position, conflating boycott of the Jewish settlements with boycott of Israel itself. It's a telling conflation, but a dangerous one.</p> \n<p>For example, Jonathan Greenblatt at the Anti-Defamation League – which claims to strongly support a two-state solution and opposes the Jewish settlements – rushed to condemn the decision, claiming it would &quot;isolate and delegitimize the State of Israel&quot; and (like Netanyahu’s government) conflating it with BDS, thus labeling it an act of anti-Semitism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>B’nai Brith took a similar stance, calling it a &quot;blatantly discriminatory decision.&quot; The city council of Beverly Hills even passed a resolution calling on Airbnb &quot;to correct this act of disrespect to the land of Israel...[and if not] we call upon all civilized people across the globe to boycott Airbnb until such time as they desist from these despicable anti-Semitic Actions.&quot;</p> \n<p>In short, American Jews who describe themselves as centrist, liberal Zionists have accepted this right-wing narrative, despite their protestations to the contrary. This is both foolish and dangerous, for several reasons.</p> \n<p>First, Airbnb actually does apply this ethos to other regions. For example, despite countless claims to the contrary, they have officially banned all listings in Russian-occupied Crimea for quite some time. And the company has announced that it is next considering banning occupied Western Sahara and will continue to consider banning other areas &quot;in an ongoing manner.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Their stated goal is not to shut down operations in every non-democratic country, or in every country that limits which nationalities may visit, but rather to avoid profiting from foreign occupation at the heart of larger regional disputes and so as not to &quot;contribute to human suffering.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But setting aside the differences between the West Bank settlements from many of the cases being cited as parallels, must every single problem area on the globe be banned for it not to constitute anti-Semitism?</p> \n<p>Was the Jackson-Vanik Amendment an example of anti-Russian bigotry and therefore Congress wrong to pass it, since so many other atrocities – far worse than Soviet treatment of its Jews – were overlooked at the time? Was the economic, diplomatic and sporting boycotts of South Africa wrong for the same reason?</p> \n<p>Should the international community and private businesses freeze any action against a country's misbehavior on moral and legal grounds until it can be rolled out simultaneously everywhere?</p> \n<p>Second, this whataboutism is not just logically problematic, it is dangerous. Do we really want to be making the argument, &quot;How can you not allow these Jews to profit on your platform from their criminal enterprise when you allow other terrible people and regimes to make money in stolen or occupied land? This is (despicable!) anti-Semitic discrimination?&quot; Can this be called &quot;liberal Zionism&quot;?</p> \n<p>Finally, Airbnb – which two years ago waived its fees in Israel in order to alleviate the stress of those left homeless by devastating fires – has not boycotted Israel in retaliation for its government’s commitment to the settlements. It still operates in Israel, including East Jerusalem and the Golan!</p> \n<p>Zionists are rightly sensitive to actions that evoke fears of BDS. But for liberal Zionists who oppose West Bank settlements on moral, legal or self-interest grounds, this could have been a moment to celebrate the company for not boycotting Israel on account of the behavior of its current government. This could have been a moment to push back against the narrative that obfuscates the distinction between the settlements and Israel.</p> \n<p>If we accept that obfuscation, we erase the key to liberal Zionism. There needs to be a space for Zionists who reject BDS but also the attempt to conflate the settlements with Israel, not to mention world Jewry.</p> \n<p>If Jews and others are forced to choose between Israel with its settlements, or else to walk away entirely, liberal Zionists may not be so happy with the choice many make.</p> \n<p>Joshua Shanes is Associate Professor of Jewish Studies at the College of Charleston.

        "text":["<p>The cowardly refusal of Stellenbosch University officials to stand up for academic freedom and intellectual honesty ahead of next week’s &quot;Recognition, Reparation, Reconciliation: The Light and Shadow of Historical Trauma&quot; conference is shameful, if not altogether unexpected.</p> \n<p>The decision to remove Professors Shifra Sagy (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev),&nbsp;Arie Nadler (Tel Aviv University) and Raya Morag (Hebrew University)&nbsp;is only the latest &quot;victory&quot; in South Africa for&nbsp;the Boycott Israel crowd, for whom intimidation and threats have long been the tools of choice.</p> \n<p>But the main victims of demands by (so-called) pro-Palestinian activists to disinvite the Israeli researchers from the 5-8 December gathering are not Israeli academics. They are the people of South Africa itself, and the country’s values of intellectual honesty and academic freedom.</p> \n<p>There is little reason even to address the calumny of the comparison between modern Israel and apartheid South Africa. The comparison bears little resemblance to Israeli society, but does violence to the millions of black and colored South Africans who suffered under decades of pass laws, separate beaches, &quot;Bantu education&quot; requirements and a thousand more violations of civil rights and of basic human dignity on a daily basis.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, as in other places, Stellenbosch’s boycott of Israeli researchers will have little effect on the groundbreaking research happening in Israel, in every field and at every university.</p> \n<p>Despite the best efforts of a small cadre of activists, academic journals are hungry for research from Israel, and academics from virtually every country in the world – including South Africa, and including the Arab world – actively pursue collaborative projects with our scholars. None of that should come of a surprise: It is the natural outcome of a societal norm where the free exchange of ideas is sacrosanct.</p> \n<p>Rather, the main victims here are South Africans themselves.</p> \n<p>Twenty-five years after Nelson Mandela was elected president, and nearly 30 years after he was released from prison, South Africa remains mired in inequality.</p> \n<p>A cursory glance at the country’s major cities confirms this: The leafy Johannesburg suburb of Sandton, located a short distance from the sprawling poverty in the Alexandra township, is still inhabited almost exclusively by whites. Same for Cape Town, where the mostly white residents of Hout Bay enjoy private swimming pools and luxury cars, adjacent to the Imizamo Yethu township where black residents are largely poor and lack basic sanitation and education infrastructure.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to a 2017 government report, white people - nine percent of the total population - still own&nbsp;72 per cent of the country’s farmland. Nearly 30 percent of black youth are unemployed, as opposed to fewer than 10 percent of their white counterparts.</p> \n<p>Socially, too, black and white South Africans have failed to capitalize on Mandela’s vision of a Rainbow Nation, offering opportunity, security and equality to all. To the contrary.</p> \n<p>The ANC's rural affairs minister Gugile Nkwinti says openly that the ANC &quot;unequivocally supports&quot; the expropriation of white-owned land without compensation. The Yes4Youth&nbsp;website, a government-sponsored initiative founded by President Cyril Ramaphosa to work with businesses to improve youth employment, says openly that the service &quot;is only available to Black, Indian or Coloured South Africans.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How ironic, then, and how sad that the one of the subjects of this week’s boycott Israel protests was Professor Emerita Shifra Sagy, the chair of the Martin-Springer Center for Study of Conflict Management at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and former chair of our Conflict Management and Resolution Program. Professor Sagy’s research would seem to be particularly relevant to the challenges facing South Africa today.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We drafted a program to bring together Palestinian and Jewish Israeli students for a project we called: 'Can we empathize with the narrative of our enemy?'&quot; says Prof. Sagy. &quot;The Palestinian students were pressured and threatened not to participate in the project in the name of not 'normalizing' ties with Israel, so we were left without their input.</p> \n<p>&quot;What we found, however, was astounding. We studied the Palestinian narrative, met with residents of the Deheisha refugee camp near Bethlehem to hear their stories, heard lectures from Palestinian academics.</p> \n<p>&quot;The data we collected was astounding: The interaction with the Palestinian narrative forced our students to consider viewpoints they hadn’t encountered before, which in turn forced them to sharpen and clarify their own beliefs. We found that the students were able to empathize with their enemies’ story, even while remaining proud Israeli citizens,&quot; Prof. Sagy said. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Pro-Palestinian activists may well feel they have won this latest round of anti-Israeli thuggery. But their &quot;victory&quot; is a stolen one, wrested from South African students and society who would certainly have benefitted from drawing on the expertise of the Israel delegations personal experience and professional scholarship.</p> \n<p>While the conference will probably go ahead, it will be much the poorer, morally and intellectually, for not having Israeli academics there.</p> \n<p>Professor Chaim Hames is the rector of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel</p>",

        "text":["<p>For those with a John Oliver-shaped hole in their lives – either because his show is now hibernating until February or, as in my case, because you simply grew tired of the series’ wall-to-wall Trump coverage and increasing proselytizing – I come bearing good tidings: Netflix’s “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj” is a funnier, fresher, less snarky version of “Last Week Tonight.”</p> \n<p>Yes, this is yet another political comedy show – something you would think we need like another far-right party in Europe or another Franco brother. Yet in a line that doesn’t quite reflect how sharply written his show is, Minhaj himself points out the uniqueness of this particular series: “I’m the brown one! That’s why you have to watch.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Why I stopped watching 'Last Week Tonight' &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>To put it a better way, Minhaj is a 33-year-old, Indian-American Muslim who’s as passionate about his Air Jordans as he is about discussing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. (Can’t wait to hear what he hopefully has to say about Israel and the Palestinians.) He’s also served his comedy dues on “The Daily Show” (between November 2014 and August 2018), done the comedy circuit (his 2017 comedy special “Hasan Minhaj: Homecoming King” is also worth a look on Netflix) and is now perfectly primed to offer his own perspective on matters both weighty and frivolous.</p> \n<p>Netflix has commissioned 32 episodes of “Patriot Act,” and it’s to be hoped they give Minhaj more of a chance to find an audience than another alum of “The Daily Show” and the White House Correspondents Dinner received earlier this year. (Michelle Wolf’s “The Break” was unceremoniously canned after a short run that indeed mirrored the show’s title.)</p> \n<p>Six episodes in, things are looking extremely promising – although I’m not sure how many people actually know “Patriot Act” exists. I only heard about it when an online stunt generated a few headlines after the show’s fifth episode (about the Supreme streetwear brand). Otherwise, it suffers the dilemma facing every Netflix show when you open the streaming service’s homepage: getting lost in the crowd.</p> \n<p>This show deserves a wide audience, though, because Minhaj’s is a voice well worth hearing – if only because it provides me with a much-needed education on Muslim and Indian culture (is it just me who didn’t know what a lota is?).</p> \n<p>A new episode drops every Sunday and the show is at its best when it covers subjects close to Minhaj’s heart – although given that these topics vary from Amazon to Mecca, and from streetwear to immigration enforcement, he does have a broad range of passions.</p> \n<p>Filmed in front of a studio audience, the show wisely dispenses with the customary desk configuration and has Minhaj simply delivering the material – like a cross between a TED talk and a stand-up set. And if his hyperkinetic delivery isn’t enough for you, the bank of screens behind has a “Michael Bay directed a PowerPoint presentation” vibe, as the host himself puts it.</p> \n<p>Minhaj’s ease in front of a live crowd is also a huge advantage – when one esoteric punch line elicits only a smattering of laughter, he breezily brushes it off with “I do my jokes for four people at a time,” thus generating a far bigger laugh.</p> \n<p>With its well-researched stories (each lasting about 20 minutes; sometimes there’s a subsidiary story, sometimes not), there’s a lot to engage viewers here. At times, I was even reminded of the “Reithian principles” of public service broadcasting that have sought to guide program makers at the BBC for generations: inform, educate and entertain.</p> \n<p>More woke than comatose</p> \n<p>Of course, this is a show that pitches its tent in the exact same spot as all other political shows: to the left of center (and yes, to quote Lyndon B. Johnson on J. Edgar Hoover, Minhaj is most definitely inside the tent pissing out). I guess the argument is that if you’re on the right and want to see a comedy show, you already have a whole channel to yourself on Fox News.</p> \n<p>What’s great about “Patriot Act” is that it avoids the overbearing preachiness John Oliver was dispensing of late. Its audiences may be more woke than comatose, but Minhaj himself knows that his “wokeness” goes only so far. In the show on Amazon, for example, he lists a long list of the website’s many sins, but admits he’ll still be using it for its convenience: When it’s a choice between woke and lazy, he’ll choose the latter every time.</p> \n<p>While it’s true that much of the humor is derived from a series of “It’s like...” set-ups, it’s also true that these lines are often very funny. Here are a few that spring to mind (and there are better ones I haven’t listed here):</p> \n<p>1. “Saudi Arabia was basically the boy band manager of 9/11. They didn’t write the songs, but they helped get the group together.”</p> \n<p>2. “‘Non-criminal arrests’ is such an oxymoron. It’s like ‘Chatty Clarence Thomas’ or ‘Remorseful Louis C.K.’”</p> \n<p>3. “The Carlyle Group is something you’ve heard of but have no idea what it is. It’s like ‘Ray Donovan.’”</p> \n<p>4. “Here’s a simpler way of describing predatory pricing: Picture a mom-and-pop store. Now imagine Amazon as the Menendez brothers.”</p> \n<p>5. “Dinesh D’Souza is on the Mount Rushmore of shitty Indians. Twice. He’s that bad.”</p> \n<p>If I have a criticism, there are moments when the show strays too close to “Last Week Tonight” territory (when Minhaj discussed U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke in the show on oil, I was expecting him to show clips of Zinke calling himself a geologist, which is a running gag on Oliver’s show). The challenge will be finding the subject matter that plays to Minhaj’s strengths and doesn’t feel like the result of a writers’ room brainstorm.</p> \n<p>Most of the half-dozen episodes have been excellent. But there are two standouts you must seek out even if you don’t plan to watch the entire series: the shows on Saudi Arabia and immigration enforcement. The former was recorded after the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and offers a brilliant crash course on everything you ever wanted to know about the kingdom – but with added jokes. Did you know, for example, that MBS’ nickname in Saudi Arabia is Abu Rasasa, or Father of the bullet. “That is the most gangster name ever,” says Minhaj. “Do you know what ‘El Chapo’ means? ‘Shorty.’” He flips between humor and earnestness effortlessly, and after delivering some killer one-liners he concludes by noting: “Saudi Arabia is only 2 percent of the entire Muslim population. But whenever Saudi does something wrong, Muslims around the world have to live with the consequences.”</p> \n<p>In the most recent episode to air, Minhaj unearthed some amazing footage of the architect behind Trump’s war on undocumented immigrants, Stephen Miller, when he was a 17-year-old, tennis-playing virgin. After Miller admits concern about his receding hairline (he was right to be worried), Minhaj interjects: “Did your hair leave you, or did you just deport it for being brown?”</p> \n<p>With a team of nine others in the writers’ room, this is clearly not a one-man show. Yet it succeeds or fails on Minhaj, and his endearing personality and warmth make “Patriot Act” a show that all nationalities can embrace. Even better, it gives the older demographic (cough) an opportunity to learn new pop culture terms like “Indian fuckboy” and “Dick appointment,” even if we are reliant upon Google to enlighten us.</p>",

At the minimum, Citibank should suspend all future sponsorship of this bigot.”</p> \n<p>The Conference of Presidents statement said that Waters “should not be given a stage to spread his anti-Israel and anti-Jewish messages.</p> \n<p>“In the aftermath of the events in Pittsburgh and with the rise of anti-Semitism globally it is essential that we speak up clearly and demand zero tolerance of intolerance, no excuses and no exceptions,” Stark and Hoenlein said in a joint statement. &nbsp;“Mr. Waters has not only espoused his views but he has pushed other entertainers to boycott Israel, often using extreme methods and pressure. His comments are not based on a criticism of a particular policy, but of Israel's right to exist.”</p> \n<p>The statement also called elected officials in countries where Waters will appear to make clear their rejection of his “offensive views.”</p> \n<p>The call came after Waters has taken his tour to Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Columbia and Costa Rica and is poised to play seven concerts in Mexico.</p> \n<p>Jennifer Bombardier, a spokesperson for Citibank responded, saying: “Citi is not a sponsor of Roger Waters’ current tour. Recently, Citibanamex offered a limited time cardmember ticket pre-sale for four shows in Mexico, as we do for thousands of concerts by various artists around the world every year. The pre-sale has ended.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>&quot;End the occupation!&quot; a middle-aged man shouted at me at one of my recent speaking events. &quot;It’s that simple, just end it!&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We are in an impatient era, an era of instant tweets, of news at our fingertips, Peace Now and Breaking the Silence now. If only it were that simple.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As we continue to brace ourselves for President Donald Trump’s &quot;Deal of the Century,&quot; we need to keep a few things in mind. I’m not talking about the debate about historical and religious rights, Abraham buying the Machpela Cave in Hebron, and everything that defines us as a Jewish nation.</p> \n<p>Those rights are widely quoted by many politicians, and are a source of inspiration for many Israelis and Jews. But they are not the realpolitik factors for a final settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>While those issues are important, they bring us no closer to understanding the challenges we face today amid the looming demand by international and national organizations that we &quot;end the occupation.&quot; The peace camp, as they like to call themselves, are no closer to bringing peace - and this is due to their failure to grasp the very real challenges Israel faces.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Here’s why Israel can’t just walk out of the West Bank.</p> \n<p>The challenges in 2018 are threefold. Leadership, geography and trust.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>First, let’s address leadership, or lack of leadership. The Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas is 82 years old, has been hospitalized several times this year and suffers from failing health.</p> \n<p>Since 2007, he has empowered his security forces to coordinate so closely with Israel we could almost call them relations of intimacy. The Palestinian security forces work with Jerusalem not out of love for Israel, but out of fear of Hamas taking over the West Bank. But as Abbas threatens time and time again to cancel this security coordination, it leaves Israel is in a constant state of national security limbo.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Abbas has no clear successor, and if the lessons of the Middle East can teach us anything, a power struggle will most surely happen within his own camp once he leaves the stage. Hamas, too, is watching like a panther preparing to pounce in order to challenge the Palestinian Authority’s West Bank leadership.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On the Israeli side, Benjamin Netanyahu has toned down his 2009 Bar Ilan endorsement of two states. He now says different people understand different things when discussing a negotiated agreement. He has refrained from repeating the 10-month settlement construction freeze he imposed in 2009 in an attempt to appease then-U.S. President Barak Obama and entice Abbas back to the negotiating table.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Neither benefits accrued, and his actions came with a huge political price. None of the Israeli contenders for the country's leadership have any other viable plan, from Naftali Bennett’s autonomy and citizenship, to Lapid’s hyperbolic economic peace, high walls and no splitting of Jerusalem. This leaves very little chance for change in the future.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Secondly, topography and geography remain the only static factor in the strategic debate about peace with the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Judea and Samaria - the West Bank of the Jordan river - are a mountain ridge. Those mountains create a strategic depth that Israel requires in order to safeguard its civilians. In the shadows of the West Bank’s hills, between Haifa and Ashkelon, lies 70 percent of Israel’s population and 80 percent of Israel’s industry, including power stations, offshore gas rigs, and Ben-Gurion International Airport. Anybody who controls that mountainous area controls everything beneath it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With all the regional turmoil, with Iranian leaders calling Israel a cancerous tumor in the region and eyeing Jordan as its next playground for Middle East upheaval, can any Israeli leadership relinquish security control over such a strategic asset?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Finally, trust. The failures of the Oslo process, the ongoing settlement activities, the repeated wars with Gaza and the political animosity leave both Israelis and Palestinians in a deep state of mistrust. This constantly deepens the current stagnation.The U.S. cutbacks to USAID’s staff and funding&nbsp;&nbsp;- which may lead to the agency’s complete collapse, according to recent reports - will undermine stability even further.</p> \n<p>For the Jewish state to have a real future, and to prevent a slide into a one-state future, these challenges must be addressed - and sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trust must be built with the help of international partners - NGOs like USAID, state actors like Egypt and Jordan - and maybe that's where Saudi Arabia fits into the puzzle. Alliances must be built.</p> \n<p>Confidence in a process to be rekindled and for Israel to extend that hand of peace and good neighborliness towards the common good of the region that its Declaration of Independence first offered.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Technology and safety measures must be devised to safeguard the strategic depth that a two state solution would require for Israel’s security.</p> \n<p>The next generation of pragmatic leadership on both sides must be cultivated – on both sides.</p> \n<p>We must look at the issues with open but realistic and practical eyes. We have to explore a path for Israel that recognizes our Jewish heritage here – but also admits that insisting on a &quot;Jerusalem eternally united&quot; under sole Israeli sovereignty, and maintaining the Jewish settlement in the heart of Hebron, may well mean we end up a minority in a one-state Holy Land. And we know what happens to minorities in the Middle East.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All of these are long processes and they must be accepted as such. There’s much work to do both for Israelis and Palestinians. There are no instant solutions at hand, and easy, self-righteous slogans won’t help.</p> \n<p>So stop shouting, &quot;End the occupation!&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lieutenant Colonel (ret.)

According to Human Rights Watch, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have authorities that “have established machineries of repression to crush dissent, including the use of torture.” Abuses in Fatah’s West Bank and the Hamas controlled Gaza include arbitrary arrests and long detentions for peaceful criticism of the authorities. There’s no accountability for the authorities’ actions and there’s no freedom of speech.</p> \n<p>The rabbi focused on the U.S. and Israeli governments as the hindrance to Palestinian freedom. Yet according to the Human Rights Watch report the detention and torture of critics and rivals by the Palestinians’ own government undermine the promise of greater freedom for its own people. Perhaps the rabbi needs to take a step back and get real. There’s no comparison between the life he leads and the Palestinians who are victimized by their government on a daily basis. It’s time to put the responsibility for peace where it belongs – with the Palestinian leadership. Perhaps when they care more about the welfare of their citizens instead of destroying Israel, peace may be a reality.</p> \n<p>Elinor Weiss</p> \n<p>East Amherst, NY</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Despite their protests, Rabbi Bronstein, his Encounter fellow travelers and the Palestinians all have been “heard,” loudly and incessantly. What really rankles is that they haven’t been heeded. Not surprising, since they even deplore the growing rapprochement with Israel on the part of once seemingly impossible Arab states.</p> \n<p>Israelis regularly hear Palestinian media incitement against them. Gaza-border communities endlessly endure constant violent threats and acts. Even as Israel daily supplies humanitarian goods to Gaza, its subjects remain trapped in a bitter Fatah-Hamas political power struggle.</p> \n<p>What Israelis never hear, though, are any calls for peace. If the status quo is really so terrible, why won’t the Palestinians seriously negotiate a change? Because they continue to refuse to recognize the legitimacy of a Jewish state in its historic homeland. That’s been their century-long trumpeted message, one far too deafeningly loud to miss.</p> \n<p>Richard D. Wilkins</p> \n<p>New York</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rabbi Bronstein says he knows what it feels like to go unheard. Perhaps he has been heard but has been found lacking, and perhaps he does not listen to others.</p> \n<p>Although his remarks are not polished, President Trump is a supporter of immigration that abides by long-established legal process, and to state otherwise is false and unfair. Immigration has always involved culturally becoming an American, which is why it takes time and why candidates need to be carefully considered.</p> \n<p>The Palestinians are “silenced”? Encounter needs to visit the Israeli-Gaza border. No silence there.</p> \n<p>And Encounter might wish to familiarize its participants with Mr. Abbas’ restrictions on freedom of expression. Haaretz reported “Decree approved by Palestinian president provides for prison terms of up to life for using digital means to harm ‘national unity’ or ‘social fabric.’” The Palestinian Authority does not hear – does not even want to hear – Palestinians, if they are critical of its “river-to-the-sea” incitement.</p> \n<p>Julia Lutch</p> \n<p>Davis, CA</p> \n<p>Creeping gender segregation</p> \n<p>This completely unacceptable phenomenon of creeping gender segregation is getting way out of hand.</p> \n<p>It further reinforces the specter of the secular community in this country being forced to bend over backwards to accommodate the ultra-Orthodox. In Western countries, any form of gender discrimination is patently illegal, and must be made so in this country as well.</p> \n<p>The current governing coalition is completely in the pocket of the Haredim, and are perpetually subject to the extreme level of extortion that they must endure to keep this coalition intact. Is is really worth it? Who is the beneficiary of this conduct? Are we?</p> \n<p>Of course, the only answer is an immediate change of government. And soon.</p> \n<p>There is a ray of hope. And that is retired General Benny Gantz. The day he assumes residency on Balfour Street in Jerusalem is the day that things begin to change for the better in Israel. No more corruption, no more ordering expensive gourmet dinners from exclusive Jerusalem restaurants to the tune of 360,000 shekels ($100,000) and then hiding the fact that there was actually a cook on the premises, no more cases of expensive pink champagne, no more expensive Cuban cigars, no more helping cronies with financially beneficial legislation, and the list goes on. Elections now.</p> \n<p>Ashdot Yacov</p> \n<p>Yes, Muslims can befriend Christians and Jews</p> \n<p>Critics of Muslims never cease to amaze me. Quite often they say the most bizarre things. Here are some examples:</p> \n<p>“Allah is not God,” “Muslims hate dogs,” “Muslims are not allowed to have friends who are Christians and Jews.”</p> \n<p>They cite this verse from the Koran (5:52): “O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for guardians. They are protectors of one another. And whoever among you takes them for guardians is indeed one of them. Verily, Allah guides not the unjust people.”</p> \n<p>The Arabic word wali means guardian or protector, not friend. The two terms are not interchangeable.</p> \n<p>According to the Koran, Christians and Jews are different in their beliefs from Muslims, so one’s allegiance should be to Muslims. There is no restriction on having friends who are Christian or Jews, and that is not what the verse in the Koran meant or implied. The Koran forbids Muslims (5:23) from taking their fathers, sons, wives or any member of their tribe as “guardians” if they are not Muslims.</p> \n<p>Whenever you are in doubt about anything regarding Islam, pick up a book about Islam, or contact AskAMuslim.com. No question is a dumb question but to argue that Muslims are not allowed to be friends with Christians and Jews is utterly insane.</p> \n<p>Mahmoud El-Yousseph</p> \n<p>Westerville, Ohio</p>",

        "text":["<p>Throughout nine months and some 17 operations in the surgical department of the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital, journalist Philippe Lan&ccedil;on did not think once about the Kouachi brothers, the terrorists who attacked the offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine, where he was a columnist. In the January 7, 2015 attack, in which 12 people were killed, including eight of Lan&ccedil;on’s colleagues, he was critically wounded after bullets riddled his right arm and shattered his jaw.</p> \n<p>While in the hospital, in Paris’ 13th arrondissement, Lan&ccedil;on learned about new techniques involving the implanting of soft tissues, including blood vessels and nerves, from his “good angel” – Chlo&eacute;, who performed most of his surgery. She also spent hours explaining things, encouraging Lan&ccedil;on while setting limits to his demands and to the dependence he was developing on her.</p> \n<p>To replace Lan&ccedil;on’s splintered lower jawbone, part of the fibula bone was taken from his leg. A pouch of soft tissue, removed from his back, was sutured to the bone and implanted in his face. A long process then began, including rejection of the transplant, repeated surgery, a gradual stretching of part of his (hairy) chest skin over the area of the jaw, a restructuring of internal tissues and gums, and eventually implantation of teeth.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;Three years after Charlie Hebdo, global terrorism is greater threat than ever</p> \n<p>The journey into the journalist’s body and soul – a painful, frustrating and despairing process – but also into how he rebuilt and returned to life, is described in Lan&ccedil;on’s recently published book, “Le Lambeau” (lit., “the shred”; published by Gallimard). The 500-page book, released in April, has just won the prestigious French Prix Femina literary award. To date it has sold about 250,000 copies in France and it is being translated into seven languages.</p> \n<p>It’s a wonderful book – a thriller, an epos of death and resurrection, of pain, mercy and love of all kinds. It is also – a rare occurrence – a paean to medical professionals of all echelons at the two institutions in which Lan&ccedil;on was hospitalized (the second being the Hotel des Invalides military hospital).</p> \n<p>“Le Lambeau” is written with candor and acuity, and is almost unbearable to read. The author presents hell incarnate: the attack, which lasted only three-and-a-half minutes; his friends lying around him, touching each other as if in a danse macabre; the brains of his close friend Bernard Marie, spilling out over Lan&ccedil;on’s lap after he’d just finished a conversation with him; the fact that his questions to the emergency responders who rescued him went unanswered – he didn’t realize that couldn’t be understood since his lower jaw had been destroyed. All this is like a punch to our gut.</p> \n<p>Writes Lan&ccedil;on: “At that moment I wondered: Was I going to survive? Return from the dead? Where was life, where was death? What was left of me? I didn’t think about these things from the outside, as if they were a subject of discussion: I lived them. They were around me, on the floor and inside me, real like a piece of wood or a hole in the floor, waves of unidentified pain washed over me and I didn’t know what to do with them. I still don’t know...”</p> \n<p>‘A dense fog’</p> \n<p>Today Lan&ccedil;on is a journalist and literary critic at the daily Lib&eacute;ration, and gives few interviews. He made his first public appearance after the attack only after receiving the award earlier this month. Our interview took place via email.</p> \n<p>In one interview you said that right after the attack, you were in somewhat of a dense fog, which you wanted to dissipate and probe by means of the act of writing. At which point in your recovery did you start writing “Le Lambeau”?</p> \n<p>“I wrote a few segments in New York, in February 2016, a year after the attack. I stopped right away since I felt it was still too raw. I started writing again in the summer of 2016, while staying with friends in Provence, and stopped again, feeling it was still too early. And yet, at the same time I wrote the first version of my portrayal of my surgeon, Chlo&eacute;. But I still hadn’t found the right tone.”</p> \n<p>“By ‘too early’ I mean I wasn’t yet ready to delve into the events I’d experienced, using my memories. I wrote the book between June 2017 and January 2018, first in England and later in Rome, at the Villa Medici [a branch of the French Academy in Rome, that offers annual stipends to French artists]. Actually, at that location, thanks to its tranquil atmosphere, I wrote most of the book. Apparently I needed to be far away from the city and hospitals where everything had taken place.”</p> \n<p>Do the scenes, noises and smells of that day in January 2015 come back to you frequently?</p> \n<p>“That has stopped over the last year. I have complicated dreams, which could be interpreted as relating to the attack, but no dream directly reconstructs it or parts of it. The emotions associated with the attack completely disappeared when I started actually writing the book, and I wrote about them as they came up. Writing was like extinguishing, one by one, the black candles I had lit.”</p> \n<p>In his book, Lan&ccedil;on describes how he cut himself off from current events, from TV, radio and newspapers, during his lengthy recovery. He didn’t want to hear anything about the fate of the terrorists, Sa&iuml;d and Ch&eacute;rif Kouachi, or about Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who killed four Jews during an attack at Hypercacher kosher supermarket in Paris, the day after the killings at Charlie Hebdo.</p> \n<p>Almost four years have passed since the attack and you still avoid exposure to current events. Are you not interested in what’s happening around you?</p> \n<p>“It’s hard for me to take interest in current events, it upsets me, it concerns me. The truth is that it’s increasingly terrible – it doesn’t add anything for me. These are events that don’t teach me anything, as far as I can tell.”</p> \n<p>Why did you choose – particularly before going into surgery – the heartbreaking chapter in which Proust describes the death of his grandmother in the first volume of “Remembrance of Things Past,” Kafka’s “Letters to Milena,” and “The Magic Mountain” by Thomas Mann as your reading material?</p> \n<p>“I don’t really know. Two of the books were chosen instinctively, by a man hovering between two worlds, without the ability to talk, covered in tubes, in a small hospital room: These were Proust and Thomas Mann. The first, since I was always reading it, the second because I wanted to read it. I read about the grandmother’s death before going into my third or fourth operation, I can’t remember when. ... The text was so powerful that it didn’t leave me. With regard to ‘The Magic Mountain,’ I kept reading the first pages where [the protagonist] Hans Castorp arrives at the sanatorium in Davos and settles in, perhaps because I too was now settling in for a long time in a world that was different than the world of the healthy, in the world of the unwell. In contrast, Kafka was there by chance. A friend brought me ‘Milena.’”</p> \n<p>By chance?</p> \n<p>“This friend knows me well, she’s my boss in the literary section at Lib&eacute;ration. You should ask her why she chose that book, but she was right. I was never without the book after that; it was the only book that was with me in the operating room, under the sheets, like samizdat underground literature. Kafka leaves no hope but he presents the wisdom of despair and the infinite spaces of regret. His genius is filled with irony and modesty.”</p> \n<p>What’s changed for you in the four years that have passed since the shooting? Have you been able to understand this act of pure cruelty?</p> \n<p>“My face has changed. My daily routine has changed, as has my professional standing. My social life has changed, my diet has changed a little. My attitude to everyday life, to my friends and colleagues, even to my memories, has changed. My personality hasn’t changed, either for better or for worse. Some habits haven’t changed, such as running regularly or walking frequently, especially since that helps my rehabilitation.”</p> \n<p>“I understand the motives of the Kouachi brothers and other terrorists – we’ve been showered with explanations – but they seem so foolish that I find no interest in them. Stupidity plays a major role in the use of violence and I think that isn’t talked about much, maybe because there’s nothing to say about it. Maybe by talking about the stupidity of others you run the risk of appearing arrogant. This is a risk that few people in the media are willing to take, in a world in which one should show more modesty.”</p> \n<p>Do you harbor any hatred?</p> \n<p>“Not at all.”</p> \n<p>Do you feel you’ve managed [in your book] to let people who didn’t experience it understand the horror?</p> \n<p>“I don’t know if I did, but in the chapter devoted to the shooting and in the one devoted to the sea anemone [where he recalls his friend’s brain spilling out], I tried to give the reader a feeling and an understanding of the horror I felt in a very intimate way. I want these moments to be understood as I lived them, as a terrible and fantastical journey.”</p> \n<p>“Le Lambeau” is a wonderful book, which carries some hope with it. Did you know this while you were writing it?</p> \n<p>“No. I didn’t want to convey any message or good news. I wanted to tell the story in the most accurate way possible, the story of a person who was the victim of a terror attack, this particular one. I wanted it to be read as an internal journey and as an adventure at the same time. At each stage of the work I asked myself the same question: Is this exactly what happened to you? Is this what you lived through, what you felt, what you remember? Did I go deep enough? Is that the way this should be written? When I had doubts regarding events, scenes or the writing itself, I addressed the question to the reader, which raised another question: Is this how one should express doubt? Should it be included in the story? Is it too much?”</p> \n<p>“Now I see in the many letters I receive – mainly from sick, hospitalized people, older people who are suffering, but also from others – that the book offers some hope. Obviously, this gladdens me. How can I define this hope? In my opinion, life is stronger than those who try to destroy it, and it unites us. One must find hope within oneself even when we’re at rock bottom, because it’s always there. I agree this isn’t high-end philosophy but I’m not a philosopher. I’m a journalist and author, two situations that aren’t contradictory, but feed on each other.”</p> \n<p>The book ends in New York, on Friday, November 13, 2015, when, while sitting at a caf&eacute; in Manhattan, Lan&ccedil;on hears about the shooting at the Bataclan club and surrounding cafes near Place Republique in Paris. Hope dies last.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The murder of 12-year-old Silvana Tsegai in south Tel Aviv has shaken up the Eritrean asylum-seeker community in Israel, but it is far from the first case of a woman being murdered in that community. In November 2010, a 30-year-old pregnant woman was murdered by her partner. In July 2012, 18-year-old Natznet Michael was murdered by her Eritrean partner and in September 2015, a 29-year-old woman was murdered by her 33-year-old partner, Dasbella Havos.</p> \n<p>The asylum-seeker community in Israel is in a state of crisis and its women and teenage girls are paying an increasingly heavy price. Women are a minority among the refugees – there are only 7,000 female asylum seekers in Israel. Thirty percent of these were victims of abuse and torture in the Sinai desert, and many of them have suffered sexual harassment at work but don’t report it. Without access to the police and out of fear of how the authorities will relate to them, these women and girls don’t report the domestic violence they suffer. The handful who do report it do not get protection from the police and say that their partners ignore restraining orders fearlessly. Battered women’s shelters are not set up to accept asylum seekers, even as the demand increases.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Why the murder of a 12-year old in south Tel Aviv comes as no surprise</p> \n<p>In December 2012 I interviewed Sanait Kidana, the founder of the Eritrean Women’s Community Center. Kidana has since emigrated to a Western country. We met following the murder of six Eritrean women by partners or family members between 2010 and 2012.</p> \n<p>“I couldn't listen to any more stories about murdered women, domestic violence, threats and harassment,” Kidana said, explaining why she had set up the center, which provides women with vocational training, family counseling and enrichment programs. “No official Israeli institution keeps records but we are overwhelmed by women coming to us for help. I estimate that 70 percent of the women in the Eritrean community suffer from violence - from being locked up at home to economic, sexual, verbal and physical violence.” Her successor at the center confirms that these problems persist today.</p> \n<p>The controversial law requiring asylum seekers working in Israel to deposit 20 percent of their salaries into a closed account they can only access when they leave the country forced many asylum seekers into poverty and pushed many women into prostitution. Only a month ago it was decided to exclude women from this law, but the damage had already been done.</p> \n<p>The scope of the prostitution was documented in a recent government report commissioned by the Social Affairs Ministry, the Health Ministry, and the interministerial anti-trafficking coordinator. An investigative report by Haaretz on the increasing number of asylum seekers forced into prostitution is now part of the government documentation. In 2014, aid organizations found that some 40 asylum seekers were caught up in the cycle of prostitution, while today there are 400 documented cases. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Despite the understanding of their situation, there is no rehabilitation available to these asylum-seeker women. Human rights in Israel are for Jewish women only.</p> \n<p>Asylum seekers in Israel are subjected to systematic institutional abuse aimed at breaking their spirit. Israel could have absorbed the members of the community with dignity, enabled them to integrate, provided basic social benefits and respectful access to welfare, education and health institutions. The government’s decision to play with the feelings of an entire population is leaving its signs on the most vulnerable among them – the women.</p> \n<p>“The murder of the girl [Tsegai] by the mother’s partner is a sad and shocking case; we condemn all violence in our community and hope that the murderer will be caught today,” says Eden Tesfamariam, the new director of the Eritrean Women’s Community Center. “That sweet girl was magic, she was always friendly and was always happy and optimistic. This is a great loss for all of us.”</p> \n<p>“Life in Israel is not easy for us,” says Tesfamariam. “We suffered a great deal during the journey and here in Israel. Because we were not accepted as refugees, we were left to cope alone. Many of the men who came to Israel experienced many traumas and never underwent any rehabilitation process, and if that weren’t enough, the government has exerted heavy pressure on us from the moment we arrived and did everything in its power to make us feel undesirable, with laws that restrict our freedom, that sink us into poverty with the deposit law. There is a great deal of frustration at the lack of an orderly policy regarding our asylum requests.&quot;</p> \n<p>“Unfortunately, more than a few men turn to alcohol, which in many cases leads to violence, and the first ones hurt are us women, who must cope with all this at home. Many times we are left with nowhere to turn and are forced to again cope alone. Please stop exerting this pressure on us and instead institute an orderly policy so that we can make use of our rights as women, so that we can get proper solutions in the realms of welfare and health, to prevent other painful cases like this one,” she said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The radical left also has an obsession: The occupation. No obsession is more justified since the occupation by nature is an obsessive phenomenon.</p> \n<p>In contrast to other obsessions, those of the Zionist left, for example, being obsessed with the occupation is not a matter of running away from the core problem – it’s a matter of dealing with it. When talking about such a fateful issue – no other one is as fateful for the State of Israel in the most profound sense – one cannot be anything but obsessive.</p> \n<p>Moreover, being obsessive is required in light of the repression of this issue by society, the media and the political system in this country. Everything is discussed here except the occupation. Thus, when talking about such a decisive matter, from which nearly everyone flees as if from fire, there is no option but to become obsessive.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; It's not so simple for Israel to just 'end the occupation' | Opinion ■ Israeli capriciousness as I witnessed it at the Bethlehem checkpoint | Anonymous Opinion ■ Blaming Netanyahu is no solution to the Zionist Left's occupation complex | Opinion</p> \n<p>Like every obsession, it’s annoying. Unlike other annoyances, the ones relating to the occupation are almost the last signs of life of a society that’s in the throes of moral dissolution, living in extreme denial. Few societies are lying themselves to death as this one is.</p> \n<p>But make no mistake: Before anything else, the direct and most pitiful victims of the occupation are the Palestinians, not Israelis. Left-wing Zionists take no interest in their fate. If they reach out to address the fire, it’s always tainted with the permanent sentiments of self-victimization held by Israelis: Look at what the occupation has done to us, how it’s corrupted us; one needs to end it since we want to live in a Jewish state; in the end it will blow up in our faces.</p> \n<p>We, us, ours. The occupation is obviously causing us harm as well, but we’re not its primary victims. There’s an obligation to identify with the suffering of the Palestinians, and along with solidarity one needs to recognize the blame borne by Israelis, all of us. The international left can make do with expressing its identification with the victims, a basic human response, but the left in Israel must also take direct responsibility for the occupation, a responsibility each one of us bears by virtue of being Israeli.</p> \n<p>But the Israeli left isn’t giving this its attention. It’s avoiding dealing with responsibility for events in 1948 and in 1967. It feels no guilt for what we’ve been doing for the last 100 years and last 50 years. Feelings of guilt are for the weak, not for left-wing Zionists, and certainly not for the right side of the spectrum.</p> \n<p>But how can one be a conscientious Israeli and not bow one’s head before the Palestinian people? How can one not admit guilt? Not take responsibility? What Israel has been doing to Palestinians from the dawn of Zionism to this day, incessantly, is one of the greatest abuses in history. Anyone not recognizing this – and that includes most Israelis – apparently has no conscience.</p> \n<p>Leaving aside pangs of conscience, dealing with the occupation should be occupying center stage in Israeli discourse due to its crucial impact on our daily lives and on the image of this country. Nothing defines Israel today more than the occupation, despite the achievements in developing cherry tomatoes and in the cyber world. Left-wing Zionists are trying to combat the symptoms without attacking the root cause of the disease. They deal with metastases, not the primary tumor.</p> \n<p>The majority of the ultra-nationalist legislation of this government is aimed at consolidating and perpetuating the occupation. This applies to the culture loyalty law and the nation-state law, the Nakba law and citizenship laws, the reckless campaign against the BDS movement, the thought police at Ben-Gurion Airport, and the campaign against left-wing organizations and even against the Supreme Court – all for the purpose of entrenching the occupation and uprooting remaining pockets of resistance while laying the legal groundwork for it.</p> \n<p>In the absence of the occupation, all these laws would be redundant. The right has won de facto, with the settlements, and it now wants a de jure victory as well. The Zionist left understands the harm in these moves and tries to oppose them. If it attains power it will shake off most of these laws, but it is not seriously planning on ending the occupation. Without this, treating metastases is hopeless. If you destroy one, another will appear.</p> \n<p>Yes, the occupation is a nuisance and dealing with it no less so. But how can one not be obsessive about it?</p>",

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – It's not new to wander around Manhattan, hear lots of Hebrew and get the impression that Israel, in particular the State of Tel Aviv, has moved here. In fact, I wrote about this phenomenon two years ago, and since then the flow of Israelis has only intensified.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One could easily have thought it was just another colorful bash in some Tel Aviv club, when some 600 costumed Israelis crowded into Chelsea Market’s Miznon, the year-old local branch of the popular global chain launched by Israeli celebrity chef Eyal Shani, to celebrate&nbsp;Halloween.</p> \n<p>The revelers spilled out into the rest of the trendy market and virtually all of them seemed to be speaking loud Hebrew. Hebrew could also be heard from the loudspeakers, courtesy of Israeli DJ Omri Anghel, who is known for the funny Hebrew video clips he produces in New York.</p> \n<p>The party was organized by Israeli companies: Ran Harnevo’s startup Homeis; SOSA, CEO Guy Franklin’s innovation hub for Israeli tech companies; and the LeumiTech banking firm, which put up the money.</p> \n<p>Another event on the Israeli cultural, business and social calendar, which took place just a few weeks ago, was an unforgettable encounter organized by Hahaverim Shel Dikla (Dikla’s Friends). Dikla is Israeli entrepreneur and marketing/branding consultant Dikla Goldstein Malamud, organizer of business and social events in Israel and New York.</p> \n<p>This one took place in a lovely building on the Lower East Side, designed by Israeli architect Eran Chen and constructed by Dvir Cohen Hoshen, owner of the Adam America real estate development firm. A tour of the penthouse overlooking the southern part of Manhattan was followed by a $150-a-plate dinner prepared by Tomer Avital, the (excellent) chef from the recently closed Balaboosta restaurant, founded by Einat Admony.</p> \n<p>The evening – part networking, part social gathering – was conducted in Hebrew and featured a keynote address by Noam Bardin, the CEO of Waze, who had moved to New York a few months earlier after he got fed up with suburban life in Silicon Valley. The second speaker was Oded Grinstein, who established a nonprofit called My Child's Cancer to help parents of sick children to find the right medical care, after his own daughter recovered from cancer.</p> \n<p>A week before the Dikla event I went to a fund-raiser for Shanti House, an Israeli nonprofit that helps homeless and runaway youths. Mariuma Ben Yosef, Shanti’s CEO, had come from Israel for the event, which was financed by Sam Ben-Avraham, an Israeli-American businessman involved in fashion and real estate. The emcees were Guri Alfi, who has moved to Los Angeles, and former model Adi Neumann, sister of Adam Neumann, cofounder of WeWork.</p> \n<p>Plenty of Israelis were in evidence there, too, among them model and designer Neta Alchimister, who had flown in especially for the event. Overseeing the dinner menu was chef Assaf Granit, who had arrived from London, where he had just opened his third restaurant (he is now planning to open a second eatery in Paris). With him came chef Eliezer Mizrahi from Machneyuda and Elior Ben Harush from Hasadna, both well-known Jerusalem eateries. Granit is planning to open a restaurant in New York in 2019 or 2020, and is confident he will find a location, and investors, in short order.</p> \n<p>Food and more</p> \n<p>In any case, these days one can easily live a full Israeli life in the Big Apple. At the Holyland Market at St. Marks Place, you can find many food products from the Holy Land. Hebrew is taught at a host of schools, among them the Abraham Joshua Heschel School, a pluralistic Jewish day school. The Reform movement's Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in midtown encourages Israelis to join, and offers services and activities in Hebrew as part of a program called Chofshi in Manhattan.</p> \n<p>You can send your kids to Israel Scouts (aka Tzofim) activities, and if you need summer camp, Kimama is also here. There are online forums for Israeli businesswomen, for Israeli women involved in cinema and other industries, and for Israeli moms in New York. Hebrew-language tours of local galleries are run by Maya Yedid and Tal Barel. If you zap through local television channels you’ll see Michal Divon, who used to appear on i24 News in Israel and now hosts a show on New York’s Channel 12, focusing news from the Bronx and Brooklyn.</p> \n<p>How many Israelis live in the United States, and in New York in particular? That’s not an easy question to answer. Shoham Nicolet, CEO of the Israeli-American Council, which has branches around the United States, estimates the number to be between 600,000 to 800,000. There are others who say that figure is closer to a million; some say it is much lower. An estimated 150,000 Israelis are said to live in New York City alone.</p> \n<p>Hot high-tech</p> \n<p>Still, the hottest Israel-New York story today is undoubtedly high-tech. Manhattan boasts around 400 companies or start-ups that are either Israeli or headed by Israelis, and the number keeps growing. In 2007 there were only seven or eight such companies here. Just a few weeks ago, Jerusalem Venture Partners and SOSA each won tenders to establish global cyber security-related ventures in the city. About 1,000 people attended the hastily planned JVP's celebration in SoHo, half of them Israelis.</p> \n<p>The following day SOSA also had an event, albeit smaller, “for the select few only,” at the W Hotel near Union Square, attended by senior municipal officials. One of the main speakers was Nadav Zafrir, a former commander of Israel Defense Forces’ intelligence Unit 8200, who has relocated to New York to run Team8, a think tank and company-creation platform that he founded. Among the wave of Israeli high-tech experts who have been flooding the city, Zafrir is a star, but he is only one of many alumni from the same prestigious unit in the city, perhaps numbering in the hundreds, who meet periodically to network and feel a bit of home.</p> \n<p>That same evening Shiboleth LLP, a law firm that has been working with SOSA for many years, hosted its own event, which included a reality-TV-style competition between high-tech firms. Zafrir addressed this event as well.</p> \n<p>Notable Israeli high-tech-in-Manhattan success stories include Adam Singolda’s Taboola, which has around 1,000 employees, and its competitor, Outbrain, founded by Yaron Galai. The newest headline-maker in these circles is former musician Yoni Bloch, who together with Barak Feldman founded Eko, which creates interactive advertisements in which viewers can &quot;control&quot; the story. Retailing giant Walmart has invested $250 million in Eko as part of its tough battle against internet retailer Amazon – an amazing achievement for the Israeli-run firm.</p> \n<p>Another rising-star company here is Talkspace, an online therapy platform founded by Oren and Roni Frank, which Time magazine included in its list of 50 top companies in the health field.</p> \n<p>But without a doubt, the biggest achievement in this realm is WeWork, which now has a market cap of around $20 billion. The company, founded in 2008 by Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey in New York, whose shared workspaces can be seen around the world, is considered one of the most successful startups of this decade. Many are wondering if it has grown too fast and if the bubble is going to break, but the fact is that WeWork is continuing to expand. The Japanese company Softbank Corp. is now considering a $15 billion to $20 billion investment in the firm.</p> \n<p>Beyond the high-tech realm, and outside of New York, there are many areas of American life that have ties to Israel. For example, next weekend the Israeli-American Council, which was founded in 2007 and &quot;serves and represents&quot; some quarter-million Israelis living in the country, will hold its fifth conference in south Florida, to be attended by 3,000 people, including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence.</p> \n<p>The IAC’s establishment is an interesting story. For years, most of the people it caters to avoided Israeli-oriented activities and events. But IAC now has 20 branches across the United States, and its conference will be attended Israeli personalities from across the spectrum, including author Meir Shalev; Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked; Jewish Agency Chairman Isaac Herzog; Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein; Israel Prize winner Miriam Peretz; MK Nachman Shai (Zionist Union); Sheldon and Miriam Edelson (the IAC's biggest donors), etc. Singer Yehuda Poliker will be performing.</p> \n<p>Who would have dreamed that so many Israeli notables would come to a conference of yordim? The truth is, almost no one uses that pejorative term for Israelis who leave their homeland anymore. If in the past such individuals would squirm when they were referred to that way, now they hold their heads high. It appears that being an Israeli immigrant in the United States has become totally legitimate.</p>",

        "text":["<p>As I read the news about the unprecedented visit by the president of Chad, Idriss Deby, to Israel, I ended up arguing with myself.</p> \n<p>Should I praise this historic visit? Or allow my skepticism free rein? My skepticism was rooted in two concerns: Would they discuss the &quot;voluntary&quot; deportation of African refugees from Israel? And was it a step to Netanyahu meeting the war criminal president Omar al-Bashir of Sudan?</p> \n<p>I am an advocate of the expansion of relations between Africa and Israel. I welcome relations based on mutual interests and respect of human rights and dignity.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Will International Political Tension Break Israel's Warming Relations With Africa?&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel Working to Establish Diplomatic Ties With Sudan, Bahrain</p> \n<p>I often argue that Israel needs to absorb its African refugees and asylum seekers because one day, they will be key leaders in Africa. Israel would then find no better allies than the currently unwelcome African refugees and asylum seekers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, so far, this hasn’t been the case. Netanyahu has continuously denied African refugees and asylum seekers any chance to remain in Israel with dignity and rights.</p> \n<p>I believe these formal visits are important and necessary both for Israel and African countries for their mutual benefit. Africa is in need of Israel’s advanced technology, cyber security and agriculture. And Israel needs Africa’s natural resources.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But my fear is: If Israel’s Netanyahu can meet with Chad’s Deby, then the next African leader Netanyahu will meet with will be Omar al-Bashir, the president of Sudan, subject of an international arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I worry that the fast pace of normalizing relations with Chad are a clear harbinger of a similar dynamic with Sudan. After all, both are led by repellent despots with abundant blood on their hands.</p> \n<p>Presidents Deby and al-Bashir have so much in common.</p> \n<p>Both presidents are career military officers who assumed via a military coup. They came to power around the same time; Omar al-Bashir was proclaimed as president in 1989, Deby in 1991. Both have survived attempts to overthrow them. Deby &quot;won&quot; his fourth consecutive presidential election in 2011; al-Bashir &quot;won&quot; his second in 2015 and is now he is running for his third in elections due in 2020, even though Sudan’s 2005 transitional constitution limits any president to two terms only.</p> \n<p>Amnesty International’s report of 2013 accused Chad’s Deby for violently oppressing his opponents as well as grave violations of human rights. Al-Bashir, as it better known, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for genocide charges, war crimes and crimes against humanity for atrocities he directed committed in Darfur.</p> \n<p>Both Deby and al-Bashir have a propensity to get actively involved in proxy wars; Deby intervened in Central African Republic and Mali to &quot;fight terrorism&quot; and al-Bashir has actively intervened on behalf Saudi Arabia in Yemen in the name of &quot;fighting terrorism.&quot; What an irony, that a president who himself is a war criminal and a terrorist, intervening in other countries using the moral justification of &quot;saving lives.&quot;</p> \n<p>In Yemen, Sudan is now complicit in one of the worse human catastrophes of our time where more than 85,000 people are expected to die through conflict-fuelled starvation. It is exact the same kind of man-made disaster with which Sudan’s president has experience; he used the same tactics, starvation as a weapon, against his own civilians in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Deby and al-Bashir maintain very strong ties, even though the two went through a period of mutual hostility in the&nbsp;&nbsp;early 2000s.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 2012, Deby married the daughter of Musa Hilal, a leader of the Janjaweed militia who’s also wanted by ICC on the same charge sheet as al-Bashir. Musa Hilal is notorious for having called for &quot;changing the racial identity of Darfur,&quot; meaning ethnic cleansing through genocide.</p> \n<p>Now, the two presidents are coordinating their efforts to dismantle the refugee and displaced people’s camps in Chad and Sudan, in order to remove the minimal protection those camps offer their inhabitants.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The only difference I see between Deby and al-Bashir is that al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court, and Deby is yet to receive an ICC warrant.</p> \n<p>When Deby fled to Darfur in 1989, accused of plotting against his predecessor Hissien Habre (currently serving a life sentence for war crimes), he sought&nbsp;asylum - and the people of Darfur offered him shelter.</p> \n<p>But there’s no honor among tyrants: Deby has since thrown mud in the face of the Darfuri struggle, and his wholehearted support for al-Bashir, genocidaire of Darfur, is offensive and unforgivable.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I am absolutely for the reestablishing relations between Israel and Sudan - but not with Bashir’s genocidal regime. But bearing in mind Netanyahu didn’t flinch at all when he shook Deby’s hand, and bearing in mind Netanyahu’s own domestic political necessity to showcase foreign policy achievements, it’s all too easy to imagine smiles and handshakes between Netanyahu and al-Bashir.</p> \n<p>That moment will be a cruel disappointment for the victims of genocide in Sudan. And it’s a cruel doubling down on Netanyahu’s determination not to countenance the continued presence of survivors of al-Bashir’s genocide in Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Mutasim Ali the is the Public Relations Officer at the African Student Organization in Israel.

        "text":["<p>Democratic House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi&nbsp;won Wednesday the Democratic nomination to&nbsp;become Speaker of the House again after putting down a revolt against her leadership bid. She will now face a full House floor vote in January to secure the speakership.</p> \n<p>House Democrats swept back into power after the 2018 midterm elections with a forty seat gain on Republicans, winning the largest percentage of the popular vote since Watergate in 1974. Pelosi still must secure the 218 votes to become the leader, which will make her again the most powerful woman in U.S. politics - putting her in control of the House’s legislative agenda.</p> \n<p>During the campaign many observers argued that a wave of anti-Israel Democrats - from Rashid Tlaib to Omar Ilhan to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - were poised to turn the party away from Israel. But with Pelosi and other senior Democrats poised to lead key committees, the chamber’s pro-Israel stance appears unlikely to drastically change.</p> \n<p>For example, Eliot Engel, 71, from New York, is set to become the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and has already declared a strong desire to conduct oversight of Trump's foreign policy after what he has described as “two years of congressional neglect.”</p> \n<p>Engel is likely to pursue Democratic initiatives to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 U.S. election and work toward sanctioning Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but when it comes to Israel, Engel is to the right of the party.</p> \n<p>Engel backed Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, and opposed Obama’s landmark nuclear agreement with Iran from which Trump withdrew in May.</p> \n<p>Pelosi has also held staunchly pro-Israel views that have at times even out flanked the GOP from the right.</p> \n<p>In 2005, while addressing AIPAC, Pelosi had waxed poetic about her personal experiences in Israel and how they shaped her views: “This spring, I was in Israel as part of a congressional trip that also took us to Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq. One of the most powerful experiences was taking a helicopter toward Gaza, over the path of the security fence. We set down in a field that belonged to a local kibbutz. It was a cool but sunny day, and the field was starting to bloom with mustard. Mustard is a crop that grows in California, and it felt at that moment as if I were home.”</p> \n<p>Pelosi, who was the 52nd Speaker of the House, previously served from 2007 to 2011 in the position which coincided with the 2008-2009 Israel-Gaza war known as Operation Cast Lead. In 2009, Pelosi sponsored a resolution that passed the House by a 390-5 majority blaming the Palestinian side for the violence and reaffirming U.S. support for Israel and a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> \n<p>The resolution quoted then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who said in 2008, “We strongly condemn the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and hold Hamas responsible for breaking the cease-fire and for the renewal of violence there.”</p> \n<p>Stephen Zunes, author and professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of San Francisco, pointed out at the time that the language in the House decision was even to the right of the Bush administration, which supported the UN Security Council resolution condemning “all acts of violence and terror directed against civilians” - the congressional resolution only condemns the violence and terror of Hamas.</p> \n<p>Pelosi’s resolution also called for “the immediate release of the kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who has been illegally held in Gaza since June 2006.”</p> \n<p>The Shalit kidnapping was a personal issue for Pelosi, who in 2008, while meeting with then Israeli Knesset speaker Dalia Itzik, held up dog tags of three Israeli soldiers kidnapped in 2006. &nbsp;Two of them belonged to Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, whose bodies were repatriated to Israel earlier that year. The third belonged to Gilad Shalit, who at the time was still believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza. Shalit was famously freed in 2011 as part of a prisoner exchange deal.</p> \n<p>Pelosi said she kept them as a “symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel.”</p> \n<p>However, she hasn't always been been on the right side of the pro-Israel divide. In 2014 Pelosi was criticized for suggesting Hamas is a humanitarian organization. On CNN she said, “And we have to confer with the Qataris, who have told me over and over again that Hamas is a humanitarian organization.” The host of the segment Candy Crowley then interrupted her to ask, &quot;The U.S. thinks they're a terrorist organization though, correct? Do you?&quot; Pelosi responded with, &quot;Mmm hmm.&quot;</p> \n<p>After receiving a lashing from the likes of Megyn Kelly on Fox News and The Republican Jewish Coalition Matthew Brook, Pelosi’s office released a statement, “As Leader Pelosi reiterated in her CNN interview, Hamas is a terrorist organization.”</p> \n<p>Pelosi was also a vocal critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress denouncing then-President Obama’s nuclear deal, which she supported.</p> \n<p>After the speech she released a very harshly worded condemnation saying, “That is why, as one who values the U.S. – Israel relationship, and loves Israel, I was near tears throughout the prime minister’s speech – saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States as part of the P5 +1 nations, and saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation.”</p> \n<p>Pelosi, who was endorsed this week by J Street in her bid for speaker, addressed the 2017 AIPAC Policy Conference by reading a J Street-backed letter, which was signed by 191 members of Congress, mostly Democrats, urging U.S. President Donald Trump to support a two-state solution.</p> \n<p>“As strong supporters of Israel, we write to urge you to reaffirm the United States’ long-standing, bipartisan commitment to supporting a just and lasting two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Pelosi said.</p> \n<p>“It is our belief that a one-state outcome risks destroying Israel’s Jewish and democratic character, denies the Palestinians fulfillment of their legitimate aspirations, and would leave both Israelis and Palestinians embroiled in an endless and intractable conflict for generations to come,” she continued.</p> \n<p>Pelosi, at 78, represents the Democratic establishment’s traditional position on Israel, coupling unwavering support for Israeli defense and the two-state solution for peace between Israel and Palestinians, a bipartisan position that courts both AIPAC and J Street and doesn’t diverge too far from that of centrist Republicans. Unlike some new members of her caucus who criticize Israel for “occupying” the West Bank or for human rights abuses, Pelosi reservers her criticism only for Israeli leaders or policies she disagrees with, most prominently Netanyahu.</p>",

        "text":["<p>WeWork founder invests in medical marijuana firm chaired by Ehud Barak&nbsp;</p> \n<p>InterCure, an Israeli medical marijuana company chaired by former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, has completed a private placement from investors including WeWork founder Adam Neumann, the company said Wednesday. The $17 million fundraiser, which is being conducted ahead of plans to list InterCure on the Nasdaq, included U.S. billionaire Gary Fegel through his GMF capital fund and InterCure controlling shareholder Alex Rabinovich. Fegel made his fortune as a senior partner at Gelncore before leaving the company in 2013. The funds will be used to develop InterCure’s business overseas and the costs connected with its planned dual-listing. Once an investment company with no assets, Intercure bought Canndoc, one of eight authorized growers of medical marijuana in Israel, in September. It aims to become an exporter when the Israeli government authorizes exports. InterCure shares finished up 6.1% at 5.26 shekels ($1.41).&nbsp; (Guy Erez)</p> \n<p>Teva to recall some versions&nbsp;of blood pressure drug due to impurities</p> \n<p>Teva Pharmaceuticals is recalling certain combinations of blood pressure drug valsartan in the United States following the detection of a probable cancer-causing impurity, the latest global recall of the medicine. The Israeli drug maker will recall all lots of amlodipine-valsartan and amlodipine-valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination tablets due to an impurity in an ingredient made by an India-based unit of Mylan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&nbsp; said on Tuesday. The European Union last week effectively banned sales of valsartan made by the Mylan India unit after some batches were found to contain the same impurity, N-nitrosodiethylamine. Teva has not received any reports of adverse events signaling a potential link or exposure to valsartan, the health regulator said. Patients are advised to continue taking their medication as the risk of harm may be higher if the treatment is stopped immediately without any alternative treatment, the FDA said. Teva shares ended unchanged at 80.60 shekels ($21.60). (Reuters)</p> \n<p>Co-Op wins 45-day stay of proceedings</p> \n<p>The Co-Op Israel Cooperative Society and Co-Op Shop supermarket chain won a 45-day stay of proceedings from creditors Wednesday. The chain had sought 90 days, but Jerusalem District Court Judge Alexander Ron declined to give it more than an initial 45 days and appointed two trustees to administer the company. The chain, which is owned by its 13,000 members, said its assets of some 250 million shekels ($67.3 million) exceeded its debts by about 50 million but it had short-term cash flow problems in part due to one-time expenses. A lawyer for Israel Discount Bank, one of Co-Op’s creditors, said the chain owned the bank more than 20 million shekels, not 8.6 million as the court filing said. The society operates nationwide 42 stores directly and another 30 through franchisees, some of which will have to be sold as part of a reorganization. (Efrat Neuman)</p> \n<p>Financial stability panel to begin work soon</p> \n<p>The Bank of Israel said Tuesday the committee newly approved by the Knesset to monitor the stability of the country’s financial sector would convene within months. The panel, which will be chaired by the governor of the central bank, will oversee Israel’s financial institutions, ensuring coordination among regulatory bodies as reforms have brought more companies into the sector. “The large number of players in the credit market and the division of responsibility between the various regulators requires looking at the entire system and closely coordinating the regulators,” the bank explained. The International Monetary Fund had recommended Israel establish the committee after the global financial crisis. The Bank of Israel said it would start work within days to set the agenda for the committee, which will include senior treasury and Israel Securities Authority officials. (Avi Waksman)</p> \n<p>Insurers lead Tel Aviv shares higher</p> \n<p>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange extended its gain Wednesday, but the dollar weakened for the first time since the Bank of Israel announced a hike in interest rates. The benchmark TA-35 index ended up 0.7% at 1,637.10 points, while the TA-125 rose 0.8% to 1,47236, on turnover of 1.13 billion shekels ($300 million). Insurance shares paced gains, helped by the expected profit boost from the rate hike and from third-quarter earnings. Migdal rose 6.1% to 4.40 shekels after saying profit nearly quadrupled from a year ago, to 243.3 million shekels. Harel gained 4.2% to 29.31 on a 75% rise to 287 million. Builder Astrom climbed 5.1% to 16.75 after it said third-quarter net attributable to shareholders climbed 33% to 194.6 million. Bank Hapoalim raised 2 billion shekels in deposits for 6.2 years at 89 basis points over equivalent treasuries. In foreign currency trading, the dollar strengthened 0.1% to a representative rate of 3.733 shekels (Michael Rochvarger)</p>",

It sets a ceiling of 11,000 shekels ($2,950 at the current exchange rate), or 10% of the total price in the case of real estate (which is lower), on transactions that can be paid in cash. Buyers will have to disclose the source of their funds.</p> \n<p>“That meaning of the law is that cash can no longer be used in real estate transactions, even if you’re talking about a payment connected with a memorandum of understanding or a payment upon signing the contract,” said Shay Aharonovich, senior deputy director for land taxation at the Israel Tax Authority.</p> \n<p>He warned the violators could be subject to fines, although not immediately after the law goes into effect in order to let people adjust to the new regime.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Only the wealthy can afford an apartment in Tel Aviv — but is that such a terrible thing? | Analysis</p> \n<p>Speaking at a conference of land assessors in Eilat on Wednesday, Aharonovitch said the reporting requirement on source of funds would not have to be filed with the tax authority at the time of the purchase.</p> \n<p>“We understand that many time at the time the sales contract is signed, home buyers don’t know how they will be paying for the property up to the last shekel. Therefore, we have set up an online reporting system and home buyers will only have to report within six months on their sources of financing. If they don’t report, we’ll impose a fine,” he said.</p> \n<p>Regarding renovations, Aharonovitch said homeowners who cannot show a receipt for the work will be required to show where the money came from. Without such proof, the Tax Authority will deem the payment as having been made in cash and impose a fine.</p> \n<p>“That is a violation not only for the contractor that got the money but also for the customer,” he warned.</p> \n<p>The 11,000 shekel ceiling doesn’t apply to non-business transactions, for example money transferred between two friends, which will be limited to a much higher 50,000 shekels. Payments between family members or to government authorities will be exempt.</p> \n<p>Unregulated free-loan societies (gemachim) that are widely used by ultra-Orthodox Jews will still be permitted to make loans in cash in the same way regulated financial institutions are permitted. Gemachim were exempted at the urging of MK Moshe Gafni (United Torah Judaism), chairman of the Knesset Finance Committee.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israeli archaeologists have retrieved a 9,000-year-old mask that was discovered by chance by a settler taking a walk in the hills south of Hebron, in the West Bank, officials said Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The Neolithic artifact, made of stone, is among the oldest surviving ritual masks in the world, archaeologists believe. It was carved when humans were transitioning from a life of hunting and gathering to agriculture for subsistence, and were beginning to form complex societies.</p> \n<p>The discovery of the mask, and other finds at the site, may give archaeologists a chance to learn more about the function of these grotesque-looking masks, which have befuddled scholars for decades.</p> \n<p>While their function in prehistory cannot be known, archaeologists suspect the grotesque-looking masks may have played a role in ancestor worship.</p> \n<p>The mask was spotted lying on the surface of a field late last year by a settler who had gone out for a walk, said Ronit Lupu, an archaeologist with the Israel Antiquities Authority robbery prevention unit.</p> \n<p>Speaking to Haaretz, Lupu did not reveal the exact location of the find or the identity of the settler but she said there was “no reason” to believe there was any wrongdoing or attempted looting involved in the discovery.</p> \n<p>Since its discovery, archaeologists have been surveying the site where the mask was purportedly found and have been testing the artifact to confirm its authenticity and provenance.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Only 15 other Neolithic masks have been confirmed as authentic, and almost all surfaced already in the hands of private collectors around the world rather than in archaeological digs, meaning experts cannot glean much information about their provenance or function.</p> \n<p>Rare prehistoric artifacts like these masks are a prime target for looters and forgers, and can fetch up to 1 million dollars each on the antiquities market, says Omry Barzilai, an IAA archaeologist and expert on prehistory who studied the find. The trade in bootleg antiquities is keenly frustrating to archaeologists because of the resulting difficulty in proving an artifact's authenticity, and the loss of opportunity to seek associated objects at the site.</p> \n<p>While some of the masks have holes on the sides, it is not clear if they were attached to the face, or may have been too cumbersome for that purpose. They may have been used as death masks or displayed in some other way, experts postulate.</p> \n<p>Other stone representations of the human face from the Neolithic period have been found across the Levant, including at G&ouml;bekli Tepe in Turkey. But these tend to be relatively abstract and researchers are divided as to whether they can be considered actually masks. As a result, the Neolithic masks from southern Israel tend to be considered the earliest clear manifestation of this cultural phenomenon.</p> \n<p>Moshe Dayan buys a mask</p> \n<p>The first mask to appear in the public sphere was bought in 1970 from a dealer near Hebron by none other than Moshe Dayan, Israel’s legendary defense minister and passionate collector of (sometimes looted) antiquities.&nbsp;Other masks were later revealed in private collections around the world, mainly in the United States.</p> \n<p>One of the few masks to emerge from an archaeological dig was found in 1983 in a cave overlooking Nahal Hemar, a stream flowing into the Dead Sea near the Israeli town of Arad. Even then, the artifact was found broken into pieces in a pile of rubble left by looters who had already ransacked the site.</p> \n<p>In 2014, the Israel Museum hosted a landmark exhibition of the Neolithic masks found in Israel and&nbsp;that spread&nbsp;around the world, and were regathered for the show.</p> \n<p>The exhibition was the result of a decade of research to locate the masks, and the artifacts underwent multiple scientific tests to determine their authenticity. After excluding one forged item, experts concluded that the authentic ones had originated in the Judean hills and the surrounding desert.</p> \n<p>“We did a lot of detective work to locate the masks and developed a scientific protocol to determine if they were authentic,” says Debby Hershman, now deputy chief curator of the Eretz Israel Museum. Hershman led the team behind the 2014 exhibition together with Yuval Goren, an archaeological scientist from Ben Gurion University, and Leore Grosman, head of the computerized archaeological lab at the Hebrew University.</p> \n<p>One of the conclusions the team reached was that the masks may have indeed been fastened to faces for use in rituals, Hershman says. This was based on the 3D reconstruction and analysis of the artifacts, which showed that the distances between the eyes and mouth in the masks followed the proportions of the human face and would have allowed the wearer to easily see and breathe through them, she said.</p> \n<p>Still, there is no substitute for being able to link a find to its archaeological context, experts say. With the help of the settler who found the mask, the Israel Antiquities Authorities located the site of the new discovery and conducted a preliminary dig, unearthing flint tools that are typical of the period called Pre Pottery Neolithic B – the same period to which all the masks belong. Testing the isotopes in the calcite encrustations that developed over thousands of years on both the tools and the mask – the researchers found that they matched, proving the objects came from the same place and time.</p> \n<p>“This is the first mask we have found in the last 35 years, so it’s important in itself,” says Lupu. “But even more importantly, we have a chance to fully excavate the site and receive a better picture of the material life connected to this cultic object, ” such as how it was used or in what context.</p> \n<p>The fact that this mask, along with the Nahal Hemar one, were both found between the West Bank and the Judean desert strengthens the supposition that this phenomenon was limited to this region. Stone masks may have been the local version of similar iconographic phenomena from the same period elsewhere in the Levant, says Barzilai.</p> \n<p>Neolithic sites in northern Israel and up to Damascus are often characterized by plastered skulls.&nbsp;These were created by removing the skulls of the dead and decorating them with plaster, seashells and other materials. Elsewhere, in the Jordan Valley and to the east of it, archaeologists tend to find plaster statuettes of human figures.</p> \n<p>The most likely explanation, archaeologists suggest, is that these artifacts represent local variations of a burgeoning ancestor cult connected to the switch humans in the area had made from being hunter-gatherers to settling down and farming the land.</p> \n<p>“This is the height of the Neolithic revolution, the period when grains were domesticated. People settled down and built houses with beautiful plastered floors and created a very developed material culture,” says Barzilai. “When you become an agricultural society, land becomes hugely important, because you have invested a lot of work in it, and you have to mark it as yours somehow: through architecture, burial or ritual.”</p> \n<p>In other words, the masks, the plastered skulls and the figurines of the Neolithic may have functioned almost as a ritual property registry, Barzilai says. They may have represented – or in the case of the plastered skulls, literally were – the ancestors of these early farmers, who displayed or worshipped the artifacts to show their connection to a place and their right to a certain piece of land.</p> \n<p>Whether this theory is correct may or may not be borne out by the results of the archaeological dig at the newly-discovered site near Hebron. But come to think of it, this is not very different from what humans do today in the Middle East and other conflict-ridden areas of the globe. Nine thousand years later, Jews, Arabs and other groups still invoke the presence of their ancestors in this land to say the same thing: “We have a right to be here.”</p>",

There is nothing about this occurrence that has any connection to a [debt] arrangement of the company from its creditors,” Ben-Moshe said.</p> \n<p>He spoke days after his Extra Energy surprised its 129,000 customers by saying it would cease providing services. The news raised questions about whether Ben-Moshe would be able to pull together the 1 billion shekels ($270 million) he needs to complete his acquisition and bailout of indebted Africa Israel, one of Israel’s largest conglomerates.</p> \n<p>In a statement to the media from Ben-Moshe, Extra Energy is said to have reported a loss of 17 million pounds ($21.8 million) in 2017. That is on top of the 13.8 million pounds TheMarker found the company had lost the year before. In order to continue operations, Extra Energy took a loan from another Ben-Moshe, Germany and Cypriot Extra Energy companies. That debt amounted to 105 million euro ($119 million) as of last February.</p> \n<p>Ben-Moshe said that, in contrast to his decision to write off the 500 million shekels he lost on his stake in Israel’s IDB group, he would not do the same in the U.K. “We have assets in England of about 100 million euros that we are entitled to,” he said.</p> \n<p>He described those assets as credit given to business and household customers. Since Extra Energy has no outstanding bank or other loans, all the repayments will go to the Extra Group, he said.</p> \n<p>Bondholders, speaking to TheMarker, said they were concerned but remained confident that the Africa deal would go through.</p> \n<p>“Sure we’re worried, but we’re waiting to see if he raises the money and how he does it,” said one bondholder, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “His decision to abandon his U.K. activities could be good for Ben-Moshe’s activities in Israel because he will no longer have to absorb losses in Britain and can focus on his Israeli business.”</p> \n<p>Ben-Moshe said Extra Energy Britain ceased operations for reasons connected with local regulatory decisions.</p> \n<p>“We told British regulators that in light of significant changes in regulatory rules in England in the area of providing electric power and gas made at the end of October … the group, which operates mainly in the German market, had decided to cease its current operations on the British market,” Ben-Moshe said.</p> \n<p>Regarding the Africa Israel acquisition, he said: “All the money that is supposed to be injected into the [debt] agreement is already in Israel. Approval by the Antitrust Authority we’ve already received and we’ve received approval from most European countries,” adding that he expected the rest to come in the next several weeks.</p> \n<p>“I hope that we will meet the deadline we’ve set for the accord of December 13,” Ben-Moshe said.</p> \n<p>Ben-Moshe said he had raised 300 million shekels of the 1 billion he needs and is in negotiations with parties he described as overseas banks and one Israeli institutional investors about raising the rest. He said he would name them later.</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON – A week after the U.S. midterm elections, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee informed its supporters that the results were a great success from the pro-Israel lobby’s perspective.</p> \n<p>“Americans elected a solidly pro-Israel Congress,” declared the lead article in Near East Report, a monthly publication distributed by AIPAC to its followers across the United States. “While polarized on many issues, the 116th Congress remains committed to the U.S.-Israel relationship on a bipartisan basis,” it stated.</p> \n<p>The following week, another prominent U.S.-Jewish organization, J Street, also publicly celebrated the results. The progressive group, which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans,” bought a full-page ad in the Hebrew edition of Haaretz, declaring that the election results were the best in J Street’s 11-year history.</p> \n<p>“Congressional support for Israel is stronger than ever thanks to the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who are committed to the values of J Street,” the ad said. It also included the names and head shots of 147 candidates who won after receiving support from J Street – more than in any previous Congress. The ad was published under the headline “For the strength of Israel, for a peace process and for a two-state solution.”</p> \n<p>AIPAC and J Street are often described as rival organizations. The former has been one of the most effective lobby groups in Washington for decades, while the latter was founded in 2007 and quickly became a prominent voice in the American-Jewish community.</p> \n<p>J Street is critical of the Netanyahu government in Jerusalem and the Trump administration in Washington, and was aligned with the Middle East polices of the Obama administration. AIPAC joined Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in many of his public battles against President Barack Obama and has a policy of not publicly criticizing the Israeli government. It has also refrained from significant criticism of Trump, expressing support for most of his policies related to Israel and the Middle East.</p> \n<p>Given this, how could both organizations celebrate the same election results? Can the election results – a broad victory for the Democrats in the House; a 53-47 Republican majority in the Senate – really be good for both AIPAC and J Street? And what will both groups be pushing for when Congress reconvenes in January?</p> \n<p>In an attempt to answer these questions, Haaretz spoke with multiple sources who have direct access to the political calculations of both organizations. In order to freely discuss such issues, all of the sources interviewed spoke on condition of anonymity.</p> \n<p>Focus on bipartisanship</p> \n<p>For AIPAC, the bottom line was that the midterms reinforced the importance of the organization’s main political strategy: Keeping support for Israel bipartisan, even in an age of increased partisan division.</p> \n<p>In recent years, the pro-Israel lobby has been criticized from the right for insisting on gathering bipartisan support for legislation – even at the cost of “softening” certain bills that could have passed with Republican votes alone.</p> \n<p>In response to such criticism, AIPAC has acknowledged that it would be a mistake to turn Israel into a standard partisan issue, as that would spell catastrophe when the Democratic Party regains power. The midterm results – a historic “blue wave” taking 40 House seats, seven governorships and hundreds of state legislature seats – is exactly what AIPAC officials were talking about when they warned against relying on Republicans alone to advance pro-Israel legislation.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the fact that Congress is divided – Democrats regained control of the House while Republicans retained the Senate – makes bipartisanship even more important when it comes to promoting legislation. What AIPAC previously stated as a matter of principle – that it is better to have bipartisan support for legislation related to Israel – has now become a factual necessity. Bills and resolutions that don’t enjoy support from legislators in both parties will only be able to pass one of the two chambers of Congress.</p> \n<p>As AIPAC sees it, such a reality makes the prominent lobby group ideally positioned – since it enjoys good relations with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Yes, AIPAC will continue to be criticized from the right for insisting on working with Democrats, and from the left for not criticizing Trump (or Netanyahu). But the organization will highlight its rare ability to work with both sides in a Washington that is increasingly divided.</p> \n<p>Strength in the numbers</p> \n<p>For J Street, the most important outcome of the midterms is that the group will once again have access to one of D.C.’s centers of power. After eight years of close relations with the Obama administration, J Street suddenly found itself in uncharted territory following the 2016 presidential election. It was shut out from the White House and aligned with a powerless Democratic minority in both the House and Senate. This forced J Street to reorient itself – from an organization that used its access and influence within the Democratic Party to promote specific policies when the Democrats held power, to an opposition group that fought hard against Trump and Netanyahu’s policies at a time when it had no real ability to stop them.</p> \n<p>Once it was announced, late on November 6, that the Democrats had taken back the House, that period came to an end. In the next Congress, J Street will have access to at least one center of power – and it’s no coincidence that the group announced its support last week for Nancy Pelosi’s bid to become speaker of the House.</p> \n<p>Unlike AIPAC, J Street has real influence only among Democrats – although the group does reach out to some Republican lawmakers behind the scenes. But its influence within the Democratic Party is growing and could reach an all-time high over the next two years.</p> \n<p>J Street sees its strength being in the numbers. More than half of all Democrats who will serve in the next Congress were endorsed or supported by J Street during the midterms. Indeed, the group will have more such relationships than ever before. Furthermore, every single House incumbent supported by J Street won their reelection bid.</p> \n<p>Although two Democratic senators endorsed by J Street lost their reelection bids (Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota; Claire McCaskill in Missouri), the group received a consolation prize in Nevada when Jacky Rosen – the Jewish candidate and former Reform synagogue president – ousted GOP incumbent Dean Heller.</p> \n<p>One development J Street officials feel particularly upbeat about is that a number of former government officials with foreign policy experience were endorsed by the group and managed to snatch swing districts from Republicans. These new members – including Elissa Slotkin in Michigan; Tom Malinowski and Andy Kim in New Jersey; and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia – are seen as future foreign policy leaders within the Democratic Party.</p> \n<p>Some were attacked during the midterms for their J Street endorsements, but didn’t shy away from the relationship – and it didn’t stop them from winning.</p> \n<p>The military angle</p> \n<p>Yet the victories of these very same Democratic candidates are also a cause for optimism among AIPAC supporters, since they say it proves that centrist Democrats carried the party to victory on Election Day. Many of the party’s ideological, progressive “stars” lost in close races, while Democrats with military or national security backgrounds won across the country. AIPAC’s emphasis on bipartisanship makes centrist Democrats from swing districts easier for the organization to work with. And with many such Democrats entering Congress for the first time in January, AIPAC sees an opening here.</p> \n<p>It should be noted that one of the Democrats who managed to flip a Republican-held Senate seat – Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona – voted against the Iran nuclear deal as a congresswoman in 2015. However, both Sinema and fellow new senator Rosen criticized Trump for the way in which he pulled out of the Iran deal earlier this year.</p> \n<p>There were two specific races in which the results were of particular importance to many within AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups.</p> \n<p>In the Senate, it was the New Jersey contest where Democratic incumbent Bob Menendez was facing a tough battle due to his recent legal troubles. Menendez is considered one of the most AIPAC-aligned Democratic lawmakers in Washington and was the strongest Democratic critic of the Iran deal in 2015. His survival in this year’s midterms means that even as the Democratic Party moves toward J Street, the Democrats’ ranking member on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations will remain a staunch ally of AIPAC.</p> \n<p>In the House, one race that caused concern among pro-Israel groups (especially on the right) was the contest in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District between the Democrats’ Leslie Cockburn and GOP candidate Denver Riggleman. This race achieved national notoriety due to Riggleman’s alleged interest in “Bigfoot erotica,” but it was being closely watched by the pro-Israel community due to Cockburn’s history as a fierce critic of Israel.</p> \n<p>It is estimated that pro-Israel donors invested as much as $1 million in an effort to stop Cockburn from winning the seat. While it is not known whether this influenced the results, the bottom line is that Riggleman – who expressed strong support for Trump’s policies on Israel – won comfortably.</p> \n<p>A joint dilemma</p> \n<p>While AIPAC senses an opportunity in the victories by Democratic centrists and moderates, J Street officials are satisfied that many of the candidates the group endorsed are seen as centrists in the current political climate. J Street believes this supports its claim that the conversation about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has shifted, and that backing a two-state solution that ensures security for Israel and independence for the Palestinians is no longer seen as an extreme or “anti-Israel” position, but rather as a reasonable, centrist point of view.</p> \n<p>One dilemma both organizations face is how to react to the hype surrounding new members of Congress who support a one-state solution to the conflict and are very critical of Israeli policies. These include Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar and Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib.</p> \n<p>On the one hand, AIPAC officials are well aware that these two members replaced Democratic representatives who held somewhat similar positions on Israel – meaning that very little will actually change when it comes to how votes are cast. Would it be wise to devote attention to these members rather than focusing on the many pro-Israel Democrats who will enter Congress on January 3?</p> \n<p>Conversely, members who are very critical of Israel and receiving a lot of media attention will certainly be used by pro-Israel groups to generate donations and increase activism from their supporters. Will AIPAC give up on such opportunities?</p> \n<p>J Street, meanwhile, will have to choose when and how to respond to positions and statements that are far to the left of the organization’s support for a two-state solution. Will it speak out against legislators who have become heroes to some progressives for being the first Muslim women elected to Congress? J Street revoked its endorsement of Tlaib during her election campaign due to her support for a one-state solution, and it could face questions about both women’s views again in the future.</p> \n<p>In terms of legislation goals, AIPAC has highlighted a number of areas: Continued security assistance to Israel; sanctions against Iran and terror groups in the Middle East and a bipartisan piece of legislation against boycotts of Israel and the settlements, which has come under fire from the American Civil Liberties Union for its effect on free speech. This legislation was amended in recent months and AIPAC hopes it will pass soon.</p> \n<p>J Street, meanwhile, will push Congress to resume financial assistance to the Palestinians, after the Trump administration’s string of decisions to cut every form of U.S. aid to them except for direct security assistance.</p> \n<p>One interesting test will be the handling of this issue by Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democrat from New York and veteran Jewish lawmaker who will likely be the next chairwoman of the House Committee on Appropriations. Lowey is considered close to AIPAC. Indeed, one former AIPAC official described her as “an old-style, pro-Israel Democrat.”</p> \n<p>On the other hand, when Trump decided to cut $200 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinians earlier this year, she released a statement criticizing the decision and warned that it could lead to a security and humanitarian crisis.</p> \n<p>Last but not least, there is one unknown hovering over Israel policies in the next Congress: the Trump administration’s long-expected Middle East peace plan. As of now, very few people in Washington have any idea what the plan will include or when it will be released – if ever. If and when it eventually becomes public, both AIPAC and J Street will face difficult decisions on how to respond to it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Eman El-Husseini and Jess Salomon have a few people to thank for their marriage, including a drunk Italian guy at a comedy club and Saddam Hussein.</p> \n<p>Salomon is a Jew from Canada, El-Husseini from a Palestinian family that fled Kuwait in 1991, after the Iraqi invasion.</p> \n<p>“Sometimes I like to give Saddam Hussein a shout-out for invading Kuwait because if not for that, this one’s family might not have ended up in Montreal, and we might not have ever met.” Salomon says.</p> \n<p>“So Saddam Hussein is a big part of our relationship,” El-Husseini interjects.</p> \n<p>“I mentioned him at the wedding in my speech,” Salomon responds, “and nobody liked it.”</p> \n<p>Now the two comics are in calmer environs: sitting at a tiny table in a trendy coffee and matcha place in Brooklyn, where they have lived since 2015. Like legions of comedians, they have come to New York City to make it big.</p> \n<p>There is one thing, however, that sets them apart: Not many two-person comedy acts can credibly say they are a lesbian Palestinian-Jewish married couple.</p> \n<p>“It’s the only conflict you can bring up where everyone knows the reference,” Salomon said. “Even if you’re in the middle of nowhere America, if I say I’m Jewish and my wife is Palestinian, people are like ‘Ooooh.’”</p> \n<p>The couple took different paths to comedy and have different styles: El-Husseini is louder, Salomon drier. But they are parlaying their marriage into a joint career. They have appeared together several times and are collaborating on a webcomic about their relationship. Called “The El-Salomons,” the comic is drawn by the London artist Jesse Brown.</p> \n<p>In one cartoon, El-Husseini encounters Christian missionaries and scares them away just by describing herself: “I’m Muslim ... and gay ... and my wife is Jewish,” she says. “Have a nice day,” the missionaries respond. In another, El-Husseini has to decline several stand-up gigs due to Yom Kippur.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The couple hopes to turn the comic into an animated sitcom.</p> \n<p>El-Husseini says club owners used to tell her not to talk about her identity. But a few years ago, while she was bombing onstage on the anniversary of 9/11, she told the crowd it was her parents’ wedding anniversary (which is true). They went wild.</p> \n<p>“There’s always resistance: Don’t talk about women’s issues, don’t talk about being Arab, don’t talk about your identity,” she says. But after telling the 9/11 joke, “I got the biggest reaction of my career at that point and I’m like, ‘Oh my God, people want me to talk about this.’ It made me so happy because it’s, like, what I know.”</p> \n<p>Stand-up was a natural fit for El-Husseini, who lived in Canada from 1991 until 2015. She was never interested in school, and couldn’t sing or dance, but could tell jokes. She sees comedy as a great way to give Palestinian and Muslim women more representation. She’s been a comedian for 12 years.</p> \n<p>“I realized when I was younger that being funny is a powerful tool, and you can really get away with a lot,” El-Husseini says.“If you’re able to make people laugh, it really goes a long way. As for being Palestinian, it’s such a controversial thing in North America.</p> \n<p>El-Husseini has done a couple of comedy tours in Palestinian cities in the West Bank and Israel. She enjoys being there and says she feels people there are always intense.</p> \n<p>“When Eman and I first started doing this, there weren’t a lot of Arab women doing comedy,” says Maysoon Zayid, a fellow Palestinian comic who toured with El-Husseini. “Eman is a brilliant, brilliant comedian who works tirelessly, but she didn’t really find her voice until she found Jess... Eman and Jess are the premise of every single joke, right?”</p> \n<p>Salomon began her career as a lawyer at the Canadian Justice Ministry under Irwin Cotler, then for a war crimes tribunal in the Hague. Her workplace was full of gallows humor. I like the idea of a sitcom that took place in a war crimes tribunal. So I’m trying to do that.”</p> \n<p>She decided to take off a couple years and return to Montreal for a shot at stand-up. That was nearly a decade ago.</p> \n<p>The two met at an English-language comedy club in Montreal where comics would hang out and drink after their sets. El-Husseini also ran a Jewish-Muslim comedy show at Christmastime called “Kosher Jokes for the Halalidays,” and invited Salomon to perform. In their circles, they say, Muslim and Jewish comics would always gravitate toward each other.</p> \n<p>“When Jess came to the comedy scene, I was convinced she was a Mossad agent,” El-Husseini says. “Who leaves law to become a comedian? She’s coming to ruin my career, I know it.”</p> \n<p>At the time, El-Husseini didn’t identify as a lesbian, so they were friends for a couple of years before anything happened. Then a drunk friend of theirs propositioned both of them at once. And the romance began.</p> \n<p>“We probably will have to think of a better story if we ever have children,” Salomon says. “There was a comic who was kind of prompting us to have a threesome with him, and that’s kind of what sparked even the idea in my mind of Eman in any romantic way. But we never ended up having it. He was like, ‘You two broads should kiss.’ He’s Italian.”</p> \n<p>The couple married in 2015. They occasionally run into tension at Jewish holiday gatherings and face down hecklers onstage. El-Husseini will sometimes get pro-Israel audience members calling her out at shows.</p> \n<p>“I had an older woman yell out, ‘Enough with the Jew jokes! Enough with the Jew jokes!’” Salomon says in describing one of her gigs. “And I was like, ‘I’m just talking about being married to a Palestinian.’ And she just couldn’t handle it.’”</p> \n<p>But overall, they say, people are fine with them. And when they’re not, the couple can always turn it into a joke.</p> \n<p>“It’s like dispelling stereotypes, you know, being like, oh, I didn’t know Muslims could be so funny or Palestinians could be so funny,” El-Husseini says.</p> \n<p>“And gay and show so much cleavage and be drinking a beer,” Salomon replies. “So many vices.”</p> \n<p>El-Husseini chuckles. “My whole life is a sin.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>&gt;&gt; UPDATE: Suspect arrested in murder of 12-year-old asylum seeker</p> \n<p>Even before all the information becomes available regarding the suspected murder of a 12-year-old Eritrean girl in south Tel Aviv on Monday, one thing is clear: Violence against girls and women and the distress experienced by asylum seekers are two of the topics that have been neglected most by Israel's governments.</p> \n<p>Interministerial task forces have been appointed to deal with both these subjects, but in both cases, the resulting recommendations have languished for months while government funding that could help has not been forthcoming. As a result, two of the country’s weakest communities have been consciously left to their fates.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The only unbelievable aspect of Monday’s killing in south Tel Aviv is that such a thing had not happened earlier.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; There's a war zone in south Tel Aviv, but Jewish residents don't see it</p> \n<p>So far this year, a total of 24 women and girls have been murdered in Israel, including two on Monday: In addition to the seventh-grader in Tel Aviv, a 16-year-old girl was found dead in the northern village of Jish.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The same sort of statistics is repeated, year after year. About half of the victims had filed complaints with the police about violence before they were killed, and 14 percent of all the individuals thought to have been involved in violent acts against women were under suspicion in more than one case.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As far back as September 2014, a decision was made to convene an “urgent” interministerial committee to deal with domestic violence. The panel's meetings dragged on until it finally submitted recommendations in June 2016. Then, instead of those suggestions being implemented as quickly as possible, a decision was made to convene yet another committee, which was to be responsible for carrying out the recommendations of the first one.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The second panel sat for another year, until July 2017, when the government ceremoniously adopted its plan of action, to which various ministries attached an estimated price tag of 250 million shekels ($67 million) over five years. Last week Haaretz reported that, in practice, last summer's resolution was devoid of content, as the Finance Ministry did not allocate funding for the approved plan, treating it instead as a collection of recommendations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some of the relevant ministries did in fact receive several million shekels to underwrite various aspects of the plan, but most of what was suggested remained unrealized, sitting in a drawer.</p> \n<p>Benjamin Netanyahu has been prime minister for years, yet this week he frankly admitted that up until now, he hadn’t been aware of the plight of female victims of domestic violence in this country: There are 200,000 of them every year, according to the Labor, Social Affairs and Social Services Ministry. Staff at the shelter for battered women that the prime minister visited this week described him as “shaken.”</p> \n<p>Just after that visit, Netanyahu announced the convening of another panel, this time comprised of cabinet ministers, to deal with domestic violence. After he was informed that another committee is already dealing with the subject, along with other issues involving violence, the premier announced that he would chair that committee's next session on domestic violence instead of its regular chairman, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan.</p> \n<p>Instead of creating more committees that will just issue more recommendations, Netanyahu would do well to provide funding, once and for all, to implement the important recommendations of the most recent panel, from last year. It would also be appropriate for him to personally monitor the implementation process.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One way or another, the only community that is suffering more from government policies relating to domestic violence is asylum seekers. In light of the government’s efforts to expel them from Israel, many people forget that these migrants are here legally. In practice, the state also recognizes that they are “not deportable,” but it also insists that they are not &quot;acceptable.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The government has repeatedly cited different reasons to explain that the fact that asylum seekers can’t be legally expelled doesn’t mean that they can be permitted to lead decent lives in this country. In the meantime, these people are living in abject poverty, many in permanent survival mode, without official status or employment security, working at low paying jobs where, by law, 20 percent of their earnings are deducted, to be returned to them only when they leave the country.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Many asylum seekers experienced abduction, rape and abuse en route to Israel. They are suffering from post-traumatic stress and living with the ongoing threat of deportation hanging over them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Even though it’s clear that many asylum seekers require social welfare services, in part to head off domestic violence, local social welfare agencies are not providing them with the requisite assistance other than in extreme, life-threatening situations. In 2014, in his harshly critical report, State Comptroller Yosef Shapira wrote: “Foreign nationals in Israel, most of whom come from undeveloped countries, also experience crises in a cultural context and don’t benefit from communal power. As a result, these foreigners are likely to need more wide-scale social services than the population of Israel as a whole.”</p> \n<p>Although the comptroller demanded that social welfare agencies revamp their policies, it was only last year that the interministerial team dealing with the plight of asylum seekers began its work, submitting its recommendations only in July. Five months have elapsed since then, but differences of opinion among the ministries have prevented final approval and implementation of the recommendations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And then this week, the High Court of Justice held a hearing on a petition from the Aid Association for Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Israel that was filed against Social Affairs Minister Haim Katz and demanded that his ministry's services be provided to these foreigners.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“When was the report submitted to the ministers?” Court President Esther Hayut asked the state’s representative at the hearing. “Five months ago,” came the response.</p> \n<p>Five months in one case, and four years in another. The state is dragging its feet when it comes to making decisions and providing funding on both domestic violence issues and policies regarding asylum seekers. Will the murder of a 12-year-old Eritrean girl in south Tel Aviv perhaps be enough for the state to finally undertake to finance a plan for the prevention of domestic violence? Will it now agree to open social welfare offices to asylum seekers?</p> \n<p>“Hasn’t the time come to decide?” Justice Hayut asked the state’s representative at the hearing without expecting an answer.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A month has now passed since a white supremacist gunned down 11 Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, transforming the way the United States views the rising tide of anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>The deadly attack on October 27 took the growing phenomenon beyond racist rhetoric and hate crimes such as graffiti on synagogues and overturning cemetery headstones: It was a shocking wake-up call to the fact that hatred of Jews had reached a different, deadly level.</p> \n<p>Pittsburgh shooter Robert Bowers – who insisted that “All Jews must die!” and he couldn’t “sit by and watch my people get slaughtered” – was undeniably steeped in a community of hate. His digital footprint included signs he had found encouragement for his extremist views on the alt-right social media platform Gab, where he had blamed the Jewish refugee organization HIAS for providing assistance to immigrants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yet since those traumatic losses, there is little evidence the Trump administration has taken any major steps that might help prevent another tragedy – either through increasing law enforcement or strengthening programs that combat racism and hatred, which it has cut or neglected during the president’s two years in office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To be sure, there have been a few encouraging signs. First, there was the revelation two weeks ago that the FBI has officially classified the Proud Boys – a self-styled “Western chauvinist” gang with mainstream appeal – as “an extremist group with ties to white nationalism.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The news effectively stripped away any vestiges of respectability from a group that, as its name and ethos reflects, stands against immigrants, Muslims, feminists, transgender people and anyone holding leftist or “non-Western” views.</p> \n<p>Shortly afterward, on November 21, the group’s founder, Gavin McInnes, dramatically announced on YouTube he was “officially disassociating” himself from the Proud Boys “in all capacities, forever.” McInnes’ decision came in the aftermath of a violent New York attack by group members on Antifa (or anti-fascist) demonstrators in October, for which they are facing charges of riot and assault.&nbsp;  In mid-November, meanwhile, more than 40 members of the Ghost Face Gangsters, a violent white supremacist street gang mainly operated from Georgia prisons, were indicted on 83 charges, including multiple drug trafficking counts, in six counties in southeast Georgia.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These, however, are only minor achievements that do little to meet the larger challenge of stemming the dangerous tide of white supremacism. The online environment that has triggered the growth of racist ideologies, leading to violence and actively building communities committed to racist attacks, is still thriving.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A recent, chilling report by Vice detailed the growth of a global network of fascist and neo-Nazi paramilitary cells called The Base, which is reportedly actively organizing and planning terrorist actions against minority groups, “especially Jews and black Americans.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since Pittsburgh, the Trump administration has shown no signs of adjusting priorities or reconsidering earlier decisions to cut the budgets of groups that combat right-wing violence.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Not long after taking office, President Donald Trump eliminated the funding President Barack Obama had awarded to the interagency Countering Violent Extremism Task Force, which funded local partners to deradicalize neo-Nazis and fought to prevent and confront other manifestations of white supremacy. Trump’s actions were harshly criticized after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, in August 2017.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the same time, the White House has boosted other funding to the Department of Homeland Security, ignoring evidence that far-right groups in the United States have been far more deadly than the Islamic terror threat.</p> \n<p>According to the Anti-Defamation League, 71 percent of deaths caused by extremist violence between 2008 and 2017 were attributable to the far right and white supremacists; 26 percent were caused by Muslim terrorists.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And just three days after the Pittsburgh shooting, the Department of Homeland Security reportedly “flummoxed” participants on a major conference call by not discussing the tragedy once, instead preferring to concentrate on the migrant caravan heading toward the southern border.</p> \n<p>John Cohen, a former senior counterterror official in the department, told the Daily Beast it was “disconcerting that in a call with national law enforcement and homeland security experts, the focus would be on the caravan versus the increasing number of mass casualty attacks the country’s experiencing, including by white extremists.”  The Department of Homeland Security frequently defends itself by saying the FBI is responsible for countering far-right extremism. However, a former bureau officer told the Daily Beast that the movement was its “lowest priority.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As both domestic and global anti-Semitism has grown, the U.S. State Department position of special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism remains vacant, as it has been since Trump took office nearly two years ago.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A renewed effort to fill the position after Pittsburgh has seen little success. Hours after the Tree of Life synagogue attack, Rep. Lee Zeldin was one of two Jewish Republican congressmen who urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to appoint someone to the job.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Days after the shooting, another Republican congressman, Rep. Chris Smith, said he believed the job would be filled “soon,” saying he had been told by the State Department a candidate was on the way. “Hopefully yesterday, because the problem is very real,” he said, adding, “I don’t think we can wait any longer for this.” &nbsp; As long ago as April 2017, both Zeldin and Smith were part of a group of 166 House members urging Trump to fill the position. Five months after that, Smith successfully introduced legislation that would raise the anti-Semitism role to the rank of ambassador, reporting directly to the secretary of state. &nbsp; At his confirmation hearings last May, Pompeo assured a congressional committee that he would “move” on filling the special envoy slot. But nothing has changed – and groups like the ADL still find themselves pleading with the administration to appoint someone.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Another important job that remains unfilled is White House Jewish liaison – a role in which a qualified occupant could have been extremely helpful in guiding the administration through the aftermath of Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Like the anti-Semitism envoy, multiple entreaties by American-Jewish leaders to name someone to the position have fallen on deaf ears.</p> \n<p>A letter from a bipartisan group of 44 U.S. representatives on June 30, 2017, calling for Trump to appoint someone, yielded no results – nor did an open, post-Charlottesville letter by 11 former Jewish liaisons charging that Trump “neither understands his responsibilities nor the nature of the ancient hatred of anti-Semitism and other forms of hate.&quot;</p> \n<p>The liaisons' prophetic letter in August 2017 described the president's &quot;equivocation and unwillingness to speak clearly, without restraint, against blatant examples of racism, anti-Semitism and related manifestations of hate” in Charlottesville as &quot;exposing not just Jews but all Americans to greater danger.&quot;</p> \n<p>In Pittsburgh, that danger became all too real.</p>",

Rand&nbsp;Paul is expected to try and limit the amount of aid to Israel under the MOU legislation. AIPAC, CUFI, and other lobbying groups are naturally trying to get Paul to relent given the importance of support for Israel as a critical military ally of the U.S. But the real story here, which is not evident from the headlines, is not about Paul’s stance on Israel but about his stance toward the Palestinians, and demonstrates why the general lack of public forthrightness from the pro-Israel community regarding the Palestinians is hurting Israel in tangible ways.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;If you are Rand Paul, a staunchly conservative Republican senator, it is not surprising that you view the Palestinian Authority as Israel’s mortal enemy, or that you view security assistance to the Palestinians as eroding Israel’s security. The discourse in the pro-Israel community, and particularly on the right, supports that point of view. In that telling, all Palestinians reject Israel’s right to exist, the Palestinian Authority is a terrorist organization led by terrorist mastermind Mahmoud Abbas.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Those with a more nuanced understanding, including nearly all mainstream American Jewish organizations and the Israeli government, know this narrative is a caricature. Sophisticated observers know that not only is the PA not carrying out terrorist attacks – although it is certainly abetting them through its martyrs fund – but that it is a vital and cooperative security partner of Israel... But in the current&nbsp;environment… where many American politicians and Jewish groups do not want to be caught on the record as defending aid to the Palestinians in any way while the Trump administration wages diplomatic war on Abbas, the caricatured narrative spreads unopposed like wildfire.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;And thus you have Paul making the critical error of thinking that eliminating security assistance to the PA will somehow benefit Israel’s security, and insisting that doing so will create the conditions in which Israel will need less security assistance rather than more. In fact, eliminating the relatively paltry $35 million in security assistance to the PA security forces will end up costing Israel orders of magnitude more if the result is that the PA security apparatus disappears or stops its coordination with Israel, forcing Israel to assume the enormous costs of policing the entire West Bank.”&nbsp;[IsraelPolicyForum]  Sander Gerber, architect of the Taylor Force Act, emails:&nbsp;&quot;Koplow is right that many of the leading pro-Israel organizations avoid an honest assessment of the Palestinian Authority and he raises what was the critical stumbling block to the Taylor Force Act: the benefit of security cooperation with Israel. There is a diversity of opinions. But Generals Bogie Yaalon and Amos Yadlin, amongst Israel’s very most respected senior military strategists, concluded that Israel should no longer allow herself to be blackmailed by the PA.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;And the Knesset overwhelming passed the Stern/Dichter Law, two more highly respected security leaders, to drastically cut money transfers to the PA —&nbsp;without allowing for a security waiver.&nbsp;Thus, says the Israeli government: PA security assistance is great, but there should be zero tolerance for Pay-for-Slay. Besides limited security assistance, the PA continues to institutionally radicalize its population to officially hate and kill Israelis (as well as Palestinians who sell land to Jews). Polls show that the Palestinians distrust the PA, for good reason, the rampant self-dealing corruption is inimical to peace for the Palestinian people. An open conversation about the PA must evaluate whether the PA itself is a barrier to peace.&quot;  TOP TALKER —&nbsp;CNN fired political commentator Marc Lamont Hill on Thursday following comments he made a day earlier at the United Nations about Israel and his call for a “free Palestine from the river to the sea.” Hill's remarks&nbsp;coincided with a&nbsp;special weeklong CNN series on the rise of anti-Semitism across Europe.  Hill attempted to&nbsp;push&nbsp;back against criticism of his remarks:&nbsp;“I do not support anti-Semitism, killing Jewish people, or any of the other things attributed to my speech. I have spent my life fighting these things.”&nbsp;  CNN's decision to fire Hill drew mixed reactions. Israeli officials and Jewish organizations welcomed the move, but some conservatives&nbsp;said the network's statement didn't go far enough. In a statement, ZOA's Mort Klein said he was &quot;disappointed&quot;&nbsp;that CNN didn't announce the reason for Hill’s termination. &quot;In light of recent alarming, hateful violent attacks on Jews... it is vital for major national news outlets such as CNN to make it clear that calling for violence against Jews is beyond repugnant, wholly unacceptable and intolerable,&quot; Klein said.&nbsp;  Glenn Greenwald&nbsp;writes:&nbsp;&quot;Hill’s firing from CNN is a major victory for the growing so-called “online call-out culture” in which people who express controversial political views are not merely critiqued but demonized online and then formally and institutionally punished after a mob consolidates in outrage... Some on the pro-Israel right who agitated for Hill’s firing have previously mocked what they call “outrage culture,” in which people are fired for controversial comments.&quot;&nbsp;  In his piece, Greenwald references Daniella&nbsp;Greenbaum Davis, the former Business Insider columnist who resigned after the site deleted her column&nbsp;defending actress Scarlett Johansson's role&nbsp;as a transgender man.&nbsp;  In an email this morning,&nbsp;Greenbaum Davis tells us: &quot;I’m very much of two minds about Marc Lamont Hill and the recent brouhaha in which he finds himself embroiled.&nbsp;Two things are clear to me. The first is that Hill is an anti-Semite who badly hides his Jew-hatred behind the veil of a progressively-inspired criticism of certain Israeli policies.&nbsp;The second is that nothing has changed about his views in the last week. CNN knew exactly what views and perspectives and beliefs they were showcasing when they chose to put him on the air.&quot;  &quot;I might cheer Hill’s downfall in another situation if I truly believed we were putting his asinine and morally repugnant views to bed. But I can’t cheer at the thought of yet another victim of the Twitter outrage machine. To be perfectly clear: people have the right to be outraged at his remarks, and outraged that CNN deemed them so worthy of highlighting.&quot;  &quot;But, and this is the big but, we can’t defeat bad speech or bad ideas by trying to regulate or silence them out of existence. The only way to defeat bad thoughts is with good ones. Sunshine is the best disinfectant. I would have much preferred for CNN to invite Hill to explain the full-range of his ideas in a debate against an articulate and passionate Zionist. And, I would have much preferred that if CNN did decide they could no longer, in good conscience, put Hill on the air, that they would make that decision freely and on their own. Editorial decisions should not be made by people on Twitter.&quot;&nbsp;  Rep.-elect Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) jumps in and&nbsp;tweets:&nbsp;&quot;Calling out the oppressive policies in Israel, advocating for Palestinians to be respected, and for Israelis and Palestinians alike to have peace and freedom is not anti-Semitic.&nbsp;CNN, we all have a right to speak up about injustice any and everywhere.&quot;&nbsp;  DRIVING THE DAY — Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, pleads guilty to lying to Congress about Moscow project — by&nbsp;Rosalind S. Helderman: “President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty Thursday in New York to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate project that Trump and his company pursued at the same time he was running for president.” [WashPost] The Trump Organization Planned To Give Vladimir Putin The $50 Million Penthouse In Trump Tower Moscow [Buzzfeed]  IN THE SPOTLIGHT — Sheryl Sandberg Is Said to Have Asked Facebook Staff to Research George Soros — by&nbsp;Nicholas Confessore&nbsp;and&nbsp;Matthew Rosenberg:&nbsp;&quot;Sheryl Sandberg asked Facebook’s communications staff to research George Soros’s financial interests in the wake of his high-profile attacks on tech companies... at the World Economic Forum...&nbsp;Ms. Sandberg — who was at the forum, but was not present for Mr. Soros’s speech, according to a person who attended it — requested an examination into why Mr. Soros had criticized the tech companies and whether he stood to gain financially from the attacks...&nbsp; In a statement, Facebook said that the company had already begun researching Mr. Soros when Ms. Sandberg made her request.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;In a private meeting on Thursday, Ms. Sandberg again distanced herself from Definers and its research into Mr. Soros, according to Rashad Robinson, head of the racial-justice group Color of Change, which was named in a Definers memo about Mr. Soros. Mr. Robinson said that while meeting with Ms. Sandberg, she denied hiring Definers or directing the firm’s research.&quot; [NYTimes;&nbsp;BuzzFeed]&nbsp;  Dylan Byers writes in his Byers Market newsletter: &quot;Neither the Times or BuzzFeed report showed that Sandberg had ordered Facebook's opposition research on Soros. Nor did her emails contradict her earlier statements, in which she claimed ignorance of Facebook's decision to hire an opposition research firm. All last night's reporting showed was that Sandberg wanted to know if there was any financial motive for a high-profile investor's attacks on her company.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;Nevertheless, the revelation fit very neatly into the new conventional wisdom about Facebook, which casts Mark Zuckerberg as the hapless and helpless chief executive and Sandberg as the duplicitous and malevolent deputy who seeks to undermine the company's critics while refusing to come to terms with its deep, structural problems (of which she is a part).&nbsp;In the end, the evidence may show that Sandberg is indeed such a person. But that evidence wasn't in last night's reporting, and the verve with which some news organizations trumpeted the harmless revelation suggests there is a not-exactly-dispassionate thirst among some reporters to take Sandberg down.&quot;&nbsp;  — Sandberg’s co-author Adam Grant defends her character on Facebook:&nbsp;“The Sheryl I know speaks out against injustice. Most people first came to know Sheryl as the author of Lean In, but what’s often overlooked is that she went out on a limb to write it… The Sheryl I know doesn’t ignore criticism. She acknowledges her shortcomings and works to overcome them… The Sheryl I know cares deeply about people... You can object to how Facebook has handled a series of crises. You can object to the decisions that Sheryl has made. But when I see strangers vilifying her character, I have to object.”  APOLOGY DEPT. —&nbsp;U.S. agency apologizes to George Soros after broadcast called him ‘multimillionaire Jew’ — by&nbsp;Felicia Sonmez:&nbsp;&quot;In letters sent earlier this month, John F. Lansing, chief executive and director of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, voiced his personal apologies to Soros and OSF president Patrick Gaspard for the program, which he said had “made several false and negative assertions” about the billionaire philanthropist and had furthered “age-old tropes against the Jewish community.” “It was based on extremely poor and unprofessional journalism, and it was utterly offensive in its anti-Semitism and clear bias,” Lansing&nbsp;wrote in the letter to Soros.&quot; [WashPost]  HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND —&nbsp;Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein and Israeli Ambassador&nbsp;Ron Dermer are expected to address the annual conference of the Israeli American Council at the Diplomat&nbsp;Beach&nbsp;Resort&nbsp;Hollywood in South Florida.&nbsp;  INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE — Trump labor secretary out of running for attorney general after Miami Herald report — by Anita Kumar:&nbsp;“Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta is out of the running to be President Donald Trump’s attorney general following a Miami Herald report that he oversaw a sweetheart deal to allow Jeffrey Epstein to serve only 13 months in a county jail… Chris Christie&nbsp;recently spoke to Jared&nbsp;Kushner at the White House. If Christie is to be chosen, Kushner must agree, the sources said.” [McClatchyDC]&nbsp;  BUZZ ON BALFOUR — As graft investigations wrap up, Netanyahu replaces defense team:&nbsp;&quot;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is replacing his defense team in three graft investigations…” [ToI]&nbsp;  2020 WATCH&nbsp;—&nbsp;For 2020 Democrats, There’s a Lot of ‘Thinking About It’ — by Matt Flegenheimer:&nbsp;“It is a political season for double negatives: Almost no one is running for president now, but many, many people are not not running.

Anti-Semitism is a presence in society that corrupts society itself,&quot; said Rivlin. &quot;We try to explain to the whole world that if you don't fight against anti-Semitism, it will hit your societies. There are stereotypes present in societies that create a lack of understanding; treatment of minorities which is not humane or moral will corrupt societies.&quot; [CNN]  Bari Weiss writes… “Europe’s&nbsp;Jew Hatred, and Ours: For reasons&nbsp;historic, aesthetic and political, we Jews are most attuned to the anti-Semitism of the far right — and we find the most sympathy among our progressive allies when these are our attackers. But when Jews point out the other two kinds, we are often dismissed as sensitive or hysterical, or as mistaking legitimate criticism of Israel for something darker. This is nonsense. The same was said of the Jews in Europe when they sounded the alarm bells. Look where they are now.” [NYTimes]&nbsp;  Hate crimes in Canada jump 47 percent in 2017 — by Anna Mehler Paperny:&nbsp;“Hate crimes in Canada increased 47 percent in 2017, primarily targeting Muslims, Jews and black people, according to figures released by the country’s statistical agency on Thursday… The spike mirrors an increase in hate crimes south of the border in the United States, where they rose in 2017 for the third consecutive year, according to the FBI.&quot; [Reuters]  MAZEL TOV&nbsp;—&nbsp;Quentin Tarantino Marries Girlfriend Daniella Pick in Private Wedding Ceremony&nbsp;— by Mike Vulpo:&nbsp;&quot;Hollywood director and his longtime girlfriend&nbsp;Daniella Pick&nbsp;became husband and wife Wednesday night after a romantic wedding ceremony...

Reserve Cut is one of only about a half-dozen kosher eateries where the bill would ring up to more than $70 per person, says Elan Kornblum...&nbsp;The growing clientele is one reason Reserve Cut will gross more than $10 million this year, Allaham said, a 10% increase from last year.&quot; [CrainsNewYork]  WINE OF THE WEEK — Marciano Estate Terra Gratia 2016 Cabernet — by Yitz Applbaum:&nbsp;&quot;I have been known to drop in on friends, open their refrigerators and find a pleasant surprise of steak or p&acirc;t&eacute; from the previous evening.&nbsp;The other night I had one of the greatest drop-in experiences ever, as I was greeted by a just-opened bottle of the Marciano Estate Terra Gratia 2016 Cabernet. This is a transformational wine for the Kosher wine industry, in that it is a top-tier Napa Valley wine with a select few barrels made kosher. Its brilliance of palate and range of taste will astound those who get to taste a bottle of this wine.&quot;  &quot;The wine is made predominantly from Cabernet grapes with some surprisingly dominant Cab Franc in the blend. The taste profile is quite traditional for a Napa Cab, but the blueberry flavors are so vivid that they seemingly transport you to the field where the grapes were picked. This wine is a full mouth experience which creeps its way over your whole being.&nbsp;It tastes as if a lot of new oak touched this wine with some hints of used oak to give it a distinct maturity, even though it is still a young wine. This wine will last a very long time and should be had with great friends.&quot; [MarcianoEstate]  BIRTHDAY OF THE DAY —&nbsp;SVP for Public Policy and Director of the Washington Office of the Jewish Federations of North America, William Daroff turns 5-0.&nbsp;&quot;I am pleased to be spending the night of my fiftieth birthday at ADL's Communities Overcoming Extremism summit in St. Louis,&quot; Daroff told Jewish Insider last night. &quot;Beyond the merit of working to combat extremism, it's great to&nbsp;be in the Central Time Zone - so that I have an extra hour in my forties.

        "text":["<p>Website Nile Net Online promises Egyptians &quot;true news&quot; from its offices in the heart of Cairo's Tahrir Square, &quot;to expand the scope of freedom of expression in the Arab world.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Its views on America do not chime with those of Egypt's state media, which celebrate Donald Trump's warm relations with Cairo. In one recent article, Nile Net Online derided the American president as a &quot;low-level theater actor&quot; who &quot;turned America into a laughing stock&quot; after he attacked Iran in a speech at the United Nations.</p> \n<p>Until recently, Nile Net Online had more than 115,000 page-followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. But its contact telephone numbers, including one listed as 0123456789, don't work. A Facebook map showing its location dropped a pin onto the middle of the street, rather than any building. And regulars at the square, including a newspaper stallholder and a policeman, say they have never heard of the website.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Tel-Aviv Times? Iran created fake Hebrew news sites in major&nbsp;'influence campaign'&nbsp;■ Iranian hackers tried to impersonate Israeli cybersecurity company</p> \n<p>It's one of more than 70 websites found by Reuters which push Iranian propaganda to 15 countries, in an operation that cybersecurity experts, social media firms and journalists are only starting to uncover. The sites found by Reuters are visited by more than half a million people a month, and have been promoted by social media accounts with more than a million followers. ClearSky, an Israeli cybersecurity firm, uncovered some 98 websites operating in 25 different countries and estimates that the large-scale operation has enabled Iran to influence public opinion in several of the countries involved.</p> \n<p>&quot;What we are seeing here is an unusual effort by the Iranians to create a global shift in the public's consciousness in order to hide the Iranian regime's true ambitions,&quot; ClearSky CEO Boaz Dolev told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>The Iranian effort &quot;is intended to work on the psychological level and in certain cases it can even be used to disrupt the activities of different institutions around the world, something that must be recognize in order to know how to defend against it,&quot; Dolev added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The sites underline how political actors worldwide are increasingly circulating distorted or false information online to influence public opinion. The discoveries follow allegations that Russian disinformation campaigns have swayed voters in the United States and Europe. Advisers to Saudi Arabia's crown prince, and the army in Myanmar, are also among those using social media to distribute propaganda and attack their enemies. Moscow has denied the charges; Riyadh and Yangon have not commented.</p> \n<p>Former CIA director John Brennan told Reuters that &quot;countries around the globe&quot; are now using such information warfare tactics.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Iranians are sophisticated cyber players,&quot; he said of the Iranian campaign. &quot;There are elements of the Iranian intelligence services that are rather capable in terms of operating (online).&quot;</p> \n<p>Traced by building on research from cybersecurity firms FireEye and ClearSky, the sites in the campaign have been active at different times since 2012. They look like normal news and media outlets, but only a couple disclose any Iranian ties.</p> \n<p>Reuters could not determine whether the Iranian government is behind the sites; Iranian officials in Tehran and London did not reply to questions.</p> \n<p>But all the sites are linked to Iran in one of two ways. Some carry stories, video and cartoons supplied by an online agency called the International Union of Virtual Media (IUVM), which says on its website it is headquartered in Tehran. Some have shared online registration details with IUVM, such as addresses and phone numbers. Twenty-one of the websites do both.</p> \n<p>Emails sent to IUVM bounced back and telephone numbers the agency gave in web registration records did not work. Documents available on the main IUVM website say its objectives include &quot;confronting with remarkable arrogance, western governments and Zionism front activities.&quot;</p> \n<p>Nile Net Online did not respond to questions sent to the email address on its website. Its operators, as well as those of the other websites identified by Reuters, could not be located. Previous owners identified in historical registration records could not be reached. The Egyptian government did not respond to requests for comment.</p> \n<p>'Unspoken truth'</p> \n<p>Some of the sites in the Iranian operation were first exposed in August by companies including Facebook, Twitter and Google's parent, Alphabet, after FireEye found them. Haaretz reported in September that ClearSky uncovered three Hebrew news sites as Iranian hack schemes. One of them, the Tel Aviv Times, receives 65,000 surfers per month, according to SimilarWeb.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Social media companies have closed hundreds of accounts that promoted the sites or pushed Iranian messaging. Facebook said last month it had taken down 82 pages, groups and accounts linked to the Iranian campaign; these had gathered more than one million followers in the United States and Britain.</p> \n<p>But the sites uncovered by Reuters have a much wider scope. They have published in 16 different languages, from Azerbaijani to Urdu, targeting Internet users in less-developed countries. That they reached readers in tightly controlled societies such as Egypt, which has blocked hundreds of news websites since 2017, highlights the campaign's reach.</p> \n<p>The Iranian sites include:</p> \n<p>- Ten outlets targeting readers in Yemen, where Iran and U.S. ally Saudi Arabia have been fighting a proxy conflict since civil war broke out in 2015;</p> \n<p>- A media outlet offering daily news and satirical cartoons in Sudan. Reuters could not reach any of its staff;</p> \n<p>- A website called Realnie Novosti, or &quot;Real News,&quot; for Russian readers. It offers a downloadable mobile phone app but its operator could not be traced.</p> \n<p>The news on the sites is not all fake. Authentic stories sit alongside pirated cartoons, as well as speeches from Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The sites clearly support Iran's government and amplify antagonism to countries opposed to Tehran –&nbsp;particularly Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Nile Net's &quot;laughing stock&quot; piece was copied from an Iranian state TV network article published earlier the same day.</p> \n<p>The identity or location of the past owners of some of the websites is visible in historical Internet registration records: 17 of 71 sites have in the past listed their locations as Iran or Tehran, or given an Iranian telephone or fax number. But who owns them now is often hidden, and none of the Iranian-linked operators could be reached. One of the Tel Aviv Times’ Facebook pages says that the organization operates from Washington, United States, but its phone number has an Ireland country code. Haaretz tried calling the number, but the line was disconnected.</p> \n<p>More than 50 of the sites use American web service providers Cloudflare and OnlineNIC&nbsp;– firms that provide website owners with tools to shield themselves from spam and hackers. Frequently, such services also effectively conceal who owns the sites or where they are hosted. The companies declined to tell Reuters who operates the sites.</p> \n<p>Under U.S law, hosting and web services companies are not generally liable for the content of sites they serve, said Eric Goldman, co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University. Still, since 2014, U.S. sanctions on Iran have banned &quot;the exportation or re-exportation, directly or indirectly, of web-hosting services that are for commercial endeavors or of domain name registration services.&quot;</p> \n<p>Douglas Kramer, general counsel for Cloudflare, said the services it provides do not include web-hosting services. &quot;We've looked at those various sanctions regimes, we are comfortable that we are not in violation,&quot; he told Reuters.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for OnlineNIC said none of the sites declared a connection to Iran in their registration details, and the company was in full compliance with U.S. sanctions and trade embargoes.</p> \n<p>Another Western dawn</p> \n<p>The Kremlin is widely seen as the superpower in modern information warfare. From what is known so far, Russia's influence operation&nbsp;– which Moscow denies&nbsp;– dwarfs Iran's. According to Twitter, nearly 4,000 accounts connected to the Russian campaign posted over 9 million tweets between 2013 and 2018, against over 1 million tweets from fewer than 1,000 accounts believed to originate in Iran.</p> \n<p>Even though the Iranian operation is smaller, it has had impact on volatile topics. AWDnews&nbsp;– the site with the focus on &quot;unspoken truth&quot;&nbsp;– ran a false story in 2016 which prompted Pakistan's defense minister to warn on Twitter he had the weapons to nuke Israel. He only found out that the hoax was part of an Iranian operation when contacted by Reuters.</p> \n<p>&quot;It was a learning experience,&quot; said the deceived politician, 69-year-old Khawaja Asif, who left Pakistan's government earlier this year. &quot;But one can understand that these sorts of things happen, because fake news has become something huge. It's something which anyone is capable of now, which is very dangerous.&quot;</p> \n<p>Israeli officials did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>In August 2015, an official account for a European department of the World Health Organization (WHO) tweeted an AWDnews story. Annalisa Buoro, secretary for the WHO's European Office for Investment for Health and Development, said the person running the department's Twitter account at the time did not know the website was part of an Iranian campaign.</p> \n<p>She said the tweet had gone out when the account had a relatively small following, limiting the damage, but &quot;on the other hand, I am very concerned ... because as a UN agency we have a huge responsibility.&quot;</p> \n<p>Jobs for women</p> \n<p>FireEye, a U.S. cybersecurity firm, originally named six websites as part of the Iranian influence operation. Reuters examined those sites, and their content led to the Tehran-based International Union of Virtual Media.</p> \n<p>IUVM is an array of 11 websites with names such as iuvmpress, iuvmapp and iuvmpixel. Together, they form a library of digital material, including mobile phone apps, items from Iranian state media and pictures, video clips and stories from elsewhere on the web, which support Tehran's policies.</p> \n<p>Tracking usage of IUVM content across the Internet led to sites which have used its material, registration details, or both. For instance, 22 of the sites have shared the same phone number, which does not work and has also been listed for IUVM. At least seven have used the same address, which belongs to a youth hostel in Berlin. Staff at the hostel told Reuters they had never heard of the sites in question. The site operators could not be reached to explain their links with IUVM.</p> \n<p>Two sites even posted job advertisements for IUVM, inviting applications from women with &quot;ability to work effectively and knowledge in dealing with social networks and (the) Internet.&quot;</p> \n<p>Demolished home</p> \n<p>One of IUVM's most popular users is a site called Sudan Today, which SimilarWeb data shows receives almost 150,000 unique visitors each month. On Facebook, it tells its 57,000 followers that it operates without political bias. Its 18,000 followers on Twitter have included the Italian Embassy in Sudan, and its work has been cited in a report by the Egyptian Electricity Ministry.</p> \n<p>The office address registered for Sudan Today in 2016 covers a whole city district in north Khartoum, according to archived website registration details provided by WhoisAPI Inc and DomainTools LLC. The phone number listed in those records does not work.</p> \n<p>Reuters could not trace staff members named on Sudan Today's Facebook page. The five-star Corinthia hotel in central Khartoum, where the site says it hosted an anniversary party last year, told Reuters no such event took place. And an address listed on one of its social media accounts is a demolished home.</p> \n<p>Sudan used to be an Iranian ally but has changed sides to align itself with Saudi Arabia, costing Tehran a foothold in the Horn of Africa just as it becomes more isolated by the West. In that environment, Iran sees itself as competing with Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States for international support, and is taking the fight online, said Ariane Tabatabai, a senior associate and Iran expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.</p> \n<p>Headlines on Sudan Today's homepage include a daily round-up of stories from local newspapers and Ugandan soccer results. It also features reports on bread prices&nbsp;– which doubled in January after Khartoum eliminated subsidies, triggering demonstrations.</p> \n<p>Ohad Zaidenberg, senior researcher at Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky, said this mixture of content provides the cover for narratives geared at influencing a target audience's attitudes and perceptions.</p> \n<p>The site also draws attention to Saudi Arabia's military actions in Yemen. Since Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir ended his allegiance with Iran he has sent troops and jets to join Saudi-led forces in the Yemeni conflict.</p> \n<p>One cartoon from IUVM published by Sudan Today in August shows Donald Trump astride a military jet with an overflowing bag of dollar bills tucked under one arm. The jet is draped with traditional Saudi dress and shown dropping bombs on a bloodstained map of Yemen. The map is littered with children's toys and shoes.</p> \n<p>Alnagi Albashra, a 28-year-old software developer in Khartoum, said he likes to read articles on Sudan Today in the evenings when waiting for his baby to fall asleep. But he and three other Sudan Today readers reached by Reuters had no idea who was behind the site.</p> \n<p>&quot;This is a big problem,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't see that they are not in Sudan.&quot;</p> \n<p>Government officials in Khartoum, the White House, the Italian Embassy and the Egyptian Electricity Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.</p> \n<p>Backbone</p> \n<p>It is unclear who globally is tasked with responding to online disinformation campaigns like Iran's, or what if any action they should take, said David Conrad, chief technology officer at ICANN, a non-profit which helps manage global web addresses.</p> \n<p>Social media accounts can be deleted in bulk by the firms that provide the platforms. But the Iranian campaign's backbone of websites makes it harder to dismantle than social media, because taking down a website often requires the cooperation of law enforcement, Internet service providers and web infrastructure companies.</p> \n<p>Efforts by social media companies in the United States and Europe to tackle the campaign have had mixed results.</p> \n<p>Shortly after being contacted by Reuters, Twitter suspended the accounts for Nile Net Online and Sudan Today. &quot;Clear attribution is very difficult,&quot; a spokeswoman said, but added that the company would continue to update a public database of tweets and accounts linked to state-backed information operations when it had new information.</p> \n<p>Google did not respond directly to questions about the websites found by Reuters. The company has said it identified and closed 99 accounts which it says are linked to Iranian state media. &quot;We've invested in robust systems to identify influence operations launched by foreign governments,&quot; a spokeswoman said.</p> \n<p>Facebook said it was aware of the websites found by Reuters and had removed five more Facebook pages. But a spokesman said that based on Facebook user data, the company was not yet able to link all the websites' accounts to the Iranian activity found earlier. &quot;In the past several months, we have removed hundreds of Pages, Groups, and accounts linked to Iranian actors engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior. We continue to remove accounts across our services and in all relevant languages,&quot; he said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The traces of blood were washed away last week by the autumn rains. Here, on this hill, blood was shed of unarmed villagers fighting to retain their last remaining bit of land and the small space for rest and relaxation they had carved out at an unofficial antiquities site on a nearby hill. The settlers in the outpost across the valley coveted the site and, starting last July, began invading it every Friday, supposedly to pray but mainly to provoke the villagers, under the auspices of the Israel Defense Forces and the Border Police. Their aim was clear: to seize control of the hill, as they had seized control of other hills around the village.</p> \n<p>A few Fridays ago, this ongoing struggle for their land exacted the lives of two villagers, when Israeli forces opened fire at close range. Seven other villagers were wounded. Since then, the hill has been declared a closed military area on Fridays. This temporary cease-fire is of course another victory for the settlers: The tiny antiquities park is closed to its owners on their day of rest.</p> \n<p>This is one of a myriad of stories, a typical case of how the settlers are seizing land that is not theirs and of the brutal response by the&nbsp;IDF&nbsp;and the Border Police when the victims attempt to protest.</p> \n<p>Khirbet Na’alan is a rock-strewn hill with oak trees and remnants of ancient stone walls from Crusader times. It’s located at the edge of Al-Mazra’ah al-Qibliyah, a Palestinian village of 3,000, north of Ramallah and close to Bir Zeit, which dates back to the 16th century, according to its residents. Talmon and its satellites – Dolev, Nachliel, Zayit Ra’anan, Nahalei Tal, Neria, Hirsha and also Kerem Re’im (the “Talmonim”) – are the settlements and outposts that surround the village.</p> \n<p>This time the evil swept in from the direction of Kerem Re’im, a trailer-home site on the hill across the way, inhabited by some 45 national-religious families, with a large Israeli flag that’s flapping in the wind and dirt trails leading to it from all sides. The ordeals of al-Mazra’ah al-Qibliyah began here in 2007, when a settler planted a vine on the desolate hill across from Khirbet Na’alan. Following a failed legal battle, the villagers started to protest against the takeover of the hill. About 40 of them, including the head of the village council, were arrested on one day of demonstrations.</p> \n<p>Sure enough, four years later, the Kerem Re’im outpost was established under the vine that had been planted there. At first it was two or three trailer homes, and then more and more in their wake. The villagers, realizing that the battle for that hill was lost, gave up. But early this year they discovered that the settlers weren’t yet sated. These uninvited neighbors started to build dirt roads to the outpost that crossed Al-Mazra’ah al-Qibliyah land. Once more the locals protested, in an attempt to stop the bulldozers, and this time their efforts bore fruit: After they appealed to the District Coordination and Liaison Office in Beit El, the roadwork came to a halt in May.</p> \n<p>But in July the settlers developed a craving for Khirbet Na’alan, which lies on the hill opposite them. Each Friday they would climb up there to demonstrate their presence and lordship over land that is not theirs – yet another act of provocation under the aegis of the IDF and the Border Police, and under the cover of prayer, which is supremely pure, pristine and innocent.</p> \n<p>Sensing the approaching danger, the Palestinians began to develop the site. They encircled it with simple steel fences, installed lighting, hung chains of lamps on the branches of the trees, repaired the dirt road running from the village to the site, placed signs calling on visitors to keep the hilltop clean and brought in picnic tables like the ones at sites belonging to the Jewish National Fund. A trailer home, like the ones used by the settlers, was even placed in a corner of the site, to function as a clubhouse and place to hang out. The battle for the hill had begun.</p> \n<p>A video in the possession of the villagers shows the encroachment by the settlers. With soldiers and Border Police around them, they are seen standing in the site restored by the Palestinians – praying, their bodies swaying back and forth, some armed with rifles. Under the oak tree in the center of the hill they can be seen exchanging smug smiles while grim-faced Palestinians stand opposite, visibly humiliated and furious, helpless against the foreign interlopers.</p> \n<p>That scene was repeated every Friday for a month. On other occasions, at night, the settlers would sabotage the fences and electrical cables, and puncture the large water tanks that the Palestinians had installed. On one occasion the villagers found an unlit firebomb, which had apparently been intended to burn down the trailer. The last time the settlers were here was on the night of November 17.</p> \n<p>It’s quiet here on Fridays now, but the villagers have been barred from reaching their only outdoor recreational space. For how long? “The decision is made according to an operational assessment,” we were told by the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit.</p> \n<p>A month earlier, on October 15, the settlers stepped up their terror tactics, entering the village in the dead of night and damaging no fewer than 28 cars, smearing Stars of David on them with an ominous inscription: “Death to the Arabs.” Iyad Hadad, a field researcher for the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem, has visual documentation of all the cars that were attacked. Passions began running high in the village, with rage and frustration mounting.</p> \n<p>And then came their Black Friday, October 26. A day earlier, the District Coordination and Liaison Office had informed residents of Al-Mazra’ah al-Qibliyah that the area of Khirbet Na’alan would be declared closed to the settlers, who would not be allowed to approach the site. But at around noon the following day, the villagers saw that settlers were gathering at the entrance to Kerem Re’im, along with a number of military vehicles. Dozens of village residents gathered at the antiquities site, watching the developments across the way with growing concern. The younger villagers began throwing stones into the valley that separates the village and the outpost, with the aim of preventing the settlers from reaching the hilltop site.</p> \n<p>Vasim Ladawda, the village’s paramedic, got a phone call from the Palestinian unit in the DCL office: What are so many young people doing at Khirbet Na’alan? Ladawda tried to calm things down. He told his Palestinian interlocutor that the young people were on their own land, and that if the settlers stayed away things would remain quiet. But tensions continued to rise and at about 1:30 P.M., a large Border Police force, together with a small number of soldiers, began moving toward the hill from all directions, firing large quantities of tear gas. The villagers threw stones at them; the settlers remained at their outpost.</p> \n<p>Smoke enveloped the hill as clashes continued between young Palestinians and the security forces. Under the tear-gas assault, most of the demonstrators withdrew toward the main part of their village. A few dozen young people and about 100 soldiers and Border Policemen remained, according to the villagers’ estimate. Gradually the distance between the two sides narrowed until just a few meters separated them. The young people descended into the valley and the Israeli troops climbed toward them. By now it was around 2:30 P.M.</p> \n<p>And then, without warning, shots rang out. Live ammunition. Within minutes the valley became a battlefield. Nine Palestinians collapsed, one after another, bloodied and writhing with pain. The video taken by the villagers isn’t easy to watch: Border Policemen and soldiers shooting the young stone-throwers from zero range, round after round of live fire, and young people falling to the ground, casualty after casualty. Sounds of shooting – puk, puk, puk – and then the groans and cries of the wounded and their rescuers. War.</p> \n<p>As usual at such demonstrations, a lone Red Crescent ambulance was parked on the Palestinian side, and with it five paramedics from the Medical Relief Society, led by Ladawda. At first, he relates, he was stunned by the large number of casualties – nine within just minutes – and by the unbridled use of live fire from such short range. Among the wounded was a medic wearing a high-visibility orange vest, and also a photographer. The young villagers carried the wounded up the hill, and filled the ambulance with four or five casualties, among them Mohammed Ibrahim Shreitah, a father of two, who was shot in the head. He died a few days later in a Ramallah hospital.</p> \n<p>Ladawda saw his brother Uthman fall to the ground. Uthman was carried to the medic, who was convinced that he had swallowed his tongue and was choking; his face had turned blue but there wasn’t any blood on him. Vasim tried to resuscitate his brother, but apart from one breath, he did not react. Meanshile, the ambulance had already left.</p> \n<p>Uthman had no pulse and Vasim couldn’t understand what had happened. He bundled his brother into his car and sped to the local clinic, where two physicians were also at a loss to explain Uthman’s condition. An ambulance arrived to take Uthman to Istishari Hospital in Ramallah; Vasim accompanied him.</p> \n<p>After about five kilometers, Vasim realized that his brother was dead. His body was cold, his blood oxidation stood at zero and he had no pulse. They drove the remaining three kilometers to the hospital where Uthman was pronounced dead, and his body was taken to be photographed. Only then was a small puncture wound discovered in his rear hip – an entry wound with no exit. The bullet had apparently devastated his internal organs, slashing upward through his body – the soldiers were below him in the valley and he had been bent over when he was shot from behind.</p> \n<p>Uthman Labawda was a construction worker, an expert in tile grouting, 33 years old, married to Maha and the father of four. Maha is in her ninth month and is due to give birth next week. Her new son will be named Uthman, of course.</p> \n<p>What happened during those minutes when the troops began to fire live ammunition indiscriminately at the unarmed demonstrators? The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit told Haaretz: “In the wake of the event, an investigation was launched by the Military Police, in cooperation with the Israel Police. On October 26, a violent breach of order occurred with the participation of more than 100 Palestinians in the area of Khirbet Na’alan. During the demonstration the participants hurled burning tires and threw stones at IDF and Border Police forces, wounding three border policemen. In response the forces made use of riot dispersal means and live fire. As a result of the fire, two Palestinians were killed and others were wounded.”</p> \n<p>In the meantime, the ground at the popular recreational spot-turned-war zone is covered with acorns, and velvet armchairs in scarlet and purple are scattered around the site. The pits that were dug for roasting chickens are filled with water. The wife of Vasim, the bereaved brother, prepared makluba and sent it here in pots. We’re sitting at a picnic table, as though nothing happened.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Shopping was the last thing on Sarah Hirsch’s mind this summer when she boarded a flight from Tel Aviv to this capital city.</p> \n<p>It started out as a Holocaust pilgrimage. Hirsch, 67, flew to Warsaw in August with her husband, Naftali, and a friend to see where her older brother was murdered at the age of three, along with three of her grandparents and all of her uncles and cousins.</p> \n<p>“I told myself I would do nothing but study and mourn,” Hirsch, who was born shortly after World War II in what today is Romania, told JTA after touring the Auschwitz death camp. “It would be an in-and-out,” she said of her and her husband’s first visit to Poland.</p> \n<p>Hirsch, a retired lawyer, also was antagonized after Poland passed a law early this year outlawing rhetoric that blames the nation for any Nazi atrocities during the Holocaust. She fears it will whitewash some Poles’ crimes amid the genocide — as do many other critics of that legislation, which triggered a diplomatic crisis between Israel and Poland.</p> \n<p>But like a growing number of Israeli tourists who have discovered Poland’s charms, Hirsch said her experiences on the ground softened her attitude.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Poland and Israel’s false declaration on the Holocaust | Opinion</p> \n<p>“It developed into giving myself the opportunity to enjoy also the good things,” including shopping, she said. “I saw a young generation here that had no part in the Holocaust trying to build a normal, democratic country with many, many beautiful things despite its singularly tragic history.”</p> \n<p>Despite tensions over how to speak about and approach the Holocaust, tourism from Israel to Poland and vice versa is dramatically increasing, official figures show.</p> \n<p>Traffic from Israel to Poland last year skyrocketed to a record 250,000 arrivals, a 79% increase from the previous year’s 139,000, according to Israel’s ambassador to Poland, Anna Azari. That followed a 40% rise in 2016 over 2015, according to the Polish Tourism Ministry.</p> \n<p>Israel has also gained popularity among Polish tourists, with almost 100,000 arrivals in 2017 — a 64% increase over the previous year. And in the first 10 months of 2018, that figure jumped to 123,000 tourists from Poland, Israel’s Tourism Ministry told JTA.</p> \n<p>LOT, Poland’s national airline, added 12 weekly flights last year to the seven it already had from Warsaw to Tel Aviv. The expansion created direct flights from Israel to Gdansk, Poznan, Lublin and Wroclaw, with a Krakow direct flight on track for next year, LOT spokesman Adrian Kubicki told JTA. He said the company is registering no change in traffic following the diplomatic crisis over the Holocaust law.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Unfair ire surrounding the joint Israeli-Polish Holocaust statement | Opinion</p> \n<p>“Israel is perceived as one of the safest and friendliest destinations in the Middle East right now,” Kubicki said. “There’s also centuries of cultural affinity that makes Polish people feel at home there.”</p> \n<p>At least 15% of the traffic from Israel to Poland in 2017 owed to organized educational trips about the Holocaust. Israel’s Education Ministry arranges such trips for about 25,000 high school students annually, with the numbers rising steadily.</p> \n<p>The crisis in relations with Israel — at the height of which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu protested when his Polish counterpart appeared to say that some Jews collaborated with their Nazi killers – seems to have had a minimal effect on the traffic.</p> \n<p>Shem Olam, a Holocaust museum near Hadera, Israel, said it would no longer include Poland on its small educational trips to Europe. Instead it sent 20 guides this year to Ukraine – a country where collaboration with the Nazis was far greater than in Poland, and which, along with several other Eastern European countries, also has recently passed laws limiting what can be said about such collaboration.</p> \n<p>Israel and Poland, which is one of the Jewish state’s staunchest advocates in the European Union, buried the hatchet earlier this year after Poland amended the legislation, effectively decriminalizing the prohibition on accusing Poland for Nazi crimes.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The State of Israel vs. the Jewish people | Opinion</p> \n<p>Naftali Hirsch, Sarah’s husband, says he feels more welcome in Poland than in his native Hungary.</p> \n<p>“Some Poles betrayed Jews during the Holocaust,” said the 70-year-old, who lost two siblings in the Holocaust. “But unlike Hungary, Romania and many other countries, this was not a collaborationist country. This was an occupied country, where the Nazis carried out systemic murder.”</p> \n<p>In Poland, the Nazis killed three million Polish Jews — half of the Jews killed in the Holocaust — as well as another three million non-Jewish Poles.</p> \n<p>“I feel a kinship,” said Nafatali Hirsch, a retired aviation professional. “When I say I’m Jewish here, there’s empathy in people’s eyes. When I do it in Hungary, there’s often an icy silence.”</p> \n<p>But Sarah Hirsch said it bothered her that their guide at the Auschwitz museum “didn’t say a word about collaboration by some Poles.”</p> \n<p>“Not many, perhaps, but we need to have this discussion,” she said. “This country and society is ready for it, despite this law, which many Poles feel uncomfortable with.”</p> \n<p>The engine for growth in Israeli tourism in Poland, however, is not in its Holocaust-related sites. Rather it owes to Israelis who are drawn by the country’s low costs, relative safety and rich Jewish heritage, according to Daniela Singler, an Israeli who has visited Poland 11 times last year.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; History is not for sale | Editorial</p> \n<p>‘It’s the perfect combination,” she said during an interview on Israel’s Channel 2 last year. “The living’s cheap. You can get a luxury meal for $13. You stay at a top five-star hotel for less than you’d spend on a guesthouse in the Galilee.”</p> \n<p>Israel’s El Al airlines, in its in-flight magazine earlier this year, crowned Warsaw as a “shopping paradise.” The article does not mention any of the city’s Jewish attractions, like the award-winning new Polin Jewish museum that opened in 2013, or what remains of the Warsaw Ghetto.</p> \n<p>Some tourists from Israel skip these sites altogether.</p> \n<p>“I’m not into the whole Holocaust thing, bro,” one tourist, Adi Cohen from Petah Tikvah, said while browsing with his girlfriend at a mall.</p> \n<p>And the Noyk Synagogue, the only surviving prewar Jewish house of prayer in Warsaw?</p> \n<p>“If I wanted to go to shul, I would’ve stayed in Petach Tikva,” he said. “I’m here to eat, drink and have fun.”</p> \n<p>The increase in tourism from Israel is affecting some Polish Jewish institutions.</p> \n<p>Galil, one of Warsaw’s best kosher restaurants, has had to move to a bigger space and triple its manpower over the past eight years, its manager, David Sosnckey, told JTA. It now employs three chefs who struggle to accommodate the ever-growing stream of patrons.</p> \n<p>The restaurant, which serves a fusion menu of Middle Eastern and Eastern European foods with kosher certification from the highly strict Edah HaChareidis label, has had to move because “the neighbors at our previous location started complaining about the noise and traffic,” he said.</p> \n<p>Several new kosher or Israeli restaurants have opened over the past five years not only in Warsaw, but in cities as far west as Poznan and as far east as Lublin. In Warsaw, that included the Israeli kosher restaurant Bekef and Hummus Bar and the Mezze falafel eatery. In Krakow, in the southern part of the country, there was Hamsa, an Israeli restaurant with Turkish references.</p> \n<p>Lublin’s newest Israeli restaurant, Olive, is part of what is perhaps the most remarkable touristic endeavor undertaken in Poland in recent years targeting a Jewish clientele.</p> \n<p>Operating since 2013, it opened as part of Hotel Ilan – a four-star establishment with 50 rooms. Its building used to house Yeshivat Chachmei Lublin, a Hasidic university of unprecedented proportions that opened in 1930, cementing the city’s status as a hub of Jewish learning and life in Eastern Europe.</p> \n<p>Featuring dormitories for hundreds of students – a novelty among yeshivas at the time – it was gutted by the Nazis in 1939. They burned the establishment’s books in 1940 in a fire that lasted 20 hours.</p> \n<p>After the building was returned to the Jewish community of Poland, it was turned into a prestigious hotel. Today it serves a varied clientele ranging from Jewish pilgrims visiting graves of prominent rabbis to conference-goers who book Ilan for its spa and exotic in-house restaurant.</p> \n<p>The imposing facade, a typical piece of 20th-century architecture with Baroque and Art Deco elements, features a fresh coat of light orange paint and a large sign in Hebrew bearing the former yeshiva’s name and a biblical verse. Only inside, does the illusion of a living, breathing Talmudic institution give way to a boutique hotel design, complete with a bar and a sauna.</p> \n<p>Another part of the building features a museum that is free to tour, even for non-guests. And there’s a small functioning synagogue.</p> \n<p>“This hotel, I couldn’t care less about it,” said one visitor, Yossi Blak, an Orthodox Jewish tourist from the Israeli city of Bnei Brak. Bound for the Ukrainian city of Uman for a Rosh Hashanah pilgrimage, Blak and his family passed by Lublin because the late Rabbi Shmuel Wosner, the leader of Blak’s stream of Haredi Judaism, used to attend Yeshivat Chachmei Lublin.</p> \n<p>“In fact,” Blak said, “I try to block out all this touristic noise, close my eyes and imagine the sound of 5,000 yeshiva students reciting and studying Torah. When they return to this hotel, I’ll get a room.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>What the hell is happening with the Labor Party? The new MK Robert Tiviaev receives “an important telephone call” and causes the opposition to lose a vote his fellow party member submitted; MK Hilik Bar is busy forging Israel’s diplomatic relations in China at a time every voting opposition hand can topple the fragile coalition. Meanwhile, party chairman Avi Gabbay continues to bicker with his party members, who are petitioning their colleagues against his plans to reserve slots on the list.</p> \n<p>How did a man like Tiviaev, a former member of Yisrael Beiteinu and Kadima (and who received 1,097 votes in Labor’s primary in 2015), become the largest opposition party’s crucial vote? Tiviaev, who wants to quit the Zionist Union anyway, is a classic Ephraim Kishon-style example of what happens in local politics every day, but he is also another symptom of Labor’s loss of direction.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Israel’s leaderless left turns to Netanyahu | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The party that built the state, the left’s flagship, the political home that’s supposed to be an alternative to the horrific regime set up by Benjamin Netanyahu and the extreme right, looks like Atarim Square on Tel Aviv’s shoreline: Desolate, abandoned and evil smelling, while standing on one of Israel’s most valuable pieces of real estate. Why can’t Labor get off the ground?</p> \n<p>Ehud Barak in his first term (1999-2001) was Labor’s last significant leader, and he too damaged the party severely later on, after stripping it of some of his loyalists to sit in Netanyahu’s second government. His retirement after losing in the 2001 election doomed the rest of Labor’s leaders to a shaky, back-stabbing future, ending with its removal from office. The party simply lost faith in itself and its leaders.</p> \n<p>Add to this acute problem the confusion of the entire Zionist left since the second Intifada and the collapse of Oslo’s hopes. The Zionist left, with Labor in its ranks, can serve as a vital alternative only to Miri Regev’s culture-loyalty bill or David Amsalem’s recommendations’ law, designed to protect the prime minister in criminal investigations. The Zionist left has difficulty advancing the idea of ending the occupation and forging peace because it isn’t sure of it itself, and is afraid the public won’t buy it.</p> \n<p>At this point one must admit that Gabbay himself, who of course isn’t responsible for Labor’s historic ills, is another symptom of its loss of a way forward. Gabbay, who was elected as a refreshing new start, indeed made almost every possible mistake - he tried to swerve right and then returned left, plunged into power struggles over party institutions and didn’t stop quarreling with Labor members - but in retrospect it turns out that his election was by itself a frantic, illogical move, a cosmetic trick employed out of despair. (I too wrote on the eve of the Labor leadership elections that Gabbay was a gamble worth taking.)</p> \n<p>Gabbay is not a leftist, and apparently isn’t made of leadership material either, because he cannot control even his own party’s MKs. It’s hard to see in him any similarity to Netanyahu, who lifted Likud from the ruins after its 12-Knesset-seat disaster in 2006, and has since settled in as ruler of Israel.</p> \n<p>Is Labor stubbornly heading toward its end? Perhaps that’s where nature is leading and there’s no point in flogging a dead horse. Perhaps Labor’s collapse would do the left good and finally produce a real opposition that can change the radical course Israel is hurtling down.</p> \n<p>But Labor’s solid base of support – worth about 10 Knesset seats, the number the polls have been giving it for a long time – is still not something to be taken lightly. The party still has potential. The kind demonstrated in the last elections, in which the Zionist Union won 24 Knesset seats, and the kind reflected in the polls, where figures like Benny Gantz win exaggerated rates of support.</p> \n<p>Labor’s traditional constituency is still alive and is demanding representation. Even more: It has been searching for a leader high and low for years.</p>",

The foundation reported it had paid Barak for “research,” but it was an unusual expense: The foundation did not spend similar sums on other studies and researchers.</p> \n<p>The Wexner Foundation focuses on developing Jewish professional and volunteer leaders in North America and public leaders in Israel. The foundation did not explain why it had employed Barak or the purpose of his research.</p> \n<p>Barak said in response that he was a private citizen, had acted lawfully and reported his income to the tax authorities. He accused the journalists of political persecution in Netanyahu’s service. Right-wing MKs persuaded the Civil Service Commission, which is headed by a Habayit Hayehudi functionary, to demand explanations from the Wexner Foundation. The foundation grants 10 study scholarships for Harvard fellowships every year for Israeli public sector employees and officers.</p> \n<p>The commission has no authority to “look into” the payments to Barak, who wasn’t a state employee. Commissioner Daniel Hershkowitz must leave the matter alone and not act as the political right’s investigations department.

This isn’t about security secrets, not even business ones, but about working for philanthropic foundations that advance public causes.</p> \n<p>Anyone who is as active in political life as Barak, even if it’s outside the Knesset or a party, cannot be called a “private citizen,” whose actions are known only to his employers and the tax authorities.

        "text":["<p>One look at Khan al-Ahmar tells the story of the impasse that has been reached in the government’s war to demolish this small Bedouin village in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>The roads that were built in preparation for the eviction remain empty. The metal gate erected at the entrance, on the slope from Route 1 down toward the Dead Sea, is wide open. Ironically, the plan to demolish the village, located near Route 1 and the settlement of Kfar Adumim, has greatly improved access to it, at least for now.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Khan al-Ahmar ruling gives green light for mass expulsion of Bedouin villages | Analysis</p> \n<p>Khan al-Ahmar has become an international symbol of the Israeli-Palestinian battle for control over Area C, the part of the West Bank assigned to full Israeli control by the Oslo Accords. And ostensibly, the freeze on the eviction proceedings is meant to allow the state to resume negotiations with the residents, due to heavy diplomatic pressure and fear of proceedings at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.</p> \n<p>But in practice, there’s no evidence of any such talks. The assessment in political and diplomatic circles is that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is mainly trying to buy time until one of the two main sources of pressure — the ICC and the settlers — eases off.</p> \n<p>Khan al-Ahmar is home to a few dozen families from the Jahalin Bedouin tribe, which originally lived in the Negev but was expelled to the West Bank in the 1950s. They live in shacks and tents that also shelter their sheep.</p> \n<p>Israel has been trying to evict them for decades. There is documentation of settler leaders demanding their eviction as far back as the 1970s. At some point, Israel’s Civil Administration in the West Bank began planning the eviction, and for the last 10 years, right-wing activists, including the Regavim organization, have been campaigning to accelerate the process.</p> \n<p>From a zoning standpoint, the buildings were erected without permits from the Civil Administration on land defined as state land. That’s the official reason for the eviction, which was upheld by the High Court of Justice. Yet over the years, several settlement outposts in similar situations have been legalized.</p> \n<p>The village’s proximity to Kfar Adumim and the highway have also been cited as justification.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, international law holds that forcibly evicting an occupied population is illegal, and the international community has mobilized to defend the residents. Inter alia, a school made of tires was built there with European funding.</p> \n<p>At first, the state planned to relocate the villagers to the Jahalin West site near Jerusalem. But during the High Court hearings, it proposed an alternative site, closer to a sewage treatment plant near Mitzpeh Yeriho.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The Khan al-Ahmar demolition will be ugly | Opinion</p> \n<p>In September, the High Court definitively rejected the residents’ petition. They were then told they had to demolish their own homes. At the same time, the state began planning to forcibly evict them.</p> \n<p>But last month, when everything seemed ready to roll, Netanyahu surprised everyone by halting the process. Sources in the Prime Minister’s Office said he did so to once again try to negotiate, based on proposals received from various parties. But what those proposals are, if they even exist, remains unknown.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s order to postpone razing the village infuriated legislators from the Habayit Hayehudi party, two of whom — Moti Yogev and Bezalel Smotrich — have pushed heavily for the eviction. They termed the decision “unprecedented weakness.”</p> \n<p>Their party’s cabinet ministers, Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked, joined in the criticism. So did then-Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who said the decision to delay the eviction had been made “in utter defiance of the defense minister’s position and despite his vehement objections.” Netanyahu was forced to bring the postponement to the security cabinet for approval.</p> \n<p>What happened at that meeting, where the ministers approved the temporary postponement, was revealed later in speeches by Lieberman and Bennett. Prior to his resignation as defense minister, Lieberman sounded more conciliatory.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israel’s solution for expelled Bedouin: Between the garbage dump and junkyard</p> \n<p>“If the prime minister and the attorney general say, ‘Let’s try once more to exhaust the attempt to negotiate for a voluntary eviction; that’s important from a legal standpoint,’ I don’t see any problem,” he said, speaking at a conference in Jerusalem. “I think this decision was correct in light of the attorney general’s request that we try to make one more attempt at a voluntary evacuation. But the moment the security cabinet decided that Khan al-Ahmar will be evacuated, it’s an irreversible process.”</p> \n<p>In other words, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit told the ministers that the postponement was legally necessary. The idea was to give negotiations a last chance.</p> \n<p>The reason lies in the statement published by the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, a few days before Netanyahu announced the postponement.</p> \n<p>“I have been following with concern the planned eviction of the Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar, in the West Bank,” she said.&nbsp;“Evacuation by force now appears imminent, and with it the prospects for further escalation and violence. It bears recalling, as a general matter, that extensive destruction of property without military necessity and population transfers in an occupied territory constitute war crimes under the Rome Statute.” &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bensouda also reminded the parties that her office is already conducting a preliminary inquiry into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before deciding whether to open an investigation.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The eviction of Khan al-Ahmar stinks up to high heaven&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>But as the political discord between Lieberman and Netanyahu increased due to the escalation in the Gaza Strip, the former’s opposition to the postponement grew accordingly. He refused to negotiate with the villagers’ lawyer because the Palestinian Authority was paying his salary. Finally, in his resignation speech, he declared, “I thought we had to evict, but unfortunately, in this case too, the prime minister issued a written order and prevented the eviction.”</p> \n<p>Bennett, in a speech where he almost resigned but didn’t, painted a similar picture. Netanyahu froze the eviction because he was worried over “what they’d do to us in The Hague,” Bennett said.</p> \n<p>Legal and diplomatic sources said Israel isn’t necessarily concerned about an investigation into Khan al-Ahmar itself. Rather, it’s worried about the ICC’s preliminary inquiry, a report on which is expected to be published soon. Its conclusions might also include the court’s decision on whether it has jurisdiction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip at all.</p> \n<p>Israel has argued vehemently that it doesn’t, inter alia because Palestine isn’t a state and therefore can’t join the ICC. At an academic conference last week, Mendelblit even said that he’s considering submitting “a detailed, reasoned argument on my own behalf about the International Criminal Court’s lack of jurisdiction in this context.”</p> \n<p>The person in Mendelblit’s office who’s responsible for contact with the ICC, Roy Schondorf, has held many meetings on this issue and even presented some of his conclusions to a Knesset committee in closed session.</p> \n<p>Last week, the internet news site Walla reported that Schondorf recently received a message from Bensouda’s office indicating that from the standpoint of international law, there’s no legal barrier to demolishing the village. The Justice Ministry flatly denied this report, saying there was no such message, or even anything “in a similar vein.”</p> \n<p>After Lieberman announced that he wouldn’t negotiate with the villagers’ lawyer, Tawfique Jabareen, because the PA was paying his salary, he resigned. If Israel doesn’t want to talk with us, then good luck with the negotiations, the villagers said, and cut off contact. And indeed, since then, there have been no talks.</p> \n<p>Civil Administration officials said that efforts to open negotiations are continuing. Israeli activists helping the Bedouin, including some residents of Kfar Adumim, confirmed that the Civil Administration had tried to contact the residents through them, in order to bypass the PA, but to no avail.</p> \n<p>The state claims the PA has encouraged the residents to adopt a rejectionist stance in order to turn their struggle into a battle of principle over control of Area C. Officials from both the Civil Administration and the Justice Ministry said the residents have adamantly refused to accept any proposal for relocation.</p> \n<p>But conversations with the residents and people close to them naturally paint a different picture.</p> \n<p>When speaking to the foreign or Palestinian media, they declare their intention of remaining where they are forever. Before he resigned, Jabareen also told the media that if evicted, the residents would return to the site immediately. Israel can demolish the buildings, he said, but it can’t evict an occupied population.</p> \n<p>Eid Abu Khamis Jahalin, one of the leaders of the villagers’ struggle, sent the same message in statements to the international media in recent days. Even if Israel demolishes the village, he said, we will rebuild it again and again.</p> \n<p>But when the microphones aren’t present, residents say the situation isn’t that simple. Some even admit, fearfully, that they are mere pawns on the political chessboard and are forced to do what the PA tells them.</p> \n<p>The PA has indeed been very visibly present in Khan al-Ahmar ever since it became a symbol, even after the lawyer it hired officially resigned. Shortly before that resignation, the tire school hosted a cartoon competition sponsored by the PA, in which Israel was depicted, inter alia, as an octopus strangling the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Some village residents don’t identify with that rhetoric. But they feel that nobody is representing them and their interests.</p> \n<p>The sense that the village is trapped between competing political pressures also emerges from statements by Israeli government sources in recent weeks. “They’ll be evicted in the end because there’s no choice; the political pressure is too great,” one said. Even Netanyahu insisted that the postponement was merely temporary and “of short duration.”</p> \n<p>But on this question too, the true answer is evident at a glance. The state promised the High Court that the villagers won’t be evicted until an alternative site is ready. But the alternative site in Azzariyeh, near Jerusalem, has been dismantled, and the site near Mitzpeh Yeriho has never been built.</p> \n<p>Building the Azzariyeh site took several weeks. Thus as long as no work is being done to build an alternative site, the promise that the eviction would happen “very soon” evidently isn’t anywhere close to being kept.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The UN Refugee Agency’s new representative in Israel says he’s greatly concerned about asylum seekers’ uncertain status in the country – an intolerable situation for anyone who believes in humanism and human dignity, as he put it. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Speaking in his first interview since taking office, Damtew Dessalegne said this week’s killing in Tel Aviv of a 12-year-old Eritrean asylum seeker, allegedly by her mother’s former boyfriend, only underlined the urgency of the migrants’ plight.</p> \n<p>Asked whether the Israeli government, a sponsor of the United Nations’ 1951 Refugee Convention, was meeting its obligations under the document, Dessalegne said Israel “is trying, but we expect Israel to do more than it is doing.”</p> \n<p>Dessalegne noted that Israel was the only Western country from which the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR, had offered to resettle refugees in other Western countries.</p> \n<p>On April 2, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;announced that an agreement had been signed with the UNHCR to resettle some of the asylum seekers in Israel in Canada, Italy, Germany and elsewhere. But Netanyahu backed out less than a day later due to a backlash from his political base.</p> \n<p>It was difficult to find other countries to accept them, Dessalegne said. The UNHCR’s agreement was the best that Israel could ask for, he said, expressing the hope that Israel would drop the poisonous political rhetoric and resume its commitment to the agreement.</p> \n<p>Referring to a bill that would let the Knesset revisit aspects of the asylum-seeker issue that the Supreme Court had ruled unconstitutional, he said Israel could bypass the court but not international law.</p> \n<p>He cast doubt over whether the Population and Immigration Authority’s efforts to encourage asylum seekers, many of them from Eritrea, to leave the country voluntarily really reflected free will. He also cautioned that the July peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea could take years to pave the way for the repatriation of Eritreans in Israel.</p> \n<p>For now, the case of 12-year-old Silvana Tzegai was telling.</p> \n<p>“Absolutely nothing could justify the taking away of this beautiful child’s life. Her murder might have been prevented, maybe,” Dessalegne said. “But this is not the time to analyze and argue what could have been done. We should rather talk about what should be done now to make sure that such tragedies never happen again.”</p> \n<p>He added: “What Silvana’s bereaved parents and their fellow refugees and asylum seekers are asking us is not to pity them, but to see them as human beings endowed with rights, dignities and abilities. They are not&nbsp;helpless people who totally depend on help they are given.</p> \n<p>“To the contrary, they are often people with a strong determination to survive and cope, which is why they became refugees in the first place.&nbsp;They&nbsp;bring or are eager to acquire valuable skills to be able to support themselves and their families by hard work.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“And, if given the chance and they are supported to nurture and realize their hopes and potential, each can make a positive contribution to the host society – economically, socially and culturally.&nbsp;If we do not act now together to find solutions for these refugees and asylum seekers – solutions built on rights, compassion and our shared humanity – we will have failed this generation of Silvana’s peers and those to come.”</p> \n<p>On April 2, the UNHCR believed the situation looked brighter. After years of Israel trying to expel the asylum seekers, not examining asylum requests and granting very few people refugee status, Israel and the UNHCR signed an agreement to resettle more than 16,000 Eritreans and Sudanese in other Western countries. A similar number would be granted proper legal status in Israel.</p> \n<p>But then came Netanyahu’s flip-flop. Since then, the prime minister and his cabinet have reverted to seeking an expulsion, though the UNHCR believes the April deal is still on the table.</p> \n<p>“As far as I’m concerned, the offer is still on. It may not be forever, not because we are going to take it away, but our resettlement partners may divert their attention elsewhere,” Dessalegne said. This was the first time his agency was offering an OECD member state, a developed country, to resettle refugees elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Calling it “a very generous offer,” Dessalegne said it was made “understanding the situation, understanding that the refugees are the ones paying the price, and a heavy price for that matter.”</p> \n<p>The global perspective</p> \n<p>Asked whether it was difficult to find Western countries willing to accept the refugees from Israel, he said “very hard. How can we justify [this] when there are hundreds of thousands of refugees in far worse situations in Kenya, in Ethiopia, in Chad, in Pakistan?”</p> \n<p>Referring to the asylum seekers, he said the countries “said if this is what it takes to bring some relief to these some people, so be it.” They were willing to make an exception and work with the government “to find a solution once and for all.”</p> \n<p>Dessalegne added that from a global perspective, the numbers in Israel were small. “Forty thousand people for a highly developed country, a regional superpower … and a country and people who know what being a refugee means … is a manageable number,” he said.</p> \n<p>If the Israeli government decided tomorrow that it was resuming its agreements with the UNHCR, the other Western countries would surely find room for the asylum seekers, Dessalegne added.</p> \n<p>In Netanyahu’s April 2 announcement that was later rescinded, it was the only time his office released a statement referring to the asylum seekers as “migrants,” not “infiltrators.”</p> \n<p>Dessalegne expressed discomfort over statements such as a 2012 comment by Miri Regev, who is now culture minister. She called the Sudanese in Israel “a cancer in our body.”</p> \n<p>“Language matters, and the way we describe other people matters,” Dessalegne said. “We cannot just throw around any terminology and any description to characterize people who have left their countries, not to seek adventure but simply because they couldn’t live and thrive in their own homeland. If these people had had the possibility to remain where they were, with their countries, with their communities, and with their friends, they wouldn’t have come.”</p> \n<p>He added: “What is at issue is … a human rights issue, therefore by describing these people the way some politicians have described them is an attack against human rights, in a way against human dignity … [calling them] bogus asylum seekers and cheaters.”</p> \n<p>As he put it, “The refugees will not go away just because one calls them by other names. For us, they remain refugees no matter what.”</p> \n<p>Dessalegne has spent 25 years at the UNHCR based in Geneva, Romania, Egypt, Italy, Armenia and Cyprus. He said he expected Israel, a country with a “vibrant democracy” and a “very engaged, active civil society” that took in Jewish refugees from around the world to be more accepting of refugees.</p> \n<p>“What fascinated me is the fusion of so many cultures and traditions and people coming from different backgrounds” and with a shared Jewish heritage, he said. “A melting pot .…So when you see this, you would expect that refugees could easily fit in.”</p> \n<p>In 1951, after the chaos of World War II, a conference was held in Geneva adopting the Refugee Convention. It defined a refugee and the signatory countries’ obligations for protecting refugees on their territory.</p> \n<p>The newly established State of Israel was a sponsor, but now Dessalegne said it was doubtful Israel was meeting its obligations.</p> \n<p>“Asylum is about showing understanding, showing you care for these people,” he said, adding that “Israeli authorities were part of the drafting committee for the convention, so they know more than we do [about] how the convention came into [being] and why – and its value. I therefore trust the government this time around will not do anything that contravenes the convention.”</p> \n<p>He said the approach toward asylum seekers didn’t need to focus on the convention, it could focus on humanitarian obligations in general. The status quo is unacceptable, he said; it isn’t good for the asylum seekers or Israel.</p> \n<p>The July peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea after two decades of war got some Israeli politicians saying the time had come to repatriate Eritreans living in Israel. “One of the solutions that we are now looking at is peace, a welcome peace, between our friend, Ethiopia, and Eritrea,” Netanyahu said at a conference of his Likud party.</p> \n<p>Dessalegne said he agreed with Netanyahu that the peace agreement would eventually provide conditions for people to return, but it wouldn’t be tomorrow and maybe not next year; it could take years.</p> \n<p>Closed-door policy</p> \n<p>In May, State Comptroller Joseph Shapira harshly criticized the Population and Immigration Authority for an open secret: Asylum requests are simply not being examined. According to the comptroller, over the previous nine years, only 52 of 55,433 asylum requests filed had been granted, including 10 requests from Sudanese and Eritreans. At the end of last year, 29,783 requests, more than half of those filed since 2009, remained pending.</p> \n<p>Dessalegne said he had a hard time understanding Israel’s economic or diplomatic interest in the policy. “It’s good to know at the earliest possible [time] who is a refugee and who is not, so that you know how to deal with that individual,” he said. “It’s good not to keep people in a legal and social limbo for a long period of time, because that will not solve the problem.”</p> \n<p>Israel provides asylum seekers with welfare services only when their very survival is in danger. In countries where asylum seekers have access to welfare services, the failure to rule on asylum requests turns the migrants into a financial burden, Dessalegne said.</p> \n<p>The more they remain in the system and have problems finding work, the more they rely on the welfare system. The moment they receive official recognition, they have better options to find jobs and support themselves. They pay taxes and contribute to the national economy.</p> \n<p>Either way, when expulsion isn’t an option, one of the Population and Immigration Authority’s approaches is “voluntary departure.” As a result, in 2016 and last year, 1,136 asylum seekers left for Uganda and 376 for Rwanda. In the two years before that, about 2,600 left Israel for those two countries combined. From January through May this year, 195 left for what was referred to as “a third country.”</p> \n<p>But, according to a number of accounts, contrary to the refugee convention, the asylum seekers had no legal status or rights in their new countries and were not provided with official documents or government approvals.</p> \n<p>Dessalegne said nothing prevents Israel from sending asylum seekers to another country if the migrants agree after being fully informed, and if the process complies with the obligation to ensure rights in the country taking them in. The question is if it’s really voluntary, and if the asylum seekers are being deprived of basic survival needs.</p> \n<p>Dessalegne referred to the law requiring Israeli employers to deposit 20 percent of asylum seekers’ salaries into an account – money that is only returned when they leave the country. When the authorities take a significant chunk of your earnings and only return it at the airport, and when you have to renew your visa every two months, you get fed up and your departure isn’t voluntary, Dessalegne said.</p> \n<p>He is also concerned about the treatment of asylum seekers around the world. Globally, last year saw a net increase of 2.9 million people forced to flee their homes due to war, violence or other persecution, bringing the total figure above 68 million.</p> \n<p>Such a huge number also sharpens the rhetoric against refugees around the world, Dessalegne said, adding that the tone was poisonous in several European countries regarding asylum seekers and immigration. Populist politicians are drawing support by opposing immigration and sowing fear, a ploy based on few facts, lots of exaggeration and to some extent also seen in Israel, Dessalegne added.</p> \n<p>One country that continues to provide asylum seekers with official status and support is Canada, where thousands of the migrants living in Israel have gone in recent years. Dessalegne, who has Canadian citizenship after moving there as a refugee at age 18, said Israel could learn a lot from asylum seekers’ integration into Canada.</p> \n<p>The combination of multiculturalism and inclusion “only enriches society,” he said. “It doesn’t take away what you already have. It adds to it.”</p> \n<p>As Dessalegne put it, “I’m Canadian, so I know what it means, and I’m one of the beneficiaries of Canada’s multiculturalism policy. But I felt from Day One that I was part of it, that I was included. And then I was determined to pay it back, because inclusion does not come for free. If you are in it, then you also have to pay for it.”</p> \n<p>According to Dessalegne, “There is this notion that multiculturalism endangers what you have.” It does not, he said. It’s enriching, but it needs to be made to work, through government policy and public statements.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The passing of President George H.W. Bush allows us to evaluate the way America’s role in the Middle East was shaped by his presidency.</p> \n<p>Without question, the two most significant events of his single term in office were the Gulf War and the Madrid peace conference. They advanced and cemented the United States’ role as the guarantor of the security of the Gulf states and the sponsor of efforts to achieve peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;George H.W. Bush and his 'roller-coaster relationship' with American Jews and Israel&nbsp;■&nbsp;From Bush to Trump: How the GOP evolved on Israel</p> \n<p>By the time Bush became president, the United States had already been a security partner of Saudi Arabia and the other Arab states of the Persian Gulf for decades. The essential bargain struck by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and King Abdulaziz al Saud — American security support in exchange for the accessibility of Gulf energy resources to the United States and its trading partners — was longstanding.</p> \n<p>U.S. weapons supplies and a modest military presence in the region following the British withdrawal in the early 1970s to secure energy supplies were its main manifestations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But it had never been put to the test in the face of a potentially existential threat until Saddam Hussein’s forces rolled into Kuwait in August 1990. Bush made an early decision to come to the defense of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, deploying first a defensive force of some 200,000 troops, and then more than doubling it to provide the forces, in coalition with dozens of other countries, necessary to expel Iraq from Kuwait.</p> \n<p>The U.S.-led victory in that war left a legacy that is still with us today. U.S. forces remained in the Gulf in significant numbers, eventually deploying to a range of bases in the Gulf states and continuing to contain both Iraqi and Iranian aggression. It is scarcely imaginable that the Iraq war led by President George W. Bush, the troubled occupation that followed and dominated U.S. foreign policy for a decade, and the eventual, fitful transition in Iraq toward a U.S.-allied democracy, with a Kurdish autonomous area in the north, would have been possible without the commitment represented by the first Gulf War.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Today, the U.S. military presence in the Gulf is largely oriented toward containing Iran, but its presence in significant numbers dates to the post-Kuwait invasion months of 1990.</p> \n<p>In the aftermath of the Gulf War, which brought the United States into closer partnership with many Arab countries, President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker sought to reanimate American efforts to promote Arab-Israeli peace. Relatively little had occurred on this front in the decade following the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, although the Reagan Administration, in its final weeks, did initiate a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization. But Bush and Baker saw an opportunity to advance a longstanding American interest.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How an ultimatum from George H.W. Bush transformed U.S.-Israel relations</p> \n<p>In the months following the Gulf War, Baker was relentless in cajoling Israel, Syria, Jordan, and a Palestinian delegation to attend a Middle East peace conference, which was eventually held in Madrid in October 1991. The conference itself produced no substantive breakthroughs, beyond having Israeli delegates seated at the same table with sworn enemies. But Madrid launched both bilateral and multilateral tracks of talks that continued for years.</p> \n<p>Peace negotiations evolved and took on new forms in the years that followed, particularly after Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords in 1993. Those negotiations were conducted out of the sight of American officials, but the Madrid process provided essential cover to give the parties space to explore new opportunities in secret. The result — mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority — has defined the terrain of U.S. peace efforts on the Israeli-Palestinian track during the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama Administrations. Even President Donald Trump, for all his skepticism of that structure, has not yet acted to definitively dismantle it.</p> \n<p>The Israel-Jordan peace agreement was also made possible by the opening created in Madrid, as well as the separation of Jordanian and Palestinian interests marked by Oslo. Talks on the Israeli-Syrian track for some two decades also derived from what was launched in Madrid, although they reached what was likely their definitive conclusion in 2011 with the eruption of the Syrian civil war.</p> \n<p>As the region has changed — with the transition in Iraq, the rise of an Iranian threat, the collapse of the Syrian state, and the ups and downs of Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts — the U.S. role has had to adapt with it. But the initiatives launched and structures put in place during the presidency of George H.W. Bush remain relevant and have defined United States efforts, both successful and otherwise, to navigate all that the region has thrown at it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That legacy makes the Bush presidency, in some respects, one of the most influential on America’s role in the Middle East in the past century, with contributions whose relevance continues a quarter century later.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Daniel B.

Last month, an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander said U.S. bases in Afghanistan, the UAE and Qatar, and U.S. aircraft carriers in the Gulf were within range.</p> \n<p>Pompeo's statement provided few details about the latest Iranian missile test.&nbsp;&quot;The Iranian regime has just test-fired a medium range ballistic missile that's capable of carrying multiple warheads,&quot; he said in the tweet.</p> \n<p>&quot;This test violates UNSCR 2231,&quot; he added, citing the United Nations Security Council's endorsement of the international nuclear agreement. &quot;We condemn this act.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Islamic Republic's government has ruled out negotiations with Washington over its military capabilities, particularly its missile program, which is run by the Revolutionary Guards.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran warned the European Union that Tehran's patience was running out on the bloc's pledge to keep up oil trading despite U.S. sanctions.

        "text":["<p>This Sunday, the extension the High Court of Justice granted the Knesset to enact a new conscription law (or non-conscription law, as opponents call it) will expire. In the absence of alternative legislation, the existing law will mandate – alas and alack, woe is us! – the drafting of all ultra-Orthodox young men of a certain age. And that means dismantlement of the coalition and an early election.</p> \n<p>The prime minister has instructed the State Prosecutor’s Office to ask the High Court for an additional four-month extension. Reason: There’s a new defense minister. That doesn’t even qualify as an insult to the intelligence.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu doesn’t want an early election. I want to serve the whole term, until November 2019, he told the leaders of the coalition parties this week. If push comes to shove, they believe, he could live with May, which, for some reason, is the month most mentioned in this context. MK David Bitan (Likud) is telling lawmakers that that’s the real goal: to get to the end of January and then dissolve the Knesset. A subsequent election campaign of 100-120 days and we’re home safe.</p> \n<p>With Netanyahu we have already had sacrosanct target dates that couldn’t be changed – and they evaporated in a blink of the eye. Now it’s May. Why? Some say the timing will be good for him after the fanfare of annual Memorial Day and Independence Day ceremonies. The nation will be euphoric and he’ll be riding high on public exposure.</p> \n<p>Others argue that the suspect from the Balfour Street residence is bent on getting the country to the polling booth after a presumed preliminary decision by the attorney general to indict him – pending a hearing. It’s vital for him to manage the event of the hearing – and possibly also the negotiations for a plea bargain that could keep him out of prison – from the position of a prime minister who has been reelected despite the well-known suspicions. According to a political source, that’s the advice the client got from his lawyers.</p> \n<p>During the meeting of heads of coalition parties early this week, Netanyahu turned to Deputy Minister Yaakov Litzman, the senior representative of Agudat Yisrael, the Knesset party most adamantly opposed to the draft bill. “Nu, Reb Yaakov, what’s up?” he asked. “With what matter?” Litzman replied with feigned innocence. “What will be?” the questioner persisted. Said Litzman: “If there is no new [version of the proposed] legislation, we will resign. If the law ends up being the one that’s now going through the Knesset” – which has passed the first of three votes, with the support of Yisrael Beiteinu and Yesh Atid – “in that case, we will also resign.”</p> \n<p>The length of the extension the High Court may or may not announce will determine the date of the election. We’ll know on Sunday. In the meantime, the coalition is alive and breathing. Not really kicking, as its internal cracks widen.</p> \n<p>The new rule set by Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon for the 10 MKs in his Kulanu party, that they are free to vote as they please on issues not connected to security or the economy, is a violation of the coalition agreement. But Kahlon is already in election-campaign mode. He’s out to snare the soft right, the center-right. Maybe those people, he hopes, will appreciate the responsibility he’s showing.</p> \n<p>One minister described the situation of the coalition in the period leading up to its dissolution as “death by a thousand cuts.” That American expression refers to a method of torture that was popular in imperial China.</p> \n<p>One serious cut that’s causing the ministers and MKs lots of pain is the ban on leaving the country that’s been imposed on them. Without their usual overseas forays every month or two, they’ll soon start showing signs of claustrophobia.</p> \n<p>And speaking of survival under extreme conditions: The new defense minister met midweek with commando troops. They sat at Netanyahu’s feet, masked, all eyes on him. He stood in the center of the circle, attired in a black battle-dress jacket, lit up like the moon on a stormy night. He also found time this week to visit the Israel Defense Forces National Induction Center, and have lunch and bond with the November crop of new recruits.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, who’s been prime minister for a total of almost 13 years, is discovering the joys of the portfolio that has charmed many good people before him. With soldiers there’s no fear of interruptions or complaints like the one from that boring nag in Kiryat Shmona. Leading up to the election we’ll probably see plenty of photos of him in the company of soldiers – after all, there’s nothing more flattering or consensual.</p> \n<p>It was reported this week that since assuming his new post as defense minister, Netanyahu has held a number of consultations on security matters with former chiefs of staff and defense ministers. The list is illuminating: Shaul Mofaz, Moshe Arens, MK Amir Peretz, Gabi Ashkenazi and Benny Gantz.</p> \n<p>Arens left the Defense Ministry 19 years ago; Mofaz, 12 years ago; and Peretz, 11 years ago. What could they possibly tell him that he doesn’t already know? And it was precisely the more relevant people, who held the defense portfolio in the past decade, who weren’t invited: Ehud Barak, Moshe Ya’alon and Avigdor Lieberman.</p> \n<p>Which goes to show that with Netanyahu everything is personal, not necessarily just business. He’s been friends for decades with Arens, who served as defense minister at the end of Netanyahu’s first term. He likes Peretz. With Mofaz, he didn’t have any really bitter disagreements, but if he did they’ve already made up. Gabi Ashkenazi isn’t wild about Netanyahu, but he hates Barak a lot more, so he’s qualified to be invited for a chat.</p> \n<p>The meeting with Gantz (whom for years he has referred to as a “wet noodle”), a potential rival of real heft, drove the press corps into a frenzy. They can relax. Netanyahu wanted to see what makes Gantz tick, sniff him out, form an impression. Call it “VISINT” or “HUMINT” – visual or human intelligence, in the lingo of the trade. Even if the two didn’t talk politics – due to the presence of the premier’s military secretary at the meeting – it was present, in the words that were exchanged, the hints that were dropped, in the things that were left unsaid, in the friendliness or antipathy displayed.</p> \n<p>All a-Twitter</p> \n<p>Some friendly advice to people interested in politics: Keep an eye on the tweets of coalition chairman David (Dudi) Amsalem (Likud), and pay attention to his media interviews. They are an effective means for discerning the content of the messages he has been receiving from the Prime Minister’s Bureau and the Balfour Street residence.</p> \n<p>“They take an excellent law, refer to it by the name ‘Gideon Sa’ar,’ and try to turn into something abominable,” tweeted an incredulous Amsalem this week. “The bill says something simple: The president will assign the duty of forming the government to the party head who has the support of the largest number of Knesset members.”</p> \n<p>Amsalem tends to echo every word dictated to him by Netanyahu or his Jonathan Urich de jour. The more absurd or mendacious the message, the more he will identify with it. This is one of his characteristics, typically accompanied by a self-righteous rolling of the eyes.</p> \n<p>About a month ago, Netanyahu himself, at his own birthday party, seemed to be accusing a “former government minister” of being behind the “plot of the century” against him – that is, an attempt to fraudulently deny him the mandate to form the government. It’s Sa’ar, his associates were told: He’s coordinating things with his friend, President Reuven Rivlin. That’s why it’s necessary to change the law so as to obligate the president to give the task of forming the next government, after the election, to a party chairman – not to “just any MK who has agreed” to it.</p> \n<p>Since then, several weeks have passed. The Prime Minister’s Bureau received reactions from the field. Likud members, the activists, weren’t buying the story. Some of Netanyahu’s associates even suggested that he was helping Sa’ar more than he was hurting him. The new situation demanded a change of approach: Don’t talk about it in personal terms, came the order to the MKs. Talk about the principle involved and about the powers of the president.</p> \n<p>The “Gideon Sa’ar bill” is the most recent obsession on Balfour Street. “Sa’ar” is today’s version of the Public Broadcasting Corporation, which preoccupied Netanyahu two years ago. Avigdor Lieberman got it right last week when he said that in contacts of his Yisrael Beiteinu associates with Likud politicians regarding a package deal meant to advance right-wing bills, they discovered that what interested their interlocutors, more than any ideological concerns, was the bill that bears the name of Netanyahu’s nemesis. For more details, refer to Amsalem.</p> \n<p>Gruesome twosome</p> \n<p>Avi Gabbay has had it with Tzipi Livni – with her endless search, like a restless butterfly collector, for alternative leaders for the center-left, as long as they’re not him. For a long time, Gabbay, Labor Party chairman, has spotted signs of lack of collegiality in MK Livni, head of Hatnuah, which together with his party forms Zionist Union. He sees her efforts to promote herself and her aims as harmful to the general interest of the center-left camp and to him in particular.</p> \n<p>The gloomy polls, the internal wrangling, the threat of a split within Labor and the incessant buzz about his murky future as party leader – all these are fraying his nerves. Which isn’t surprising. You’d have to be made of galvanized steel to withstand that daily battering. Gabbay is partaking of the menu that was offered to his many of his predecessors. The Labor Party, or Zionist Union by its current name, is a restaurant with few diners, and a kitchen staff of Shi’ite suicide bombers that know how to serve only one dish: bitter herbs.</p> \n<p>Two reports from the last week made Gabbay’s blood boil. One was published in this column, about a private survey commissioned by Livni to examine the number of seats Zionist Union would get with her as its leader (20, which is six or seven more than is predicted under Gabbay, according to other polls reported in the media). The second was a report by Ayala Hasson on TV Channel 10, according to which Livni and former Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon met – separately, a few hours apart – with Ehud Barak in his Assuta Tower home in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Livni explains that these meetings are part of her effort to attract serious people to Zionist Union, “in order to bring about an [electoral] upset.”</p> \n<p>But Gabbay has no illusions: The “upset” would amount to the party’s turning its back on him. He has no doubt that Livni and Barak were discussing ways to remove him as Labor leader; he’s discerned a systematic, deliberate campaign to unseat him. As part of that process, he recently had a visit from an emissary, who claimed to be speaking for himself, but whom Gabbay is convinced was sent by the gruesome twosome of Ehud &amp; Tzipi.</p> \n<p>That person made a suggestion: Gabbay, Barak, Gantz and Livni could meet and agree to conduct a series of polls to determine which of the four would be likely to garner the most Knesset seats as head of the center-left bloc. The winner would be crowned candidate for prime minister.</p> \n<p>Gabbay spotted a trap intended to lure him into the chute that leads cattle to the slaughterhouse. What’s the trap? Gantz, after all, won’t agree to the suggestion. Why should he? He’s riding high. He’s forming his own party. So in the end there will be three. The polls might show that Livni is more popular than Gabbay, but that’s an optical illusion, he believes. Her support is only from the left-center, and mainly from the left. Livni is incapable of getting even one-quarter of a Knesset seat from the right. She and Barak, with their anti-Bibi tweets, are playing by themselves in a sandbox.</p> \n<p>Gabbay believes that the intention behind the indecent suggestion was to bypass the results of last year’s Labor primary – and then to bypass him. “I was elected by a body of 57,000 people,” he was overheard saying. “They want to be elected on the basis of a sample poll of 500 people. That’s not going to happen. I won’t play the polls game.”</p> \n<p>The past week really set him off, and Gabbay decided to confront his subversive rival, as he sees Livni. They met on Monday at the Knesset. To describe their conversation as “rough” would be an understatement.</p> \n<p>“Instead of conducting polls about how we can win, you’re conducting polls about how to beat me, how to push me aside,” he told her. “All those surveys and meetings place only one question on the agenda: Who will should me?</p> \n<p>“You are weakening me and, indirectly, all of us,” he continued. “As long as I’m perceived as being temporary, as being a candidate for replacement, we will never recover in the polls. You should be seeing to it that I’m strengthened, not weakened. Every time you give an interview, you say, ‘only a [center-left] bloc, only a bloc’ – your message is that I and Zionist Union are not the solution but the problem.”</p> \n<p>In conversations with confidants, the Labor chairman says he regrets having appointed Livni head of the opposition in July, to replace Isaac Herzog, who became chairman of the Jewish Agency. The bitterness is understandable but it’s all wisdom in hindsight: In any case, he had no choice. She held a pistol to his temple in the form of a public threat to leave Zionist Union with her four Hatnuah MKs.</p> \n<p>Besides the uptick in Livni’s media appearances, Gabbay sees no electoral gain from her appointment. Before July, Zionist Union was getting an average of 15 seats in the polls. After Livni was appointed leader of the opposition, Zionist Union started faring worse in the polls. She hasn’t attracted new voters, rather perhaps she’s scared off some of the existing ones. Now the party is polling two to three fewer seats.</p> \n<p>Livni and Barak already tried, and both failed, Gabbay is saying in private conversations; they’re not new merchandise. They’re a trend that makes left-wingers feel good. The only game in town is Benny Gantz. His hookup with Labor is perfectly natural, Gabbay believes. In the end there are only two brands: Gantz, who will attract right-wing voters, and Labor, with its history and its roots.</p> \n<p>“If instead of talking every day and all day about hooking up and about a bloc, if you were to say that you support me, believe in me, and that Zionist Union is the thing, we would become stronger. Gantz will lose two seats [in the polls], we’ll go up to 16 and he’ll go down to 10, and then he’ll come to us,” Gabbay suggested, during his conversation with Livni.</p> \n<p>You don’t need to have particularly good ears to figure out, from what Gabbay is saying in closed forums, that he’s not ruling out the possibility of stepping aside in favor of Gantz. But first, let the latter come out of his hiding place, jump into the arena, give a few interviews and get scorched and scratched. Then it will become clear whether he’s made of the stuff a politician needs and whether his shares are worth anything or are a bad investment.</p> \n<p>I asked Gabbay how this saga will end. He said he didn’t want get into the issue any more, but that he did have a message for Livni, Barak, MKs, for all the conspirators and also the supporters. “There’s a chance for a turnaround, despite all the polls,” he observed. “I see it on the ground every day. People are fed up with Bibi, and on D-day they won’t vote for him. We can do it.”</p> \n<p>We received the following response from the office of the opposition head: “Since May 2013, I have been working to bring together those who share our path, in order to foment a turnover. That’s the reason for the founding of the Zionist Union, which created a lot of hope. My interest is the country’s welfare, and I hope that we will be wise enough to occupy ourselves with replacing the government and not with ourselves.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back on Sunday after police recommended indictments against him and his wife for bribery and other corruption charges, calling it a “witch hunt” and saying the investigation was “tainted from the start.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu was speaking at a Likud event marking the first night of Hanukkah. The event was opened by coalition head MK David Amsalem, who turned to the prime minister, saying:</p> \n<p>“Thousands of people came here to support you. We met this morning and you asked me why I’m sad. I think most people are sad today because of what’s happening, it’s unreasonable. We’re in a democratic state, and governments are changed at the ballot box, not by the police.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'Flush your iPhone': New details from Netanyahu bribery case&nbsp;■ Analysis:&nbsp;To survive three bribery cases, Netanyahu may push Israel's democracy to the brink</p> \n<p>After Amsalem, Netanyahu spoke, saying: “We are here to celebrate the victory of light over darkness. Listen to me, in the end, the light always prevails. ... Hanukkah might be a holiday of miracles, but I have to ask you: How did they know to publish these absurd recommendations against Sara and me exactly on the police commissioner’s last day? What can I tell you, a real Hanukkah miracle. “But what did you expect?” he continued.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Even before the first investigation started, they already determined and leaked that these would be the recommendations, so what’s new? You can’t expect a different result after the deluge of leaks from the investigations and a daily brainwashing in the media.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has dismissed various corruption allegations as attempts by the media and his enemies to destroy him politically.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu sharply assailed the police and its outgoing commissioner, Roni Alsheich. “The heads of the system insolently claimed that I’d sent investigators and that Sara had sent someone to complain about the chief investigator for sexual harassment,” he said, referring to the Roni Ritman case involving the head of the police anti-fraud unit.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Those same officers continued investigating me and Sara even though they were in a direct conflict of interest. How can you conduct an unbiased investigation like that?” He continued, “I don’t know who the next police commissioner will be, but I know one thing – he’ll have a lot of rehabilitation to do, since the public’s trust in the police is not at its peak.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu referred to the evidentiary basis underlying cases 2000 and 4000, according to each of which he received or intended to receive a bribe in the form of favorable media coverage. “I don’t think it’s healthy that the police in a democracy investigate relations between politicians and journalists. But if you do, then do it thoroughly. Tens of ministers and Knesset members were not investigated, including key witness [Yesh Atid leader] Yair Lapid, who secretly met [Yedioth publisher] Arnon Mozes dozens of times.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;Everyone acted in order to pass a law which would shut down the daily Israel Hayom, a law which without my stiff opposition would have passed, giving Mozes millions. Many of those Knesset members enjoyed favorable coverage in Yedioth Ahronoth and on Ynet, its online affiliate. Not only favorable, it was pampering coverage. No one touches them, and me, who buried that law, I’m the one investigated? It’s absurd. If it’s not Bibi there’s no investigation.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu added: “Israel is a state where the rule of law applies, in which police recommendations have no legal validity. Only recently, a host of recommendations against mayors were rejected. They ended in nothing. And here too you know how it will end – ‘There will be nothing – ” and the crowd chanted, “Because there is nothing.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In closing, Netanyahu made it clear he does not intend to resign. “Hanukkah is a festival of courage and persistence. We persist, I persist, the investigations have not deflected me and the recommendations won’t deflect me either from the really important matters.” Earlier, sounds of an anti-Netanyahu demonstration could be heard outside.</p>",

        "text":["<p>An American audience might find it easier to follow the latest brouhaha surrounding Benjamin Netanyahu and his legal problems if it thinks of Netanyahu as Donald Trump, of outgoing police chief Roni Alsheich as a more flamboyant and erratic Robert Mueller, and of Netanyahu’s Likud colleagues as the Israeli version of kowtowing GOP stalwarts, who fear their party leader more than their consciences.</p> \n<p>Everything will seem familiar now: The police have just recommended that Netanyahu be charged with bribery in the so-called Bezeq affair, just as they did in two previous reports on the prime minister’s alleged corruption. Rather than respond to the suspicions or explain the circumstances surrounding the details that have already been made public, Netanyahu preferred to cast himself as an innocent victim being framed by a corrupt police force. His toadies, including government ministers and members of the Knesset, eagerly disseminated his corrosive message far and wide.</p> \n<p>At a rally held on Sunday night to light the first candle of Hanukkah, Netanyahu let loose on his investigators. The police recommendations in the Bezeq affair, Netanyahu asserted, “were determined and leaked to the media even before the investigations started.” Police were conducting a “manhunt” against him. In other words, the charges against him are, excuse the expression, totally trumped up. The prime minister is being framed.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Unable to charm the media, Netanyahu sought to control it | Analysis ■ Case 4000 and the abuse of the Israeli public | Analysis ■ Netanyahu must resign | Editorial</p> \n<p>“Nothing will come out of it because there’s nothing to it,” Netanyahu repeated his favorite retort to the allegations against him. If there’s really nothing to it, as he asserts, then the police spent millions of government shekels, interrogated scores of witnesses and wasted thousands of investigator hours in order to turn Netanyahu’s nothing-burger into a thick and well documented criminal file. If this were true, it would constitute a putsch that, in any normal country, would require that the police command be disbanded forthwith and its commanders put on trial.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to tell whether Netanyahu believes his own malarkey. On the one hand, someone who thinks that he’s up against nothing doesn’t go out and hire top-flight criminal lawyers, as Netanyahu did last week. On the other hand, after decades of casting himself as the victim, Netanyahu may have forgotten that it was just an act. Like his friend Trump, Netanyahu may also believe in a worldwide conspiracy out to get him, no matter what it takes.</p> \n<p>If you change the name and the scenery, Netanyahu’s Hanukkah rally was classic Trump-style rabble rousing, streamed directly on live TV, over the heads of the hostile media. He portrayed himself as a martyr, savaged by the left for his “Israel-First” positions, subject to defamation and false accusations by their agents on the ground, in media and law enforcement. The base and its gullibility are the cornerstones of both Trump’s and Netanyahu’s political modus operandi.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu must think it’s reasonable for a sitting prime minister to attack the police and to undermine public trust in its integrity for his own personal, political and legal purposes. Either he is a master con man who will stop at nothing, or he suffers from megalomaniac narcissism that leads him to believe that he and the state are one and the same, his welfare and Israel’s wellbeing are intertwined and his rule is so vital that it justifies any dastardly deed needed to preserve it.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu exploited the misguided timing of the publication of the police report – on the last day of Alsheich’s tenure – to imply that it proved Alsheich’s malevolence or in some way negated the findings of the police report. The timing, however, was significant in another sense: It caused the publication of the police findings against Netanyahu to overlap with the separate controversy that erupted after a committee headed by former Supreme Court Justice Eliezer Goldberg nixed Police Minister Gilad Erdan’s candidate to replace Alsheich, Chico Edri. Rather than accepting the findings of the vetting committee, which was set up by the government itself, Erdan announced that he would ignore Goldberg and urge the government to approve Edri’s appointment nonetheless. Erdan’s bruised ego took precedence over good governance, never mind the blow to the prestige and credibility of a police force headed by an officer tainted by the government’s own committee.</p> \n<p>But while Netanyahu and Erdan’s battles are designed for their personal needs – Netanyahu is fighting for survival and Erdan for his image – Habayit Hayehudi leader Naftali Bennett is talking revolution. Bennett and his sidekick, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, were the first to back Erdan and call on the government to simply ignore Goldberg and do away with vetting committees altogether. Two weeks ago, Bennett savaged the army’s advocate general for much the same reasons.</p> \n<p>Bennett and Shaked want to remove legal and ethical shackles that still confine the government’s freedom of action. They want to take the good out of good governance. They seek to get rid of all the checks and balances that might thwart their plan to change Israel’s religious democracy into a settler-dominated theocracy that does what it pleases, ignoring such antiquated values as separation of powers, checks and balances, the rule of law and human rights. Netanyahu and Erdan – along with wannabe cultural commissar Miri Regev – provide the fuel with which Bennett and Shaked hope to burn the house down and build a more Jewish and less democratic structure instead.</p> \n<p>As things stand, this will be the central and fateful question facing Israelis in the upcoming elections. Netanyahu’s personal fortunes will be intertwined with the religious-nationalist campaign to get rid of all the institutions and functionaries that prevent it from governing as it sees fit. Their enemies list reads like a blueprint of Israeli democracy, as it once was: Not only the Supreme Court, which Shaked is “fixing,” or the Justice Ministry, over which she rules, or the legal advisers of government ministries, who will soon be appointed directly by their political masters, or the police, which Netanyahu is now targeting. Bennett and Shaked ultimately hope to suborn the presidency, the army and even the Shin Bet to their purposes, when the time is right.</p> \n<p>So that the next elections will be about more than Likud or Labor, Netanyahu or someone else, left or right, peace or war, etc. It will be a ballot that will determine the essence of Israel in the future. Its results will determine whether the right-wing bulldozer will finally crush what is left of Israel’s once proud democracy and build in its stead a system with a constitution that includes one solitary clause: To do as it’s told.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s probably unique in crowdfunding to raise money to provide psychological treatment for Israel Defense Forces combat soldiers who served in military campaigns, in this case Operation Protective Edge, and are suffering from trauma.</p> \n<p>Ganem: I can’t really relate to crowdfunding. When I entered the website and saw that people were raising money to get a book published, or for a new app, it really bugged me. I said: Am I now supposed to turn my friends’ trauma into a four-minute video?</p> \n<p>But you did it.</p> \n<p>I simply had no choice.</p> \n<p>Let’s go back to the beginning of the squad’s story – or maybe, better, to the beginning of your military career.</p> \n<p>I was born and raised in Sajour, a Druze village in the north. In the ninth grade, as is usual in our community, I switched to a military boarding school. Roy Peles, whom we’ll talk about in a moment, and I were already rising stars during our basic training [in an elite unit of the Nahal Brigade]. We were marked. We were sent to a squad leaders’ course, where we became soulmates. We were commanders of a group of new recruits, and then we went to an officers course. Actually, we both dreamed of the same posting after the course: to return as officers for the new recruits whom we commanded as squad commanders. In the end Roy, the outstanding athlete, got that post. I remember that he came out of the meeting with the battalion commander positively jumping with joy – and I understood immediately that he’d got the nod and that I was going to be stuck at some dark and depressing new recruits base. We completed Bahad 1 [Officers Training School] in June 2014. Roy got the squad and went with them to the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>What happened with you?</p> \n<p>Just as I thought, I was stuck on a base of new recruits, bored and frustrated. On the weekend when Operation Protective Edge broke out my family wasn’t in the country. I decided to take advantage of the opportunity of my uptight mother being away, and I went to the staging areas.</p> \n<p>What does that term mean?</p> \n<p>The areas outside the Gaza Strip, on this side of the border, where the support troops for the soldiers fighting inside are stationed. They bring in food and equipment and evacuate the wounded. An officer in a staging area is a rare commodity, because everyone is involved in the fighting inside, so they were very happy to see me. At night I slept among piles of donated deodorant and candy. Suddenly I heard people starting to shout and run, and I realized that something serious had happened. The first rumor was that an officer had been killed [on Friday, July 25, 2014, at night].</p> \n<p>Did you think it was Roy?</p> \n<p>I never imagined it might be someone I knew. I stopped a vehicle and asked them to take me to the command post, fast. On the way I opened the window and heard a kind of sound like a bottle being opened, and I realized that the incident hadn’t ended, because there was mortar fire. At the command post, I was briefed on the situation, and then I heard on the radio network that the “black unit” was going in – a unit of religiously observant soldiers with dogs.</p> \n<p>I’m speechless.</p> \n<p>You understand what they do, and you know why they are being sent in.</p> \n<p>What were you told about the events inside?</p> \n<p>At about 10 P.M. soldiers, including Roy and his squad, took up positions in a house and prepared for an attack on the casbah of Beit Hanun. A few minutes afterward Kornet [anti-tank] missiles were fired into the house. Roy took a direct hit and was killed on the spot. [He was 21 years old.] Another missile hit the floor below and 10 soldiers were wounded.</p> \n<p>Most of them seriously. Please explain about the Kornets – they’ve been in the headlines lately.</p> \n<p>The Kornet is one of the most sophisticated missiles. It can be fired long distances and is extremely destructive. There are very few Kornet lauchers in the Gaza Strip, and that night one of them targeted the building. Roy took a direct hit, so his body couldn’t be found. At midnight, the brigade commander announced a cease-fire via the radio network. The Israeli troops would be leaving Gaza at 5 the following morning. Afterward I understood that there had been a real argument between the battalion commander, who refused to leave without Roy, and the brigade commander, who said: “You’re out at 5.” So, after the complicated evacuation of the wounded was completed, they still had to find Roy’s body, under hysterical time pressure. They didn’t give up. The noise I’d heard – the mortars – was cover fire for the search. It took until 4:30 A.M. to find the body.</p> \n<p>What did you do then?</p> \n<p>I half-slept on some armored personnel carrier, next to the guy who was in charge of identifying bodies. He woke me up at 5 to help him with the stretcher with the deceased. Two armored vehicles arrived. We unloaded equipment, all of it covered with blood, from the first one. On the other one was the body, wrapped in a curtain from the house. I had never seen a dead body. I took down the stretcher. Suddenly I realized that something was wrong, that everything was quiet around me, that everyone was trying to avoid looking at me. I grabbed the guy in charge of identifying bodies and simply pushed him up against the vehicle by force.</p> \n<p>“You’re going to tell me now who it is,” I demanded. He said, “It’s Peles, ‘bro.” I ran to the stretcher. I saw that part of the kneepad was sticking out. And I recognized the mark Roy made on his equipment: P.R. It was him. I grasped that it really was him. And I… I don’t know. I can’t say what went through my head, what I thought. I only know that suddenly my phone rings, and who should it be but Hagit – Roy’s mother. She was supposed to come that morning with care packages.</p> \n<p>And she didn’t know what happened.</p> \n<p>She hadn’t yet been officially notified.</p> \n<p>Wow, I can’t breathe.</p> \n<p>I spoke to her only after I was sure she already knew. Hagit is truly an exceptional woman. I remember every word of that conversation. “Good morning, Omri” – like that, perfectly cool. “Do you know what happened?” I said. “Of course, I’m here.” And then she says, “All right, so come over.” I went to her place in Tel Aviv. The house had already begun to fill up with people. From that point on everything becomes a blur. I don’t even remember where I slept that night, what exactly happened.</p> \n<p>Understandable.</p> \n<p>That weekend another friend of mine, Liad Lavie, who had been wounded, also died. I’d visited him in the hospital before going to the front, but I hadn’t realized how serious the situation was. Roy’s funeral was held on Sunday, Liad’s on Monday. On Tuesday I was informed that I was being transferred to a new position, replacing Roy. “The vehicle that took him out will take you in.”</p> \n<p>You tell this story as though it happened to someone else.</p> \n<p>I really can’t say what I felt. I put on my gear and went in to meet Roy’s troops. I get there and something like six soldiers are standing there. That’s what was left of the squad. All the rest were in the hospital. And they’re totally wiped out. I didn’t know what to say to them. In the end I came out with, “Okay, this is as bad as it will get. From here on it’s only up.” They still laugh at me about it.</p> \n<p>What did they tell you?</p> \n<p>Nothing.</p> \n<p>You didn’t talk about what had happened? About Roy?</p> \n<p>No.</p> \n<p>Why not?</p> \n<p>I don’t know. It’s a Pandora’s box. We didn’t want to open it. They were still in training. They’d only been in the army for a year then. Not some kind of gnarled fighters who have seen a thing or two in their time. They left the base and suddenly ran into a war. Their commander was killed in front of their eyes. Half the squad was simply wiped out.</p> \n<p>How could you not have talked about it?</p> \n<p>Do you get it? I took over the squad, I went through the rest of the war with them, I ran with them until their discharge – and I never grasped how badly they were hurting, what happened to their souls.</p> \n<p>What about your soul?</p> \n<p>Gone. Nonexistent. I don’t know what to tell you. On automatic pilot. I went on running with them. We took in new soldiers. We called ourselves the “Ganem-Peles squad.” They did amazing work. I felt that it was a success, that I took them to a situation of being a superb squad. Our ways parted in 2016 – they were discharged and I went on to my next post.</p> \n<p>Did you stay in touch?</p> \n<p>Mostly through WhatsApp. We didn’t meet much after that, because I was a long way off.</p> \n<p>When did you understand that there was a problem?</p> \n<p>It took time. First I heard, by a roundabout route, that two soldiers from the squad had thought about ending their lives. Last Memorial Day I met a few of them at Roy’s annual commemoration, and the idea came up for us all to meet and talk about what had happened. Four years after that black night, we met at a lovely spot by Alexander Creek. Almost everyone showed up. That’s where I was hit by the real bombshell. They talked about what had happened there. People cried. Broke down. Talked about what happened to them</p> \n<p>What had happened to them?</p> \n<p>Nothing good. Some had disconnected completely from the squad and we didn’t hear from them. You know what the hardest thing for me was at that meeting? That suddenly the penny dropped and I realized that four years had passed, and that neither my friends nor I had shared what we went through in Operation Protective Edge. Not with friends. Not with family. Not with partners. Not with anyone.</p> \n<p>When they did start to share, what did they say about that night? If they’d never talked about it, that means each person had only one piece of the puzzle.</p> \n<p>That’s what happened, and it made me understand how powerful it would be if we all underwent therapy together. One of us had been wounded very seriously that night. The army wanted to discharge him, but he insisted on staying in. During his service he wanted to put an end to his life. His trauma from that night is that everyone was calling to him and shouting, “Medic, medic, help” – but he couldn’t get up, because he had taken shrapnel in his leg. That’s the trauma that was burned into him: Everyone around him was dying and he tried to get up and couldn’t.</p> \n<p>We also have to remember that it all happened in darkness.</p> \n<p>That darkness shimmers for everyone, in flashes. Total darkness, no turning on flashlights, you don’t know what’s happening with you, what’s going on around you. You don’t even realize you’ve been wounded, because you’re on an incredible adrenaline rush. Some people didn’t realize they’d been wounded until they got outside. Our deputy company commander, for example, took a piece of shrapnel in the leg; it took him two days to realize he was wounded.</p> \n<p>You weren’t there, in that room. So it was also the first time you’d heard the whole story.</p> \n<p>One of the soldiers from the squad, who is now in a process of recognizing that he has PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder], said: ‘When I see a fountain, I see splashes of blood.’ That’s what they went through in that room. Blood. Screams. “Help me.” Shots from outside. The knowledge that another missile might hit at any time. Yonatan Herbelin, who wrote a book about it, was part of the medical team that treated the wounded. His trauma was the most powerful. He told about how they evacuated the wounded, and every time they went in they were trembling with fear, afraid to see which of them would pull someone who was dead or wounded out of the dark. He collapsed there.</p> \n<p>Another member of the squad, an outstanding soldier, said he later flew to South America, entered his room in a hostel in Cusco [Peru], and couldn’t make himself go outside. He felt that the streets were full of people who wanted to kill him. He called his father and asked him to come. His father immediately got on a plane, took his son and brought him home. He told us about it when we were sitting in a circle, and I saw the shock on everyone’s face. We were sure that he was one of those who came through it okay. So was he, the strong hero, also shattered? We understood that everyone had been traumatized differently.</p> \n<p>And then you decided that you would all undergo therapy – a very specific form of therapy.</p> \n<p>It was then that I grasped the depth of the problem, but I had absolutely no solution. One night, when I was at a bar [a few months ago], I suddenly get a call from Ido, who was the company commander who led the force that night. “Ganem,” he tells me, “there was a report on TV about the unit in Shujaiyeh [referring to survivors of an incident in a Gaza town in which seven Israeli soldiers were killed in an APC]. They underwent group therapy in Romania. I don’t care how hard we have to work or how we get there, but we’re going to do that therapy.”</p> \n<p>Why that specific therapy?</p> \n<p>Because in the report, when the deputy company commander was asked why he embarked on that journey, he replies, “Because I am responsible for my soldiers, for them getting back to their lives.” He made me realize that I had the same responsibility. The very next day I contacted the nonprofit group that offers the therapy – together with Hagit, Roy’s mother, who’s been fighting alongside me for this from the first moment.</p> \n<p>A special woman.</p> \n<p>Very. It’s hard to explain just how special. She’s involved in this with all her soul. She says that maybe she can’t help her son anymore, but she can help other kids.</p> \n<p>Tell me a little about the therapy you want to undergo.</p> \n<p>Path to Tomorrow [Bashvil Hamachar] is a nonprofit organization that was established after the Second Lebanon War [2006] and it specializes in arranging treatment for traumatized soldiers.</p> \n<p>It’s funded by the Defense Ministry, isn’t it?</p> \n<p>In very small part. Most of the funding is from donations. The principle is that therapy is experienced together – and in a natural setting. First there are personal interviews with the therapists, then there’s a two-day get-acquainted meeting, and afterward we go on a hike in the Carpathian Mountains, in rugged conditions. There, every day, with the therapists, more layers are peeled away. The wounds are reopened and then closed properly. It’s like the biggest fear – to talk about that night – becomes something else.</p> \n<p>Something therapeutic.</p> \n<p>If you ask someone from our squad to tell you today about what happened in Gaza, he’ll go in his pants. I was told that this journey is a life-changer, because for the first time you face the trauma head-on. You understand that it is part of you and of who you are. It was also explained to me that it’s important to deal with trauma soon after the event.</p> \n<p>With time it becomes embedded in the psyche and becomes part of every experience.</p> \n<p>Do you know whom the organization treats mostly? People aged 40 with children. At the age of 40-plus, suddenly their army service blows up in their face.</p> \n<p>Does the whole squad want to undergo therapy? Aren’t there any who are against it?</p> \n<p>There are. One of the medics, for example, blames himself because one of his friends was wounded. It doesn’t matter how many times the person who was wounded tells him that it wasn’t his fault, that there was nothing he could have done. He just can’t shake it. He can’t look his friend in the eyes; he’s broken off from him completely. My dream is for him to come with us and free himself of it. A few said, “Leave me alone, I’m all right, it’s behind me, why do you want to drag me to Romania to open old wounds?” But I’m insisting. I know it’s not behind anyone.</p> \n<p>Do you know when I understood how traumatized my friends are? I was a patient in Ichilov Hospital not long ago. A few friends came to visit, and we were sitting there, at night, in the caf&eacute; across the road. Suddenly, right opposite us, a motorcycle runs into a bus and the driver is thrown into the air. I turn and look at my buddies. One of them, a medic, suddenly jumps up and does a sprint, runs as fast as he can – in the other direction. I ran to the injured person, but he just fled. I can say the same about myself – to this day, my mother doesn’t know what happened that night.</p> \n<p>You said earlier that no one from the squad shared.</p> \n<p>The day after I started the crowdfunding campaign, the mother of one of the soldiers called me and said, “Omri, listen well, even if I have to give you my whole salary you’re going on that journey. I want my son back. He doesn’t say a word to me. He comes home, but it’s like he’s not really there. He escaped and hasn’t returned.” That conversation really finished me, the conversation with the mother begging for her son’s life.</p> \n<p>It feels as though we should blame the system in this case. To ask how it’s possible that soldiers have to raise money in order to treat themselves. But it’s clear that the system can’t be responsive to everyone.</p> \n<p>I don’t blame the Defense Ministry. It’s not a bad organization. It’s an organization that works in binary terms: Either you’re diagnosed with PTSD, and then you get therapy, or you’re not diagnosed, and it’s, “See you later.” So everyone who’s not diagnosed with PTSD is all right?</p> \n<p>Do you know how many IDF soldiers are currently diagnosed with PTSD? Take a guess.</p> \n<p>Twenty-five hundred?</p> \n<p>Nearly 5,000. You were closer than I was. I thought it would be tens of thousands.</p> \n<p>The thing is that it really is tens of thousands. But those are the transparent ones. They’re the ones who carry their trauma quietly. Who are afraid to admit that they’re hurting.</p> \n<p>And the procedure also isn’t simple.</p> \n<p>We have one soldier on the squad who’s in the process [of applying for recognition of his disability at the Defense Ministry]. You have to sign an affidavit, you get a few assessment meetings, after which it’s decided whether there’s justification for treatment. And then the diagnosis process starts. You know what the wackiest part is? Since he started the therapy, he’s been incapable of getting out of bed. The psychologist or psychiatrist who met with him scratched all his wounds, took him back that night, asked him the toughest questions and then told him, “All right, in another few weeks I’ll conclude the review and then we’ll decide what to do with you.” In the meantime he’s stuck in bed.</p> \n<p>Generally, when there’s a failure in a large system, private organizations enter the vacuum. Here the vacuum is endless. How many PTSDs are walking around among us, who haven’t had and won’t have a response?</p> \n<p>I know that things are happening. That a pilot program has been started in Givati [infantry brigade], for example – mental preparation for discharge through trauma processing. Maybe the army will understand that in the end it pays off to do a kind of preventive psychological treatment. That could prevent a great many cases of trauma afterward.</p> \n<p>This is an organization that has become used to the idea that soldiers’ mental problems, up to a certain level, are theirs and their families’. What should the system learn from your case?</p> \n<p>That the experiences need to be processed. If our soldiers had undergone some sort of processing of what we experienced – a day, a month, a year after the event – some of us would be in a far better situation today.</p> \n<p>What about before? Why, for example, don’t soldiers get psychological preparation?</p> \n<p>I was a company commander for a year and a half. I never spoke with my soldiers about these things.</p> \n<p>And you never got preparation as a soldier.</p> \n<p>No. Look, there’s a unit that deals with psychological problems, which you can contact and get a response. I don’t know how effective it is.</p> \n<p>Maybe before we think about a systemic response, soldiers have to be taught to speak up, to share. To eradicate the macho norms. It’s insane that you came to these soldiers three days after the disaster and yet you didn’t talk about it.</p> \n<p>I agree. In the army, feelings aren’t something you put on the table. You don’t talk about feelings. Certainly not with combat soldiers. But I’d say that this conception is beginning to change: As a company commander, I saw that officers under me talked a little with their units about sharing. But we belong to the previous generation.</p> \n<p>You want to raise 200,000 shekels [about $54,000]. How far are you from your goal?</p> \n<p>A few tens of thousands of shekels.</p> \n<p>You know, it’s not such a vast amount, so how do you account for the fact that you haven’t been able to raise it so far?</p> \n<p>I approached a great many people of means – I completely lost my shame. But I discovered that there’s a problem. It’s hard for people to identify with others who have psychological problems. It’s not sexy. We joke about it in our unit and say that those who were wounded physically were saved. The army and dozens of additional organizations embrace them in every possible way. But what about the invisible hurt? One of my soldiers, who’s in a really bad mental state, takes a dig at his wounded buddy and says to him, “‘Bro, you have a car, you have good conditions, you swim at the disabled veterans’ center. But me, the only pool I have is the pool of my tears.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“I don’t know who the next police commissioner will be,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech to activists from his Likud party. “But he’ll have a very tough job of rehabilitation to do. The public’s faith in the police isn’t at an all-time high.”</p> \n<p>Actually, nobody knows who the next prime minister will be, but he’ll have a huge rehabilitation job to do. He’ll have to repair democracy, stop the witch hunt against the legal gatekeepers, return sanity to the system, clear the corridors of power of corruption and corrupt people, and end the culture of lies and incitement, of sowing hatred and division.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; What's at stake for Netanyahu after police recommend bribery charges | Explained</p> \n<p>Netanyahu seemed panicked, on the verge of hysteria, at his party’s Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony in Ramat Gan Sunday night. He devoted a long speech to current events and spent a considerable portion of it attacking his investigators and outgoing Police Commissioner Roni Alsheich. Then he discussed the facts of Case 4000 as he sees them: There was nothing wrong with the decisions he made as communications minister regarding Bezeq, the corporation owned by Shaul Elovitch, his good friend and, if the Israel Police have their way, a codefendant in the case.</p> \n<p>But all this was irrelevant. The premier is allowed to lash out at Alsheich; it makes good headlines. But it has no legal significance.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; For Netanyahu's supporters, bribery recommendations only serve to support his narrative | Analysis</p> \n<p>The phrase “a relationship of bribery” between the politician and the businessman, backed by countless pieces of evidence of all types, is what matters. The documents, the money, the taped statements are what will talk, not the wild, aggressive speeches by a serial suspect who feels the noose tightening around his neck.</p> \n<p>Like a drowning man grasping at straws, Netanyahu pulled out everything he had – and it wasn’t much – to stigmatize his investigators as biased or corrupt in the best case and as criminals in the worst: the dubious police investigation of senior Israel Defense Forces officer Gal Hirsch; Alsheich’s hiring of former Labor Party activist Lior Chorev as his media adviser; and so on and so forth.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu fired in all directions – “crazy claims,” “a clear conflict of interests,” “a completely tainted process,” “tendentious leaks” and “there will be nothing because there is nothing.” The audience was enthusiastic, the Knesset members nodded in agreement.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read the Haaretz investigation that started it all: The Israeli news site in Netanyahu's pocket</p> \n<p>But the ball is already in the prosecution’s court and will eventually land on Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit’s desk. The decisions will be made, or so at least we hope, on the basis of the evidence, not on the weeping and wailing.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu and his wife, the eternally oppressed Sara, were obsessed with getting favorable coverage from media outlets that aren’t necessarily among the country’s most influential. And this obsession apparently led him to the criminal conduct described in the police’s conclusions. His actions are suspected of enriching Elovitch to the tune of 700 million shekels ($190 million).</p> \n<p>Eventually, the public will become acquainted with the testimony and tapes provided by the two men who turned state’s evidence – then-Communications Ministry director general Shlomo Filber, who is now presenting himself as an innocent lamb, a paragon of integrity; and Nir Hefetz, the Netanyahu family’s media adviser, who left a path of destruction in his wake everywhere he went.</p> \n<p>The main question is what Netanyahu’s goal is. There’s no doubt that he sees being prime minister as a flak jacket. In his view, he must be a sitting prime minister when the time comes for his pre-indictment hearing with Mendelblit – and preferably, following an election in which he has received a new mandate from the public to rule. That’s the first hurdle in his path.</p> \n<p>After that, will he opt for a convenient plea bargain, or will he prefer to go to trial? He himself probably doesn’t know yet.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Netanyahu is tightening his grip on his submissive party and his governing coalition. On Sunday, the High Court of Justice gave the government another extension – presumably the last, but who knows? – of the deadline for enacting a new conscription law. There are now an extra six weeks, until mid-January, to vote on the bill.</p> \n<p>At that point, either the Knesset will be dissolved and a new election will be called for mid-May, or the government will drag on for another two months, until the Knesset’s spring recess, and the election will be held in September. The decision will be made by one man only, based solely on what he believes will best serve him in his legal battle.</p> \n<p>Likud Knesset members and ministers, some of whom are already on edge over the delayed round of cabinet appointments, will vie with each other over who can express the most support for the serial suspect. Most have been careful not to deviate from the prime minister’s talking points. The phrase “selective enforcement” has recurred again and again, as have accusations that the police “picked its target in advance” and so forth.</p> \n<p>Even those ministers who normally exhibit a fa&ccedil;ade of statesmanlike behavior have come out looking ridiculous with their vapid remarks. “I’m certain there’s no basis for the police recommendations,” declared Science Minister Ofir Akunis. Certain? On what basis? “I’m certain the attorney general won’t accept the recommendations,” added Social Equality Minister Gila Gamliel in a tweet.</p> \n<p>Let them fawn. They’re in favor of a loyalty to royalty law.</p> \n<p>Another recurrent motif has been the assault on Alsheich, who ostensibly chose to end his term as police commissioner with publication of these recommendations. Unfortunately, this transparent spin has even crept into media analyses. The pundits sat in the television studios with grave faces and rebuked the commissioner: Why didn’t he publish all this a week or two ago? How scandalous.</p> \n<p>Naive viewers could easily have been persuaded that two issues of equal weight lie in the balance – the suspicions against the prime minister and his wife, on one side, and the timing of the recommendations’ publication on the other.</p> \n<p>The timing of all this is fishy? Could be. The police chief is vindictive? Perhaps. But all of that is dwarfed when compared to suspicions pending against Netanyahu&nbsp;in three cases&nbsp;– and this one is the most serious.</p>",

        "text":["<p>To the Good People of Sderot,</p> \n<p>First, allow me to express my deepest appreciation for the steadfastness and resolve that you, and all the good people in the Gaza area, have demonstrated in the face of a very difficult situation. No normal country would tolerate it. My heart goes out to you.</p> \n<p>Please note, however, that I did not say that the situation is “unacceptable” – it clearly is not. The fact is that you have been living with it for 20 years. The people in the south have had to live with difficult challenges in the past, as well. We have forgotten, but the “fedayeen” attacks in the 1950s caused far greater casualties.</p> \n<p>Residents of northern Israel have faced even tougher situations for 40 years and may very well have to do so again soon. During the second intifada, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv bore the brunt of the violence. We did not hear allegations of regional discrimination at the time.</p> \n<p>There is a price to be paid for our national independence and those who pay it are usually, but not always, in the border areas.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Pushing for an Israeli Victory Is the Only Way to End the Conflict With the Palestinians</p> \n<p>No, your blood is not less red than that of the people who live in Tel Aviv. As human beings, we are all equal. But you know as well as I do, that in the strategic and political reality we live in, there is a difference between Tel Aviv and Sderot and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying knowingly. Various good souls may be telling you that there is a military solution to the problem, that if we just hit them hard enough one more time and allow the IDF to win, the problem will be solved. The truth is, it will not. There is no solution for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>Maybe you do not remember anymore. Rocket attacks began well before the disengagement from Gaza, continued under center-left, right-wing and hard-right governments, and under a series of chiefs of staff. Believe me, our generals today are as good and courageous as their predecessors. Do you think that either they, or I, do not want to hit Hamas hard, really stick it to them? The nature of military threats and warfare has changed, not just in our region, but the world over, and the days of grand military victories are gone.</p> \n<p>Even the United States, the most powerful country on earth, has been unable to defeat the insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. In wars against nonstate actors, unlike wars against states, there are no decisive outcomes.</p> \n<p>We can conduct a large-scale ground operation and conquer all of Gaza. But even the great heroes (in their own minds), Avigdor Lieberman and Naftali Bennett, are against this today, and rightly so. If we topple Hamas, it is unclear who will take over and it could certainly be far worse if, for example, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad or ISIS were in control. If we destroy Hamas’s rocket arsenal it will be replenished rapidly. Above all, a major ground operation will entail tens of casualties, even hundreds if we try to topple Hamas. With all due respect for your suffering, it just does not justify the cost.</p> \n<p>We can, of course, conduct an aerial operation. Maybe you didn’t notice, but that’s exactly what the Air Force did, quite successfully, in the last round. And don’t let them lie to you about this either; there just are not that many good targets left in Gaza to attack, targets whose destruction would have a significant impact on the situation. We already attacked the primary civilian infrastructure targets. Hamas, as an organization, does not offer many critical targets.</p> \n<p>It is true that we no longer have significant deterrence – nor will we in the future. Deterrence only works if the adversary has something to lose. The situation in Gaza, however, has become so desperate that the people do not have that much to lose anymore. Hamas’s total misrule, together with the destruction that we have wreaked, caused this situation, and it is very hard to deter terrorist organizations in the best of circumstances.</p> \n<p>Honestly, I have had it with all the nonsense about Hamas’ great victory in the recent round. The Arabs have been celebrating their great “victories” ever since the War of Independence in 1948. Look where it has gotten them – and where we are. Let’s keep a sense of proportion.</p> \n<p>The truth that neither I, nor other politicians, wish to tell you – and which you do not want to hear – is that we will have to manage the conflict and gird ourselves to live with it for quite some time. At the same time, will also have to conduct occasional and limited air attacks, to ease the pressure on you somewhat, and to invest billions in a crash program to deploy a nearly complete national rocket shield, as well as passive defenses, such as shelters.</p> \n<p>We also have to hold diplomatic talks with Egypt, Qatar and anyone willing to listen, in order to bring about calm and prolong the lull until the next round. In the long-term, we either have to reach a settlement with the Palestinians, or separate from them, but that is a story for other lies that we tell you.</p> \n<p>And that, my good people of Sderot, is part of the problem. You want us to lie to you. I understand. It is hard to accept that we will have to continue living with this difficult situation for a long time. The human spirit seeks a solution, a strong response. You must, however, learn to live with the situation. Otherwise we will have to continue lying to you. We have become pretty good at it.</p> \n<p>With you, until the next round.</p> \n<p>Bibi</p> \n<p>Chuck Freilich, a former deputy Israeli national security adviser, is a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Belfer Center and author of &quot;Israeli National Security: A New Strategy for an Era of Change&quot; (Oxford University Press, April 2018).

        "text":["<p>The High Court of Justice will have to decide if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has to resign if he is indicted in the corruption cases against him, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit said on Monday.</p> \n<p>“In principle, my position is to act according to the law and the rulings of the Supreme Court,&quot; the attorney general said during a session of the State Control Committee, in the Knesset.</p> \n<p>&quot;In the case of a cabinet minister, there is a clear ruling of the Supreme Court to the effect that after a decision is made to file of an indictment against him, the minister must resign from his post. As for the prime minister, this is a not simple question, it certainly will reach the High Court, and then it will have to decide on this matter, too,” Mendelblit told the committee.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;For Netanyahu's supporters, bribery recommendations only serve to support his narrative&nbsp;■&nbsp;Explained:&nbsp;What's at stake for Netanyahu after police recommend bribery charges</p> \n<p>If Netanyahu is indicted, the attorney general will still have to express his own opinion, in principle, as to whether the prime minister must resign, even before a petition is submitted to the High Court on the matter – whether it comes from the public or Netanyahu himself. The attorney general’s opinion will carry a great deal of weight in the High Court.</p> \n<p>When citing the case of a minister, Mendelblit was referring to a ruling by the High Court from 1993, stating then – and recently again&nbsp;–&nbsp;that Interior Minister Arye Dery could not continue in office after a harsh indictment on charges of corruption was filed against him. At the time, no explicit precedent existed on the matter that would demand a resignation, but then-Attorney General Yosef Harish supported a petition to the High Court by the Movement for Quality Government, which objected to Dery continuing in office.</p> \n<p>In 2013, the High Court ruled in a similar manner against the continued tenure of mayors who had been indicted on various charges – despite the fact that then-Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein did not support their resignation.</p> \n<p>At Monday’s session in the Knesset, which was chaired by MK Shelly Yacimovich (Zionist Union) and scheduled to discuss the status of gatekeepers in the control committee, Mendelblit said it was important to reach a decision in the cases concerning Netanyahu as soon as possible.</p> \n<p>“Everyone is working on this with all their energy to reach a quick decision. But if you expect decision on these matters without having received the positions of the supervising prosecutors and the state prosecutor – you wouldn’t want to live in such a country,” he added.</p> \n<p>Asked how long it will take to reach a decision on whether to indict Netanyahu, and whether the attorney general will inform Israelis about that decision if the next Knesset election is held as scheduled in November 2019, Mendelblit said: “I am a professional, not a politician, and I will work in a professional manner. Not according to when or if there are elections.”</p> \n<p>He added, &quot;I am working in order to make the best decision for the people of Israel. I have no intention of rushing through things and I resent hints to that effect. [The decision] will be made as fast as possible.&quot;</p> \n<p>The police &quot;are not persecuting anyone, and the lawyers neither want to persecute nor to rule,” said the attorney general. &quot;We are pursuing justice and the rule of law.&quot;</p> \n<p>Mendelblit was asked by Yacimovich for his opinion on Netanyahu’s attack on Sunday against the police's recommendations to indict him.</p> \n<p>“In cases such as this, as far as I’m concerned, the police’s recommendations are the police’s recommendations and not those of the State Prosecutor’s Office. We need to back up the police and give them full support. I think that everything they did, they did in a professional manner. I give full backing to the Israel Police,” he answered.</p> \n<p>As for the decision to name an additional team of lawyers to examine the cases against Netanyahu, Mendelblit said the move was planned well in advance.</p> \n<p>“It was a decision made a few months ago ... It is very similar to previous decisions to appoint additional teams. There is always an obligation that, alongside the supervising prosecutor, there are others who will improve the decision,&quot; said Mendelblit. &quot;This is part of my responsibility. My obligation, to make the best recommendation, to consult with the best people.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>As part of a gentrification process taking place in the area, the 'Kiryat Hamelakha' compound in south Tel Aviv has become a center for the local art scene, with many abandoned workshops having been converted into galleries and workspaces for artists. But alongside the artistic spirit that permeates the place, there still exists the harsh and heart-breaking phenomenon of street prostitution provided by transgender women and other women, mostly addicted to drugs and malnourished.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“I Feel Pretty,” an exhibition by artist Hagit Shahal, which ran from late October through mid-November at the Artspace Tel Aviv (Makom Le’omanut) gallery, a nonprofit foundation, in the compound created a fascinating and brave dialogue with the prostitution in the area, to which society turns a blind eye, abandoning the people trapped in it to their fate.</p> \n<p>The outer wall of the gallery displayed a work called “Save Me!” by guest artist “Shredder,” the pseudonym of a street artist who specializes in protest art. The work is made up of three types of texts gathered by the artist: Texts quoted from the “When He Pays Me” Facebook and Tumbler pages, where activist Tali Corral has posted testimony from prostitutes; texts from the online forum “Amazing Sex,” in which clients rate the prostitutes they’ve visited like any other consumer item; and informative texts from organizations that fight prostitution.</p> \n<p>The work, which had been displayed as a protest earlier in the year directly across from the Pussycat strip club, was now on exhibition facing the streets clients pass along in their cars as they search for a sex worker.</p> \n<p>Within the gallery, Hagit Shahal displayed her disturbing works of strip-club performers – both pole dancers who work at strip clubs and the women who dance in cages. The works depict the pole dancers as faceless, their very humanity suppressed.</p> \n<p>Shahal creates the outlines of the pole dancers, then gouges them with her engraving knife, dismembering and shattering the bodies with the aim of disrupting the objectifying gaze. In so doing, she gives the women back their power. “At the beginning of the work the women are whole, but gradually, over time, they disappear and break down; what’s left is body parts wrapped around a phallic pole,” she says.</p> \n<p>“The colors of the series, black, white and bright red, create direct images that look like traffic signs or posters at a demonstration,” notes the exhibit’s curator, Nir Harmat. “Shahal works with a technique known as linocut, and her carving technique, which includes the use of sharp knives, engraving, and gouging&nbsp;on the linoleum sheet, permeates the content of the works, which display a wounded and dismantled body.”</p> \n<p>This body of work was born when Shahal was working on a earlier show, “What Do You Want?” which showed in 2011 at the Apart Gallery. Her research included examining stereotypical art representations of women showing everything from pleasure to pain, and it exposed her for the first time to online videos of pole dancers and strip clubs.</p> \n<p>“I had never been in a strip club, and I thought of pole dancing as an erotic dance, the way it was marketed to the general public,” Shahal says.</p> \n<p>What she saw in the videos, however, “was harsh and brutal. Many of the women’s movements are on their bellies, they crawl, they don’t stand up straight. During those moments when they are standing steady, they have the pole between their legs,” she says.</p> \n<p>Harmat, the curator, adds, “The broken body is piled up and grows to be a glowing feminine shadow in the darkness of the ink print. The works have no space; they have no time. There’s a continuum and a pile of bodies designed to stimulate and release. The works seek to create an uncomfortable, disturbing viewing position that raises awareness of the subject and marks this industry as insulting the dignity of women, something that demeans, hurts and discriminates.”</p> \n<p>What would you say to a woman who does pole dancing at a club and views it as art, claims that it empowers her, that she likes it and that it’s her free choice?</p> \n<p>“I can’t argue with a woman who tells me, ‘I have a lot of fun doing this, it’s empowering, it’s artistic.’ Whoever says that, that’s great. But I’m sure that even the woman who says that and who’s convinced of it, in her subconscious even she knows that she is cooperating with a worldview that lowers her and humiliates her.”</p> \n<p>Shahal worked on the exhibit for two years, during which a legal spotlight was directed at the stripper scene in the Israeli sex industry. In August 2017, Tel Aviv District Court Judge Michal Agmon-Gonen granted the appeal of the Ramat Gan municipality, which sought to close a long-open strip club near the Diamond Exchange. In her precedent-setting ruling, she wrote that, “Objectifying women is not entertainment,” and that the establishment in question engaged in “practices of contempt, the objectification of women and violations of their dignity.”</p> \n<p>That ruling was followed this past August by new guidelines issued by the State Prosecutor’s Office that defined lap dancing as an act of prostitution and stating that clubs where it was practiced risked closure orders, nonrenewal of their business licenses and even prosecution for operating a business without a license.</p> \n<p>“It didn’t influence the [artistic] work,” says Shahal, “but the change it caused encouraged me greatly. Michal Agmon-Gonen’s ruling is very important” for the way it redefines lap dancing. Now, she explains, “it has no other meaning than prostitution. The lap dance is the beginning, whose next step is to lead the customer to a private room for the purpose of sex for payment.”</p> \n<p>An entire wall of the exhibition was covered with red banners, including some of the alluring names women use to entice customers, even as they erase their own identities, monikers like Lexus, Rihanna, Natalie and Lola.</p> \n<p>“I went to an American website that advises strippers and pole dancers on how to choose a stage name,” says Shahal. “They divided it into categories, each of them meant to appeal to what men like. So, because men like luxury cars, they proposed names like Mercedes or Lexus. Men like alcoholic drinks, so they proposed the names Brandy and Gin. For the male gaze, what is more alluring to imagine, a performance by Hannah or one by Roxy?”</p> \n<p>“The wall of names sums up the entire message of the exhibition – these are women without an identity. Nothing belongs to them, not even their name, even that is stripped from them,” says Shahal.</p> \n<p>Yigal Amir did not approve</p> \n<p>Shahal was born in 1950 in Tel Aviv. In her youth, she studied drawing and music, and in her 20s she performed as a jazz musician. “I’m not a performer by my nature,” she says smiling. “I didn’t like performing. I enjoyed making music, playing and singing with people and at some stage I felt I needed to choose between my two loves.”</p> \n<p>In 1969, Shahal went to Holland to study art at the Free Academy in The Hague. She had a jazz group, and she recalls with clear enjoyment how she appeared before Queen Juliana on her birthday, but her love for painting and drawing won out. She specialized in lithography, screen printing and etching.</p> \n<p>In 1989-91, she worked as a television sketch artist for ABC News, drawing courtroom illustrations of newsworthy trials in Israel. Later, she did the same for Israel’s Channel 2 News, for which she documented visually the trials of John Demjanjuk, Arye Dery and Yigal Amir. Amir, the assassin of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, “would tell me that my drawings were lousy and I didn’t know how to draw,” Shahal recalls with a smile.</p> \n<p>Shahal recently published a first book of her own art, “I Feel Pretty,” which includes works from 2011 to the present day. The subject of gender plays a role in much of her work. Her exhibition “What Do You Want?” was a series of linoleum cuts of women dressed, packaged and imprisoned in such suggestive items as stiletto heels, pointy leather boots and corsets. All are items of clothing intended to serve the male gaze and which are inherently violent, chaining the woman, limiting her movement and hurting her.</p> \n<p>“Feminism broke out in my artistic work in a much clearer manner in the last two decades,” says Shahal. “I’m a painter who loves paintbrushes, color, drawing and a sensitive line, but something interesting happened as the content of my works became more feminist: The works began to be in a more rigid and more bruising technique. You could say that this unyielding technique led me to places where it connected with the material that fascinates me today.”</p> \n<p>Shahal is one of the founders three years ago of the Association of Women’s Art and Gender&nbsp;Research in Israel, whose members are artists, curators and researchers. The organization’s goal is to draw attention to female artistic work, she says: “to encourage research on both contemporary and forgotten female artists, and to encourage and support the activities of women artists in Israel. We organize, among other things, exhibitions, seminars, conferences and lectures.”</p> \n<p>It was her initiative to invite Shredder to participate in her exhibition. “I was exposed to his work across from the Pussycat club and was moved by it,” she explains. “I got in contact with him, shared with him what I felt and proposed that he exhibit with me.”</p> \n<p>“Prostitution is a real presence in the Kiryat Hamelakha compound,” says Shredder. “That’s why I’m glad to be part of an exhibition that deals with the subject, especially in this part of the city. I was amazed that none of the candidates in the Tel Aviv mayoral election talked about eradicating prostitution, in fact didn’t relate to this issue at all.” He says that it also has been given short shrift in the artistic realm, too, “and I’m very happy that it has been given a respectable stage here.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>After four years of separation, a Turkish citizen was reunited with her 7-year-old son. She thought that her child would immediately be able to make friends and play with his peers, and begin to return to a normal life. But when the boy saw other children, he picked up stones and started throwing them at the youngsters. Shocked, his mother asked him why he behaved that way. “I only wanted to play with them,” he said.</p> \n<p>Four years before that, the child's father, a Turkish citizen, had kidnapped him and the two moved to Syria in order to join the Islamic State. The father married another woman with children, who had left her husband in Turkey and moved to Syria to live a “proper Islamic life.” Within a short time the boy’s father was killed while participating in a terror attack. The stepmother was forced to marry an Islamic State member, and shortly afterward was also killed; the new stepfather decided to abandon the children.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'Christians face imminent extinction in the Middle East,' says Archbishop of Canterbury | Watch&nbsp;■&nbsp;Push for Syria solution may hasten Iranian forces' exit | Analysis</p> \n<p>Fortunately for the Turkish boy, he found his way to an orphanage, and from there returned to his homeland, after many efforts were made to locate him. Now he is undergoing psychological therapy and may return to a normal life.</p> \n<p>His mother, who was interviewed by the website Middle East Eye, said the child doesn’t talk much about his experiences while living with&nbsp;Islamic State fighters, he still has nightmares and is unable to communicate with friends. But he did tell her that on one day, he was annoyed with his stepsister and wanted to kill her with his father’s rifle. Luckily for her, the rifle was too heavy and he couldn’t lift it.</p> \n<p>Another boy, who was staying at an orphanage in Mosul, Iraq, demanded a knife from one of the staff there. When the man refused, the boy took a pencil and stabbed one of the girls at the facility.</p> \n<p>The person responsible for absorbing the Islamic State orphans at the shelter said that after arrival there, children sometimes sing songs they learned from the Islamic militants, others curse a lot, and many pray devoutly five times a day and devour the food they are given with uncontrollable voracity.</p> \n<p>It is estimated that over 2,500 “Islamic State children” are still living in refugee camps and orphanages in Iraq and Syria. These youngsters can be divided into two main categories: Those who were kidnapped by Islamic State operatives in order to serve as fighters and carry out suicide attacks, and those who arrived with parents who enlisted in the organization, or were born during the war years.</p> \n<p>When the fighting ended in locales where&nbsp;Islamic State had established itself, many of the fathers abandoned their families, leaving their offspring behind with their mothers. Now these women are awaiting a decision about their own fates – one that necessitates an investigation to determine whether they were Islamic State fighters themselves. Generally, their children are considered lucky, because for now they at least have something to eat and receive minimal medical care – albeit no psychological help.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, about 17,000 “Islamic State children” are roaming the streets in Syria and Iraq without receiving any assistance. They usually beg for food and are easy prey for&nbsp;Islamic State militants, who kidnap and exploit them in order to continue their terrorist operations.</p> \n<p>Many of these children have no documentation, and that is the source of another infuriating problem: At least 1,000 children are citizens of foreign countries such as France, Germany, Russia, Azerbaijan, Tunisia, and so on, but their governments are unwilling to recognize them as citizens due to the absence of identification papers.</p> \n<p>But even when there are papers, no country is rushing to bring them back home. France and Germany have declared that they are willing to take in a limited number of children, but without their mothers, since they are unable to check whether the women were Islamic State operatives.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Even mothers who never lived in Iraq and Syria, and who succeeded in tracking down their children at camps or elsewhere, cannot meet with them, due to regulations. That is apparently one of the twisted ways in which those countries are taking revenge against the mothers (and their children) for deciding, whether of their own free will or by force, to live with Islamic State militants.</p> \n<p>These circumstances invite all kinds of cruel dilemmas. For example, situations where women can and want to return home with their children, but their husbands won't accept the children because they were born to Islamic State fighters, or because the woman became pregnant by another man, even if she was raped.</p> \n<p>The mother must then decide whether to abandon her children in a refugee camp or other facility and go home, where a hostile society awaits her, or to remain with her children in the camps as long as the authorities allow it.</p> \n<p>The many reports being disseminated of the distress of these thousands of children have yet to produce orderly rescue plans. At best they are being cared for by aid organizations that are not equipped t,o provide vital psychological treatment; in the worst case, by government services in Iraq or Kurdish forces in Syria. These children will be last in line for rehabilitation – and the first to give rise to a new, twisted and hostile generation.</p>",

        "text":["<p>On December 27, 2016, Nir Hefetz, the media adviser of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, arrived at the home of Shaul Elovitch, controlling shareholder of the Israeli telecommunication company Bezeq.</p> \n<p>Hefetz's motives for initiating the urgent meeting were dark: To obstruct the undercover investigation against the prime minister and destroy significant evidence. The day before that meeting, Haaretz had reported that Netanyahu was a suspect in two secret cases, without listing the precise allegations.</p> \n<p>On the night of the meeting, immediately after Hefetz left Elovitch’s home, Ilan Yeshua, the CEO of the Walla News site of which Elovitch is also a controlling shareholder, was summoned to the house.</p> \n<p>Elovitch and his wife Iris were waiting for Yeshua. They looked frightened.</p> \n<p>According to the evidence the police had gathered in the case, dubbed Case 4000, Elovitch told Yeshua that the terrified Hefetz had asked to meet with Elovitch urgently, came to his home and told him that at the prime minister’s residence it was believed that the two secret affairs the police were investigating involved Netanyahu’s connections with two wealthy men: Australian billionaire James Packer and Elovitch.</p> \n<p>Elovitch also told Yeshua that Hefetz had supplied him with a narrative that was cooked up and coordinated with the intent of leading to the failure of the anticipated police investigation.</p> \n<p>Elovitch told Yeshua what Netanyahu’s story would be if an investigation were launched, as well as what Hefetz wanted Elovitch and Yeshua’s versions to look like.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Bibi Bombshells Explained: Your Guide to All the Netanyahu Cases&nbsp;■&nbsp;Millions of dollars, favorable coverage: What we can tell you about the new Netanyahu graft case roiling Israel</p> \n<p>Yeshua had a key role to play in this criminal obstruction. The coordinated version was meant to keep Netanyahu and Elovitch out of criminal range and away from being painted as having a quid pro quo relationship.</p> \n<p>Yeshua was to take personal responsibility for slanting coverage on the Walla news site to benefit the Netanyahus and to tell investigators that Elovitch never demanded anything like that of him, nor did Elovitch interfere in journalistic content. Elovitch told Yeshua that he and Hefetz had agreed to destroy the suspicious text messages they had exchanged and that Elovitch then demanded that Yeshua delete all incendiary material from his cellphone right on the spot.</p> \n<p>In a scene that seemed taken from a film noire production, Elovitch, according to the evidence the police have, told Yeshua: “Throw your phone down the toilet.”</p> \n<p>“Yeshua, who had served Elovitch’s interests for years, realized that he was entering very dangerous territory,” a legal source familiar with the details of the investigation told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>“He promised Elovitch that he would delete all the incriminating correspondence between them, but begged Elovitch to allow him not to do it right then and there,” the source told Haaretz. “A real struggle developed and at the end Yeshua managed to get away on the pretext that his phone contained pictures of his family that were very close to his heart. He promised to destroy everything after he copied the photos onto his computer. It was very hard for him to get out of there with the explosive material. The next day, Yeshua met with his lawyers and told them about the incident. The report was written down and is considered very strong evidence.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A week after the nighttime meeting, Elovitch could breathe a little more easily. The two secretive probes against Netanyahu were exposed, and it turned out that they supposedly involved criminal connections between Netanyahu and two other businessmen – Yedioth Ahronoth publisher and managing editor Arnon Mozes and Israeli-American movie producer Arnon Milchan.</p> \n<p>Although he had calmed down a little, Elovitch was still on edge, and according to the evidence collected by the police, he asked Yeshua frequently whether the material had been destroyed and whether he remembered what to say if a police investigation ensued. Yeshua assured Elovitch that the material had been swallowed up in a black hole.</p> \n<p>“Luckily for Case 4000, Yeshua kept all the material and in fact fooled Elovitch,” a legal source recently told Haaretz. “If he had become part of the obstruction network, it is very doubtful this case would have been born,” he added.</p> \n<p>In June 2017, the Israel Securities Authority arrested and questioned Elovitch and numerous senior figures at Bezeq on suspicion of fraud.</p> \n<p>During the investigation, which dealt with a suspected attempt by Elovitch to defraud investors and wrongful ties between Elovitch and Communications Ministry Director General Shlomo Filber, indications emerged that Elovitch was using the Walla news site as a tool to give benefits to the chief regulator – Communications Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>But despite these indications, the material was not seriously investigated, and in November the Israel Securities Authority conveyed its recommendations to the State Prosecutor’s Office department in charge of economic and tax crimes without even touching on the core of the affair.</p> \n<p>At the same time, senior officials in the Justice Ministry were asked why officials in the prosecutor’s office were not urging the securities authority investigators to follow up on promising leads.</p> \n<p>“The prime minister is under two criminal investigations. No one wants to get embroiled now in another investigation the end of which is not known and will put off a decision on Case 1000 and Case 2000 for a long time,&quot; a senior legal official told Haaretz at the time, referring to suspicions of bribery in the form of gifts to the prime minister and his wife (Case 1000), and a deal to secure positive coverage in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth (Case 2000).</p> \n<p>About a week after the Israel Securities Authority recommendations, Haaretz’s lead headline reported that evidence had been found in the Bezeq case of quid pro quo ties between Netanyahu and Elovitch and that Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit and State Prosecutor Shay Nitzan had not yet instructed the police to investigate.</p> \n<p>A few weeks went by before the prosecutor for economic and tax affairs, Liat Ben Ari, informed the securities authority that it would need to do some more investigating and summon Yeshua – who had served as Elovitch’s right-hand man at Walla for many years – to testify. “We had asked to question him before,” a source involved in the investigation said, “but approval was not given.”</p> \n<p>It is very doubtful that any senior official in the prosecution or the securities authority predicted what would happen one cold December day, when Yeshua first came to the authority’s office on Montefiore Street in Tel Aviv. “That was the moment when the glass ceiling was smashed and the Bezeq case became the Netanyahu case,” a person involved in the investigation said.</p> \n<p>The testimony was defined by a person who read it as “a desire and need to come clean,” while Yeshua’s iPhone –&nbsp;the one he didn’t destroy, and which he gave to the police&nbsp;–&nbsp;&nbsp;included hundreds of exchanges and dozens of recorded calls through which one main theme was clear: complete subservience of the Walla news site to the chief regulator as bribery.</p> \n<p>Many of the instructions by Elovitch and his wife Iris connected, outright and callously, the need for sympathetic regulation and Netanyahu’s efforts to help (“he'd commit suicide for me,” as Elovitch put it), as well as the need to satisfy the Netanyahus. “I have to wean him off,” Elovitch wrote in one message, while in another, he instructed: “Give her everything possible,” referring to the prime minister’s wife. The wording was that of a bribery deal.</p> \n<p>As Yeshua’s testimony was given secretly to the Israel Securities Authority, meetings were being held in the attorney general’s office. Mendelblit, who was sour on the raw material in Case 1000 and Case 2000, and treated them as something “you can’t vomit and you can’t swallow,” changed his tune.</p> \n<p>What impressed him mainly were the huge regulatory benefits Netanyahu had allegedly given to Elovitch in his capacity as communications minister: approval of the merger between Bezeq and the satellite TV network Yes, worth a billion shekels, and stopping the reform in the wholesale market, which is believed to have saved Bezeq hundreds of millions of shekels over the years.</p> \n<p>“It was clear at that point that the evidence in Case 4000 greatly entangles Elovitch and strengthens the suspicion that he had bribed Netanyahu. There was also the evidence indicating that Netanyahu had intervened to benefit Bezeq and that his director general, Filber, had acted as an agent for Bezeq’s interests within the Communications Ministry.</p> \n<p>But there was no one who would testify to the connection between the two axes, a corrupt agreement between Netanyahu and Elovitch, for example, or awareness on Netanyahu’s part that he was promoting Elovitch’s interests in exchange for subordinating Walla,” the source said.</p> \n<p>That is the main reason that Filber and Hefetz were drafted as state witnesses with very generous deals. Filber told investigators about Netanyahu’s involvement in promoting Bezeq’s interests. Hefetz told them about the boss’s involvement in slanting coverage on Walla.</p> \n<p>Neither of them are considered optimal state witnesses and the information they provided apparently did not come close to the evidence provided by the legendary state witnesses Shula Zaken and Shlomo Dachner (in the Holyland affair) or Moshe Sela (in the Benizri case). But the higher echelons in the prosecutor’s office are certain, even now, that the agreements with them were necessary to crack the case.</p> \n<p>The police recommendation reported Sunday reveals the name of a new star in the affair: Zeev Rubinstein, an associate of both Elovitch and Netanyahu, who is suspected of serving as an intermediary between the two senior players. The pieces of the puzzle come together thanks to the state witnesses, Rubinstein –&nbsp;who left allegedly implicating correspondence, as well as additional witnesses from Bezeq and the prime minister’s office inner sanctum.</p> \n<p>The police recommendations, which seem to have been formulated quickly on the verge of hastily, a day before Police Commissioner Roni Alsheich puts aside his uniform, are not the final word.</p> \n<p>In the coming weeks, marathon meetings will be held in the Justice Ministry before a decision is made whether to summon Netanyahu to a hearing, and about what the particular charges will be. If the attorney general announces that he intends to indict Netanyahu, he will give the prime minister's attorneys many months to study it. Only after he holds the hearing will we finally reach the end of the line.</p> \n<p>Until this happens, Netanyahu, his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s and those on his side will try to reduce Case 4000 to miniature dimensions and tell anyone who wants to hear it that this is a ludicrous case in which the bribery is “a gossip item about Sara,” as Netanyahu has said in private conversations.</p> \n<p>This direction is not expected to change, even when the evidence becomes public and the dimensions of Netanyahu's pressure on the poor news website become clear, as well as the evidence on the huge regulatory benefits the prime minister gave Elovitch, benefits that hit the public in its pocketbook.</p> \n<p>In response to Sunday's police recommendation, Shaul Elovitch's lawyer, Jacques Chen said: &quot;For an extended period, the police, through their leaks, have been preparing us for this recommendation. The recommendations are a rehash that present nothing new and I hope that those handling the case will look at it from a legal and professional perspective divorced from the huge pressure being exerted on them and that has accompanied this investigation from the beginning and has tainted it. Mr. Elovitch insists that he has not committed any offense.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>May 2015, late at night, the 34th Israeli government was sworn in. Sara Netanyahu sat in the visitor’s gallery in the Knesset, near film producer Moshe Edery, a close confidant of the Netanyahu family. Nearby sat another man who has received almost no exposure in the Israeli media, an Israeli who left for the United States in 2001 named Zeev Rubinstein. His presence alongside the prime minister’s wife was not a coincidence, and was the result of the warm and close relations between Rubinstein and the Netanyahus. Rubinstein has a number of other close friends in Israel, including Shaul Elovitch, who was until quite recently the owner of the Bezeq telecommunications company, which also owns the Walla news site.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, the Israel Police and Israel Securities Authority released their recommendations to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, as well as former media mogul Shaul Elovitch and his wife, Iris, for bribery and other corruption charges in the investigation dubbed Case 4000, also known as the Bezeq-Walla affair. But other people were included in the alleged crimes, including their mutual friend Rubinstein, the vice president for business development of the Israel Bonds organization in the United States, which underwrites debt securities issued by Israel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The Haaretz investigation that started it all:&nbsp;The Israeli news site in Netanyahu's pocket&nbsp;■&nbsp;'Flush your iPhone': The minute this scandal became a Netanyahu bribery case&nbsp;■ Editorial:&nbsp;Netanyahu must resign</p> \n<p>The police said in their announcement that “an adequate evidentiary foundation” had been found against Rubinstein to recommend an indictment on charges of serving as an intermediary in the prime minister's alleged bribery and accepting bribes. In other words, the police say he is one of the links connecting Elovitch to Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>Sources involved in the investigation said Rubinstein did not create the initial connection between Netanyahu and Elovitch, but that at certain points he allegedly aided the two in reaching understandings. Evidence exists that links Rubinstein directly to the deal at the center of the corruption case: Positive coverage on the Walla news website in return for benefits for Bezeq from the Communications Ministry, the sources said.</p> \n<p>Rubinstein’s connection to the Bezeq affair was revealed on Sunday for the first time and surprised many of his acquaintances in Israel. Uri Shani, formerly a close adviser to Yesh Atid Chairman Yair Lapid, said that only three weeks ago he sat with Rubinstein and other Israeli friends and acquaintances in Israel in a Greek restaurant in Manhattan. They have been friends for years, back from when both were members of Likud, but “we are friends from afar,” said Shani. “In the meeting in the restaurant he seemed cheerful and happy and didn’t look tense. I didn’t know at all he was investigated in the affair,” said Shani.</p> \n<p>A charming and charismatic man</p> \n<p>Rubinstein, as his friends in Israel describe him, is a very charming and charismatic man, who knows how to make connections easily. He knows how to make friends with everyone, the wonderful type of wheeler-dealer form the movies, said someone who worked with him in the past. “What’s the Bonds? It’s connections,” added a political consultant who knows Rubinstein well. “He knows everyone, on the left and the right. He is an octopus of acquaintances. A man who knows how to create links in an extraordinary way and reach anyone he wants, including ministers,” the political consultant added.</p> \n<p>In recent years, in political circles there were those who called him “Sara Netanyahu’s operations officer in New York.” This is because during the family’s visits to New York he took care of all their arrangements, and helped out the Netanyahu children, Yair and Avner, too, when they visited the city. “He is very close to Netanyahu, for years,” said someone who worked with Netanyahu in the past. “He would go with him to the most intimate places, such as the White House.”</p> \n<p>Rubinstein’s connection with Netanyahu began in Likud circles back in the 1990s, when Rubinstein had a very close relationship with former Likud minister Limor Livnat and her political adviser at the time, Shaul Schneider. This is how he met Netanyahu, but it seems the close relationship between the two began only later, at the beginning of the millennium when the Netanyahus travelled to the United States often and Rubinstein was living there.</p> \n<p>During his visits to Israel in recent years, Rubinstein also visited the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem. He was even one of the guests at the “Independence Day barbecue” – an event mentioned in Meni Naftali’s lawsuit against Netanyahu and the Prime Minister’s Office. The suit states that Naftali, the chief caretaker of the Prime Minister’s Residence, complained that he had to work on the Independence Day holiday and Sara Netanyahu told him in response that the prime minister had to work on that day too.</p> \n<p>According to someone who attended the barbecue, the meat cost thousands of shekels. “Sara explained there that she wanted to honor Rubinstein like he honors her when she travels overseas,” the person who had attended the event said.</p> \n<p>Rubinstein’s name was also mentioned in the “Bibi Tours” affair exposed by journalist Raviv Drucker, concerning&nbsp;Netanyahu’s overseas travel arrangements while serving as finance minister between 2003 and 2005. Rubinstein was mentioned specifically concerning an incident in June 2007, when Netanyahu was head of the opposition. In order to bypass the ban of the Knesset Ethics Committee on accepting outside funding for Sara Netanyahu’s trips abroad, Rubinstein supposedly asked his friend, public relations executive Bruria Angel, to arrange an event in which Sara would speak to a group of businesswomen on the psychological implications for children living under the shadow of terrorism. In the end, the event did not take place, and Sara Netanyahu’s flight was funded in a different way. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>It’s always good to have someone else around</p> \n<p>The relationship between Rubinstein and Elovitch began in 1994, when he began to work at Eurocom, a company owned by Elovitch. Rubinstein was the marketing manager for one of the group’s companies, and worked directly under CEO Elovitch. After starting work, Rubinstein added a dimension of openness to the media and public relations to the company – while at the same time taking pride in his access to politicians, said someone who worked with him at the time. Rubinstein decided to leave after three years in the job, but stayed for another year to work in Eurocom’s headquarters alongside Elovitch. In 1998, Rubinstein joined Bezeq-Call, then a subsidiary of the still government-owned telecommunications giant, which was run by Schneider, who appointed Rubinstein the vice president of sales and marketing.</p> \n<p>It is likely that the nature of this triangle of relations between Netanyahu, Elovitch and Rubinstein will become clearer as more information about the Bezeq-Walla case comes out. Someone who knows Rubinstein told Haaretz – before the new revelations against him – that Rubinstein “is in touch with Shaul Elovitch, and with his brother Yossi too, but will not want to admit it.”</p> \n<p>“People of the status of Elovitch and Netanyahu know how to meet. But it is always good to have someone else around, a mediator, contact, to understand the spirit and trends,” he added.</p> \n<p>In May 2015, before the Bezeq-Walla affair was exposed by Haaretz, Elovitch’s spokesman was asked about his acquaintance with Rubinstein. He was asked when the two had last met, how often they met and if Elovitch was aware of Rubinstein’s connection with Netanyahu. The spokesman said at the time: “About 20 years have passed since Rubinstein left one of the companies owned by Elovitch, in which he was a vice president. Since then the two have had no contact.”</p> \n<p>Rubinstein said at the time in a telephone conversation, about Elovitch: “Friend? I worked for him between 1994 and 1998, I’m in hello-hello touch with him. The last time I met with him was a very long time ago.” This week, people close to Elovitch said this response related to business dealings between Rubinstein and Elovitch, but he did not mean that they did not have any contact over the years. Rubinstein was unavailable for comment.</p> \n<p>Rubinstein moved to New Jersey in 2001, after working for communications company Solgood for two years. At first, he worked for Israel Discount Bank in New York. His job was to put the bank in touch with Jews and Israelis working in the United States. After that, he worked for a year as the CEO of Tadiran Telecom in the United States, and then he went to work for a number of Jewish organizations. First as the head of Birthright in the United States, after that at the American Council for World Jewry, and now the Israel Bonds.</p> \n<p>Rubinstein often offered his services as a sort of go-between to Israeli companies and the American government in the early 2000s, claiming he had government connections, a source who knew him when he first came to the United States said. He is considered to be connected to Jack Rosen, a Jewish real estate tycoon, who is close to former President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party. Until 2013, he was the Executive Director of the American Council for World Jewry, headed by Rosen.</p> \n<p>Rubinstein has connections in the Republican Party too. In 2012, he accompanied New Jersey governor Chris Christie on his visit to Israel.</p> \n<p>In response to Sunday's police recommendation, Shaul Elovitch's lawyer, Jacques Chen said: &quot;For an extended period, the police, through their leaks, have been preparing us for this recommendation. The recommendations are a rehash that present nothing new and I hope that those handling the case will look at it from a legal and professional perspective divorced from the huge pressure being exerted on them and that has accompanied this investigation from the beginning and has tainted it. Mr. Elovitch insists that he has not committed any offense.&quot;</p> \n<p>Rubinstein’s lawyers, Pninat Yanai and Rami Tamam, said: &quot;Mr. Zeev Rubinstein did not act as alleged as a go-between between the prime minister and Mr. Elovitch. He was not asked to be nor did he initiate any such connection. His relations with the Elovitchs was one of friendship with a few random meetings during his visits to Israel over the years since he moved to the United States, and nothing more. The relationship with Yossi Elovitch was cut over a decade ago.&quot;</p> \n<p>“As a well-known figure in the Jewish world, Mr. Rubinstein was asked more than once to help in inviting the prime minister’s wife for lectures in front of women’s circles or various Jewish groups, and he always passed the request on to the Prime Minister’s Office as is appropriate, for their handling according to procedure,” his lawyers said.</p> \n<p>The lawyers added: “Mr. Rubinstein does not have and has never had any connection to the suspicions under investigation, and the various reports trying to link him to the matter are regrettable. The fact that Mr. Rubinstein has known the prime minister and Mr. Elovitch personally for many years, certainly cannot testify to anything and/or link him to the matter under investigation in any way or manner.” The lawyers added that they had no doubt that the prosecution would carry out its work faithfully and find that Rubinstein was not involved in any crimes.</p>",

        "text":["<p>&gt;&gt; UPDATE:&nbsp;Israel launches operation to destroy Hezbollah cross-border tunnels from Lebanon</p> \n<p>Thursday night’s incident in Syrian airspace, which was painted in dramatic colors by Arab media outlets, turns out to have been relatively minor.</p> \n<p>Syria’s air defenses, identifying what it considered to be unusual movements by Israeli planes in southern Syria, fired 20 anti-aircraft missiles. But contrary to Syria’s claims, they hit no Israeli planes or missiles.</p> \n<p>There has been no credible information from Syria about any damage caused by an Israeli strike. Russia didn’t condemn or even officially comment on the incident. And while shrapnel from one Syrian missile fell in the Israeli portion of the Golan Heights, it caused no damage.</p> \n<p>As in several other recent incidents, this looks like a Syrian overreaction. The last such overreaction, on September 17, led Syria to accidently down a Russian spy plane.</p> \n<p>Thursday’s incident occurred a few hours after former Military Intelligence chief Amos Yadlin made an unusual statement. Yadlin, who heads the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, told the radio station 103 FM that Iran has recently altered its behavior in the region.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Trump's decision to stand by Saudi prince has Netanyahu's fingerprints on it </p> \n<p>“Beyond the fact that the Russians are angry at us and giving us the cold shoulder, I think they also sent forceful messages to Iran that its military entrenchment and missile factories in Syria are harming the effort to stabilize Syria,” he said. “An unstable Syria doesn’t suit the Russians. Israeli strikes have dropped to near-zero, and I think that’s not because we don’t want to [carry out strikes], but because the Iranians have changed their tactics. They’re moving everything to Lebanon.”</p> \n<p>Yadlin thus said openly what several senior Israeli officials have recently hinted: Due to changes imposed by Russia, the Israeli-Iranian battle has largely moved to other countries.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Iran test-fired missile capable of hitting Europe, Pompeo says</p> \n<p>Israel, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United Nations General Assembly in September, is worried by the Iranian-Hezbollah effort to set up production lines for precision weaponry in Lebanon. Some of the necessary materials are now being smuggled on the frequent flights from Tehran to Beirut, rather than overland through Syria.</p> \n<p>Lebanon is undergoing many changes that worry Israeli decision-makers: the effort to build precision weapons factories; Russia’s growing interest in events in Lebanon, after having bolstered its aerial defense umbrella over Syria; the return of some Hezbollah fighters from Syria as the civil war dies down there and changes in their deployment in Lebanon; and the continued upgrading of Israel’s barrier along the Lebanese border, which will approach areas disputed between the two countries near Rosh Hanikra and Manara. Israel has already announced that it intends to continue building the barrier despite Lebanese warnings.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah probably isn’t seeking war with Israel right now. But the improvement of its offensive capabilities during Syria’s civil war and the return of some of its units to Lebanon worry the Israel Defense Forces.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Lebanon’s suspicions of Israeli plans are growing, leading to counter-threats. This weekend, Hezbollah released a threatening video showing aerial photographs of various Israeli sites, including Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. The clip included a Hebrew caption: “If you dare to attack, you’ll regret it.”</p> \n<p>The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit responded in Arabic on social media, “People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.”</p> \n<p>All this is happening less than two weeks after Netanyahu warned in a speech of a serious security situation. His speech had a political motive; he was trying, successfully, to keep the Habayit Hayehudi party in the government after Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman quit and withdrew his Yisrael Beiteinu party from the ruling coalition. But it also raised questions about whether Israel was planning an offensive. Since Netanyahu’s position on the Gaza Strip is fairly clear — he wants to avoid war with Hamas if possible — attention has focused on Hezbollah.</p> \n<p>The government recently extended the term of Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot for an additional two weeks, to mid-January. Shortly afterward, Eisenkot announced that he was canceling a planned trip to Germany.</p> \n<p>Yet anyone trying to connect these dots seems to be jumping the gun. If war is expected, you don’t extend the chief of staff’s tenure by a mere two weeks. And if war were being planned, the extension presumably wouldn’t have been announced.</p> \n<p>The more likely interpretation is that tensions are indeed expected, due to the changes up north and Hezbollah’s efforts to acquire better weapons, but there’s no deterministic process leading inevitably to war. It’s worth recalling that Israel and Hezbollah have been through similarly tense periods in previous years, but have nevertheless managed to preserve almost complete quiet in the 12 years since the Second Lebanon War.</p>",

        "text":["<p>From a practical political point of view, Avigdor Lieberman, Naftali Bennett, and their idea to take a tougher stand toward Hamas just&nbsp;went down to defeat, if not humiliation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That’s because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once again showed his political skills; the first is now ex-defense minister, the second failed to become defense minister.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;‘Get used to the rockets’: What Netanyahu should tell Israelis living near Gaza&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>From a longer-term point of view, however, the duo raised an issue that for decades had not been part of the Israeli political discourse but, due to their efforts, promises to be an important factor in the future: that would be the concept of victory, of an Israeli victory over Hamas and, by extension, over the Palestinian Authority and Palestinians in general.</p> \n<p>Victory – defined as imposing one’s will on the enemy so he gives up his war goals - has been the war goal of philosophers, strategists, and generals through human history.&nbsp;Aristotle wrote&nbsp;that “Victory is the end of generalship.” Karl von Clausewitz, the Prussian theorist,&nbsp;concurred: “The aim of war should be the defeat of the enemy.” Gen. James Mattis, the U.S. secretary of defense, finds that “No war is over until the enemy says it’s over.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Palestinians routinely speak of achieving victory over Israel, even when this is fantastical: to cite one example, PA leader Mahmoud Abbas called his Hamas counterpart, Ismail Haniyeh, after eight days of violence with Israel that left Gaza badly battered in November 2012 to “congratulate him on the victory&nbsp;and extend condolences to the families of martyrs.”</p> \n<p>Contrarily, in Israel, the notion of victory has been sidelined since at least the Oslo Accords of 1993, after which its leaders instead focused on such concepts as compromise, conciliation, confidence-building, flexibility, goodwill, mediation, and restraint. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert immemorially&nbsp;articulated this attitude&nbsp;in 2007 when he stated that &quot;Peace is achieved through concessions.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel is incomparably stronger than Hamas – but it will never win: Interview with Hamas leader in Gaza</p> \n<p>his perverse understanding of how wars end led Israel to make extraordinary blunders in the 15 years after Oslo, for which it was punished by unremitting campaigns of delegitimization and violence, symbolized, respectively, by&nbsp;the Durban conference of 2001&nbsp;&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Passover Massacre of 2002.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Such nonsense ended during Netanyahu’s near-decade-long term as prime minister, but it has not yet been replaced by a sturdy vision of victory. Rather, Netanyahu has put out brush fires as they arose in Sinai, Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, Syria, and Lebanon. While agreeing with the concept of an Israeli victory when personally briefed, he has not spoken publicly about it.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, other leading figures in Israel have adopted this outlook. Former deputy chief of staff Uzi Dayan called on the army “to return the path of victory.” Former education and interior minister Gideon Sa’ar&nbsp;has stated&nbsp;that “The ‘victory paradigm,’ like Jabotinsky’s ‘Iron Wall’ concept, assumes that an agreement may be possible in the future, but only after a clear and decisive Israeli victory ... The transition to the ‘victory paradigm’ is contingent upon abandoning the Oslo concept.”</p> \n<p>In this context, the statements by Lieberman and Bennett point to a change in thinking.&nbsp;Lieberman quit his position&nbsp;as defense minister out of frustration that a barrage by Hamas of 460 rockets and missiles against Israel was met with a ceasefire; he called instead for “a state of despair” to be imposed on the enemies of Israel. Complaining that “Israel stopped winning,”&nbsp;Bennett demanded&nbsp;that the IDF “start winning again,” and added that “When Israel wants to win, we can win.” On rescinding his demand for the defense portfolio, Bennett emphasized that he stands by Netanyahu “in the monumental task of ensuring that Israel is victorious again.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Netanyahu's vision for the Middle East has come true | Analysis</p> \n<p>Opponents of this paradigm then amusingly testified to the power of this idea of victory. Ma’ariv columnist Revital Amiran wrote that the victory the Israeli public most wants lies in such arenas as larger allocations for the elderly and unbearable traffic jams. Meretz leader Tamar Zandberg, replied to Bennett that for her, a victorious Israel means winning Emmy and Oscar nominations, guaranteeing equal health services, and spending more on education.</p> \n<p>That victory and defeat have newly become a topic for debate in Israel constitutes a major development. Thus does the push for an Israeli victory move forward.</p> \n<p>Daniel Pipes is president of the Middle East Forum think tank, which promotes Israel Victory, a project to steer U.S. policy toward backing an Israeli victory to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians.

Most of these penalize only companies that boycott Israel, although nine states, like Illinois, have passed or are considering passing&nbsp;laws that extend the penalties to entities that boycott Israeli businesses operating in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>The Israeli government has been up in arms over Airbnb’s announcement, and ministers have been seeking retribution in various ways. After the announcement, Erdan, the point-man in the government to combat pro-Palestinian boycotts, said he would consult with the U.S. government on the matter.</p> \n<p>“We will approach the U.S. government because 25 U.S. states have sanctions against American companies that boycott Israel,” Erdan said on Israeli Army Radio.</p> \n<p>He also called for a boycott of Airbnb and promoted one of its rivals.</p> \n<p>“I call today on all those who support Israel and oppose discriminatory boycotts: they should cease using Airbnb and turn to other services,” Erdan told a diplomatic conference hosted by the Jerusalem Post newspaper. “By the way, Booking.com is a great service,” Erdan added.</p> \n<p>There are 200 Airbnb listings in West Bank settlements. Airbnb has more than 22,000 hosts in Israel.</p> \n<p>Airbnb does not intend to remove Jewish homes in East Jerusalem, territory Israel annexed in a move not recognized abroad and which the Palestinians want for a future capital, or the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Marc Lamont Hill, a political commentator and professor at Temple University,&nbsp;has apologized for his use of a phrase associated with Palestinian extremists&nbsp;in discussing the current plight of the Palestinians at the United Nations.</p> \n<p>Hill, a professor of media studies and urban education at Temple who also hosts the syndicated television show “Our World with Black Enterprise,” called for “a free Palestine from the river to the sea”&nbsp;on Wednesday during an event held at the United Nations for the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.</p> \n<p>“We have an opportunity to not just offer solidarity in words but to commit to political action, grassroots action, local action and international action that will give us what justice requires and that is a free Palestine from the river to the sea,” Hill said.</p> \n<p>In an&nbsp;op-ed published&nbsp;on Saturday in Hill’s hometown newspaper, the Philadephia Inquirer, he wrote: ” Critics of this phrase have suggested that I was calling for violence against Jewish people. In all honesty, I was stunned, and saddened, that this was the response.</p> \n<p>“Palestine from the river to the sea” was a slogan of the Palestine Liberation Organization beginning with its founding in 1964, claiming a Palestinian state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea and rejecting control by Israel of any land in the region, including areas controlled by Israel prior to 1967. It later became a popular political slogan used by Palestinians who reject compromise with Israel, including the terror group Hamas, which calls for the destruction of Israel.</p> \n<p>Hill said in his op-ed that he was calling for justice in the area from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, in the form of &nbsp;a single bi-national democratic state that encompasses Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.</p> \n<p>“Throughout my speech, I spoke explicitly about the need for Israeli political reform, specifically as it pertains to Arab citizens of Israel. I also called for a redrawing of borders to the pre-1967 lines, as well as a greater attention to human rights for those living in the West Bank and Gaza. At the time, I believed that these demands made in the speech sufficiently reflected my belief in radical change&nbsp;within&nbsp;Israel, not a desire for its destruction,” he wrote. &nbsp;“Clearly, they did not.”</p> \n<p>“I take seriously the voices of so many Jewish brothers and sisters, who have interpreted my remarks as a call to or endorsement of violence. Rather than hearing a political solution, many heard a dog-whistle that conjured a long and deep history of violence against Jewish people. Although this was the furthest thing from my intent, those particular words clearly caused confusion, anger, fear, and other forms of harm. For that, I am deeply sorry,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>Hill also noted that he has called for a rejection anti-Semitism in any form, including preventing physical violence against Jews, &nbsp;as well as anti-Semitic images.</p> \n<p>CNN announced on Thursday that it had&nbsp;fired Hill.</p>",

        "text":["<p>George Herbert Walker Bush was the last Republican realist in the White House. He was also the last U.S. president to come into office fully prepared for his job. Unlike Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and, of course, Donald Trump, none of whom had any experience with running a federal administration, Bush had served as Congressman, ambassador to the United Nations and China, Director of the CIA and Vice President for eight whole years. As far as the international order was concerned, Bush was the right man, in the right place and in the right time.</p> \n<p>The challenges he faced in the world arena were titanic. Bush oversaw the liberation of Eastern Europe, the dismantling of the Soviet empire and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. His approach was far more pragmatic than ideological. He refrained from invoking traditional conservative values and resisted calls by fellow Republicans to use the opportunity of the collapse of the Soviet Union to strike a blow for liberty and freedom. His careful and dispassionate strategy and tactics stabilized the world, smoothed the transition and established the framework for the new Europe of the 21st century.</p> \n<p>The 1990-1991 Gulf War launched by Bush was a prime example of Bush’s caution and international savvy. His prime motivation for the invasion of Iraq was not to save Kuwait from tyranny but to maintain U.S. deterrence and to draw a line in the sand that instructed the world on what America would not and could not tolerate.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;From Bush to Trump: How the GOP evolved on Israel&nbsp;■&nbsp;George H.W. Bush and his 'roller-coaster relationship' with American Jews and Israel</p> \n<p>Unlike his overzealous son, who would see his fortunes sink in the Iraqi quicksand a decade later, Bush exemplified Ariel Sharon’s maxim that “restraint is also power”. He refused to let “mission creep” alter his original goals and extricated the U.S. from the war once its original objectives were achieved.</p> \n<p>Bush built up an unprecedented international coalition of 35 countries against Saddam, which included distinctly undemocratic countries, such as Egypt, and even ostensibly anti-American Syria. He relied on the authority of the international institutions so reviled on the Republican right, opting to go it alone only when there was no other option.</p> \n<p>And he refused to allow the U.S. military to take Baghdad and topple Saddam Hussein. Republican hawks, along with many Israelis, criticized Bush’s reluctance at the time but the experience of his far less cautious son proved that in foreign affairs and national security, more is often far less.</p> \n<p>Yitzhak Shamir, who clashed with Bush like no previous Israeli prime minister, nonetheless appreciated the U.S. President’s realistic streak. The same was true of Bush’s forceful Secretary of State James Baker, whose battle with Shamir was even longer and fiercer. Shamir knew how to differentiate between Bush’s leadership on the world stage and his efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, which Shamir opposed.</p> \n<p>It took no small amount of confidence and trust in the U.S. leadership for Shamir to compel his combative Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Israeli army chiefs to refrain from retaliating for Saddam’s missile attacks on Israeli cities.</p> \n<p>Bush’s realistic streak propelled him to exploit the aftermath of the Gulf campaign to convene the Madrid Conference and to launch the first-ever direct talks between Israel and Palestinians, Syrians and Gulf countries. His pragmatism, however, left him woefully unprepared for the clash with Shamir’s all-encompassing ideology and dogged resistance to any and all concessions.</p> \n<p>Shamir’s battle with Bush over the $10 billion in loan guarantees that Israel needed in order to absorb the wave of new Russian immigrants, who had made aliyah in the wake of the collapse of communism, was incomprehensible to Bush. It frustrated the U.S. President and made him lose his famous cool, leading to what is arguably the worst altercation in history between a U.S. president, on the one hand, and Israel and the Jewish community on the other.</p> \n<p>Bush’s pent up annoyance burst out in his address to the nation on September 12, 1991, which AIPAC’s legendary executive director Tom Dine later described, Pearl Harbor style, as “a day that will live in infamy.”</p> \n<p>Bush had angered Shamir and American Jews the year before when he blasted Israeli settlements in “the West Bank and East Jerusalem”, but his tirade against “A thousand Jewish lobbyists on Capitol Hill against little old me” sparked accusations of outright anti-Semitism. Bush was invoking the charge of “dual loyalty” against U.S. Jews, and they rewarded him with a measly 12% of their vote, the lowest ever for any Republican presidential candidate, in his 1992 run against Bill Clinton.</p> \n<p>Bush tried to make up for his lapse of judgment in the waning days of his presidency by courting Shamir’s successor Yitzhak Rabin, but the die was already cast. He had tapped into the historical Jewish suspicion of the GOP, which, despite Ronald Reagan, was still viewed as cooler on Israel than Democrats and still blemished by the anti-Semitic views of many of its past leaders.</p> \n<p>Like father like son, many Jews said at the time, recalling the pre-World War II activities of Bush’s father, Senator Prescott Bush, whose Union Banking Corporation served as a front for German industrialist Fritz Thyssen, a Nazi sympathizer and funder who later recanted. In a bit of historical irony, it is the same Thyssen whose conglomerate later morphed into the ThyssenKrupp group, the builder of Israeli submarines that is a central player in one of the ongoing corruption investigations against Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>Bush, however, was no anti-Semite. He maintained traditional U.S. support for the Jewish state and played an instrumental role in facilitating the immigration of Russian as well as Ethiopian Jews. He believed that the Middle East peace was vital to U.S. security interests, that the Gulf War had created an unprecedented opportunity to achieve it and that Israel was being pigheaded in its refusal to cooperate. His great misfortune was to let Shamir’s obstinacy get to him and make him lose his cool, thus consigning him, in Jewish eyes, to the ranks of hostile Presidents, much like Barack Obama who succeeded him 16 years later.</p> \n<p>History will shine a more favorable light on the Bush presidency. His careful handling of the breakup of Eastern Europe as well as the Gulf War created the world that saw Israel reach a historic deal with the Palestinians at Oslo and allowed it to capitalize on the new opportunities of the post-Soviet world, including its current romance with countries such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. The stability instilled by Bush on the world scene allowed Israel to strengthen and thrive.</p> \n<p>But Bush was an anachronism in many ways even when he was just elected. He came into the White House on the coattails of his far more flamboyant and conservative predecessor Reagan, and even so, may not have won the 1988 elections were it not for his exceptionally weak Democratic challenger Michael Dukakis. Bush was an Eisenhower at a time when the GOP was already transitioning to the populist, conservative and religion-based party molded by his own son, George W., and cemented today by Trump himself. He was an uncharismatic pro at a time when the GOP was already yearning for a flamboyant rabble-rouser. In today’s GOP, someone like Bush wouldn’t be elected dogcatcher.</p> \n<p>Bush didn’t lose the elections because of Jewish outrage, though the sharp drop in Jewish donations to the GOP in 1992 certainly hampered his campaign. His place in Jewish and Israeli history is colored by their tendency to judge U.S. presidents solely by their attitude to the Palestinian problem and the future of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Only through this distorted mirror can a savvy international player like Bush be condemned while Trump, for example, is held up as a paragon of friendship and virtue, solely for his support for Netanyahu’s right-wing policies. It is a preference that says less about Bush than it does about the evolution of Israel’s dangerous course, which Bush tried in vain to alter.</p> \n<p>Correction: The article previously stated incorrectly&nbsp;that President George H.W. Bush referred to Israeli settlements in the West Bank as &quot;illegal.&quot;</p>",
