        "text":["<p>Some 60,000 people attended a rally in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square on Sunday evening, according to police estimates, capping a day of demonstrations and a partial strike around the country in support of equal rights for Israel's LGBT population.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The strike call and demonstrations were sparked by the amendment to the surrogacy law and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s actions — saying Monday that he supports surrogacy for single fathers, but voting Wednesday against an amendment that would have done that. But the wave of protest, gained momentum over the past few days, appears to go far beyond opposition to a specific law, relating more generally to what the protesters say is a deprivation of the rights of LGBT individuals in many aspects of life.</p> \n<p>Addressing the Tel Aviv rally, Zionist Union Knesset member Itzik Shmuli, who is gay, said: &quot;We will no longer be silent. This struggle is not only about the rights of the [LGBT] community but on the image of the country. This is the 21st century. People are not seated at the back of the bus because of the color of their skin and they will not be deprived of the right to be parents due to their [sexual] orientation. Netanyahu has sold the most important thing to us as a society to an extremist minority in his government for extraneous political interests, the value of equality.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Why the battle for gay rights in Israel passes through parenthood, not marriage</p> \n<p>Actress Gila Almagor, who attended the rally in Tel Aviv, told Haaretz: “The lack of equality cries out to the heavens. I am proud and straight, but why yes for single women and no for a father?” Is it all just politics and not morality, she asked? “What happened her is unprecedented.”</p> \n<p>Speaking at the rally in Tel Aviv, Chen Arieli, co-chairwoman of The Aguda, Israel’s National LGBT Task Force, called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “look at this square, there is a grievance here that demands action and not press releases. Now it is our turn, Mr. Prime Minister, to tell you no. No to empty statements, no to PR meetings empty of content, we demand actions. Come with me, Mr. Prime Minister, to meet your people,” Arieli said.</p> \n<p>Earlier in Tel Aviv, protesters briefly blocked the southbound lanes of the Ayalon Highway. Two protesters were arrested in Jerusalem after they disrupted traffic in the city center. Protesters also briefly blocked main roads in Haifa and in Be’er Sheva. In the northern city of Afula, 200 people demonstrated.</p> \n<p>The Israeli army said soldiers taking part&nbsp;in the protests around the country would not be punished, contrary to a prior statement in which the army said it prohibited soldiers from participating. &quot;Since the demonstration is ostensibly political, it is forbidden to take part in the demonstration,&quot; the statement said.</p> \n<p>The workers' committee of the Foreign Ministry expressed its support for the LGBT community:&nbsp;&quot;We want to express our solidarity with the ministry's employees who are working in Israel and abroad, who are often exposed to insults and contempt based on their sexual orientation.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some protesters also set up a tent on Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv. Protesters shouted slogans against the government and in support of the LGBT fight for equal rights. “If anyone tries to stop our fight for equality, they’ll find out that we’ll stop this whole country,&quot; they chanted.</p> \n<p>Meretz party chairwoman Tamar Zandberg addressed the Rothschild protests, saying: &quot;This week the government voted against the Israeli citizens and today we are showing them that Israel is stronger and more determined than the government.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Equality rights are a basic aspect of democracy and we will continue to be here and everywhere to support equality,&quot; Zandberg added</p> \n<p>Hundreds of protesters also demonstrated near the government offices in Haifa, and blocked Haatzmaut Street in the lower part of town carrying rainbow flags and banners reading &quot;there is no equality there is discrimination, bring down the government!&quot; and &quot;we won't surrender, we will win.&quot; Demonstrators also chanted slogans against Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett and the government.</p> \n<p>Sympathy for the protest was exceptionally widespread. Hundreds of employers announced that they would allow employees to observe the strike without penalty. The Histadrut labor federation expressed its support, and various companies published advertisements in support.</p> \n<p>“I believe that this struggle is receiving so much support because it touches many people on a personal level,” LGBT rights Knesset lobbyist Oded Frid said: “LGBT people, their families, their friends and the entire public that really supports the community’s rights and has difficulty accepting the lack of equality and clear discrimination.”</p> \n<p>One such person is Gilad Ben Ari, of Tel Aviv. His daughter, Gal, 24, lives with her partner in Nahariya, and he believes the rights of the gay community are connected to the rights of all people in modern society. “The basic right to be who you are, the basic right to be a parent,” he says. “As the father of a lesbian daughter, I feel more obligation to fight for the right to live quietly and securely,” he said.</p> \n<p>Even before the surrogacy law, Ben Ari stood by his daughter at every opportunity, but now he feels the fight needs to be taken up a notch. “Fighting also means speaking everywhere and in every conversation about human rights and against the ignorant societies in the world we live in, of the danger to a society that can agree to such outright discrimination.”</p> \n<p>Other issues that made headlines over the past several days also related to how government policy affects specific groups. It began with the detention of a Conservative rabbi who presided over a marriage outside the aegis of the Chief Rabbinate and continued with the nation-state law, which states that the right to national self-determination in Israel is exclusive to the Jewish people. Although it states that it does not affect the status of Arabic, it defines Hebrew as the country's official lanuage whereas Arabic is accorded &quot;special status. But those issues did not ignite anger like the surrogacy law.</p> \n<p>“Struggles over identity of certain groups or ... involving only weaker groups, are mistakenly seen as irrelevant to the public, and so people remains indifferent,” MK Shmuli said speaking earlier. When a struggle also involves the middle class, there is more of a chance for a mass protest, he claimed.</p> \n<p>The current LGBT protest is such a struggle, said Shmuli, who was a leader of the social protest in the summer of 2011. The economic obstacle of surrogacy — the cost is between $120,000 to $130,000 — is very relevant to the middle class, Shmuli explained, adding that the protest is about discrimination that affects many people, he says.</p> \n<p>Omer and Almog Bar-Lev Shiloah have been together for seven years. Two years ago they decided to expand their family. They had only one possibility: surrogacy in the United States. Not only was it expensive, but it took an emotional toll. “This is such a significant process in our lives and we had to do it from a distance of a 15-hour flight,” Omer told Haaretz. “When there are difficulties in the pregnancy, you can’t just pop over for reassurance. You can’t feel the babies during the pregnancy.” The couple’s twins, a girl and a boy, were born in January. Any desire they may have to give their children siblings remains only that, a desire, considering the difficulties the state puts in their way, Omer says.</p> \n<p>The road to surrogacy for gay men is not completely closed off. The High Court of Justice is now hearing a petition by Itay and Yoav Pinkas-Arad, which was filed before the law was passed. The court would not hear the case as long as the legislation was pending, but now that phase is past. “Having filed the petition almost nine years ago, we’re disappointed at the Knesset’s disgraceful decision,“ Itay Pinkas told Haaretz. But he said he was “encouraged and proud” that the protest had extended to so many parts of society.</p> \n<p>Hagai Kalai, a lawyer who represents the LGBT community in most of its High Court petitions, says that many people “feel the direct connection between discrimination against the LGBT community and other infringements on the liberal lifestyle, like separating men and women in public spaces enforcing modesty rules,” he says.</p> \n<p>The head of the Reform Movement in Israel, Rabbi Gilad Kariv also identifies with this aspect. “Most of the Israeli public does not want Israel to be a paradise for extremists, but to be a place that encourages tolerance, equality and acceptance. After a week in which MKs failed to understand this fact, the protest of the gay community that is sweeping up the public reminds us that the Israeli future will be decided not in the legislature, but in the kindergartens, the neighborhood parks, streets and squares and by the will of the Israeli public to stand up against zealotry and intolerance.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>An observant Jew may not eat a cheeseburger. Every Jew knows that. What they may not realize is that the basis for the inflexible separation of meat and milk is not based on clear instruction, either from above or from anywhere else.</p> \n<p>The complexities of Jewish dietary laws, including separating milk and meat, did not spring up ex nihilo. The customs evolved gradually, from the primeval beginnings of Judaism thousands of years ago until taking on their more or less current shape in Early Modern Europe. And it all began with one obscure verse in the Hebrew Bible, a verse about a baby goat, which appears however no less than three times: “Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk” (Exodus 23:19; 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21). But what does that mean?</p> \n<p>The fact is, this verse is not clear, and its meaning has been debated for millennia by sages and greats, including Philo, Rabbi Akiva, Maimonides, St. Augustine, Martin Luther, Julius Wellhausen, and Jacob Milgrom, to name just a few. The result has been quite a few theories.</p> \n<p>Recipes from the pagan kitchen</p> \n<p>The traditional view is that this verse was God’s way of saying Jews should keep meat and dairy separate. Why God would decide to separate meat from dairy is not explained: He works in mysterious ways and who are we to question God.</p> \n<p>Another theory, espoused by Maimonides and modern scholars, has it that boiling a kid in his mother’s milk was an ancient pagan practice that the ancient rabbis wanted to ban Jews from emulating.</p> \n<p>A third theory espoused by Philo and many others since has it that boiling a suckling animal in the liquid that was meant to give it sustenance was cruel, hence the ban.</p> \n<p>Yet another theory has it that the phrase “in his mother’s milk” originally meant “still suckling” and the meaning was: wait until the kid is weaned and only then may you cook and eat it.</p> \n<p>None of these theories is satisfactory. If God wanted to tell Jews to keep meat and dairy separate, why didn’t he just come right out and say it?</p> \n<p>Nor is there any evidence for a pagan rite of this kind; and if the writers of the bible wanted to compassionately ban cruelty to animals, why did it command that young animals be killed as sacrifices?</p> \n<p>Similarly, if the Bible wanted to ban Jews from eating unweaned kids, why does it elsewhere say that a kid may be sacrificed from the age of eight days on, when it is certainly still suckling (Leviticus 22:27)?</p> \n<p>Yet another possibility, first recorded in the 9th century biblical commentary by the Karaite scholar Benjamin Nahawandi, is that none of these theories are right, and the sentence has been misunderstood.</p> \n<p>That's BLL</p> \n<p>Hebrew is written without vowels, which makes the text susceptible to misreading.</p> \n<p>Readers of English take vowels for granted. But if you take the word &quot;bell&quot; and take away the &quot;e&quot;, for instance, you are left with BLL, which could be read as ball, bell, bill, boll or bull! It could even be bulla, belle, Billy, and so forth. You cannot possibly know which it is without context.</p> \n<p>The key word in the verse in question has four consonants: T, B, Sh and L, which can theoretically be read in different ways. So this word could be interpreted as cook, boil or seethe; or using different vowel sounds, it could mean &quot;to ripen,&quot; i.e., mature.</p> \n<p>Given its context in the bible, that interpretation could make sense.</p> \n<p>The verse first appears in in Exodus 23, not among dietary laws as one might expect but among laws governing sacrifices at the Temple on holidays. In this context, the meaning “mature” could make sense: Do not wait for the newborn livestock to be weaned, bring it to the Temple right away.</p> \n<p>If this was in fact the original intention of the verse, it was misconstrued at a very early date.</p> \n<p>Both references in Exodus place the prohibition in conjunction with the Temple sacrifice. The editor who placed the verse in Deuteronomy, probably at the very beginning of the Second Temple period (the 5th or 4th century B.C.E.) put it into a section dealing with dietary laws. Clearly he read the verb in the verse to mean “boil”.</p> \n<p>Whatever the original meaning of the verse, it seems that very early on, this verse was understood as a prohibition on literally cooking a young goat in his own mother’s milk. That is, it would have been fine if one cooked it in the milk of some other she-goat as long as it wasn’t his mother.</p> \n<p>This seems to be the way the Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria understood the prohibition in the first century C.E., at the very end of the Second Temple period. He though makes the reach that &quot;kid&quot; means any baby mammal, including sheep and cows (Virtues 8:249–251).</p> \n<p>We do not know when precisely the verse began to be interpreted as a prohibition on mixing meat and dairy. It may have been already interpreted this way by some Jews in the time of Philo, unbeknownst to him, or perhaps it only developed in the aftermath of the destruction of the Temple in 70 C.E.</p> \n<p>What we do know is that in the second century C.E., when Targum Onkelos, the rabbinical sanctioned translation of the Torah into Aramaic, was made, that was the established reading. Onkelos translates the verse “You shall not eat meat in milk.” The goat and his mother were edited out for clarity.</p> \n<p>The succinct interpretation provided in the Aramaic translation is elaborated upon in the Mishnah, a legal codex of Rabbinic Judaism redacted in about 200 C.E. According to the Mishnah (Hullin 8:1-2) the prohibition on eating meat in milk encompasses not only mammals but poultry too, but not fish and locusts.</p> \n<p>The Mishnah in its accepted form is conflicted, however, about this inclusion of fowl, which of course do not lactate, also saying, “One who brings up fowl with cheese on the table does not transgress a negative commandment.” (Hullin 8:3) This more than implies that the verse on the kid and mother goat did not include fowl, for if it did, bringing fowl on the table with cheese would transgress that negative commandment.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the Babylonian Talmud (Hullin 116a) recounts a story about Rabbi Levi going to eat dinner at the house of Joseph the Fowler, who served him peacock head cooked in milk. When Levi tells this to his rabbi Abba Arika, he asks why Levi didn’t excommunicate Joseph then and there. Levi responds that he thought they practiced the law according to Rabbi Jose the Galilean, which excluded poultry since it doesn’t have mother’s milk. This story seems to show that the view that chicken may be eaten with dairy was suppressed some time in the 3rd century or so.</p> \n<p>Wait for it</p> \n<p>Once it was established that meat, including poultry, may not be eaten together with milk or any milk products, the next issue that the rabbis tackled was the technical question of how to achieve the separation of eating cheese and meat. This seems to have been a matter of debate during Talmudic times (3rd to 5th centuries).</p> \n<p>According to the Talmud (Hullin 104b), all that is required between eating meat and eating dairy is that one wash his hands and wash out his mouth. On the next page (Hullin 105a), Rabbi Assi asks Rabbi Johanan bar Nappaha how long one must wait between eating meat and cheese, and Johanan, the greatest rabbi of third century Palestine answers, “no time at all.” This was apparently the rule accepted by the rabbis in Palestine.</p> \n<p>The rabbis in Babylonia on the other hand seemed to have come to a different conclusion.</p> \n<p>The Babylonian rabbis thought that a period of waiting must be observed at least between eating meat and dairy. No wait is necessary between eating dairy and then meat, they concluded, based on a saying of Rabbi Hasda. The rabbis of Babylonia concluded that Johanan must have been talking about meat following cheese, but not cheese following meat, though this is in fact not actually stated.</p> \n<p>However, the rabbis of Babylonia seem to have not decided what the exact time period one must wait between eating meat and eating dairy. A statement made by Mar Ukva in the same Talmudic section states that the more pious waited a day and less pious waited shorter periods of time.</p> \n<p>Apparently, the more lenient view of the Palestinian rabbis made its way to northern Europe (modern-day northern France and Germany) in the Late Middle Ages (11th to the 13th centuries). The Jewish communities there did not observe a waiting period between meat meals and dairy meals - as long as they were separate meals. Even if they were back to back, it was fine.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the more stringent Babylonian tradition requiring a waiting period from meat to cheese took root in southern Europe (modern-day Spain and southern France). Eventually, this was codified by Maimonides in the 12th century as a six-hour wait, which is still the tradition among Sephardic Jews.</p> \n<p>Another important development appeared in Europe in the 12th or 13th century. The rabbis of the period decided that certain cooking vessels absorbed the flavor of the meat or the dairy cooked in them for 24 hours. Thus they argued, using these vessels for cooking the other within the same 24 hours could constitute a violation of the meat in dairy rule and thus was forbidden. Gradually this rule concerning cooking vessels developed into the practice of keeping separate cookware, dishes and cutlery for meat and dairy over time, which is the practice today.</p> \n<p>In later generations (15th and 16th centuries) the proliferation of the clock in Europe led to the adoption of a set period for waiting in northern Europe too, though only for an hour, not six as in the Sephardic tradition). But in later generations (17th to the 19th centuries), various Ashkenazi communities adopted longer waiting periods, typically three hours in the case of German communities, six hours in Eastern Europe, and famously in the case of Dutch Jews, only one hour.</p> \n<p>Thus the small seed planted in antiquity - an obscure verse about a baby goat in the Bible - grew into a massive tree of regulations, rules and traditions dictating what Jews may and may not eat.</p>",

Keeping Israel as the Jewish nation-state does not threaten the future of the Jewish people; it safeguards it. Protecting Jewish traditions, just as they safeguarded our people through two millenniums of exile, is the only way to be sure that Israel can continue to be a strong and vibrant democracy in a very difficult region.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;While I welcome the concern of our Jewish brethren, alongside many friends of Israel around the world, and while I have full faith in their love for Israel and the Jewish people, I would urge all to remember that disagreement isn’t dangerous.

Sometimes she emerged from the hallway dressed up like a gorilla and scared us to death. She had all kinds of masks in her closet, and we waited in suspense for the next thing. She told us stories, impersonated family members, stung us with loving sarcasm and was always there for the big family that she had brought into the world.</p> \n<p>Life in Tripoli wasn’t harder for Nonna than life in Israel. She was an educated girl who possessed joie de vivre, knew four languages even before she learned Hebrew (Arabic, Italian, English and Ladino), loved to sing the songs of the Egyptian artists Farid el-Atrash and Abdel Halim Hafez, was an avid dancer and later did all she could not to let the difficult life in Israel break her. The story of my grandfather and grandmother is the story of an ancient community that disappeared from Libya but found itself in Israel, where it carries on the customs that sustained it for thousands of years.</p> \n<p>How little I know about her, about the life that led her to become my grandmother. How little I know about the culture she came from, though it dictates so much of the person I am today.</p> \n<p>My grandmother’s life was full and rich, and despite the blows – most poignantly the loss of an infant daughter and later of a son at age 21 – she remained proud and beautiful and was always laughing. Humor was integral to her life, and without it things would surely have been much harder. After her death, I discovered that this lighthearted temperament, which blends life’s ingredients into something digestible, is characteristic of the place where she grew up.</p> \n<p>An ‘Italicization’ process</p> \n<p>Libyan society was divided and polarized, mainly between the urban population in the province of Tripolitania and the more rural Benghazi region (known as Cyrenaica). The people of Tripoli are known for their warm temperament – they love life’s pleasures; they like to talk, celebrate and amuse one another. My grandfather was the exact opposite. The people of Benghazi, where he spent his childhood, are considered more introverted, insular, even stern. He was like that, too, accepting everything with tranquility and sangfroid but without much verbalizing.</p> \n<p>The Jews of Libya settled in the Tripoli and Benghazi regions following the expulsion from Spain at the end of the 15th century and the start of the 16th. They came from Spain, Portugal and Italy, and lived without much fanfare in Libya until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1904, according to “The Jews of Libya: Coexistence, Persecution, Resettlement” by Ben-Gurion University’s Maurice Roumani, Libya’s Jewish community numbered 18,000. The great majority, 12,000, lived in and around Tripoli, the country’s largest city (a third of whose population was Jewish), and 2,000 lived in Benghazi, the second largest. By 1939, Libya’s Jewish population stood at 30,000, increasing to 32,670 by 1948.</p> \n<p>The Jews lived mostly in their own neighborhoods, particularly in Tripoli, where they resided in the Jewish Quarter (Haret el-Yahud). They were for the most part from the lower middle class, and traditional in their behavior, not embracing the changes wrought by the start of modernization in Libya at the end of the 19th century. At the same time, a minority of Libyan Jews were more affluent and were influenced by European culture. Tension developed between the two groups and was worsened by the Italian occupation, which extended between 1911 and 1943.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the 32-year occupation generated many positive changes for the Jewish community, including improved civil rights, a better economy and a higher rate of education. The Jews entered the colonial bureaucracy, became active in trade with Europe, and took up the liberal professions. The sociologist Shlomo Swirski, in his book “Seeds of Inequality” (Hebrew, 1995), notes that this process often included a narrowing of class differences and the political and cultural identification of some of the Jewish elite with the Europeans. This was the case with the elite in Tripoli, who adopted Italian culture.</p> \n<p>The colonial authorities in Libya had the Jews learning Italian in the schools, expanded trade between Libya and Italy, introduced modern economic methods, and cultivated Western culture and its values. Roumani notes that during the Italian occupation, 43.8 percent of the Jewish men and 29.7 percent of the Jewish women in Tripoli spoke Italian. The phenomenon was even more widespread in Benghazi, where Italian was spoken by 67.1 percent of Jewish men and 40.8 percent of the Jewish women. The Italians also invested in improving life in the Haret el-Yahud, many of whose residents were poor and where there was a high birth rate and low education level.</p> \n<p>Beginning in the 1920s, the Jews extended their businesses into new markets, and in the ‘30s many Jewish-owned companies that offered shares and incorporated partnerships were established. But the Italians reduced the autonomy of the Jewish community; its leaders, members of the local social elite, were permitted to engage only in social, cultural and welfare matters.</p> \n<p>Zionism without Zion</p> \n<p>My grandmother was born in 1935 to Nissim and Miriam Ben Lulu. Her mother was a member of the prosperous and prominent Farid family of Tripoli. From her stories, I could picture the house she lived in – spacious and high-ceilinged – where at 5 P.M. everyone would gather in the central courtyard for coffee and traditional sweet biscuits. The family owned farms, buildings and herds of cattle, and employed a laundrywoman, a cleaner and a baker. They spoke Italian, and Italian culture was an essential part of their life.</p> \n<p>My grandmother attended a non-Jewish school, because Tripoli’s Jewish schools were for boys only. Her speech fused Arabic, Hebrew, Italian, Ladino and occasionally a bit of English, from a stretch she lived in the United States with two of her children. The mix of languages was part of her world. But this cultural diversity was diminished in the generations that followed. From that rich world – Arab, Italian, Jewish, extraordinarily cosmopolitan – the children of my grandparents inherited just one language. The worldview was reduced to just one culture that in itself isn’t whole but consists of patches of cultures and worlds remote from us.</p> \n<p>My grandfather, by contrast, came from a lower social class; his father was a fisherman and his mother descended from a family of rabbis. He attended a Jewish school and could read and write Arabic and Hebrew. His mother used to say that he loved learning, and because they had no means she tore up flour bags, smoothed them out and turned them into pages for him to write on.</p> \n<p>Roumani relates that Jewish education in Libya, which was considered to be on a low level, was based in synagogues and private homes. From the end of the 19th century, Jewish education was reformed, and began to include the introduction of nonreligious subjects and the Italian language. In 1890, three schools of the Paris-based Alliance network opened in Libya, offering a French-Zionist education.</p> \n<p>My grandmother didn’t get involved in political issues, but my grandfather was very much attracted to Zionism. As a boy he helped the Zionist movements in Benghazi by delivering packages and letters. The Zionist movement arrived in Italy at the end of the 19th century, but it took off after the start of the Italian occupation, which motivated not only the social-cultural elite, but young Jews as well.</p> \n<p>Organized Zionism was established from 1913. In the 1920s and ‘30s, schools that taught Hebrew and a large Hebrew library were established in Tripoli and Benghazi. The Zionists in Tripoli believed that it was essential for Jews to learn Hebrew in order to counteract the influence of the Italians, which rendered them less traditional and estranged them from the community. The Zionist movement in Libya held cultural events, published a weekly newspaper, established sports associations such as Maccabi, and founded youth movements and even a religious kibbutz-oriented group.</p> \n<p>The Mussolini effect</p> \n<p>In September 1938, as a result of the alliance between Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, Italy and Libya adopted their first race laws. Jews were forbidden to hold permanent residences in Italy, Libya and other regions, and were banned from public schools. Mixed marriages were outlawed, and business dealings between Jews and non-Jews were prohibited. The Jews were summarily dismissed from employment in government ministries, municipalities, banks and public institutions. Roumani notes that Libya’s Jews suffered additional abuse at the hands of the Italian police and Italian institutions.</p> \n<p>Yet the strategic role that the Jews had played in the Libyan economy moderated the fascists’ race policy. Roumani quotes a 1938 report by the Milan police, which reported on the very strong financial status of Libyan Jews, especially when it came to offering discounts. The report also noted Jews’ quick responses, in contrast to the slowness and the reserved character of the Italian banks. But as Italy became more deeply involved in the war, the race laws were implemented with greater stringency and additional laws were promulgated.</p> \n<p>Jews who held Libyan citizenship were interned in concentration camps in Tripolitania, notably Jadu, where my grandfather and his family were imprisoned, and in other cities in the Yafran and Gharian region, where my grandmother and her family languished. Those holding British citizenship were sent to camps in Europe, including Innsbruck in Austria and Bergen-Belsen in Germany.</p> \n<p>The appalling conditions in the camps led to epidemics that claimed many lives. Such conditions were aggravated by brutal acts of humiliation and oppression by the Italian officers; every day the men were forced to do long hours of backbreaking work. Particularly horrific conditions existed in Jadu. My grandfather, who was 9 at the time, says many members of his family were murdered in the camp.</p> \n<p>My grandfather’s mother drew picture of dolls and sold them to Arabs through the fence. One day she was caught; an Italian officer hit her with a crowbar and broke her back – she remained hunched over for the rest of her life. My grandfather’s father fled to Egypt with his eldest son before the transport to Jadu. He wasn’t reunited with his family until 1949, in Israel.</p> \n<p>The events of the war, the pogroms against the Jews in Libya by the country’s Arabs in 1945 and 1948, and of course Israel’s establishment and the ongoing lobby for immigration – all of these generated aliyah. Between 1949 and 1952, almost all of Libya’s Jews immigrated to Israel, among them my grandfather and grandmother and their families.</p> \n<p>The first years in the Jewish state were a trying period for the community. They were housed in transit camps, maltreated by the authorities, and were the victims of discrimination, racism and poverty. From the capacious house in Tripoli, my grandparents came to a transit camp in Mikve Yisrael near Tel Aviv. Roumani describes the dramatic worsening in living conditions that afflicted most of Tripoli’s Jews in Israel, even those from Benghazi. Nonetheless, community life was rich and full.</p> \n<p>In any event, the transplanted Libyans didn’t completely come to terms with their fate; they often demanded from the Jewish Agency employment, housing and an end to the neglect. Many of them were farmers, and they asked the Jewish Agency for plots of land to settle and work, requests that were generally granted. In the first three years after their arrival they established 12 moshavim – cooperative farming communities – throughout Israel, from the north to the south. By the end of 2000, there were 25 moshavim founded by Jews of Libyan origin. According to the World Organization of Libyan Jews, as of 2008 about 130,000 Jews of Libyan descent were living in Israel.</p> \n<p>My grandfather and grandmother met at the wedding of a relative. My grandfather managed a farm, raised cattle and opened a butcher shop in Ramat Gan, which he ran with my grandmother. There they also learned how to speak Yiddish. She gave birth to eight children, the first of which, a daughter, died in infancy.</p> \n<p>Gradually they sank their roots, until the tragedy that shook their lives – their son, Uzi Hasson, was murdered in a terror attack. For a long time they kept to themselves and lost many of their sources of livelihood, but they didn’t give up and were able to maintain the family honorably.</p> \n<p>Other members of the family, notably my grandmother’s mother’s affluent family, bypassed Israel in favor of Italy, where Libyan Jews became part of the upper class and did well economically, often as goldsmiths. My grandparents wouldn’t have forgone Israel for any price – but I can’t shake off the thought: What would have happened if we had gone to Italy instead?</p>",

        "text":["<p>Rotem Nachmias, 43, from Arad; arriving from the Netherlands</p> \n<p>Hello, landing after a long trip?</p> \n<p>Eleven days. Never in my life had I left the children for more than four days.</p> \n<p>And from where are you returning to us?</p> \n<p>I was in a small village in Holland, where my partner lives. He’s not Israeli. We met many years ago at the Dead Sea, but I was married and nothing happened, and when I was divorced we remembered each other and decided to go for it. So we’re both on the Holland-Israel line, and it’s great.</p> \n<p>How did you meet at the Dead Sea? How romantic to meet someone at the lowest point in the world.</p> \n<p>We met because I came to give treatments there. I’m a masseuse and a reflexologist, and I also treat psoriasis. He was there for that reason, and that was that. At first he had psoriasis all over his body, and now only a little on the back of the neck. (Laughs)</p> \n<p>How did you get into the profession?</p> \n<p>By mistake, of course. I started architecture studies right after the army, and on a trip to Canada and the United States, I did a course in snowboarding. I didn’t find myself – coming from the desert to the snow – but on the course I met someone who taught massage, anatomy and physiology in San Diego. I went there, was turned on by the college, and stayed. I dropped the architecture and got into the architecture of the body. (Laughs)</p> \n<p>Where do you live?</p> \n<p>I live in Arad. I was born and raised there. My father was one of the city’s founders. He was there from the beginning, in the ‘60s, and worked at the Dead Sea Works, which belonged to an American company – they built the infrastructure for the whole place. My father is originally from Tiberias but grew up in Kibbutz Mishmarot in the “outside child” program. Arad was established by former kibbutzniks, so it has an essentially secular and pluralistic character.</p> \n<p>That’s right, and you used to have the well-known Arad Festival of pop music.</p> \n<p>Yes. During the festival, every home that could, or couldn’t, hosted the festival-goers. If, say, there were guys who were sleeping outside on the grass, people would open their home and invite them to shower and have something to eat. In the final performance at the festival by Meir Ariel – who was my father’s classmate on Kibbutz Mishmarot – we had 50 kids in the house. Meir sat there with my father and they reminisced, and then Meir just invited everyone, the whole 50, to his show and gave them tickets.</p> \n<p>That sounds magical, and it causes a bit of a pang in the heart.</p> \n<p>Yes. It was a city where people didn’t lock their doors. I walked around shoeless and people would say to me, “Would you like me to buy you shoes?” I would answer, “My dad can do it.” There was prosperity, it was the pearl of the desert.</p> \n<p>And what happened to Arad after that?</p> \n<p>In the past four years we’ve had a little immigration by Gur Hasidim, who became a fifth of the population, but a fifth whose presence is strongly felt. It’s not just a problem in Arad, it’s happening in other parts of the country, covertly. It’s disturbing, this takeover, because a uniform society is a sick society.</p> \n<p>What has become more acute?</p> \n<p>It’s not especially new – there have been Gur people since the ‘60s. The admor [the sect’s leader] was asthmatic and had a house there [because of the dry climate], and they didn’t bother anyone. But in 2014 the gates opened and more and more of them arrived. At first people didn’t notice so much, because we’re very accommodating and accepting, until it reached the stage of spitting at “revealingly dressed” girls.</p> \n<p>And what did you do?</p> \n<p>After the Gur people hung “for sale” signs on houses, even occupied houses, with phone numbers of nonexistent companies, just to create a feeling that the city was emptying out of its secular population, an Arad couple printed a sign with pictures of [Gur leader Yaakov Arye] Alter and [Gur sect MK Yaakov] Litzman and hung it up on Shabbat. After the end of Shabbat there were burning tires, and then we demonstrated. It was a rough, violent demonstration, until the police arrived to break it up. We didn’t disperse until 4 in the morning, when they brought in Litzman himself.</p> \n<p>What next?</p> \n<p>They understood that there were people who would fight them, but elections are coming up and the secular representative has already sold us down the river. One of the candidates is an Arad native who has returned to the city. Let’s hope he’s elected and we’ll see what happens.</p> \n<p>Asaf Rahamim, 42, from Kibbutz Beit Hashita; flying to Romania</p> \n<p>Hello, would you like to tell us where you’re flying to?</p> \n<p>I’m going to an off-road motorcycle competition. It’s said to be the hardest in the world. A 15-year-old girl is taking part, who will probably be the youngest competitor there, and I’m going with her to shoot a documentary about her. My field in photography is extreme sports.</p> \n<p>How do you shoot a documentary?</p> \n<p>In principle, you need to get into the situation and learn it. In this case, because the racing situation is almost impossible, and many don’t even manage to cross the starting line, the documentary will focus on the experience she undergoes, irrespective of the result, so there will be a story no matter what.</p> \n<p>Are there things that should or shouldn’t be done in the documentary situation?</p> \n<p>The important thing is to be open all the time, not to create interference, to be careful, attentive, not to miss an incident. It’s challenging because you don’t know where you’re going – you know there’s a story and approximately what you want to say, but you don’t know what will happen at every moment. There can be one minute that’s wow and then two dull days.</p> \n<p>How did you come to connect extreme sports and photography?</p> \n<p>I’ve been a motorcycle rider from a young age, and my brother studied photography for two years in an academic program. I followed suit, and by the age of 11 I was already developing pictures by myself.</p> \n<p>Sounds terrific. What did you do?</p> \n<p>I would take pictures, I rushed to create ideas. I would come to a spot on Mount Gilboa, ask riders to kick up dust and I’d shoot. The photography has developed since then, but I still don’t use Photoshop. For example, a new moped arrived in Israel and I shot it in 360 degrees in a studio, against a white background on a revolving white stage. I like to take a complex idea and succeed in photographing it.</p> \n<p>Can you elaborate on that?</p> \n<p>For example, in 2010 I took friends who do hang gliding to shoot them doing their thing at night. I understood that because of the dark, the black background, it didn’t really matter against which background I photographed them. And I got an idea there. I took a hall and, using rappelling ropes, I hung them all in the air with their gliders. They were the stars of the scenes I shot. I didn’t even have to erase the cables with Photoshop because they were black against a black background. From there I went on to snowboarding, bikes and in the end I even hung motorcycles. I hung them so they looked like they were just about to crash, but it was actually a studio shot. And if, say, a bit of dust was missing I’d ask someone to clap his hands with flour. Without manipulating the picture.</p> \n<p>You talk about shooting special photos without Photoshop, but in the end we live in an era in which everyone has a camera in their pocket and can upload the picture instantly. How does a photographer stay distinct, and how is the field developing in this situation?</p> \n<p>I’m interested in the creative side more than in just the photography. It interests me to create something complex and succeed in making it real. Say I’m at a work meeting. I come with a prepared storyboard of the places we’ll shoot from, with the whole idea for the video ready and clear. The CEO tells me, “Your business card says Photographer, but you’re not only a photographer.” And the truth is, my business card now says ‘Creative – Production – Photography.”</p> \n<p>Well done, a necessary leap forward. Finally, how do you go home calm after the adrenaline of motorcycle riding?</p> \n<p>It’s just the opposite. A rider needs to use up adrenaline so he can come home clean. Riding is the place that’s pleasurable for me. Today I arrived at the airport – I could have used Route 6 – but I drove through the Jordan Valley, through all that nature, on winding roads. That’s a good way to clear the head, and it gives you a kick.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Jeremy Corbyn is a paragon of a leftist, one who has fought his whole life for the values he believes in. Israelis regard him as a sort of alien – the left here has never been led by an Israeli Corbyn, nor by anyone who can hold a candle to him.</p> \n<p>Corbyn is a brave man. He voted in parliament 553 times against his party’s position, and yet he took its leadership by storm. He voted against the war in Iraq, against nuclear weapons and against British rule in Northern Ireland. He was active in Amnesty against Augusto Pinochet, and was arrested in anti-apartheid demonstrations in South Africa.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Why Corbynism is a threat to Jews throughout the Western world</p> \n<p>With such a conscience and courage he wouldn’t have gotten anywhere in Israel, apart from Breaking the Silence. In Britain he has a good chance of being elected the next prime minister. Nothing lights up the imagination and inspires hope more than that. Anyone who wants to see the world take action against the Israeli occupation should dream of Corbyn.</p> \n<p>Corbyn has been declared the next enemy of the Jews. Viktor Orban is a righteous among the nations; the American alt-right is the rock of Israel and its savior; Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines’ leader who called to kill millions “like Hitler,” is a welcome guest in Israel – and Corbyn is the enemy of the people.</p> \n<p>The Jewish establishment in Britain and Israeli propaganda have taken out a contract on him, to foil his election: He’s an anti-Semite, Labor is anti-Semitic, Jewish life in Britain is in “existential danger,” no less, as three British Jewish newspapers cried out in a joint editorial.</p> \n<p>While the situation of any Jew in Britain is better, safer, more egalitarian and freer than the condition of any Arab citizen in Israel, not to mention the Palestinians in the occupied territories, the Jewish establishment’s desperate cry for help raised an uproar and commotion against Corbyn.</p> \n<p>The Israeli press hastened to join the incitement campaign – branding every Labor utterance as anti-Semitic. Party Member Peter Willsman branded the rabbis who accused his party of anti-Semitism as “Jewish Trump fanatics” – gevalt, anti-Semitism. Some commentator accused Corbyn of being too apologetic, another accused him of not apologizing. Even a young, impressive journalist like Antonia Yamin of Kan hastened to join the instigation crusade.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Orban Is a Clever anti-Semite. Corbyn Is a Stupid One&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;A Dishonest Fallacy: Israel’s Occupation Isn't Why anti-Semitism’s Spiking&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>Let it be said: Corbyn is a staunch, consistent opponent of Israel’s occupation policy. That is his right; as a true leftist it’s his duty. On Labor’s fringes there are certainly anti-Semitic circles; Corbyn stated several days ago in an op-ed in The Guardian that they have no place in his party. The attempt to reduce what Labor defines as anti-Semitic, unlike the prevalent definition of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, doesn’t necessarily make the party anti-Semitic.</p> \n<p>But the Jewish-Israeli propaganda persists: When Israel enacts the apartheid law and its soldiers kill 160 unarmed demonstrators on the Gaza border, the only response is to accuse anyone who criticizes this of anti-Semitism. It works, it places the accused in the prosecutor’s role.</p> \n<p>Israel has enacted a law saying it is the nation-state of the Jewish people. In other words, anything Israel does represents the entire Jewish people. This has a price.</p> \n<p>When an Israeli sniper shoots dead a legless man in a wheelchair, and a nurse – the Jewish people is a partner. Thus Israel’s policy is inflaming anti-Semitism in the world. It may and should be criticized, as Labor does and as Corbyn does, and the gagging, in the form of labeling any criticism as anti-Semitism, is outrageous.

Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here</p> \n<p>VIEW IN DEBUT: An early version of today's Daily Kickoff was available in the Debut Inbox starting at 7:08 AM EDT  HEARD THIS MORNING — Ivanka Trump in conversation with Axios Executive Editor Mike Allen at the Newseum in DC: “Every day I walk in the White House and that means something. It’s very special. And I never, ever let myself forget the privilege that I have to serve our country.” &nbsp; In introducing the morning's conversation, Mike Allen noted that “RSVPs for this event have broken all our records in 12 years of doing conversations like this. You’ve gotten more response than Bill Gates or Mark Cuban.” Ivanka reacted: “That’s pretty impressive.”  Ivanka on her future: &quot;I am 36 years old, so I have a long life ahead of me, and I don’t know what it holds for me. At some point, I will likely return to the private sector, but I don’t have a timetable.”  Allen: So you might live in Washington permanently?  Ivanka: “Or not go back to that business (the fashion brand). I just don’t know. I am really passionate about the work i am doing here and I am committed to it.”  Allen: So you might spend the rest of your life in the ‘swamp’?&nbsp;  Ivanka: “Well, that’s highly unlikely.” [Video]  Allen: Do you think the media is the 'enemy' of the people?  Ivanka: &quot;No, I do not. I can share my own personal perspective. I have certainly received my fair share of reporting on me&nbsp;personally that I know not to be fully accurate. So I have some sensitivity around why people have concerns and gripe especially when they sort of feel targeted. But no, I do not feel that the media is 'the enemy of the people.'&quot;  Ivanka added that the news about family separations at the border was a &quot;low point&quot; during her time in the White House: &quot;I felt very strongly about that and I am very vehemently against family separation and the separation of parents and children... Immigration is incredibly complex as a topic. Illegal immigration is incredibly complicated. I am the daughter of an immigrant, my mother grew up in communist Czech Republic, but we are a country of laws... These are not easy issues, these are incredibly difficult issues and like the rest of the country, I experienced them in a very emotional way.&quot; [CNN]  DRIVING THE CONVO&nbsp;— As Israel Enshrines Its Jewish Identity, Its Druze Minority Feels Abandoned — by&nbsp;Dov Lieber&nbsp;and&nbsp;Felicia Schwartz:&nbsp;&quot;Scores of former senior military and police chiefs are pressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to revise&nbsp;a recent law enshrining the country&nbsp;as a Jewish nation-state to include the Druze, an ethnic minority ingrained in military and civic life...&nbsp;On Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu’s office offered a draft of a plan to address the community’s complaints, including legislation that would “anchor” the status of the Druze in law, offer benefits for minority-group members who serve in the military and recognize Druze’s contributions to protecting Israel.&quot; [WSJ]&nbsp;  REPORT: Israel assures U.S. Jewish &quot;nation-state&quot; law won't lead to discrimination — by Barak Ravid:&nbsp;&quot;Senior U.S. officials asked senior officials in the Israeli Prime Minister's office for clarification over the [new nation-state] law...&nbsp;The Israeli Prime Minister's office confirmed&nbsp;the issue was raised during a meeting between Netanyahu's chief of staff, Yoav Horowitz, and U.S. ambassador David Friedman...&nbsp;At this stage, the White House accepts&nbsp;the clarifications from Netanyahu's office. Nevertheless, the U.S. is following the protests in Israel against the bill, and criticism about it in the Jewish community in America.&quot;  &quot;One of the critics of the law was Alan Dershowitz,&nbsp;who is perceived as being close to President Trump. Dershowitz spoke publicly against the law in an interview to i24 news channel.&quot; [Axios]  PROFILE:&nbsp;Stav Shaffir Speaks for Us, Too — by&nbsp;Armin Rosen:&nbsp;“Despair is not a political strategy.” It isn’t an option for American Jews, either, Shaffir stressed. “One of the things that I wish for American Jews to understand, especially for the American liberal democratic camp of American Jews, is the amount of influence that the extreme right wing in Israel is getting from the American right,” she said.&nbsp;[Tablet]  -- FIRST LOOK: Adam Rubenstein profiles&nbsp;&quot;Kid Trump&quot; — Charlie Kirk, the 24-year-old founder of Turning Point USA: &quot;Charlie Kirk calls himself “the luckiest 24-year-old ever to exist.” He started the group six years ago instead of going to college and now has 130,000 high school students, undergrads, and recent college graduates on board in what he calls the fight “to save Western civilization.” [WeeklyStandard]  UPCOMING:&nbsp;National Security Advisor John Bolton will visit Israel from&nbsp;August 12th—13th amid Israeli&nbsp;concerns about the Trump Administration's&nbsp;approach to Iran, according to Hadashot's Dana Weiss.&nbsp;  --&nbsp;John Bolton Brings a Nuclear Superhawk Into the White House:&nbsp;&quot;John Bolton has quietly gotten his very own John Bolton, and his name is Tim Morrison. Morrison possesses a hostility to negotiated restrictions on U.S. nuclear weapons that&nbsp;rivals Bolton’s own, as well as an expertise on nuclear issues undisputed by even his harshest critics...&nbsp;He’s a stridently partisan person who constantly insisted on confrontation with the [Obama] administration,” said a former official at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).&quot; [DailyBeast]  Israel warns Iran of military response if it closed key Red Sea strait —&nbsp;by&nbsp;Ori Lewis:&nbsp;“If Iran will try to block the straits of Bab al-Mandeb, I am certain that it will find itself confronting an international coalition that will be determined to prevent this, and this coalition will also include all of Israel’s military branches,” Netanyahu said at a passing out parade for new naval officers in Haifa.&nbsp;[Reuters]  ON THE GROUND —&nbsp;Israel says Assad back in charge, Syrian front likely to be quieter:&nbsp;&quot;Israel described the Syrian civil war as effectively over on Thursday and predicted that the Golan Heights frontier between the countries would be quieter with central rule by Damascus restored there... “From our perspective, the situation is returning to how it was before the civil war, meaning there is a real address, someone responsible, and central rule,” [Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman] told reporters, referring to a decades-old standoff between Israel and Syria.&quot; [Reuters]  Israel Kills Seven Armed ISIS Terrorists Approaching Syria Border — by Yaniv Kubovich:&nbsp;&quot;Seven Islamic State terrorists were killed in an Israeli attack overnight Wednesday in Syria's Golan Heights.&nbsp;The terrorists came as close to 200 meters to the Israel-Syria border, at which point Israeli troops launched an attack against them.&quot; [Haaretz]&nbsp;  Netanyahu cancels Colombia trip, citing Gaza situation:&nbsp;&quot;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has canceled a trip to Colombia planned for next week due to the situation around the Gaza Strip, an Israeli official said on Thursday.&quot; [Reuters]  U.S. quietly released funding a few weeks ago to the Palestinian Authority security forces:&nbsp;&quot;Top Trump administration&nbsp;officials have talked up&nbsp;America's years of assistance to Palestinians — even as the administration has taken steps to curtail its own contributions. &quot;The United States has given billions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians. We've done nothing but help,&quot; a senior administration official told NPR... &quot;Anybody who thinks that the United States has to engender more goodwill with them after all this country has done for them is not necessarily looking at the full picture.&quot;  &quot;The U.S. quietly released funding a few weeks ago to the Palestinian Authority security forces. The money supports them working with Israel to maintain security in the West Bank, the State Department said. Now the administration is deciding which other Palestinian aid projects it might unfreeze, based on whether the projects meet national security interests and policy goals and provide &quot;value to U.S. taxpayers,&quot; a State Department official said, without specifying.&quot; [NPR]&nbsp;  Israel inaugurates Jewish heritage center in hotly contested East Jerusalem neighborhood -- by&nbsp;Erin Cunningham:&nbsp;&quot;Amid high security, senior Israeli ministers and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, a staunch supporter of Israel,&nbsp;attended the ceremony&nbsp;on a narrow, trash-strewn street in the Silwan neighborhood, a recent flash point for tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. The Israel government says the center will honor Yemenite Jews who lived here in the 19th&nbsp;century and has allocated $1.2&nbsp;million to develop the site.&quot; [WashPost]  ON THE HILL — Yesterday, the Senate passed&nbsp;(87-10) the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019. The legislation includes the U.S.-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2018, which&nbsp;authorizes&nbsp;the 10-year MOU (memorandum of understanding) signed between Israel and the Obama administration in 2016, $500 million for U.S.-Israel missile defense cooperation and up to $50 million for U.S.-Israel counter-tunnel cooperation. The bill now goes to President Trump, who is expected to sign it into law.  Israeli-born New York Assemblywoman Nily Rozic (D-Queens)&nbsp;sent a follow-up letter addressed to President Trump&nbsp;urging the&nbsp;administration to fill the vacancy in the U.S. Department of State for a Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat anti-Semitism. &quot;The Special Envoy has played a unique and important role in the effort to fight against anti-Semitism and for human rights. Please appoint a Special Envoy to help eradicate anti-Semitism and do not allow this important post to remain vacant,&quot; Rozic wrote.  TOP TALKER:&nbsp;Kirsten Gillibrand Pays The Price For Speaking Out Against Al Franken — by Amanda Terkel:&nbsp;&quot;Most prominently, Gillibrand has attracted the ire of billionaire George Soros, who has long funded Democratic candidates and causes. Soros recently said he wasn’t sure whom he was supporting for 2020, but that it absolutely wouldn’t be Gillibrand. He accused her of going after Franken, “whom I admire,” to “improve her chances” for president. “If standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that’s on him,” Gillibrand said in a statement to HuffPost... When someone does something wrong, you have to speak up and be counted, whether it’s President Trump, or a Democratic colleague.”&quot; [HuffPost]&nbsp;  Ocasio-Cortez Invite To Shoah Museum Backfires— by Stewart Ain:&nbsp;&quot;The Immigrant Arts Coalition was trying to make a match — hold a conference on immigration and women’s empowerment at the museum and feature the future face of the Democratic Party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez... But... it turned&nbsp;out not&nbsp;to be a match made in heaven. The National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene, which is currently performing “Fiddler on the Roof” at the museum and is listed as a co-sponsor of the conference, was not informed in advance that Ocasio-Cortez... had been invited to speak next Sunday.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;The group’s chairman, Jeffrey Wiesenfeld, said he was informed by an irate board member whose neighbor learned of it from a flyer in the mail. “Absent a public reassessment by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez of her unfair and extremist position [on Israel], she dishonors both the Immigrant Summit and the museum by her scheduled appearance,” Wiesenfeld said in a statement.&quot; [JewishWeek]&nbsp;  HAPPENING TODAY:&nbsp;Primary Threat Targets One of Two Jewish Republicans in the House — by Simone Path&eacute;:&nbsp;&quot;The next test of President Donald Trump’s&nbsp;endorsement&nbsp;power will come&nbsp;in Tennessee, where a little-known freshman — one of two Jewish Republicans in the House —&nbsp; is being outspent more than 2-to-1... Most Tennessee political operatives think Rep. David&nbsp;Kustoff will survive... But they acknowledge that 2018 is an unpredictable year. A&nbsp;loss would make Kustoff&nbsp;the fourth House incumbent and the third Republican to&nbsp;fall in a primary this year.&quot; [RollCall; Independent]  2020 WATCH --&nbsp;Republicans abuzz over Schmidt's divorce from GOP --&nbsp;by Ben Schreckinger,&nbsp;Eliana Johnson and Daniel Lippman:&nbsp;&quot;Steve Schmidt's public break from the GOP and quiet departure from his corporate PR gig earlier this summer are fueling speculation in Republican circles&nbsp;that he’ll advise a presidential bid by his longtime client, former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz...&nbsp;“I don’t have any plans to be on a political campaign, and I would never jump into one too lightly,” Schmidt said in an interview. “Howard Schultz is a hell of a man, a hell of a leader. I'm proud to call him a friend, but there's no campaign, and I don’t have anything to tell you.&quot; ...&nbsp;Few of Schmidt’s peers believe that. The moves, and speculation about Schmidt’s future, have not escaped the notice of Republican operatives.&quot; [Politico]&nbsp;  MUELLER WATCH --&nbsp;Trump Pushes for Interview With Mueller Against Lawyers’ Advice -- by&nbsp;Michael Schmidt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Maggie Haberman:&nbsp;&quot;For the past week, Mr. Trump has expressed frustration about the confluences of investigations that have dogged him. The president told his advisers that the Russia inquiry and a separate federal investigation in Manhattan into his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, have undermined him for too long and need to be brought to an end.&quot; [NYTimes]  Learning From Henry Kissinger — by&nbsp;Jeremi Suri:&nbsp;&quot;The authors of “Kissinger the Negotiator,”&nbsp;James K. Sebenius,&nbsp;R. Nicholas Burns&nbsp;and&nbsp;Robert H. Mnookin, are an all-star trio of experts on negotiation in business, law and diplomacy. They have focused on Kissinger because he is unsurpassed for the range and intensity of his negotiations as national security adviser and secretary of state...&nbsp;Kissinger repeatedly told Soviet, Chinese and other leaders that they should work only with him, encouraging disregard for the rest of the American government. This personalization of his negotiations runs against the authors’ advice about building a strong team. Kissinger was, in fact, a terrible team player. And many of his negotiations, particularly with the Soviet Union and the Middle East states, proved unsustainable after his departure.&quot; [NYTimes]</p> \n<p>** Good Thursday Morning!

        "text":["<p>In his 1992 book “Sleeping on a Wire,” which recounts his conversations with Israeli Arabs, author David Grossman reported on a dream harbored by former Israeli parliamentarian and current spy-in-exile Azmi Bishara. The founder of the Arab nationalist Balad movement wanted to see “a black mass in Tel Aviv.”&nbsp; In his typically arrogant vision, Bishara saw himself “marching 50,000 Arabs in Tel Aviv, just as Martin Luther King marched 50,000 blacks in Washington, D.C.”</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Even if slightly less than 50,000 Arabs showed up, and though the analogy to African-Americans may seem spurious, Bishara’s dream came true on Saturday night. Israel’s controversial nation-state law spurred tens of thousands of Arabs, to borrow Benjamin Netanyahu’s infamous words, to descend in buses and in droves on Rabin Square in Tel Aviv and to march eastwards to Tel Aviv Museum. Many Jews came to support them, but far less than the number that showed up last week at the demonstration by the Druze.</p> \n<p>The comparisons to the Druze protest are, of course, inevitable. Both protests occurred at the same place, same time and for the same reasons. The analogies provide a study in contrasts that highlights the uniqueness of the Israeli Arab predicament.</p> \n<p>Israeli media built up the Druze protest in advance, but more or less ignored the demonstration of the far larger Israeli Arab community until it actually took place. Jewish public opinion embraced the Druze but viewed the Arab protest with suspicion and apprehension. Even those Jews who showed up seemed anxious: Many of them nervously asked for translations of the placards and speeches in Arabic, suspecting extreme messages that they could not endorse.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Tens of thousands gather in Tel Aviv for nation-state law protest led by Israeli Arabs ■&nbsp;Haaretz publisher calls for Israelis to 'join the struggle' at nation-state rally&nbsp;■&nbsp;Basic law or basically a disaster? Israel's nation-state law controversy explained ■&nbsp;&nbsp;'My Israel is dead': One of Israel's biggest donors is furious about the nation-state law&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With few notable exceptions, the Arab demonstration did not draw top former security officials and army officers, did not attract most of the mainstream opposition leaders, did not merit special lighting with the colors of the Palestinian flag on the Tel Aviv Municipality building, which promoted an upcoming summer concert instead.&nbsp; Even the police charged with maintaining order looked different: With the Druze, they were relaxed, smiling, few and far between. For the Arabs, the police came out in force, fortified by Border Police, looking grim and on alert.</p> \n<p>For the Arabs, emotions are more charged.&nbsp; Their wounds are graver and their scars deeper: They’re not the product of this or that law, and won’t heal quickly or easily. The situation of Israeli Arabs has improved immensely since the first 17 years of the state, when many of them lived under strict martial law, but despite their steady climb, they are still the last in line and the mountaintop seems as far away as ever. Unlike the Druze, Israeli Jews don’t view Arabs as “blood brothers.” Despite being caught for decades between an Israeli rock and a Palestinian hard place, notwithstanding the remarkable restraint they’ve shown relative to their predicament, for many, if not most, Israeli Jews, the Arab minority remains a fifth column in waiting.</p> \n<p>The Arabs, as Golda Meir once said of Israeli Black Panther activists, aren’t as “nice” as the Druze. They don’t brandish their service in the Israeli army, which they mostly avoid, they can’t point to their sacrifices for Israel’s security, didn’t wave Israeli flags and certainly don’t identify with Hatikvah’s “Jewish soul” sufficiently to belt out the Israeli national anthem, like the Druze. Equality, they claim, is a basic right, not something one has to pay for.</p> \n<p>There were plenty of posters and placards endorsing Jewish-Arab solidarity and promoting a full and free democracy, but unlike the Druze, the Arabs did not shy away from stark political and sometimes nationalistic slogans such as “Bibi go home” and “Apartheid state.” A group of young girls from the Arab town of Umm al-Fahm waved Palestinian flags but encountered sharp protests from Jewish demonstrators. Netanyahu, naturally, was quick to pounce on the manifestations of Palestinian nationalism to sow more division and to justify the passage of the nation-state law.</p> \n<p>Unlike the Druze, the Israeli Arab opposition to the nation-state law is total. It’s not limited to the fact that the word “equality” is absent from the law or to the demotion of Arabic from “official language” to one with “special status.” Israeli Arabs reject the notion of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. This was the unequivocal assertion of Muhammad Tatour from Nazareth, who came to the demonstration with his wife Samar and brought along their two daughters, Haya, 9, and Joann, 6, “so they could see it.” Samar, however, shyly demurred from her husband’s stance, reflecting divisions in their community as a whole: The protest is about complete equality between Jews and Arabs in our shared land, she said, and that’s it.</p> \n<p>The common denominator between the two demonstrations is the clash they engendered between old established leaderships, which are happy to stick to the old status quo, and a younger guard that seeks a new Israeli deal. Druze leaders were willing to strike their own bargain, to maintain their preferred status in Israeli society and to accept what Arab Member of Knesset Ahmad Tibi described on Saturday as “mukhtars’ bribes,” which is equivalent, more or less, to bribing Native American chiefs with trinkets. The Arab leadership also feels more comfortable with a rigid ideology that views a demonstration for equal rights as implicit normalization and recognition of the Jewish state. According to a report by Jack Khoury in Haaretz, their voters pushed them to organize Saturday night’s protest, just like their Druze counterparts.</p> \n<p>Ayman Odeh, chairman of the Joint List alliance of Arab parties, was careful to phrase the goal of the protest carefully: We are seeking “deep equality,” he told Haaretz, “that recognizes our personal as well as national rights.” Tibi was blunter: Our ideological opposition to Israel as a Jewish state is well known –but that’s not what the demonstration was really about. The nation-state law “points the way to apartheid,” he asserts. It has an element of “Jewish supremacy” and “the creation of two separate classes of citizens, one that enjoys full rights and one that doesn’t – and even in the second group there is an effort to create different categories.”</p> \n<p>Tibi rejects the differentiation made by supporters of the nationality law between collective rights, which Jews enjoy, and individual rights, which are given to all others. Individual rights, including cultural and political, are derived from belonging to a collective, such as the large Arab minority in Israel, Tibi says. In a Friday op-ed in Haaretz, Professor Shlomo Avineri expressed the same position: “One cannot sever individual citizens’ rights,” he wrote, “from their consciousness about their identity, culture, tradition, language, religion and historical memory.”</p> \n<p>The Arabs are protesting efforts to downgrade their status, Tibi says, against a backdrop of 70 years of official discrimination. This is an effort to assail what Tibi terms “indigenous citizens” and to tell them: You are tolerated and you should make do with the new roads and health clinics that we build for you from time to time. Tibi notes, however, that the new law has made it much easier for Israeli Arab politicians to convince foreigners of their plight. “Maybe we should thank Netanyahu,” he adds drily.</p> \n<p>Tibi claims that it was possible to get the law approved without taking Arabic down a peg or two. The ultra-Orthodox politicians had agreed to nix the clause demoting Arabic. Avigdor Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu was also inclined to agree, but the matter was never put to a vote. Tibi says Tourism Minister Yariv Levin told him that the obstacle was Netanyahu, who insisted on the change. Tibi confronted Netanyahu in the Knesset cafeteria. His reply, according to Tibi, was that he supports expanding the study of Arabic in Israeli schools, but “someone” is blocking his efforts. An incredulous Tibi asked the prime minister: “Are you seriously sending me to [Education Minister] Naftali Bennett?”</p> \n<p>Tibi cites another government minister as explaining that Netanyahu fears the creation of an Israeli version of the “Canadian model,” in which both English and French are official languages and all rules, regulations, posters and speeches must be rendered in both. Canada and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have somehow gravitated in recent months to becoming a reviled symbol of enlightened liberalism: Donald Trump torments them, Saudi Arabia bristled at them for standing up for women’s rights activists and now, as it turns out, Canada and Trudeau are Netanyahu’s nightmare as well.</p> \n<p>The third stanza of the French version of the Canadian national anthem “O Canada”, however, contains the suspiciously supremacist line “among the foreign races, our guide is the law.” For Tibi and Israeli Arabs, as well as for many Jewish Israelis, the law is no longer a solution. Rather, it has become the problem. The law sparked an unprecedented mass demonstration of Israeli Arabs in the heart of Tel Aviv, known as the first Hebrew city, but it also exposed the lingering duality of the Palestinian community, as it define itself. Their show of force also demonstrated their isolation. Unlike the Druze, at the end of the evening the Arabs could sense, as always, that they are entirely on their own.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Even Alan Dershowitz, the great defender of the Israeli right, said openly that it’s hard to defend Israel following the enactment of the nation-state law. Even he was shocked to discover what officials in Jerusalem mean when they say “a Jewish state.” Dershowitz’s awakening may herald the end of the golden age of “Jewish legalism.”</p> \n<p>But that day has yet to come, and meanwhile Jewish legalism still reigns not just in Jerusalem but also in Washington, as was evident from the White House’s desire to revise the mandate of UNRWA, the UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees. Not, heaven forbid, for the sake of the Palestinian refugees; quite the contrary, it was to enable them to “reach their full potential,” as a senior Trump administration official said.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;UNRWA under attack: Trump tries to destroy a Palestinian achievement to force a deal</p> \n<p>The heart of Jared Kushner, Trump’s Jewish son-in-law and senior adviser, goes out to the Palestinian refugees. “Our goal can’t be to keep things stable and as they are,” he wrote in an email to Jason Greenblatt, Trump’s (Jewish) Mideast envoy, and his staff. In another email, he wrote that UNRWA “perpetuates a status quo, is corrupt, inefficient and doesn’t help peace.”</p> \n<p>Granted, Kushner was born in the winter of 1981 and hails from New Jersey, but it turns out that he too was promised a dove of peace, in the words of the famous Israeli song “Winter 1973.” He’s breaking the silence about UNRWA’s crimes. For the exact same reason, he urged Amman to abolish the refugee status of 2 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan. He’s the Martin Luther King of the Palestinians in that country.</p> \n<p>That was sarcasm, of course. This decision has nothing to do with the Palestinians’ welfare. Kushner and his staff are merely duplicating the logic that led the administration to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. It’s a blatant attempt to clear the negotiating table of the last remnants of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict’s core issues. First Jerusalem, and now the right of return.</p> \n<p>Instead of solving the problem of the Palestinian refugees, they’re abolishing the problem posed by “the refugees.” If there are no Palestinian refugees, why do they need a right of return?</p> \n<p>Amira Hass explained with chilling clarity in Haaretz that UNRWA’s continued existence is a Palestinian political achievement indicating recognition of the refugees’ right to return to pre-1967 Israel. But as Hass herself notes, “the Clinton and Obama administrations can’t be suspected of supporting UNRWA to promote the Palestinian refugees’ return to their homeland.”</p> \n<p>More than anything, this recognition of their right is for the purpose of negotiations, for use as a bargaining chip. But Kushner seeks to humiliate the Palestinians – or as the right likes to say, to destroy their hope – in order to seal a deal cheaply.</p> \n<p>Still, something here doesn’t add up. After all, the Palestinian Authority effectively conceded the right of return – even if it hasn’t said so publicly – and sufficed with Israel’s acceptance of a symbolic number (10,000, according to the “Palestine Papers” published by Al Jazeera). So what are they cooking up here?</p> \n<p>This maneuver by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, via Kushner, can’t be understood except as an attempt to prevent millions of Palestinians from moving to the future Palestinian political entity. Or in other words, to prevent them from realizing their right of return even to the Palestinian state.</p> \n<p>Dershowitz still hasn’t fully understood Jewish exceptionalism as taught in the school of Netanyahu. The Zionist longing to be “like all the other nations” is for universalist, cosmopolitan, rootless leftists; what’s permissible to Jews is forbidden to others. The “Palestinian state” will at most be “half a state,” and it will be limited not just militarily, but also in terms of immigration. Who is a Jew? Israel will decide. And who is a Palestinian? Israel will decide that too.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Caesarea port is undergoing a surge of development the likes of which haven’t been seen since King Herod’s days. Those responsible are aiming high: They see the place as “the capital city of the ancient world,” comparing it to leading tourist attractions like Pompeii, Venice and Athens.</p> \n<p>The person in charge, Baroness Ariane de Rothschild (the banker wife of Baron Benjamin de Rothschild), has been taking a tremendous personal interest in the site. She visits it several times a year, is involved in the details of the restoration and development and is investing huge sums to realize her vision — to make Caesarea one of the world’s leading sites for historical tourism.</p> \n<p>About a month ago the baroness dedicated the new promenade along the walls of the ancient city. Restoration of the large arches opposite the port is presently being completed. Everyone involved in the work in Caesarea declares that “we’re doing it in a big way.” No more limited development and small excavations; no more slow restoration of an archaeological-historical monument.</p> \n<p>In Caesarea they speak mainly of a “tourism experience,” an expression that usually arouses horror among archaeologists. But this time it seems even professionals are toeing the line, especially if it’s being done at the baron’s expense. Three organizations are working in a cooperative venture: the Edmond de Rothschild Foundation (via its executive arm, the Caesarea Development Corporation), the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.</p> \n<p>Ads declare that these groups “have joined together for accelerated development that is unprecedented in scope, to expose and restore ancient Caesarea and to make it accessible, as ‘the capital of the ancient world’ and as a central attraction in the fabric of tourism in Israel.” Then comes an explanation that “the excavations are being conducted along with meticulous preservation of the archaeological, historical and natural values of the space, with access geared to a huge number of visitors from Israel and abroad.”</p> \n<p>At the moment it is somewhat difficult to recall the poem by Hannah Szenes about Caesarea, which speaks of “the sand and the sea, the rustle of the water.” Nowhere in the world are there such remains. Caesarea was built in the fourth century B.C.E. as a small Phoenician marina. In 31 B.C.E., after his victory in the Battle of Actium, the Roman emperor Augustus Caesar gifted it to Herod, who named the city after his benefactor.</p> \n<p>Herod built the city between 10 and 22 B.C.E., with a large port, bathhouses and temples. Vestiges of Herod’s palace were identified on a reef that juts into the sea. After Herod’s death Caesarea became the seat of the Roman procurators of Judea and the capital of the Province of Judea. The population was mixed — Jews and foreigners.</p> \n<p>Events that took place near the synagogue in Caesarea in 66 C.E. led to the beginning of the Great Revolt, when the Jews of Judea revolted against their Roman rulers. During the Byzantine period Caesarea was an important Christian center, and in the seventh century it was conquered by Muslims. Between the 10th and 12th centuries it was alternately ruled by the Crusaders and by Saladdin. In the 13th century it was conquered by the Mamluks, and the city was destroyed.</p> \n<p>Muslims from Bosnia, fleeing from the Austrian occupation of their country in 1878, settled in Caesarea and restored it; In 1945 it was home to 930 Muslims and 30 Christians. In February 1948, shortly before Israel’s War of Independence, a unit of the Palmach Jewish commandos captured the city, and its residents fled or were expelled. Most of the village homes were destroyed, and those that remained now serve as restaurants on the coastline.</p> \n<p>Hail, Caesarea!</p> \n<p>Modern-day Caesarea is not at all an ordinary place. It was built and operates on private land belonging to the Rothschild Foundation. Prior to the establishment of the state, Baron Edmond de Rothschild purchased large plots of land, and in 1948 he granted 500,000 dunams (123,500 acres) to the State of Israel, keeping 30,000 dunams for himself — on the coast. In 1962 the Rothschild-Caesarea Foundation was established, owned jointly and equally by the state and the baron’s family. At the time the foundation was granted a full exemption from taxes on its profits, an arrangement that is still in force.</p> \n<p>Just recently a so-called “historic” agreement was achieved between the Finance Ministry and the foundation, which extends the tax exemption until 2032. The foundation promised to transfer 700 million shekels for higher education in Israel. The port, one of the most important ancient sites in Israel and a popular national park, is the only park run by the Caesarea Development Corporation and is committed to the business-financial and tourism aspects of the project.</p> \n<p>There are very few parallels in Israel to this complex formula, one of them being the City of David in Jerusalem, run by the private settler foundation Elad. Baroness de Rothschild, chair of the Caesarea foundation, has budgeted a huge sum for the development of the ancient port — 150 million shekels ($40.6 million). The three groups (the foundation, the Antiquities Authority and the Nature and Parks Authority) have agreed on the development plan among themselves.</p> \n<p>Caesarea already ranks alongside Masada as the most popular tourism site in Israel that charges an entry; both get around 700,000 visitors a year. A similar number visit Masada. The horizon envisioned by the directors of the site is far broader. Vered Sarig, director of the Caesarea Port, is convinced that there will be a million visitors to the site this year, 75 percent of them from abroad. “Our goal is to create concentrations of content on the highest international level. Next year, when we complete the present stage of work, I have no doubt that we will be able to compete with the Acropolis in Athens.”</p> \n<p>Sarig explains the process: The Antiquities Authority has done mapping in the 500-dunam historical space. There are 26 focal points that are worthy of restoration. Seven of them are phenomenal — such as the aqueduct, the Herodian wall, the arches in the port and the towers along the Crusader wall. The current major project is development of the huge arches, which were used as storehouses 2,000 years ago; 87 million shekels (about $23.5 million) are now being invested in this project. It’s hard to find a precedent in Israel for a similar project on an ancient site.</p> \n<p>“Nowhere in the world are there Herodian remains like the port,” says Sarig. The only possible comparison she says, is Venice. The large stone arches stand next to what once served as an internal port, and became covered with soil and grass. The external port is the one familiar to us. The receding of the sea makes it difficult for visitors to understand the structure of the ancient port, and the exhibit to be built within the arches is meant to solve that and clarify the appearance of the ancient structure.</p> \n<p>As part of the restoration of the arches, impressive remains of the Temple of Rome and Augustus were exposed. This is part of the temple platform built by Herod in the first century CE, which overlooked the entire city. Throughout history, important religious structures were built on this platform. The present project includes the restoration and development of some of the port’s arches and the steps of the temple.</p> \n<p>In addition to restoration of the arches, the wall promenade, a vestige from the Crusader period, is now being developed. On the wall, which is eight meters tall and three meters wide, there were 16 towers. At the northern end of the site the ancient synagogue from the period of the Great Revolt, which is mentioned in the Talmud and the writings of Josephus Flavius, is now being excavated.</p> \n<p>At the marina itself an underwater archaeological park is being developed, touted as “the first of its kind in Israel and in the world.” The park reveals the construction technique of the ancient port built by Herod. About two years ago, divers found a treasure hoard containing 2,085 gold coins from the Fatimid period (10th to 11th century).</p> \n<p>A tourism experience</p> \n<p>In addition to all this, there are 22 places of business at the port — restaurants, bars, galleries, entertainment venues and shops. The combination of commerce and archaeology is not common in Israel, certainly not in such proximity. At Masada, for example, commerce is concentrated on the lower part of the mountain, while the archaeological site above operates without “appendices” or diversions.</p> \n<p>The concept in Caesarea is different. Some people think it’s refreshing, while some archaeologists consider it a danger to such an important site. Others, more conservative, see it as a cheapening of an important site. And several archaeologists who asked not to be named believe that the massive restoration at the site deviates from any reasonable standard.</p> \n<p>Architect Ze’ev Margalit, Manager of Preservation and Development in the Nature and Parks Authority, believes that the present activity is wise and correct. “Everything in archaeology is examined individually. If the find is sensitive and it original condition is important — don’t touch it. In Caesarea the situation is different. We’ve created a balance here between the original find and the restoration. True, there’s massive and even unusual intervention here, but there’s also careful differentiation between the original and the modern, and we’re completely faithful to the research information. We haven’t invented anything here.”</p> \n<p>Margalit explains that today, there is a different attitude to archaeological sites everywhere in the world. Reviving the site is essential, and modern additions such as a caf&eacute;, a gallery and street performances make proper use of an archaeological site.</p> \n<p>“A tourism experience doesn’t have to be boring. Let’s let go a bit. It won’t detract at all from the value of the site. If only we could do that at other sites. That’s the future.”</p> \n<p>Too much investment?</p> \n<p>Another important question is whether there is any justification for concentrating so much effort and investment on one site, when there are many other sites that are begging for preservation and tourism development.</p> \n<p>Yisrael Hasson, director general of the Antiquities Authority, feels that the concentration on one site is fully justified. He says that for many years there was a covert and overt battle between the IAA and the Caesarea Development Corporation. When he assumed his position about four years ago, Hasson worked to promote accelerated development of the site.</p> \n<p>“The process of erosion caused Caesarea to disintegrate before our eyes,” he says. “We reached the conclusion that we have to conduct accelerated rehabilitation and development of the site. What we see today in Caesarea is only 6 percent of its treasures. Beneath the ground lies 94 percent of the city, with which we’re unfamiliar. There’s a huge theater there with 25,000 seats, which dwarfs the familiar amphitheater with its 3,000 seats. The entire plan that was approved is being funded by the Caesarea Development Corporation, and they’re keeping their word.”</p> \n<p>Wouldn’t it be a good idea to spread the effort to additional archaeological sites?</p> \n<p>“I wish we had an overall plan for developing archaeological tourism; the country needs such a plan. In its absence we’re happy to cooperate with an organization like the Caesarea Development Corporation, and we see that when the authorities operate transparently and with joint planning — the result is good. If you give me funding and a national plan, we’d be happy to work at many other sites. The limitation of course is the funding. If only the State of Israel would decide what’s important to it — the way they decided on developing sites in Jerusalem — that’s what we’ll do.</p> \n<p>The local Pompeii</p> \n<p>Michael Karsenti, CEO of the Caesarea Development Corporation, told Haaretz that the vision of Baroness Rothschild is to turn Caesarea into a local Pompeii. The site in southern Italy, considered one of the most popular ancient sites in the world, attracts over 3 million visitors annually, about the total number of visitors to Israel in a year.</p> \n<p>“Our goal is to reveal the real size of ancient Caesarea,” says Karsenti. “Today we’re familiar with only a small part of the original city. The baroness understood the tremendous potential of the place and is therefore investing large sums of money in its development.</p> \n<p>“We believe that this will bring growth and additional tourists. That would justify the construction of additional hotels in Caesarea. We’re involved here in one of the biggest archaeological projects ever conducted in Israel, and our goals, as decided by the baroness, involve both values and business. We’re only at the start, and in the end we’ll become a leading international tourist site.</p> \n<p>“Our assumption is that the investments will bring more visitors to our area and that we’ll be able to measure the benefit in simple financial terms — did the turnover in the restaurants increase, did we sell more entrance tickets?” The site is a national park and the cost of a ticket is 39 shekels — 35 go to the Nature and Parks Authority and 4 to the Caesarea corporation.</p> \n<p>Karsenti says the Caesarea corporation does not intend to profit from the project; it will be satisfied with the anticipated benefits from the national park, which will help enhance Caesarea’s and Israel’s international reputation. The number of tourists to Caesarea rose 27 percent last year, he says (about the same as the increase in the number of tourists to Israel). These are direct revenues, he explains. “We’re a place that is unique in the entire world. There’s a leading archaeological site here, and next to it a wonderful beach and a golf course. Countries that have turned themselves into a quality golf destination saw an increase in gross domestic product. That will happen here too.”</p> \n<p>Karsenti is also well aware that there are many residents of Caesarea who aren’t happy about the massive development of the antiquities site. He describes the community as having an “exclusive communal” image, and the entry of millions of tourists, as in Pompeii or Athens, doesn’t necessarily accord with the exclusivity and the quiet that Caesarea residents are looking for.</p> \n<p>“It’s true,” admits Karsenti, “some residents of Caesarea are convinced that we shouldn’t build anything here, but my promise to them is that everything is being done with transparency and a correct planning process. They understand that the development of tourism and of our land is essential. We won’t do anything that will harm their interests; we’ll find the balance between the exclusive lifestyle and a mass tourism site. We’ll preserve the character of the place along with developing tourism. One of the ways of doing so is to build separate access roads to the community and the site.”</p> \n<p>Karsenti’s vision is optimistic. He says that every third tourist who visits Israel comes to Caesarea, while 70 percent visit Jerusalem. He estimates that Israel will have 10 million tourists in 2040, with 4 million coming to Caesarea. Four million visitors a year are not a recipe for peace and quiet.</p> \n<p>The baroness is aware of that, says Karsenti, and of the risks involved in developing mass tourism. She has a home in one of the old neighborhoods of Caesarea, where she stays during her frequent visits to Israel. The objective, explains Karsenti, is clear — to maintain a balance between the tourism asset and living in a quiet place by the sea.</p> \n<p>In order to see the full picture, one should go north of Caesarea. After passing the synagogue you reach the Aqueduct Beach. If you continue for about another 5 kilometers to the north you arrive at the small fishing village of Jisr a-Zarqa and the bridge over Nahal Taninim. The entire area is already a national park. All that needs to be done is to develop it as a single complete and continuous complex, where you can walk from the richest community in Israel to the poorest one, with one amazingly beautiful aqueduct built by Herod connecting the two.</p> \n<p>As Hannah Szenes wrote in “A Walk to Caesarea”: “Eli Eli (‘my God, my God’), may it never end.”</p>",

She went to the aliya department at the Israeli embassy in Moscow nine times, and each time was asked to bring new documents.</p> \n<p>One of the papers she was asked for was an additional document for a group of documents she had already submitted attesting to a job she had held many years ago.</p> \n<p>In response to the administrative petition Gervits filed with the Jerusalem District Court on behalf of Rynska and two other Russian citizens seeking to immigrate to Israel, Nativ told the court that Rynska “was born just three months after her parents’ marriage, and in such a case, proof of paternity is needed in order to make a decision.”</p> \n<p>Gervits’ request that Nativ present a written guideline for addressing the matter has yet to be met in court.</p> \n<p>Nativ's head Neta Briskin-Peleg declined a request from Haaretz to see Nativ's guidelines, saying only that the organization operates in accordance with the regulations of the Population and Immigration Authority, which apply to&nbsp;all those eligible under for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return, not only those from the former Soviet Union.</p> \n<p>Haaretz asked the Population Authority to present its guidelines, or to clarify whether there is actually a guideline regarding the right of the child of a Jewish parent to make aliya cannot be recognized if the child was born “too close” to the parents’ wedding date.</p> \n<p>The Authority said that just because Nativ adheres to its procedures “doesn’t mean that Nativ officials don’t get to exercise significant independence of judgment.”</p> \n<p>A businessman from Moscow, who wished to remain unidentified, says he submitted an aliya application in 2014. Only recently after a freedom of information request filed by Gervits, did he and his wife receive identical letters from Nativ, which said: “Your application is rejected because you were born to a Jewish mother and you are of a different religion,” with no further explanation.</p> \n<p>But&nbsp;the man says he has never converted to another faith. He calls himself a “good Jew” who has been donating for years to the Chabad synagogue in Moscow, attends synagogue on Jewish holidays and fasts on Yom Kippur. His wife, however, has gone to church from an early age.</p> \n<p>“She wrote about this honestly (in the questionnaire she filled out at the embassy),” the man says. “It’s her right,” he insists.</p> \n<p>Although his religion has nothing to do with that of his wife, Nativ somehow decided that he had converted to another faith. The organization also refuses to reveal the questionnaire he filled out on which he declared himself a Jew under the section of nationality and under the section on religion.</p> \n<p>You can’t argue with a sphinx</p> \n<p>The delays and failure to provide written explanations are in violation of a law that requires civil servants to respond in writing within 45 days and include an explanation for any decision.</p> \n<p>Gervits says of Nativ’s failure to provide explanations that &quot;they’re violating the law and meanwhile obtaining a tactical advantage in court.”</p> \n<p>Gervits has filed petitions for years for rejected aliya applicants, but now avoids approaching the High Court without knowing the rationale behind such obscure reasons provided as “belated recognition of paternity,” “criminal past” or “change of religion.”</p> \n<p>“You can’t argue with a sphinx,” says Gervits, quoting the late justice Moshe Landau.</p> \n<p>Gervits says it is tough to contest a decision when the only reason provided for a rejection is “due to professional guidelines of the Population and Immigration Authority.”</p> \n<p>“If you have such rules, then let’s hear what they are,” he says. “If there aren’t any, then just say that you decide to do whatever you want with each case. The information is not yours, it belongs to the public.”</p> \n<p>Elam says another difficulty in challenging Nativ's decisions is that its representatives avoid giving any answer to rejected applicants, and recommend that the applicant come to Israel and try on their own to have their status recognized by the Population Authority, which amounts to recommending to those rejected for immigration to come to Israel as tourists and wage a bureaucratic or legal battle once in the country, until their tourist visa expires.</p> \n<p>Elam sees this as peculiar advice coming from an organization whose main purpose is to determine whether or not a person is eligible for aliyah.</p> \n<p>“Nativ is supposed to be executing the policy of the Population Authority,” says Elam. “They are in close contact with the authority. If you don’t know what to do in a certain case, then talk about it and make a decision. Why send someone to Israel?” &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nativ head Briskin-Peleg says, “there are complicated cases in which the Nativ consul cannot make a clear-cut decision on eligibility.</p> \n<p>In such cases, the Population and Immigration Authority is the final arbiter. There are cases that are transferred to the Population Authority for a decision and in which there is no need for the family to come to Israel, and there are cases where the applicant’s physical presence in Israel is required.</p> \n<p>But, at least in the year that I have served as head of the organization, the number of these cases has been close to zero. I am certainly against bringing the family here.”</p> \n<p>&quot;Genetic testing are not sufficient&quot;</p> \n<p>Nadezhda Popova, a 65-year-old math teacher from Karpinsk, whose father was Jewish, is another case in point. She and her husband and son contacted Nativ in 2014 to apply for an aliya visa.</p> \n<p>The organization decided she had insufficient proof of her father's paternity, and advised Nadezhda to have tissue testing done with an aunt who lives in Israel and is registered as Jewish by the Population Authority.</p> \n<p>After an initial test was inconclusive, a second test was done that indicated the two had a greater than a 99-percent chance of being related. The family court in Haifa provided an expert opinion that both Nadezhda’s relatives living in Israel are her relatives.</p> \n<p>The Popovas presented the findings to Nativ in 2016 but the organization refused them a visa, and advised them to come to Israel and resolve the issue with the Population Authority.</p> \n<p>The authority’s offices in Haifa referred them back to Nativ. Late last year the Population Authority finally decided to reject the application. Elam says the decision was never delivered to the family and Nativ refused his request to relay it to them.</p> \n<p>“This hurts me so much. I am the daughter of a Jew, I have the right to make aliyah,” says Nadezhda. “My whole life I was humiliated for being a Jew, And now Israel won’t accept me either.” The Population Authority says that “the court ruling says the results of the genetic testing are not sufficient to permit the applicant’s entry into Israel” and that “the applicant must present documents proving her eligibility in accordance with the Law of Return.”</p> \n<p>Briskin-Peleg declined to comment on the cases presented in this article, citing privacy concerns. In response to other questions, she said, “Nativ’s source of authority is the Population and Immigration Authority and reviews of eligibility are done in accordance with the procedures of the Interior Ministry and based upon the Law of Return.</p> \n<p>An eligibility review is made on the basis of original documents that have been determined to be sufficient for proving eligibility, and when applicants do not have documents that unequivocally prove their eligibility, eligibility cannot be determined.</p> \n<p>&quot;Therefore in certain cases, additional documents are needed to complete the picture. As of now, anyone who comes to the consulate and is not found to be eligible for aliya receives a written answer with an explanation of the reasons for the rejection.</p> \n<p>&quot;When additional documents are needed, the applicant does not receive a negative answer but tries to gather more documents to prove his eligibility, and of course may go back to the consulate and request to submit more documents. Unfortunately, not all applicants are able to come up with documents to prove their eligibility.”</p> \n<p>The Population Authority says “Nativ is authorized to determine eligibility for aliya on the basis of the Law of Return” and that all of the procedures may be found on the authority’s website. But there is nothing on the website that lists the rules for determining aliya eligibility.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In a preplanned coincidence, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was absent from a vote of the Likud Central Committee on December 31. “On the jubilee anniversary of the liberation of the territories of Judea and Samaria [the West Bank], including our eternal capital Jerusalem, the Likud Central Committee calls on the [party’s] elected representatives to act to enable free construction and to apply the laws and sovereignty of the State of Israel to all the areas of liberated settlement in Judea and Samaria.” That’s the text of the resolution that the central committee passed unanimously.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is a calculating man. He won’t go down in the history of the Jewish people – that is, in the minutes of Likud Central Committee’s meetings – as an enemy of hityashvut – the word for settlement in general, as opposed to hitnahalut, the word for settlement in the West Bank. He prefers to block proposals rather than oppose them.</p> \n<p>And sure enough, two months after the central committee’s resolution, Netanyahu blocked a Knesset bill calling for Israeli sovereignty to be applied to the settlements. That bill was sponsored by MKs Yoav Kish (Likud) and Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi), the heads of the Knesset Caucus for Eretz Israel. Netanyahu has prevented the advancement of a series of bills aimed at implementing Israeli sovereignty in the territories, among them one that would annex the city of Ma’aleh Adumim, southeast of Jerusalem, and one that would make Jerusalem responsible for the settlements around it.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Once and for all: How many settlers need to be evacuated from the West Bank to make way for a Palestinian state &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>The only bills on Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank that the government decided to support are a law putting Ariel University under the aegis of the Council for Higher Education and a law placing chicken farmers in West Bank settlements under the supervision of the Egg and Poultry Board. Dramatic laws, certainly, but not what the advocates of annexation covet.</p> \n<p>Israel has yet to take a step toward fulfilling the goal for which Yehudit Katzover and Nadia Matar established the group Women in Green. What is that goal? In a word: sovereignty.</p> \n<p>“Settlement is reversible, sovereignty isn’t,” they say. They want sovereignty so they can stop fighting for every tree they plant and the Palestinians uproot – or vice versa – but mainly to prevent an “expulsion” &agrave; la the 2005 Gaza pullout. Sovereignty, in their perception, will make it clear to every Palestinian boy and girl born into the occupation that “the Land of Israel is ours,” meaning not theirs.</p> \n<p>The problem, Matar says, is that the Palestinians harbor the hope that one day, “they will succeed in taking Judea and Samaria and establishing a state for themselves, and afterward Tel Aviv and all the rest.” She adds: “Israel is cultivating that hope. For 51 years, a question mark has hung over this territory because Israel hasn’t decided what it wants. But if Israel doesn’t say it’s hers, others say ‘We will take it’ or that we’re occupiers.</p> \n<p>“That’s how the world understands it. We have to put a stop to it. The application of sovereignty will make the picture clear to Palestinian young people: ‘My friend, you’re invited to live here in the State of Israel, but you won’t have a state here. There will be a bit of a crisis at first, but when all this becomes clear to them, it’ll be good.’”</p> \n<p>Katzover and Matar aren’t alone. The “sovereignty dialogue” is gaining pace in Israel, so now is the time to examine what the proponents of sovereignty mean when they talk about it. Katzover and Matar told me who they think the major players are, so I set out to discover what they’re anguishing over and which issues bother them – legally, economically and morally – and what they argue about among themselves.</p> \n<p>Naftali Bennett: ‘Autonomy on steroids’</p> \n<p>The education minister and the leader of the Habayit Hayehudi party, Naftali Bennett, suggests annexing Area C of the West Bank (which was divided into three areas of rule in the 1995 Oslo II Accord) to Israel, granting citizenship to the Palestinians living there and introducing autonomous Palestinian rule in Areas A and B. But Areas A and B are in fact made up of numerous enclaves within Area C. If we see the West Bank as a sunny-side up egg made of 165 individual yolks (the Palestinian enclaves), what Bennett suggests is to remove all the white that surrounds the yolks, and just making that part of Israel.</p> \n<p>Do you have ambitions beyond Area C?</p> \n<p>“No. Not one Jew lives in Areas A and B, and there isn’t a single Jewish settlement there. They have autonomy there, they administer most of the components of life for themselves. Overall, anyone who goes through there won’t see any patrols by the Israeli army. There were 50,000 to 70,000 Arabs in Area C a few years ago, compared with 400,000 Jews. I suppose that there are now about 80,000 to 90,000 Arabs and half a million Jews. The demographics aren’t working against us. The birthrate of the Jewish mother has overtaken the birthrate of the Arab mother.”</p> \n<p>I asked Bennett to address the fact that Areas A and B are inside Area C. “Of course,” he replied, “the picture is mottled.” He also commented on the view that the Palestinian population in Area C is in reality far larger than his plan estimates – some say 300,000, far above the 50,000 who would be granted citizenship under Bennett’s original plan.</p> \n<p>“We need to freeze the situation,” he said. “I can decide to execute a freeze according to either 1993 or 2013. At some point, there has to be a situation freeze, otherwise everyone will want to become an Israeli citizen and will move to Area C.”</p> \n<p>In other words, Israel can decide on a “situation freeze” according to the year that suits it, in order to set the quota of Palestinians on whom it will confer citizenship.</p> \n<p>The plan itself – Bennett’s sovereignty plan – calls for the application of Israeli law and administrative jurisdiction to Area C; in other words, to apply sovereignty and annex the areas. “It requires a government decision, not a law,” he said. Following that, he would offer the Palestinian residents of Area C three options: citizenship (Bennett doesn’t rule out that this will be accompanied by a mandatory declaration of loyalty to the state), residency (which many will choose, he believes, as is the case in East Jerusalem), or continued residency/citizenship in a Palestinian “or other” authority.</p> \n<p>What country would the Palestinians in areas A and B be citizens of?</p> \n<p>“There is already autonomy. There is no sovereign contiguity but there is transportation contiguity. There needn’t be a connection between sovereignty and movement. It’s no problem for a Palestinian to get into a car and drive from Jenin to Ramallah. Along the way he passes through parts of Area C, but there are no fences and don’t have to be.”</p> \n<p>No checkpoints between A, B and C?</p> \n<p>“Right. Nothing. It’s all open. The vision of freedom of movement.”</p> \n<p>How would that autonomy be administered?</p> \n<p>“Self-rule, elections, like they have today, water, sewage, electricity, infrastructure and so on. Two significant things won’t happen. Overall security responsibility remains with us. Second, they don’t have the right to stream in millions of descendants of the Palestinian refugees who now live in Lebanon or Syria in refugee camps. So it will be less than a state. Autonomy on steroids, something beefed up.”</p> \n<p>You wouldn’t knock down the separation fence?</p> \n<p>“That’s something that has to be examined with time, in two parameters: security and whether it’s acceptable to the Israeli public. It will take time. And then there’s a “Marshall Plan” for Judea and Samaria. If I were prime minister, I’d do it immediately.</p> \n<p>“1. Freedom of movement between Binyamin and Gush Etzion – between Ramallah and Bethlehem. I begin by building that road.</p> \n<p>“2. I triple the number of lanes for security checks, so that an Arab who lives in Nablus and works in Rosh Ha’ayin won’t wait three hours at the checkpoints, but five minutes. There will be dignity and respect for every person at the checkpoints.</p> \n<p>“3. An open tourist region. In terms of tourism, the Land of Israel is one unit, so a ship will dock at Haifa and from there the tourists will travel to Nazareth, Nablus, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron, and a stamp of transit for an integrated tourist region can be organized for them to get the ball rolling.</p> \n<p>“4. A land port in Jenin. A dock, or more than one, can be allocated to the Palestinians in Haifa. Apart from the security responsibility, the customs responsibility will be theirs. We won’t levy anything, there will be a passage from Haifa to Jenin, and the offloading will take place in Jenin.</p> \n<p>“5. I establish joint industrial zones for Arabs and Jews, as exist now, but 10 times as many in Judea and Samaria. The Palestinian people – all told – are of a high level. Israel faces serious personnel problems in countless areas, from agriculture and construction to high-tech, and we can create a very good opportunity. Palestinians working in Israeli businesses is a very significant layer of the realistic Palestinian economy.</p> \n<p>“6. Upgrading of infrastructure in Judea and Samaria. It’s unbelievable that the chief road artery in Judea and Samaria looks like a neglected alley. How does it serve the Israeli interest if settlers or Palestinians wait in line for an hour to enter at Hizma [near Jerusalem]? It’s intolerable for everyone.</p> \n<p>“7. We’re proud of our agricultural technology. We talk about the Israeli [dairy] cow, which yields three or four times as much [as their peers globally], and we go to India or China to apply it. Why not in the Palestinian Authority, our neighbors?</p> \n<p>“Those steps give a real spurt to the quality of life in Judea and Samaria – a life of dignity, [though] not full realization of the desire for a state. It’s less than a state, but it seems to me to be as good as it gets.</p> \n<p>“I don’t rule out functional autonomy within Jordan. If Jordan decides on it and the Palestinians want to be citizens of Jordan who live in the Palestinian Authority or in Area C, that’s also possible. If they want to live in Moti Kedar’s cantons [see below], that’s also possible. They will decide. But in the end, there is one status in the territories of Israel, namely the citizens of Israel.There won’t be one territory with two statuses. Accordingly, there is no apartheid here.”</p> \n<p>If you’ve forgone the vision of Greater Israel and of ‘the promise,’ why not go one step further and forgo Area C as well?</p> \n<p>“Theoretically, if there were no demographic problem and if there were no Palestinians, the whole of the western Land of Israel [the land west of the Jordan River] would be ours. But there is a problem, and I want to strengthen the Israeli, not the Palestinian, interest.”</p> \n<p>Caroline Glick: The full method</p> \n<p>Columnist Caroline Glick and the late Knesset Member Uri Elitzur are considered the pioneers of the idea of applying Israeli sovereignty to all the territories and granting Israeli citizenship to the Palestinians. In her 2014 book “The Israeli Solution: A One-State Plan for Peace in the Middle East,” Glick presents her blueprint. She would apply Israeli law to the West Bank, which would be integrated into Israel along with its Palestinian inhabitants. The plan doesn’t encompass the Gaza Strip because, she argues, by withdrawing from it in 2005 Israel voided its claim to territory or sovereignty there. “Gaza is an independent state,” she said.</p> \n<p>According to Glick, in an email to Haaretz, “The Palestinians in Judea and Samaria are already dictating no small amount of Israeli policy, through their free access to the state authorities, including the Supreme Court, and through the security threat they constitute to the state. In my view, it’s an optical illusion to treat the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria as an entity from which it’s possible to disengage. Accordingly, in my opinion, it’s preferable for the Palestinians to receive Israeli residency.</p> \n<p>“As for the question of citizenship for the Palestinian inhabitants of Judea and Samaria, there are two mistaken assumptions about this issue. First, there’s an assumption that all the Palestinians would be interested in acquiring citizenship, whereas past experience in Jerusalem and in the Golan Heights shows that there is no reason to assume this. Second, there’s an assumption that as a whole the Palestinians will meet the criteria for citizenship. Again, there’s no reason to assume this.</p> \n<p>“At the same time, the assumption that every change in the historical status of Judea and Samaria has to be implemented over time and gradually is correct. Therefore, as I see it, the Likud Central Committee and Habayit Hayehudi are right to say that Israel should apply Israeli law to Area C as a first step. The Palestinian inhabitants of the region will receive the status of permanent residents, like the status conferred on the residents of East Jerusalem and of the Golan Heights in 1967 and 1981.</p> \n<p>“In the wake of that move, and in accordance with developments on the ground over a period of at least a decade, it would be possible to extend the area in Judea and Samaria to which Israeli law will be applied and to treat the inhabitants of those areas as permanent residents in the first stage. As is the case in Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, every application for citizenship would be examined separately.”</p> \n<p>Martin Sherman: The transfer method</p> \n<p>Martin Sherman, the founder and CEO of the Israel Institute for Strategic Studies, is probably the most extreme of all the annexationists. He advocates applying Israeli sovereignty to the whole West Bank and is also the only one who wants to annex the Gaza Strip as well. He says there is no other way to ensure Israel’s security militarily.</p> \n<p>“Bennett’s plan sounds logical, until you look at the map, and then you see corridors everywhere, so sovereignty is meaningless,” he says. “Even if there is only a 30 percent Palestinian minority, it’s still a recipe for Lebanonization. They’re a very hostile group.”</p> \n<p>According to Sherman, Israel needs to act vigorously to reduce the Arab presence. How? War is the most effective way, Sherman says (because &quot;'kinetic means' are more acceptable,&quot; as he told the Ribonut correspondent). But if there’s no war - and Sherman claims he's not calling to start one - “a series of incentives is needed so they’ll leave. Positive incentives – money for families that leave and negative ones: to declare them an enemy and start to gradually reduce the provision of services and goods to the Palestinians” in both the West Bank and Gaza.</p> \n<p>In Sherman’s view, Israel has no moral, legal or practical obligation to maintain the socioeconomic life of an enemy that’s committed to its extinction. On the contrary, its moral obligation is to bring about its collapse in order to prevent attempts to liquidate Israel and kill its citizens. Together with declaring the Palestinians a collective enemy, Israel should revoke its recognition of the PA and work to dismantle it.</p> \n<p>“Anyone who wants to leave should take an emigration package and look for somewhere else to live,” Sherman says. “Let them go to Indonesia, or India, for example. Transfer isn’t a dirty word.”</p> \n<p>Mordechai Kedar: The emirates method</p> \n<p>To understand the emirates plan of Middle East affairs expert Mordechai Kedar (of Bar-Ilan University and the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies), you must hear his take on the entire region. “In the Middle East, the strongest group is the family, and then the extended family, the clan, the tribe. Most of the modern states in the Middle East – Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Jordan, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco – were created by colonialists, and the state was forced on the groups that lived in its territory,” he says.</p> \n<p>“The idea of the modern state wasn’t welcomed by the majority of citizens, and it didn’t supplant traditional loyalties. So there’s no ‘Syrian people,’ no ‘Iraqi people’ and no ‘Libyan people.’</p> \n<p>“The Palestinian story is much the same. We tried to build a people on the basis of the idea of a Palestinian state, to remove the primary reference group and create a national consciousness that wouldn’t be challenged by competing forms of consciousness: the tribe, the ethnic, religious or communal group. That attempt isn’t working. Accordingly, we need to act according to the successful model of the Gulf emirates, which are based on local families.”</p> \n<p>Here, then, are the stages of Kedar’s plan, in his words:</p> \n<p>“1. Recognizing the Gaza Strip as a state, because it possesses all of a state’s attributes. Hamas has ruled in Gaza for 11 years, and its government takes the right attitude toward the local families.</p> \n<p>“2. Application of Israeli sovereignty to all of Judea and Samaria.</p> \n<p>“3. Dismantlement of the Palestinian Authority.</p> \n<p>“4. Establishment of seven emirates – city-states – in the West Bank: in Arab Hebron and in Jericho, Ramallah, Qalqilyah, Tul Karm, Nablus and Jenin. They would be independent emirates based on the local families. The emirates’ inhabitants will be their citizens – citizens of the Emirate of Hebron, citizens of the Emirate of Nablus and so on.</p> \n<p>“5. The rural areas will remain under Israeli sovereignty.</p> \n<p>“6. Israel should offer Israeli citizenship to the residents of the rural villages, who make up about 10 percent of the Arab population in the West Bank and don’t pose a demographic threat. They will live in Israel like the Arabs of the Galilee and the Little Triangle Area in central Israel, which is roughly bounded by the Arab towns of Baka al-Garbiyeh, Taibeh and Tira.</p> \n<p>“7. Border crossings will be established between all the emirates and Israel. The security arrangements will be in Israel’s hands.”</p> \n<p>Zeev Elkin: The salami method</p> \n<p>The plan of Jerusalem Affairs Minister Zeev Elkin (Likud), is that there is no plan. He believes that the territories belong to the Jewish people. “We have a historical-national right to Judea and Samaria that’s stronger than our right to Tel Aviv. Our whole return to this place is based on the fact that it belongs to us. If we forgo that principle, in the next stage, we can be sent to Uganda,” Elkin told the journal Ribonut (which, sure enough, means “sovereignty”), published by Women in Green.</p> \n<p>Still, he tells me in our meeting, he thinks the annexation of the West Bank should be gradual. The Israelis should learn the “salami method” from the Palestinians. “Every place on which there’s an Israeli consensus or a parliamentary majority, and international understanding that it’s ours – there’s no reason why we shouldn’t already take those regions now,” he says.</p> \n<p>As Elkin puts it, “Application of sovereignty to part of the territory must not be construed as the forgoing of the other territory. That’s how the salami method works.”</p> \n<p>The gradual working plan, then: application of sovereignty to territories about which there is broad agreement, without fear that this will be perceived as relinquishing the remaining territory. These would include Ma’aleh Adumim, Greater Jerusalem, the settlement blocs, the settlement “areas” (as in the Likud Central Committee resolution, these go beyond settlements to encompass areas of jurisdiction that include open areas around the settlements, but less than Area C) – every part of the territory about which a broad consensus can be mustered, while noting in advance that this is not the end.</p> \n<p>Unlike others on the right, Elkin admits that he’s disturbed by the binational-state issue. In his view, granting citizenship and equal rights to Palestinians is a dangerous solution. On the other hand, it’s equally clear to him that it’s impossible to annex the West Bank without giving the people rights and full citizenship, including the right to vote in Knesset elections. In other words, in any territory that’s annexed, the inhabitants receive full rights (subject to security reservations, of course).</p> \n<p>Alan Baker: The legal aspect</p> \n<p>The international legal expert Alan Baker, a former ambassador to Canada, was surprised when I told him I’d come at the recommendation of Nadia Matar and Yehudit Katzover. After all, he says annexation isn’t legal. Apparently it was more important for Women in Green to have a jurist explain that, according to international law, there is actually no occupation.</p> \n<p>According to Baker, a member of the committee chaired by former Supreme Court Justice Edmond Levy (who died in 2014) to examine the legal status of the West Bank settlements, the territories in question are not occupied.</p> \n<p>“That’s the position under international law and the international conventions,” Baker said, at his office at the Institute for Contemporary Affairs, which he heads within the framework of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. The territory was taken from Jordan, which was not a legitimate, internationally recognized sovereign power there. That’s because Jordan annexed the area in 1951, two years after the end of Israel’s War of Independence.</p> \n<p>“These are not lands that belong to a sovereign state, because they are lands that were under dispute,” he said. “It doesn’t fit the legal definition of ‘occupation.’”</p> \n<p>Israel, Baker says, does have historical and legal rights to the area based on international documents: the Balfour Declaration, the San Remo Declaration, the writ of the Mandate that was given to Britain by the League of Nations, and the UN Charter. The latter is the legal instrument for international recognition of the Jewish people’s rights to the territories, as Article 80 stipulates that all the agreements concluded previously by the League of Nations and all the commitments that were given (San Remo and the British Mandate) remain in force.</p> \n<p>Then why not annex?</p> \n<p>“Because it’s impossible to annex a disputed territory unilaterally. We’ve already applied personal law to the settlers. They’re subject to the Israeli criminal code and they pay income tax. We can’t go beyond this unless it becomes ours as part of an agreement. We undertook in Oslo that they [the Palestinians] would not become a state and try to be admitted to the UN, and that we would not annex. The whole fate of the territories is subject to negotiations. That’s what we signed.”</p> \n<p>Amatzia Samkai: The economic aspect</p> \n<p>The economist Amatzia Samkai focuses on the financial consequences of annexation. At the request of Orit Strock, a former Habayit Hayehudi MK and member of the Caucus for Eretz Israel in the Knesset, Samkai headed a team that examined the economic ramifications of applying Israeli sovereignty to Area C and its Palestinian residents. In our meeting, he presented the conclusions of the first part of the study, which examined the cost of integrating the Palestinians and absorbing its population.</p> \n<p>Samkai’s study is based on the controversial estimate that 150,000 Palestinians live in Area C. Based on that, the researchers calculated the cost of National Insurance and health payments, outlays for education and welfare, as well as the cost of expanding the government ministries to be consistent with the needs of the added population. Extra revenue would come from income tax, value-added tax, property tax, National Insurance payments, health tax and business taxes from 150,000 new Israeli citizens.</p> \n<p>Overall, Samkai estimates that an annual investment of around 2 billion shekels ($542 million) would be required, which is “less than one half of 1 percent of the state budget, which exceeds 450 billion shekels.” He also believes that application of Israeli sovereignty to Area C would create new economic opportunities because of the addition of personnel to labor-intensive industries and additional real estate for construction and agriculture.</p> \n<p>In his study, Samkai rejects the attempt to compare the application of sovereignty to Area C to the same effort undertaken years ago in East Jerusalem. He acknowledges that it’s a natural comparison but believes it’s impossible, “because of a deficiency of data and, more so, because of the difference in the characters [of the two population groups], and given the ability to carry out a more decisive separation from the economy of the Palestinian Authority,” according to the study.</p> \n<p>Note that this part of the study doesn’t take into account the expected profits from the new real estate freed up in the center of the country and the influence of the Israelization on prices of existing property, or on security expenditures. This is a critical point because at present, construction, development and infrastructure in Area C are very limited. Once the area becomes Israeli in every respect, the sky’s the limit. Two new cities could be built east of Rosh Ha’ayin. You don’t have to be an economist to grasp the dramatic effect this could have on housing prices. Samkai plans to address the significance of this in the next parts of the study.</p> \n<p>Yoram Ettinger: The demographic aspect</p> \n<p>Yoram Ettinger isn’t a professional demographer, and the majority of those who are dismiss his arguments outright. But he has studied the subject for 14 years, and has one message that he constantly reiterates: the “demographic demon” is a bluff. “In contrast to the angry prophets of demographics in the Israeli academic, governmental and political establishment – who have been warning about an Arab population time bomb since the struggle for the state’s establishment – the documented demographic trend points to an unprecedented Jewish demographic tailwind,” Ettinger says.</p> \n<p>The population issue is considered the Achilles’ heel of the annexationists. If territories where millions of Palestinians live are annexed, there’s a risk of Israel losing its Jewish majority, and then the only way to preserve the state’s identity would be by undemocratic means, meaning apartheid. That’s why the annexation advocates pounced eagerly on Ettinger’s data. He’s the demographic messiah, who promises that annexation is possible without risking the loss of a Jewish majority. Every annexationist today draws on Ettinger’s demographic good tidings.</p> \n<p>According to Ettinger, demographers who rely on the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics claim there are 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank and 1.9 million in Gaza. But his numbers tell a different story: 1.8 to 1.9 million Palestinians in the West Bank and 1.5 million in the Strip. All told: 3.3 million Palestinians, not 4.9 million.</p> \n<p>The reason for the gap, he says, is that the Palestinian statistics bureau includes some 400,000 residents of the West Bank who have lived abroad for more than a year, more than 300,000 Jerusalem Arabs, and 100,000 Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza who married Israeli Arabs, received an Israeli ID card and are counted as both residents of Israel and the PA. In addition, the PA denies the negative migration balance that has been increasing since 2000, and on September 7, 2007, the World Bank, according to Ettinger, documented a 32 percent inflation in the number of births.</p> \n<p>According to Ettinger, if we consider the entire population of Israel and the West Bank combined, there is a Jewish majority of 66 percent. If Gaza is included, it’s 57 percent.</p> \n<p>It’s important to note, according to Ettinger, that Jewish fertility is trending upward, while Arab fertility (in both Israel and the territories) has been decreasing for the past 20 years. In the meantime, the negative migration balance of the Arabs in the West Bank is continuing (since 1950!) at about 20,000 a year in the recent period, while the number of Israeli emigrants has fallen from 14,200 in 1990 to 8,200 in 2015.</p> \n<p>Ettinger recalls that in 1944, Prof. Roberto Bachi, the founder of Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics and a renowned expert in the field, published a demographic forecast in order to persuade David Ben-Gurion that 600,000 Jews did not constitute a critical mass sufficient to establish a state. Ben-Gurion wasn’t deterred, even though the Jewish majority within what became the partition borders was only 55 percent, and there was a Jewish minority of 39 percent in Judea and Samaria and within what we know today as the Green Line. “Ben-Gurion’s response was that a leader doesn’t accept demography, a leader determines demography, and he was right,” Ettinger says.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“The issue now is a conflict between Israel’s identity as a Jewish state and as an Israeli state,” explained right-wing journalist Shimon Riklin on Army Radio. He’s right. That is the basis for the campaign waged by organizations such as the right-wing group Im Tirzu, labeling members of human rights groups as traitors and foreign moles. It also underpins Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Hungarian-style campaign, led by the nation-state law.</p> \n<p>The law has in effect eliminated the notion of Israeli citizenship. There is no such thing as Israeli anymore. It’s now an epithet akin to leftist. Now it’s Jewish, while the status of everyone else has been downgraded.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>In a Haaretz op-ed (in Hebrew), former cabinet member Haim Ramon played the innocent, wondering why we are angry, holding protest rallies instead of embracing the new nation-state law. After all, he wrote, it’s only about “granting the right to nationhood exclusively to the Jewish nation,” without harming “individual rights.” All the spokespeople for the ethnocentric right wing, along with their helpers, such as Ramon, have avoided elaborating on the “national” rights granted only to Jews by the law, along with any discussion of violations of the individual rights of the population as a whole.</p> \n<p>The bottom line is that this law totally ignores minorities and their rights. Clause 7, for example, provides that the state will encourage and promote the establishment and consolidation of Jewish settlement. This detailed description underscores the fact that only Jews will benefit from all these efforts undertaken by the state, whereas non-Jews won’t. The state won’t develop or encourage or promote or establish and consolidate anything for them. That wouldn’t be in the “national interest,” as the law explicitly states when it comes to Jews.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Basic law of basically a disaster? Israel's nation-state law controversy explained ■&nbsp;It's no crime to march for peace | Analysis&nbsp;■ Netanyahu and Orban: An illiberal bromance spanning from D.C. to Jerusalem</p> \n<p>But come on, guys, why be crybabies and make such a big deal of something as trivial as residential communities and housing and associated services? After all, no “individual rights” will be violated, say Ramon and those on the right. But that’s a blatant lie. When a Druze citizen wants a permit to build a house and is denied it for “national” reasons (for not being Jewish), his individual rights are trampled. Is there anything more important to a person than a house?</p> \n<p>We should listen to the two people who sponsored the law, ideologues of the new right in the cabinet, Tourism Minister Yariv Levin and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked. Levin explained that the law’s main objective is to assist judges who have a rightist agenda. “The law gives them tools they never had before. It permits incentives and benefits to be granted based on a desire to maintain a Jewish character,” he said. Last year, Shaked said it would allow judges to favor the Jewish character of the state over its democratic one.</p> \n<p>The real target of this Hungarian-style politics is not necessarily minorities, but anyone who doesn’t toe the government line. The nation-state law is the tool to achieve this. Who will determine what&nbsp; Jewish character is and who will decide who is Jewish and entitled to Levin’s benefits? Not the law, not the courts, but religion and those who speak on its behalf. The key to admission to this world of benefits will not be in the hands of every Israeli, not even of every Jew, but only of government rabbis.</p> \n<p>The law already puts hundreds of thousands of people from the former Soviet Union beyond the pale, since they are not recognized as Jews. Many of them vote for Yisrael Beiteinu, the party whose name in Hebrew means “Israel is our home,” but Israel no longer views itself as their home.</p> \n<p>Even Israelis considered Jewish now may face a problem. Who will guarantee that they aren’t re-labelled? I’m not sure they will recognize me. I’ve been accused many times of not being Jewish. Others have claimed that I’ve forgotten what it means to be Jewish. If it were up to them, why would they recognize me, a secular person, as their equal? They may predicate the desired recognition on keeping religious commandments and the adoption of a religious lifestyle, in addition to a loyalty oath. “A Jewish nation” is not synonymous with Jews in general, but only with loyal Jews. Think about it. When they have the authority to grant special privileges in a Riklin-style “Jewish state,” do you really think they’ll give them to you?</p>",

        "text":["<p>“I always wanted to eat. I wanted to understand food from outside the environment in which I grew up,” says Brooklyn-born Mushka Haskelevich, 24, who grew up in an ultra-Orthodox family. At 14, she left home to go to school in Maryland, still in a religious framework, but far from her parents’ eyes. Although she no longer consider herself religious, at 18 she came to Israel to study at a girls’ seminary. “It wasn’t a very strict place. I loved it in Israel and I felt I’d be freer here, so I decided I would make aliya.” She went back to New York to save money, worked in various restaurants (“Not as a cook, but I learned a lot about food and the restaurant business”) and on the last day of 2013 she moved to Israel and settled in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Here she worked in restaurants as a bartender, waitress and shift manager before finally deciding to enter the kitchen. “I got tired of the constant interaction with people, and by then I’d learned a lot about food and cooking. Eventually I was ready to take this step.” It happened when she met Yoav Mizrahi, who is still her partner today, and whose family owned the well-known Caf&eacute; Mizrahi in Mahaneh Yehuda (which has since closed). “They needed help in the kitchen, so I started working there as a baker. Everything I know about dough I learned from Moran, his sister, who was the restaurant’s pastry chef.” She went on to work at Anna restaurant as a cook, and even after leaving, her passion for cooking never waned.</p> \n<p>Her choice of a bagel recipe has significance for her, and the filling connects her childhood with her adult life: “For me, the bagel is something that life always revolved around. I grew up in a Haredi home, and bagels were a regular thing. Every Sunday we would eat bagels with lox and cream cheese. When I started leaving religion, I discovered that the bagel was also a very New York food – I had no idea. Since I left home I haven’t gone back to eating cholent or gefilte fish, but bagels have stayed with me. It’s a kind of food I’m very fond of.”</p> \n<p>The day before we took the pictures for this column, the famed New York chef Anthony Bourdain committed suicide. Hezkelwitz says, “Through him, I discovered New York. I was a little girl. I didn’t know where to go. I’d grown up in the city, but in a bubble. I started watching all his shows and reading his books. I discovered that half an hour from my house there was a whole affordable world out there that I could experience just as he did. I followed him a lot. Through him I discovered the bagel with bacon, egg and cheese. It was an exciting discovery – the bagel that I was familiar with but in a whole new form. A bagel sandwich is something that every New Yorker eats and can afford, even if you’re homeless or hungover. It’s something that everyone can experience. It’s tasty and it’s inexpensive. It’s great.”</p> \n<p>Bagels</p> \n<p>Don’t be alarmed – the recipe is a bit long, but it’s quite simple and just requires some patience. The result is definitely worth it.</p> \n<p>Ingredients (for 10 bagels):</p> \n<p>For the dough base:</p> \n<p>350 ml (1/3 cup + 2 tbsp) water</p> \n<p>250 gr (2 cups + 1 tbsp) bread flour (rich in gluten)</p> \n<p>3 gr (1/2 scant tsp) dry yeast</p> \n<p>For the dough:</p> \n<p>400 gr (3 cups – 2 tbsp) bread flour (rich in gluten)</p> \n<p>25 gr (2 heaping tbsp.) white sugar</p> \n<p>10 gr (1/2 tbsp) salt</p> \n<p>For boiling:</p> \n<p>1 tbsp baking soda</p> \n<p>2 tbsp honey</p> \n<p>For baking:</p> \n<p>Whatever toppings you like: sesame or poppy seeds, sea salt, garlic powder</p> \n<p>Prepare the base for the dough: Combine the flour, water and yeast with a spatula or mixer. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place a moist towel on top. Let the bowl sit in a shaded spot outside the refrigerator for three hours, then check that the base has doubled in volume and that bubbles have formed (The bubbles burst when you rap the bowl on the counter). If it doesn’t look like that yet, give it some more time. When the base is ready, combine the remaining dough ingredients – 400 gr bread flour, 25 gr white sugar and 10 gr salt in the bowl of a mixer. Mix on medium speed using the dough hook and gradually add in the base. Let the mixer work for 15 minutes until a smooth and uniform dough is obtained.</p> \n<p>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and brush it with a little olive or other oil. Divide the dough into 10 pieces, forming each into a ball (Do not flatten the balls). At this stage it’s important to work quickly because we don’t want the dough to warm up. Place the dough balls on the oiled parchment&nbsp;paper, cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate for half an hour.</p> \n<p>Remove the baking sheet&nbsp;from the refrigerator and form the dough balls into bagel shapes: Roll the ball in your hands and gently start to form a hole in the middle. Use two fingers to create a hole that’s not too small and not too big.</p> \n<p>Return the bagels to the lined baking sheet&nbsp;(They are now a bit larger than before, so an additional sheet&nbsp;may be needed). Cover the baking sheet&nbsp;with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight (or 10 hours). This last step is optional, but Mushka Hezkelwitz says that, after much experimentation, she has found that the long refrigeration produces a better texture and crust and a richer flavor.</p> \n<p>Remove the baking sheet&nbsp;from the refrigerator and let sit for two hours (still covered). Bring 5 liters of water to boil in a large pot. When the water is boiling, add the baking soda and the honey. With a slotted spoon, place the bagels in the boiling water three at a time (so as not to crowd them). Let them boil for two minutes then flip them and let them boil for another two minutes. Remove them from the water with the slotted spoon and place on a rack. At this stage, you can sprinkle on the toppings you like: poppy seeds, sesame, coarse salt, garlic powder and so on.</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius. When the oven is hot, bake the bagels for 8 minutes. Then turn the baking sheet&nbsp;around and let them bake for another 8 minutes. Keep a close eye on them in the last couple of minutes, as they may be ready before the second 8 minutes are up. As soon as they are nicely browned, they can be taken out.</p> \n<p>Let the bagels cool before slicing (otherwise the texture will be less than ideal).</p> \n<p>Bagels with cream cheese, lox and pickled onion</p> \n<p>Ingredients (for 10 bagels):</p> \n<p>10 slices lox</p> \n<p>10 tbsp cream cheese (30 percent fat or more)</p> \n<p>1 small jar pickled capers</p> \n<p>pinch of coarsely ground black pepper</p> \n<p>dill or chopped chives for topping</p> \n<p>For the pickled onion:</p> \n<p>1 onion</p> \n<p>1/3 cup red wine vinegar</p> \n<p>2 bay leaves</p> \n<p>5-6 allspice berries</p> \n<p>To make the pickled onion: Peel the onion and cut in half lengthwise. Slice as thinly as possible and place the slices in a small jar. Pour in just enough wine vinegar to cover the onion. Add the bay leaves and allspice berries. Close the jar tightly. The onion will be ready in just 15 minutes (and will keep in the jar in the refrigerator for two weeks).</p> \n<p>Slice a bagel and spread it with cream cheese. Place a slice of lox on the bagel and sprinkle on a few capers, some pickled onion and black pepper. Add dill or chives if desired, close the sandwich and serve.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked must not have been in Israel in recent years, which would explain why she keeps saying that “war between the [legislative and judicial] branches” could develop. The fact is that the war between the branches has been raging for years. It is mainly manifested in frontal attacks on the Supreme Court by a flood of legislative proposals designed to curb the court’s powers and independence, as well as in declarations by politicians – including Ayelet Shaked, who seems to be a different person than Minister Shaked – furiously attacking the rulings by the court and accusing it of exceeding its mandate.</p> \n<p>Shaked’s latest remarks constitute a threat against the bench with respect to a matter standing before it. In other words, if the justices agree to hear petitions against the nation-state law, it will be a declaration of war. War is war and her comments are part and parcel of the government’s attack on the court.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Basic Law or basically a disaster? Israel’s nation-state law controversy explained&nbsp;■&nbsp;Former deputy president of the&nbsp;Supreme Court: nation-state law will only 'add to discrimination' against Arabs</p> \n<p>Minister Shaked seems to have missed the lesson on the independence of the judiciary. If she had been there, she would have heard that a judicial system is worthless if it isn’t independent. Appointing judges based on how much they agree with the worldview of the justice minister, and levelling threats at the courts, undermine that independence. The attack on judicial independence in Israel is especially perilous because in contrast to most democracies, the status and powers of the court are not protected by law.</p> \n<p>Israel of all countries needs to recognize the court’s authority to intervene when a constitutional (i.e., Basic) law is involved – to the point of overruling it. Israel has no system of checks and balances like other democracies have, such as having two legislative houses, decentralization of power between states or regions, an obligation to be subject to international treaties or international courts, and so on.</p> \n<p>There is no real separation between the legislative and executive branches in Israel, and the Knesset’s oversight of the government is not worth much either. The executive branch controls legislation by dint of its majority. The Knesset, and in effect the government, is both the legislative branch and the constitutive authority.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Explained:&nbsp;How Israel's government is aiming to outweigh the High Court</p> \n<p>Enactment of constitutional (Basic) laws can be accomplished by a regular majority and ordinary legislative procedures. The only element in the legal system with the power to impose checks and balances is the Supreme Court. No wonder those aspiring to absolute rule are acting to castrate it.</p> \n<p>Let's say the Knesset were to enact a law enshrining the supremacy of men over women, of heterosexuals over homosexuals, of whites over blacks, of soldiers over people who do not serve in the military and so on. According to Shaked's approach, the court would have to say “Amen.” How much does the nation-state law – which is in effect a Jewish supremacy law – differ from these examples? And if this is so, our judicial system has become wide open to tyranny, arbitrariness and discrimination, unfettered and unrestrained.</p> \n<p>The philosopher John Rawls devised a political thought experiment about how to set up a just society: try making political decisions while imagining you are behind a “veil of ignorance,” where you don’t know your religion, nationality, social class or other affiliations. In such a scenario, no sensible being would agree to give a government the kind of power granted to the nation-state law.</p> \n<p>That is why conservative, non-activist judges – such as the late Supreme Court deputy president Mishael Cheshin – believed in the authority of judicial review also when it comes to Basic Laws, by virtue of overriding principles.</p> \n<p>Among judges today, the real question isn’t whether the court has such power, but rather: When an overriding principle has clearly been trampled, does it demand juridical intervention – which may reach the level of revoking a law or one of its provisions (when the problem can’t be fixed by a lesser intervention)? Note that human rights legislation that was enacted in Israel, which until recent years had been a source of pride to all, was only born thanks to the creative approach of Supreme Court justices during Israel’s first decades of existence.</p> \n<p>There are examples of courts that conduct judicial review of its Basic Laws without explicit constitutional authority to do so, such as in India and Brazil. Shaked is also aware of this possibility, or else she wouldn’t have taken the trouble to try and void that power in her proposed amendment to the Basic Law on Legislation, which includes a clause bypassing the Supreme Court. That proposal is in the spirit of the authoritarian constitution of Hungary, Israel’s newest ally, competing with it over who is more nationalist and who tramples the most human rights.</p> \n<p>Shaked has not tired of repeating the untruth that before the nation-state law, the court did not have tools to defend the Jewish character of the state. The fact is that Israel has always been the place where the Jewish people realized its right to national self-definition, both as a political position and as a constitutional and super-constitutional principle. There are values in Israel that are equal in importance to its Jewish ones – such as the democratic character of the country – but none that supersede. Thus, the nation-state law has nothing to add to this.</p> \n<p>The justice minister says in the same breath that the law does not harm minorities, and also that it aims to change the balance between democracy and equality and the national-Jewish character of the state (hence the opposition to mention of the word “equality” in the law).</p> \n<p>But how can this magic be done without harming minorities? How can the state’s duty to promote and encourage Jewish settlement under the nation-state law not be accomplished at the expense of non-Jews?</p> \n<p>Shaked also presents the law as consensual. How can a law that separates Jews into two camps, and sparks sweeping opposition by all non-Jews, be consensual? And whence the imperviousness to the intolerable humiliation of non-Jews, who find themselves beyond the pale?</p> \n<p>The truth is completely different. In their heart of hearts, many of the members of the coalition know that the nation-state law has cooked their goose, but they lack the courage and integrity to admit it.</p> \n<p>The Supreme Court would be doing a favor for the state and its people – including the coalition – for the Zionist vision and Israeli citizenship, for the relationship with world Jewry, and for Israel’s status among the nations, if it relieves us from the wrongs and ills of this legislation.</p>",

Tlaib, along with Egyptian-American Abdul El-Sayed and Lebanese-American Fayrouz Saad – two other Michigan hopefuls aiming to make it to the midterms – fit a different profile.</p> \n<p>They are the American-born children of immigrants from the Middle East, reflecting the state’s increasingly high profile, well educated Arab-American community. (Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who has a Palestinian father, has already made it to Capitol Hill.)&nbsp;And all are running campaigns fueled by the energy generated by opposition to President Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>Of the three, Tlaib appears to have the best chance at victory. Tuesday’s contest in Michigan’s 13th Congressional District is a tight three-way race to replace Rep. John Conyers, the 89-year-old who resigned from Congress in December following sexual harassment allegations. Polls show the race as being too close to call, but Tlaib is running strong and recently grabbed the key endorsement of the Detroit Free Press – the region’s largest local daily.</p> \n<p>Tlaib has been a rising star in Michigan politics since 2008, when she became the first Muslim woman in the state legislature. Her mother is from Beit Ur al-Fauqa, outside Ramallah, and her father from Beit Hanina, an East Jerusalem neighborhood. She is one of 14 siblings.</p> \n<p>As Election Day draws near, the national spotlight has shone brightly on the state’s historic number of Muslim contenders, with The Washington Post describing the primaries as both “tests of the party’s progressive insurgency and tests of whether Muslim candidates can win.”</p> \n<p>The races are also testing the reaction of Michigan’s established and heavily Democratic Jewish community to a new generation of Arab-American progressives with whom they agree on the majority of pressing domestic issues, but worry about where they stand on foreign policy – specifically Israel.</p> \n<p>Jewish nerves jangled in the final days leading up the primary when, along with new Democratic hope Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Women’s March leader Linda Sarsour showed up in Michigan to campaign for progressive candidates on the ballot..</p> \n<p>Tlaib has mostly avoided comment on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and declined to answer questions from Haaretz on the subject. She did, however, tell the Washington Post: “We need to be much more honest about the fact that the walls are not working. We need to be honest about the dehumanization on both sides, frankly. And more importantly, we need to be not choosing a side. What I bring to the table, growing up in a Palestinian-American household, and coming to Detroit, is an understanding that there’s so much comparison between what happened there and what happened to African-Americans here.”</p> \n<p>Tlaib’s use of the language of intersectionality echoes that of New York candidate Ocasio-Cortez, who was widely criticized in May for comparing Gaza protesters to civil rights activists in the United States.</p> \n<p>But it is Sarsour’s embrace that has made Jewish Democrats most concerned about Tlaib. The two women are longtime political allies: In a recording for StoryCorps in 2011, Sarsour described Tlaib, four years her senior, as “my friend, my mentor, my role model.”“Some people really freaked out,” said one Jewish Michigan resident active in Democratic politics.</p> \n<p>Even before the July 29 event, Hannan Lis – an Israeli-American businessman active in both the organized Jewish community and the Democratic Party – warned Jewish progressives against embracing the candidate due to her ties to Sarsour.</p> \n<p>Lis insists that Tlaib’s Palestinian identity and Muslim religion aren’t the issue: Neither is particularly unusual in Michigan, where the Jewish and Muslim communities often work together. His problem with Tlaib is that “she has chosen to associate with a person who is divisive and clearly hostile to Israel. Linda Sarsour is very clear in her opinions; she is on record regarding Louis Farrakhan. For American Jews, even liberal ones, it is not something we can overlook.”</p> \n<p>Steve Tobocman said he was shocked by the “vitriol” directed at Tlaib on social media following the Sarsour visit. Tobocman, the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants, has been a close friend and political mentor to Tlaib, and defends her ties with Sarsour.</p> \n<p>“These are two women who have been at the forefront of exposing Donald Trump [as] a threat to the civil rights and comfort that Jews and other minorities in America have enjoyed,” said Tobocman. Just because Tlaib and Sarsour have known each other for nearly 20 years “doesn’t mean [Tlaib] agrees with all of [Sarsour’s] comments on every issue,” he noted.</p> \n<p>Tobocman pointed out that Tlaib has no political need to pander to either the Muslim or Jewish communities, given that the 13th Congressional District is 70 percent African-American. He added that Tlaib was “focused on dignity of all people and civil rights, and on peace. In that context, of course she is concerned about human rights abuses inflicted by the Israel Defense Forces, as she’s concerned about human rights abuses on the other side.”</p> \n<p>He said that while Tlaib hasn’t issued any position papers regarding any other aspects of foreign policy, she has done so on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, because she “sought out the support and received the endorsement of J Street.”</p> \n<p>The J Street PAC fundraising page on Tlaib says she is “personally familiar with the costs that the conflict has brought to Israelis and Palestinians.” As a result, she advocates the United States being “directly involved with negotiations to reach a two-state solution” and “supports all current aid to Israel and the Palestinian Authority.” In addition, she “does not support the expansion of settlements and believes that they make it difficult to reach a sustainable two-state solution.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>1.&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu knew exactly what he was doing. After all, he tried to get Israel’s nationality law, now renamed the nation-state law, through the Knesset in late 2014. So he knew from personal experience that there might be an international outcry, Israel’s image would sustain a harsh blow, many American Jews would be mortified and Israeli Arabs and the opposition would accuse him of sowing division and hate. He knew because he’d been there, done that.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Basic Law or basically a disaster? Israel’s nation-state law controversy explained &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>2. But Netanyahu also knew that this time around, the president of the United States wouldn’t try to stop him. Unlike Barack Obama, Donald Trump would not intervene with Netanyahu personally against the nationality law and his administration officials wouldn’t encourage U.S. media to focus on it.</p> \n<p>It’s doubtful whether Trump has even heard about the nation-state law anyway, never mind taken the time to know it and understand it, as Obama invariably did on most issues, but it’s guaranteed that, in any case, he doesn’t really care. If Sheldon Adelson says it’s good for the Jews, Trump could very well be telling himself, it’s good enough for me.</p> \n<p>But U.S. acquiescence to Netanyahu’s nationality law goes far beyond Trump’s usual public deference to Netanyahu and the objectively unprecedented affinity between the U.S. administration and the current Israeli government. The Israeli right wing’s nationality law is a populist ploy that stirs up acrimony and strife, which is exactly what Trump likes to smell when he wakes up in the morning.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Nation-state law protest is about Israel's identity&nbsp;– not equality | Analysis</p> \n<p>The nation-state law is nationalist, discriminatory, implicitly anti-Muslim, and exceedingly insulting to any Israeli who isn’t Jewish. What’s not to like, Trump must be asking himself. An administration that defied Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims by moving its embassy to Jerusalem and one that backs Israel blindly but reprimands the Palestinians incessantly certainly won’t be bothered by a little turmoil over Israel’s Jewish identity. It’s probably fake news, anyway.</p> \n<p>3. But even if Israel and the United States had no special relationship whatsoever, the Trump administration would still approve of the nation-state law. It aligns with their Weltanschauung. The law is a clear reflection of what Trump projects to America and throughout the world. It feeds on ultra-nationalist sentiments and sidelines minorities, which is great, infuriates the media, which is fine, and enrages the liberal left, which is dandy. And it shows Netanyahu’s middle finger pointing just like Trump’s at all those hoity-toity liberal democracies that preach so-called moral values, as if they’re better than us. Textbook Trump.</p> \n<p>4. Trump is not only a wooer of dictators from Kim to Putin to Duterte, but also an inspiration for leaders with authoritarian and nationalistic tendencies everywhere. His era marks the decline of a Western alliance based on shared values and the rise of a me-first, every-country-for-itself, mind-your-own-business approach to international affairs. This gives leaders in countries such as Poland, Hungary and now, unfortunately, Israel, freedom to stray from the established norms of modern democracy, more or less to their hearts' content. Without the U.S. leading or at least supporting, many other governments can’t be bothered either.</p> \n<p>5. Trump has transformed the international zeitgeist, but his influence on world affairs is even more pervasive. He rivets the world and takes its attention away from everything but him. He sucks up people’s energy, leaving them feeble to think about anything else. The same circles that gave loud voice to their fury in December 2014, when the nationality law was previously on the docket, are otherwise enraged today. They are confronted and affronted by a far greater threat to their values than a law passed in distant Israel.&nbsp; By being so spectacularly outrageous, Trump sidelines and diminishes the transgressions of his counterparts throughout the world.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Druze solidarity rally could make or break Netanyahu's election campaign | Analysis</p> \n<p>6. This is doubly true, of course, for American Jews, a majority of whom are truly aghast at Trump’s presidency. They are naturally circumscribed by the apathy of the White House and far more concerned with the outcome of the upcoming mid-term elections, anyway. In any case, the nationality law doesn’t evoke the kind of outrage that makes people demonstrate, sign petitions or phone their local legislators. Liberal and enlightened U.S. Jews have been living with Israel’s ongoing slide into intolerant nationalism for years.&nbsp; They’ve already been dealt a series of body blows by the Netanyahu government, most notably in its refusal to recognize them or treat them as equals. They’re used to it by now.</p> \n<p>For many American Jews, the nationality law means more embarrassment, more pain and more anguish. They know Netanyahu doesn’t pay attention to them anyway. And they suspect they know where all this is headed, but would rather not think about it, as they slowly drift away.</p> \n<p>7. So the setting was ideal for Netanyahu: He could count on a compliant U.S. president, an American body politic busy elsewhere and public opinion too busy freaking out over the Trump presidency in general. He knew the Israeli left would be outraged and Israeli Arab politicians, though not their constituents, would create a ruckus. That was fine by him: in fact, it was just what the hate-doctor ordered.&nbsp; Netanyahu covets such wedge issues that can inflame his base and put his critics and opponents on the defensive for not being “national” enough in the eyes of the majority of Jews that gets him elected.</p> \n<p>8. The Druze, however, surprised him. They threw a monkey wrench in his works. The country’s pride and joy, the conservative, right-leaning, intensely loyal tribe with the impeccable credentials of combat soldiers and commanders for the Israeli army did not figure in his game plan. Netanyahu was warned, but took the Druze for granted.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Netanyahu's spin backfired, fueling massive Druze nation-state protest rally | Analysis&nbsp;■ Behind the scenes: How Netanyahu's 'apartheid' trap torpedoed talks with Druze leaders</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s mistake about the degree of Druze indignation was compounded by his reaction to it. He tried to sow division among people who pride themselves on unity and mutual solidarity, and he cast doubt on the patriotism on those who have paid a proportionately heavier price on the battlefield and in the fight against terrorism than the Jewish majority itself. In Israeli terms, Netanyahu took on the toughest possible rival.</p> \n<p>9. The Druze rebellion has already yielded Saturday night’s massive protest at Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square, one of the largest in recent memory. It remains to be seen, however, whether it is a flash in the pan or heralds the birth of new Israeli alliance between moderate Jews and non-Jewish minorities that would fight for Israeli democracy and liberal values.</p> \n<p>But one should remember that any serious challenge to Israeli political orthodoxy, the right wing’s supposedly perpetual hegemony or Netanyahu’s seemingly endless stay in office will be met by a fiercer, harsher, more cynical and more divisive response than ever before. With Trump by his side, nothing’s gonna stop Netanyahu, now or in the future.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The statements and accusations flying around about the new Basic Law on Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People have been confusing and contradictory to outsiders, and even to Israelis.</p> \n<p>In an odd twist, the proponents of the law – those who celebrated its passage in the wee hours of July 19 – are now saying it changes nothing. And its angry, protesting opponents contend that it changes everything and undermines the foundations of Israel’s democracy.</p> \n<p>Tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrated last Saturday night&nbsp;in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square, in a rally led by Israel’s&nbsp;Druze citizens. This is the community that has felt most betrayed by the law, believing that it turns all of the country’s non-Jews into second-class citizens.</p> \n<p>The legislation, first conceived and proposed about seven years ago, is meant to establish and enshrine Israel’s Jewish national values in law. It will have no immediate impact; there is nothing in the law that has any practical application. But its symbolic importance has already been devastating.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Netanyahu's spin backfried, fueling massive Druze nation-state protest rally ■ Netanyahu to panel discussing Druze protest: 'No hasty decisions' on nation-state law ■ Dreyfus the Druze: For Israel's non-Jewish minorities, loyalty to the state ensures radical disenchantment | Opinion &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>That importance centers on the fact that the new legislation is a Basic Law. Israel’s lack of a constitution has led to the creation of a series of such laws: piecemeal measures that the courts are meant to recognize as articulating the underlying principles of the state, and might someday be incorporated into an actual constitution.</p> \n<p>This is why the nation-state law’s long-term impact could ultimately prove significant. That, of course, will depend on the nature of future Israeli governments, how they choose to incorporate the country’s now explicit Jewish national and religious character into government policy, and whether the courts use the law to uphold such policies if challenged.</p> \n<p>What is the law exactly?</p> \n<p>Most of its elements already existed in Israeli law. They are simply being emphasized in the new law and given more weight by being a Basic Law.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed hard to pass the bill, seeing its enshrinement of “Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people” as part of his political legacy – and with an eye toward upcoming elections.</p> \n<p>But beyond politics, the law has diplomatic importance as well. Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, have long demanded that the Palestinians acknowledge Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state as a condition in peace negotiations. How can Israel demand this of others, it was asked, if it did not do so itself?</p> \n<p>A key goal for Netanyahu and the right-wing camp in passing the law is to act as a counterbalance to the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty (1992) in court rulings. The nation-state law, they contend, will force judges to consider Israel’s Jewish character, as well as individual rights and freedoms, in future decisions. Critics say what is omitted is just as significant as what is included in the new law: the words “democracy” and “equality” do not appear.</p> \n<p>An earlier, more extreme version of the bill was even more explicit in prioritizing Jewish national values over democratic ones, including legalizing the creation of Jewish-only communities. Still, even the current language could be used to justify planning that benefits only the Jewish population and discriminates against non-Jews, based on the nation-state law’s provision that the state “views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and will work to encourage and advance its establishment and consolidation.”</p> \n<p>Why are the Druze so upset by the law?</p> \n<p>A unique, Arabic-speaking religious and ethnic group, the Druze community in Israel (excepting those in the Golan Heights) has long identified openly and proudly with the state and its institutions (unlike most other minorities in the state).</p> \n<p>Druze men are subject to the draft. Indeed, the community’s soldiers have long been recognized for their service and many have served in high ranks in the Israel Defense Forces. They are also represented in the leadership of centrist, and even right-wing, political parties. Druze lawmakers, reserve officers and numerous members of the community have loudly and publicly protested the law as an insult to their service and dedication to the country, challenging their loyalty.</p> \n<p>That message was hammered home by Saturday’s demonstration, with slogans proclaiming “If we are brothers, we must be equals.” The rally drew former members of the defense establishment, including ex-IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi, former Mossad Director Tamir Pardo and ex-Shin Bet security service heads Yuval Diskin and Ami Ayalon.</p> \n<p>Three Druze lawmakers have filed a petition in the High Court of Justice, calling the legislation an “extreme” act that discriminates against the country’s minorities. The petitioners asked the court to annul the law or rule out parts of it on the grounds of infringement on basic rights, including the right to equality. They said minorities have no status in the law, essentially exiling the Druze and other communities despite their service and loyalty to the state, Akram Hasoon (Kulanu), Saleh Saad (Zionist Union) and Hamad Amar (Yisrael Beiteinu) wrote.</p> \n<p>Three subsequent petitions have been filed against the nation-state law, but Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked warned this week of no less than an &quot;earthquke&quot; if the High court moves to nix it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What has been the response from the Netanyahu government? Will the law be changed?</p> \n<p>The outcry has seemingly swayed some ministers who actively supported and voted for the law. Education Minister Naftali Bennett said after the initial outcry that “a specific flaw arises regarding our Druze brothers, and that must be amended.”</p> \n<p>Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon also admitted mistakes were made when approving the law, saying it should be amended. “The enactment of the nation-state law was done hastily,” he told Army Radio two weeks ago. “We were wrong and we need to fix it.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has come out strongly against any changes to the law, though, presumably assuming that revisiting the wording would be equivalent to opening a Pandora’s Box, giving opponents a chance to kill it entirely.</p> \n<p>An attempt at reconciliation between Netanyahu and Druze leaders prior to Saturday’s protest was a huge failure, with the prime minister angrily cutting the meeting short in response to an online reference to apartheid made by a former Druze officer.</p> \n<p>At the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu again defended the legislation, saying it was necessary “to fortify Israel’s status as a Jewish state.” He later claimed it would prevent unification of Palestinian families and block entry of “infiltrators.”</p> \n<p>His only concession to the storm was the formation of a special ministerial committee to resolve the matter through the creation of additional legislation. However, he had already presented this idea to Druze community leaders and they rejected it as insufficient, demanding an amendment to the nation-state law that addressed all minorities in Israel.</p> \n<p>What does the Israeli public think of the law?</p> \n<p>Polling shows that while the majority of right-wing voters support the law, there is, unsurprisingly, wall-to-wall opposition to it in the Arab community.</p> \n<p>The most cited poll, published in Walla News at the end of July, showed 58 percent of Israelis supporting the law. Those who identified as centrists politically were split down the middle.</p> \n<p>However, in the monthly Peace Index poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute, only a minority – 45 percent – said they were either “sure” or “thought” there was a need for the law; 47 percent said there was no need and 62 percent said it should have included a reference to equality.</p> \n<p>Public opinion analyst Dahlia Scheindlin wrote that Netanyahu should beware the perceived damage to Israel’s social cohesion and its international image as a result of the law, even in the eyes of his loyalists.</p> \n<p>She ran focus groups among self-defined “moderate-right” Israeli Jews and those who called themselves the “center-leaning right,” and was “struck – and frankly surprised – to find that hardly anyone had a good word to say about the law.”</p> \n<p>She reported that supporters of the current government described the law as “reckless, rushed, politicized, and unnecessary,” and that it “just creates a provocation.”</p> \n<p>When the moderator proceeded to ask the group if they thought there would be consequences, a man replied, “Yes of course. From abroad they’ll look at us as racists.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Three weeks ago, at around 9 P.M., Mustafa Samareen was driving the Egged route 44 bus. As he approached his final destination at the settlement of Bat Ayin, a few youths starting throwing stones at the bus. The front windshield was completely shattered and Samareen needed medical assistance.  “I don’t understand what they want, I’m only a driver,” Samareen says. “They don’t want Arab drivers there.” He says soldiers in the area didn’t manage to catch the young men. This wasn’t the first instance: Stone-throwing has become a familiar feature at the settlement, one more example of the violence inflicted on&nbsp; Arab drivers working in public transportation.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Last year there were 18 registered cases of assaults on drivers, averaging one or two a month. Monitoring these incidents are two groups, the Racism Crisis Center and Koach LaOvdim, a labor-union group representing drivers at private bus companies. This is but a partial list since drivers often don’t report assaults in cases when the blows were light, when they were merely spat at, or when no delay in service was caused that would require an explanation to a manager.</p> \n<p>There is also a lack of trust that complaints will be addressed. “No one looks after us, not the company, not the Transportation Ministry, not the police – we’re on our own,” says a driver who requested anonymity.</p> \n<p>In any case, verbal abuse seems to have become the norm. According to private bus companies, every case is reported to the ministry, which declined to give details to Haaretz.</p> \n<p>There have been a raft of incidents. At Bat Ayin one driver was threatened with a pistol and another was sprayed with tear gas. In several cases stones were thrown. In Kiryat Arba a driver who asked a passenger to pay was assaulted, which also happened in Ma’aleh Adumim to a driver who told a woman that her car was blocking the lane.</p> \n<p>Another case involved youths who refused to part from the bottles of alcohol they were holding. In an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in the settlement of Kochav Yaakov, the police removed three youths who were smoking in a bus. They waited for the driver at another stop, broke a glass bottle over his head and threw stones at him.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israeli Arab bus driver says three Jewish youths attacked him with pepper spray ■ Jerusalem school district rejects Israeli parents' call to ban Arab bus drivers ■ More Israelis are coming out as anti- Arab, with politicians setting the tone &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>In all the cases, excluding one, the drivers were Arab. Jewish drivers may not be immune to violence, but it seems that in the fraught meeting between Jewish passengers and Arab drivers, “racism quickly erupts,” says one driver.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to obtain official statistics regarding the number of Arab bus drivers. In conversations with drivers in several companies that won bids for operating bus lines, it turns out that Arab drivers make up one-third to three-quarters of drivers.</p> \n<p>Several drivers note that they take care not to speak Arabic if a confrontation develops. “As soon as the passengers realize that the driver is Arab, reactions become more extreme,” says Mohammed Masalha, who works for Superbus.</p> \n<p>In early August, Masalha was driving on Route 2 toward the Afula central bus station. At one of the stops a young woman wanted to enter holding a cup of coffee. When Masalha told her that this was prohibited “she went wild, cursing my father, mother and all Arabs.” When the trip resumed she got out of her seat and approached him in a menacing way. One of the other passengers rushed to get between them.</p> \n<p>“I stopped the bus and called the police. The young woman must have called her brother, who came in through the back door. I didn’t see him until he pushed through and sprayed me with pepper spray,” Masalha says, adding: “I was doing my job in the most professional manner, I talked to her respectfully and I tried to make her see that the request wasn’t unreasonable. All I asked was for her to throw the coffee away.”</p> \n<p>Masalha filed a complaint with the police. He says that another complaint about racist epithets from another passenger, filed a year ago, has not been addressed yet.</p> \n<p>According to the list prepared by the monitoring groups, there has been a rise in the number of incidents over the summer, possibly due to the addition of nighttime lines that collect youths from clubs and similar places. According to Thamer Salaymeh, who works for the Egged bus company, “many youths come aboard, some of them a bit out of control after consuming alcohol.”</p> \n<p>A few weeks ago he refused to let three young men holding bottles board a bus at Ma’aleh Adumim. A scuffle broke out, including the well-known curses. One of the men tried to break a bottle over Salaymeh’s head.</p> \n<p>“I tried to protect myself and other passengers,” he says. “After they realize a driver is an Arab they let loose all their pent-up tensions. I don’t think Jewish drivers experience the same thing. Many cases don’t even reach the media.”</p> \n<p>It seems that Masalha and Salaymeh were assaulted mainly as bus drivers, but the fact that they were Arabs added intensity. In contrast, George Nazy, who works for Kavim Jerusalem, says he was assaulted in March just for being a non-Jew (he is Armenian-Christian).</p> \n<p>“Driving down a street I heard a noise and stopped the bus, thinking there had been an accident,” he says. “When I came out I realized it was stones. Three boys, one secular and two religious ones, were yelling ‘Arab, Arab.’ I realized they were looking to attack Arabs. One of them unleashed a pitbull at me. I asked them why they were hitting me but none of them answered.”</p> \n<p>This is the only case in which charges were filed, perhaps because a passerby videotaped the incident. It was the second time Nazy had been attacked. Two years ago he commented to a passenger who was smoking in the bus and got assaulted with an iron chain. “We sit in the dining room and drivers relate what they’ve gone through. It leads to despair. Every week there’s a new incident. Who wants to stay in this job after being spat on and called a dirty Arab?” he adds.</p> \n<p>The head of the workers’ committee in Egged Jerusalem says Jewish drivers don’t want to work at night, increasing the risks to Arab drivers. He says it’s particularly bad in Bat Ayin and Kiryat Arba. Last year the far-right group Lehava distributed a leaflet&nbsp; decrying the employment of Arab drivers, suggesting they pose a risk to Jewish women. A complaint he filed with the police has remained unanswered.</p> \n<p>Koach LaOvdim declared a work dispute in June because Egged had not addressed these assaults. Egged has promised to add a security guard in the evenings and to install three cameras on every bus. So far one camera has been installed on 10 buses. But one company cannot replace a systemic, government-led response. “They’re doing nothing and these assaults continue,” says attorney Uri Nirov, the legal counsel of the Racism Crisis Center.</p> \n<p>Egged says that responsibility for the safety of citizens, including bus drivers, rests with law enforcement agencies. Installing cameras is a temporary solution giving partial but immediate assistance to drivers. We hope a systemic solution is found soon,” said a spokesman for the company.</p> \n<p>The Transportation Ministry said that assaults are handled by the police, while the police say they handle cases of violence thoroughly and professionally. “Many suspects were arrested last year and charges were filed. The results of Masalha’s first complaint were reported to the plaintiff.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Archaeologists excavating the ancient Jewish village of Shikhin in the Galilee encountered a mystery: a strangely large proportion of the animal bones were from wild gazelles. It was far greater than the proportion of gazelle remains found at any other archaeological site in Israel, from that time of about 1,900 years ago, or earlier. Or later. What was the strange predilection the ancient Jews of Shikhin had for gazelles?</p> \n<p>Some were surely eating of the gazelle, which is perfectly kosher when slaughtered by ritual. But the people of Shikhin also had plenty of domestic flocks: sheep, goats and cows. It seems, the archaeologists concluded, that the Jews of Shikhin had developed a robust industry of curing gazelle hide for parchment, including for Torah scrolls.</p> \n<p>Dining habits in early Shikhin</p> \n<p>In Roman times, the Jewish village of Shikhin, also known as Asochis or, nowadays, Shukha, was known for its pottery, as revealed by passages in the Mishnah and Talmud. Indeed, recent excavations in the town found an abundance of types of pottery lamps and decorated oil lamps.</p> \n<p>Naturally, as happens when excavating a residential area, the archaeologists also found animal bones. But that strangely large proportion hailing from the local gazelle was baffling: The project's zoological archaeology expert, Dr. Carole Cope, estimates the proportion of gazelle remains among the Shikhin animal bones at 13%. The norm at other sites is more like 5%.</p> \n<p>&quot;There were much more deer bones in Shikhin than at any other site in Israel, especially any Jewish site from the time,&quot; says Prof. Mordechai Aviam of the Kinneret Colleges Institute for Galilean Archaeology, who has been directing the digs with Prof. James Riley Strange of from Samford University, Alabama.</p> \n<p>Even when compared with sites from the earlier Bronze Age and Iron Age, when people had been cultivating flocks for thousands of years but still hunted for some of their meat, the proportion of gazelle bones at Shikhin is big, Aviam says – noting also that the gazelle run really fast, which is a nice way to say they are a terrific pain to chase down. So appetite alone could hardly explain the spike in gazelle hunting.</p> \n<p>Consider the gazelle</p> \n<p>The gazelle is indigenous to the region and was appreciated in ancient times not only for its speed but for its gracile beauty. The ancient Hebrews alluded to it frequently in the scriptures (Song of Solomon 2:17; 8:14, 2 Samuel 2:18, 1 Chronicles 12:8)</p> \n<p>Hurry, my dear one, and be swift like a gazelle, Or a young stag, Upon the mountains of spices – Song of Solomon 8:14</p> \n<p>Also, if one can catch a gazelle, it tastes really good. But the rub is, at about the same time the spike in gazelle remains appears in Shikhin, the rabbis were trying to discourage hunting for meat, Aviam says.</p> \n<p>It isn't that the rabbis were early vegetarians. The problem was that hunting with bow and arrow or spear could harm the animal in ways that would render it non-kosher. Not least, it would likely die from its injuries before being &quot;properly&quot; slaughtered. If one must catch a wild animal, for supper or whatever purpose, the rabbis recommended nets.</p> \n<p>The people of Shikhin had other options. The sheep, the goat and the cow had been domesticated thousands of years. In the 1st century C.E., the Torah was written mainly on parchment made of sheep or goat skin. Later, leather would also be used. Part of the Dead Sea Scrolls, including the Book of Isaiah version found at Qumran, were written on bovine hide.</p> \n<p>Apparently though gazelle hide was considered finer, and since gazelles hadn't been domesticated but had to be hunted, their pelt probably cost more. The villagers could have had a tidy sideline in selling the pelt after eating the animal.</p> \n<p>They may have been an enterprising lot in Shikhin. A&nbsp; workshop for making oil lamps dating to the first and second century C.E. was identified last year: it appears to have been operated by a Judean rebel who fled the Romans, and set up a new life in the Galilee.</p> \n<p>King Solomon's table, or library</p> \n<p>Most of the indigenous mammals mentioned in the bible are extinct in modern Israel, such as the lion. Not so gazelles, but although they still exist in the Galilee and Golan Heights, they are under pressure from habitat encroachment by people – and they remain hunted to this day.</p> \n<p>Culinary tastes change vastly over the eons. Most ancient recipes would range from the objectionable to the obnoxious according to modern tastes. But we still find gazelle tasty. And kosher.</p> \n<p>Under Jewish tradition, gazelles may be eaten (Deuteronomy 12:15,22, 14:4, 15:22). The animal also constituted one of the regular delicacies on King Solomon's sumptuous table (1Kings 4:22-23). But Solomon, if he existed, lived well over a thousand years before the people of Shihkin, by which time the rabbis had begun frowning on animals hunted with weapons.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the people of Shihkin were ignoring their rabbis and ate gazelles with abandon. But the theory that they were selling their skins finds support in the Talmud, describing Hiyya, a rabbi who moved from Babylon to the Galilee in the late 2nd century or early 3rd century (even though that's a century or two later than the date of the Shikhin bones).</p> \n<p>Said&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Hiyya to R. Hanina, ‘I went and sowed flax, made nets, trapped deer, the meat of the deer I gave to orphans, from the skins I made scrolls, on which I wrote the five books of Moses. I went to a town and taught the five books to five children, and the six divisions of the Mishnah to six others. Then I told them, Until I return, teach each other the Pentateuch and the Mishnah. And that is how I prevented the Torah from being forgotten in Israel’ - (b. Ketubot 103b; Neusner translation).</p> \n<p>Aviam thinks that shows gazelles were hunted in the Galilee for their hides, to make Torah scrolls. The parchment would may also have been used to make mezuzahs and amulets, he thinks.</p> \n<p>In any case, Rabbi&nbsp;Hiyya's comments&nbsp; suggest that hunters used nets rather than weapons so that the animals could be slaughtered in a kosher manner.</p> \n<p>The laws of shechita, as kosher slaughter of birds and ruminants is called in Hebrew, were not handed down by Moses, but were shaped by the rabbis in debate over time, starting in about 200 C.E. The form of slaughter as practiced for centuries is to cut the animal's throat – crucially, severing both the trachea and esophagus - with an extremely sharp knife, in one back and forth motion, to preclude suffering to the animal insofar as possible.</p> \n<p>Any deviation from the exact practice renders the animal unfit for eating, and it is abundantly clear why death by spear or arrow would transgress against these rules.</p> \n<p>Shikhin was near Sepphoris, which was one of the Galilee’s two Jewish capitals (the other was Tiberias). Sepphoris, with its academies and renowned rabbis, could have provided a reason for Shikhin’s residents to develop the production of fine, and mainly expensive, gazelle parchments, Aviam says.</p> \n<p>Dr. Ram Bukhnik, a zooarchaeologist with the Kinneret Institute for Galilean Archaeology, notes that some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were written on parchments made from gazelle and ibex hides. &quot;Jewish sources from later periods recommend gazelle skins for parchments because they are soft and well-suited for writing on,” he says.</p> \n<p>The Pliny theory</p> \n<p>Why would people use untanned skin to write on at all, for millennia after the invention of papyrus paper?</p> \n<p>For one thing, it was hardier. There is a reason we wear shoes made of leather, not paper. For another, both sides could be written on, which was not the case of papyrus.</p> \n<p>The Jews may have had to resort to non-paper for their writing afters Egypt prohibited its export in about 190&nbsp;B.C.E., according to the historian Pliny. Following that, leather parchment was invented in Pergamon. In fact the word &quot;parchment&quot; is believed to have stemmed from the name of that Greek city.</p> \n<p>The Dead Sea Scroll of Isaiah, which was written towards the end of the second century B.C.E. i.e., roughly at the same time as the pharaoh's export ban, was written on leather.</p> \n<p>Lambskin is also prized for parchment, Cope says. Indeed, many of the butchered sheep found at Shikhin were young, going by the bone evidence. That too supports the hypothesis that the town was home to a brisk parchment production industry almost 2,000 years ago.</p>",

        "text":["<p>PepsiCo is acquiring Israel’s SodaStream International for $3.2 billion in cash, the two companies said on Monday, as the giant American beverage and snacks company seeks new markets outside of its traditional core business of bottled carbonated soft drinks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>PepsiCo agreed to pay a very high price for SodaStream, which makes machines used to make carbonated drinks at home. The U.S. company will pay $144 a share, a generous 32% premium over SodaStream’s average weighted share price over the last 30 days. That comes after SodaStream’s share price has soared some 85% this year before the deal was announced.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The lesson SodaStream taught Israel&nbsp;■&nbsp;SodaStream's makeover is a success, but can the stock keep climbing?</p> \n<p>The news on Monday drove SodaStream shares up nearly 9% to 522.60 shekels ($142.74) on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and by a similar amount on the Nasdaq.</p> \n<p>The deal caps a hugely successful effort three-year by SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum to turn around the company after it was beset by changing consumer tastes&nbsp; away from sugary carbonated drinks of the kind that PepsiCo was built on towards healthiest alternatives, including sparkling water.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, SodaStream reported its strongest results in the company’s history, with a 31% year-over-year jump in revenues to $172 million and an 82% climb by net profit to $26 million.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Indira Nooyi pointed to SodaStream’s success in reinventing itself as the reason why she wanted to bring the company into the group as one of her final acts before she steps down as PepsiCo CEO on October.</p> \n<p>“Daniel and his leadership team have built an extraordinary company that is offering consumers the ability to make great-tasting beverages while reducing the amount of waste generated,” she said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Companies like PepsiCo are also worried about the impact on growing online grocery shopping and consumer tastes for niche products or products they can customize to their tastes.</p> \n<p>Other soft-drink producers have tried to tap the home-carbonation segment but without much to show for it. Coca Cola ventured into the segment in 2014 when it bought a stake in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, but the soft-drink-making system they developed was discontinued two years later.</p> \n<p>Founded in the U.K. in 1903, SodaStream devices was a fixture in British kitchens in the 1970s and 80s, but it faded in popularity as bottled soft drinks became cheaper. The company was bought 20 years ago by Soda-Club, an Israeli company founded in 1991 by Peter Wiseburgh.</p> \n<p>By the time Birnbaum took over as CEO in 2007, SodaStream was struggling. However, he was successful enough in turning it around that by 2010 SodaStream went public in New York. Its fortunes continued to improve, and there was even a report at the time that PepsiCo might buy it.</p> \n<p>The report proved wrong and by 2014 SodaStream was seeing sales and profit drop as consumers turned away from sweet, carbonated soft drinks. Birnbaum revived the company’s fortunes with a strategy of positioning itself as a healthier, environmentally friendly alterative to produces like Coca Cola and Pepsi; that’s because SodaStream users could use the device to make whatever kind of drink they wanted while the bottles used by the devices are reusable.</p> \n<p>As its business was being hurt by changing consumer preferences, SodaStream also found itself in 2014 targeted by the international boycott, divestment and sanctions movement because its main Israel plant was in the West Bank settlement of Ma’aleh Adumim.</p> \n<p>The company also made waves when it hired Scarlett Johansson to pitch its home-carbonation systems at the Super Bowl in 2014, not least for having to change its ad because of a dig at Coca Cola and Pepsi. The actress herself subsequently came under fire from BDS.</p> \n<p>In 2016, the company moved its manufacturing operations to an industrial park by the Bedouin town of Rahat in southern Israel. It had to part ways with hundreds of Palestinian employees who lived in the West Bank and could not obtain permits to work in Israel, but wound up hiring hundreds of new employees, including from Rahat itself. Its move to the south made SodaStream one of the biggest employees in the region.</p> \n<p>At a news conference on Monday, PepsiCo’s incoming CEO, Ramon Laguarta, said he had no plans to shake up SodaStream, terming it a successful business that didn’t require any tinkering. He also said PepsiCo had committed to remaining in Israel for 15 years but added he believed it would be here “forever.” As to investing in Israel, Laguarta said he was unconcerned.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In fact, PepsiCo already does business in Israel. It has a U.S.-based joint venture with Israel’s Strauss Group called Sabra Salads that makes and markets hummus and other prepared salads that was formed in 2007.</p> \n<p>Strauss and PepsiCo also produce the FritoLay snack in Israel under a 50-50 joint venture and Pepsi soft drinks have been manufactured and distributed in Israel by Tempo Beverages under license since 1992.</p>",

But home carbonation of tap water eventually took off and the company’s heyday came in the 1970s and 1980s, reaching 10 million U.K. homes.&nbsp;A series of changes of ownership, which included Reckitt &amp; Coleman and Cadbury Schweppes, grounded momentum.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;Eventually the company was bought by Soda-Club, its Israeli distributor.

He is making sure everybody knows it. I don’t think you mess with somebody like that.” It’s rare for a business leader to speak out against the foreign policy of their own country, especially a seasoned executive like Mr. Sharp, but his experience dealing with Saudi Arabian interests makes him more qualified than most to discuss the Canadian government’s approach.&quot;  &quot;Mr. Sharp’s relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia began in the mid-1990s, when Four Seasons was under pressure to reduce its debt. He met with Prince Al-Waleed on a yacht on the French Riviera, and the Saudi investor agreed to come to Mr. Sharp’s rescue and take a 25-per-cent stake in the company and allow the hotel founder to keep a controlling position.&nbsp;Just over 10 years ago, Mr. Sharp took Four Seasons private in what he said was a bid to maintain the company’s strategy and direction, selling the majority of the company to Prince Al-Waleed and Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates.&quot;&nbsp;[GlobeAndMail]&nbsp;  SPORTS BLINK:&nbsp;Bob Kraft gives wheelchair-accessible van to RI family in need —&nbsp;by Justin Dougherty:&nbsp;&quot;New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft handed over set of keys to a brand new wheelchair-accessible van...&nbsp;to the family of Alyssa Silva, who suffers from spinal muscular dystrophy.&quot;&nbsp;[WHDH]  Israeli equestrian athlete refuses to compete on Yom Kippur:&nbsp;&quot;Israeli&nbsp;Equestrian&nbsp;rider Dan Kramer, who is scheduled to participate in the world championships next month, generated a controversy in the industry after announcing in a letter to the horseracing federation that he decided not to participate in the competition because it will take place on&nbsp;Yom Kippur.&quot;&nbsp;[Ynet]&nbsp;  Israel Becomes Hotspot for NBA Stars, and Some Are Catching the Heat —&nbsp;by Elad Zeevi:&nbsp;&quot;A few days before [Victor] Oladipo’s luxury tour of the Holy Land, an aerial photo of Tel Aviv through the window of a plane appeared on LaMarcus Aldridge’s Instagram account...

And [it’s been] the same thing in the community of people supporting Palestinian rights. I do listen to the criticism, and I do listen to constructive suggestions. But generally speaking, when the trolls attack, I mute it really. If it’s just insults — you’re a self-hating Jew, you’re a blood thirty Zionist, whatever — that doesn’t illuminate anything.

        "text":["<p>Leading demographers claim that if the world continues to go about its business as usual American Jewry will experience some radical changes by the year 2088. Some are preparing for a future in which Orthodox Jews, who currently represent but 12% of American Jewry, will become its majority and public face.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As the Jewish descendants of Louis Brandeis and Emma Lazarus drift away into the ether of an increasingly multi-cultural America, they claim, it will be Donald Trump’s Orthodox grandchildren who stand to inherit the mantle and prestige of being the chief representatives of American Jewry.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The New Jewish Elite of the Trump Age: Ultra-Orthodox and pro-Israel Hawks&nbsp;|&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Misreading the Apocalyse:&nbsp;Orthodoxy Won't Save American Jewish Life&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>On the surface, the data seems simple enough: Non-Orthodox Jews on average have a fertility rate of less than 2 children per couple; while the Orthodox average over 4.&nbsp;Multiply all of that by a few decades and voil&agrave;: By the 22nd century, the Orthodox, who are currently the smallest, most politically conservative, insular, observant and poor sector of American Jews will become its dominant group.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But such sociological predictions should be carefully examined and fleshed out before being used for determining public policy and the annual allocation of billions of dollars in American Jewish philanthropic funds.</p> \n<p>In fact, what at first sight seems to be an inevitability becomes a quite tenuous projection, in light of larger historical trends and available economic data. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>For most of the 19th and 20th century, Orthodoxy in the United States was a study in institutional decay. While it claimed the mantle of authentic Judaism, its retention rates plummeted as young Jewish men left behind their black hats and cut their side-locks; women increasingly refused to wear head coverings and skirts. They stopped keeping kosher and began moving up America’s socio-economic ladder.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By the mid 1970s, however, demographers had begun to see signs of vitality in Orthodoxy. New civil rights legislation that offered greater acceptance of minorities at the workplace, governmental subsidies for impoverished communities, and newfound pride in ethnic identities all contributed to a noticeable reduction of Orthodoxy’s attrition rate by the end of the century.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sociologists point to four social factors to account for the movement’s rebirth in the United States. They include a &quot;passion&quot; about Jewish norms and purpose, the performance of numerous &quot;rituals,” a deep investment in &quot;community&quot; and an unswerving commitment to Jewish &quot;education.&quot;</p> \n<p>These key factors, that the demographer Steven M. Cohen summarizes by the acronym PRICE, have been Orthodoxy’s formula for success and flourishing. The question Cohen poses to &quot;the rest of American Jewry is how many others are willing to pay the PRICE for a rich Jewish life.&quot;</p> \n<p>It is more than ironic that one would employ the acronym of PRICE to justify a prediction that a majority of American Jewry will become Orthodox. While many have begun to reexamine the social and ideological profile of American Orthodoxy’s PRICE, none of them contain a rigorous examination of its economic profile and how the actual price of PRICE might affect a long-term prognosis.</p> \n<p>A cursory analysis of available data on Orthodox adherents reveals that they can be economically divided into two groups.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A large portion of Orthodox Jews, the sector that has seen the largest growth, come from impoverished Hasidic families that are supported by large scale social welfare programs. Though they average close to six children per couple, 43% of ultra-Orthodox families earn less than $50,000. Lobbying efforts and collective voting translates into kosher pork barrel funds that allow these groups to continue to survive, creating an endemic social welfare class.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Recognizing the severe economic challenges posed by a Haredi lifestyle&nbsp;the group that is more often touted as a model for Jewish continuity are the super wealthy Modern Orthodox Jews, who earn like Episcopalians and increasingly vote like Evangelicals.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Unlike their more frugal ultra-Orthodox brethren, those who identify as Modern Orthodox, an&nbsp;influential subgroup that boasts Joseph Lieberman, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner among its adherents,&nbsp;wear fashionable clothing and are among the most affluent and best-educated Americans. Whereas less than 15% of Evangelicals earn over $150,000 a year and a smaller fraction attend post-graduate education, 37% of Modern Orthodox families now earn $150,000 a year and a similar percentage obtains post-graduate degrees.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Indeed, Modern Orthodoxy’s appeal has everything to do with PRICE but is best understood through what sociologists would describe as a club-model.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Orthodoxy’s norms and mores - that induce members to spend Shabbat together, pay large sums of money to attend all-Jewish private schools, and decrease their ability to socialize with nonmembers - and economic profile have created a unique social constellation in which rewards are measured through both monetary categories as well as the cultivation of social bonds and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The club nature of Modern Orthodoxy has already been uncritically recognized its lay leaders, such as Jay P. Lefkowitz, the Bush White House General Counsel of the Office of Budget and Management, who explicitly compare it to a &quot;club,&quot; choosing, somewhat oddly, to use the analogy of being &quot;a Jet,&quot; one of the West Side Story street gangs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;As Modern Orthodoxy Declines, a Jewish Trump-voting Religious Right Is Ascendant&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Is Ivanka Trump America’s Most Powerful Jewish Woman?</p> \n<p>For Lefkowitz, being a member in the club of Orthodoxy demands punctilious observe of a set of highly intricate rules and regulations, but not belief in God, social or economic justice or the ambitions of a larger Jewish civilizational project. What Lefkowitz, however, fails to recognize is the larger socio-economic implications of his apt description.</p> \n<p>Modern Orthodoxy’s high cost of entry requires that one can afford kosher sushi, making it look like&nbsp;something closer to the Augusta National Country Club than a major American religion. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>In fact, the Modern Orthodox community is already reaching an economic breaking point, with its rabbinical and lay leadership warning of an impending economic crisis and prohibitive day school tuition fees and camp costs. The Modern Orthodox club continues with every passing day to give way to the larger and more welcoming welfare model of the ultra-Orthodox.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In other words, if demographers’ projections come to fruition then American Jews, who today are one of the wealthiest ethnic groups in America, would by 2088 become one of its poorest.</p> \n<p>If that seems far-fetched, it is because it runs counter to everything we know about the history of Jews and the choices those who were once Orthodox have made in the last century.</p> \n<p>From 1870-1970 Jews’ around the world left Orthodoxy en masse, not only because they rejected its xenophobia, sexism and religious dogmas, but because they knew that the God worshipped by the Orthodox would not put bread on their tables.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The critique against Orthodox economics was a decisive turning point in modern Jewish history. It is what gave rise to the mass migrations to the United States and Palestine at the end of the nineteenth-century and was the basis of virtually all major modern Jewish political movements ranging from Bundism to Zionism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As the founder of Zionism, Moses Lilienblum explained to observant Jews living traditional lifestyles in the late nineteenth century: &quot;I am not interested in telling Jews to stop keeping the things that are written in the [sacred] books, I only want to tell you.you don’t have bread to eat.&quot;</p> \n<p>While in the 1860s Lilienblum criticized Orthodoxy’s moral hypocrisies and intellectual shortcomings, by the 1870s he came to see Orthodoxy’s moral and intellectual deficiencies as reinforcing a lopsided economic model comprised of paupers and super wealthy philanthropists. Lilienblum railed against Jews limited economic profiles and the high costs associated with boutique forms of rabbinic Judaism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When Lilienblum issued his critique of Orthodox economics he was greeted with jeers and denunciation. Fifty years later, Lilienblum’s words had become a sina qua non and the bedrock of a new Jewish politics. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Just like in America today, at the end of the 19th century there was a demographic explosion among observant Jews living in Russia. As Lilienblum’s comrade and the founder of Jewish socialism, Aron Shemuel Lieberman explained in 1876: &quot;While&nbsp;currently, the children of the yeshiva are deeply conservative (they observe that which has been established and hate that which is new) they possess the capacity to transform the old ideal into the new.&quot;</p> \n<p>Lieberman correctly predicted that the youth in the yeshiva would not allow itself to remain enslaved to limited economic roles and dependent upon the mercy of millionaire philanthropists. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Once again, Orthodoxy is swelling, its day schools mushrooming, and its consumption patterns far outpacing its production capacities. Some are calling for new philanthropic funds to support an Orthodox Jewish future. But such calls fail to take into account what we know about Jewish history.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As in Lilienblum and Lieberman’s day, the children of the Orthodox will leave its ranks and chart their own path - perhaps not now, but eventually. Where they will go is still uncertain. But what is likely is that tomorrow’s youth will probably engage in a full critique of Orthodoxy’s support for the current occupant of the White House and Orthodoxy’s moral-economic shortcomings.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>They too will eventually come back to the most simple and basic reason why Orthodoxy is just not a viable option for humanity: It’s the economy, stupid! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Eliyahu Stern is Associate Professor of Modern Jewish History at Yale University.

        "text":["<p>One thing that has characterized Turkey’s financial crisis so far is the seeming lack of government response. The central bank has moved to ensure liquidity for the banking system, but the big steps that Ankara ordinarily would have ordinarily been expected to take, such as in interest rate hike or capital controls, have not even been hinted at. Assuring statements by the country’s leaders have also been in short supply.</p> \n<p>Yet the government has been hard at work and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has done his fair share of talking.</p> \n<p>Among other things, the Istanbul prosecutors office has opened an investigation into social media accounts that spoke about lira in what it termed a “provocative way.” The government has ordered a bizarre boycott&nbsp;of imported American electronics, while leading companies like Turkish Airlines and T&uuml;rk Telekom have vowed not to advertise in the U.S. media. Erdogan, meanwhile, is urging Turks to sell their gold and dollars and increase imports.</p> \n<p>If all of this seems to be irrelevant to Turkey’s very real problems of a sinking lira and excessive debt, just listen to Erdogan himself and you will understand the logic.</p> \n<p>“There are various campaigns being carried out. Don’t heed them,” Erdogan told a rally of his supporters last Friday.</p> \n<p>“Don’t forget, if they have their dollars, we have our people, our God.” In other words, Turkey isn’t suffering from bad policies or changing global economic conditions. It is fighting enemies conspiring to ruin the country.</p> \n<p>This kind of talk isn’t new to the Turkish leader. He had, for instance, the same response when the international credit rating agencies downgraded Turkish debt to junk status.</p> \n<p>“You’re a firm in such an important position and you take steps saying ‘How do I stain Turkey? How do I put them in a tough position?’&quot; he said, railing against Moody’s in June as if the agency was out to get Turkey, rather than because Turkey’s number looked so bad.</p> \n<p>Paranoid economics</p> \n<p>Erdogan’s paranoid approach to economics isn’t unique. Iran’s leaders, who are facing the consequences of an American boycott as well as decades of shambolic policies have also adopted the strategy of blaming enemies inside and outside Iran and sickening the legal system. Over the weekend Reuters reported that new Islamic revolutionary courts will be set up for two years to impose stiff sentences on Iranians “disrupting and corrupting the economy.&quot; The right to appeal will be limited, judiciary chief Amoli Larijani said in a letter read on state television.</p> \n<p>Other countries in economic crisis have resorted to similar strategies. Vladimir Putin has framed Russia’s economic woes as a war being fought against the country by the West. Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro has down the same, as did Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe in his day.</p> \n<p>Of course, United States and/or European sanctions and/or tariffs also contributed all of these countries’ problems. But their role was marginal compared to how much damage these countries’ leaders did themselves.</p> \n<p>It’s easy to dismiss the paranoia and talk about “economic war” as a cynical campaign by these countries’ leaders to deflect blame away from themselves and on to a fictional someone else who very handily can never be apprehended and thereby solve the crisis. The enemy in this “economic warfare” serves the role of Emmanuel Goldstein in Orwell’s “1984,” the every-plotting, ever-elusive enemy of the people and all-purpose scapegoat.</p> \n<p>Surprisingly, this paranoid approach to economic policy often works, in terms of convincing the public. The nuts and bolts of economics are a mystery to even the most intelligent and informed citizens, and the sudden onset of a crisis when everything has seemed to be just fine naturally arouses paranoid instincts. Why now? Someone must have done something to cause it.</p> \n<p>Worldview of conspiracy</p> \n<p>But I think it would be wrong to dismiss the policy of paranoia as cheap propaganda. Authoritarian regimes, like the ones in Turkey, Iran, Russia and Venezuela, are in variably obsessed with enemies or conspiracies, whether they are political rivals, foreign powers, or minorities at home. It’s not a game: it reflects the worldview of leaders who don’t believe in sharing power, respecting other points of view, or in transparent institutions.</p> \n<p>That goes a long way to explaining why Erdogan, watching Turkey drowning in a major financial crisis, can’t bring himself to throw a lifeline. Instead, he draws on the bank of unseen enemies and calls on loyal Turks to go into battle to fight the enemy by stepping up exports, changing their dollars into liras and boycotting iPhones.</p> \n<p>Erdogan’s paranoia combined with his vast powers over the government is a big danger to Turkey, unless he (uncharacteristically) decides to cede power of economic policy.</p> \n<p>Economic warfare won’t solve Turkey’s problems and, in any case, is a lost cause if Turkey plans to go up against the U.S. Counting on Turks to patriotically buy the liras that they had been dumping until now for perfectly good economic reasons is no more promising. Setting up your own credit rating agency, which Erdogan threatened to do when he blew up at Moody’s, isn’t going to enhance the country’s credibility with investors.</p> \n<p>Turkey’s ability to grapple with its problems will require not only adopting the right policies but restoring the democratic institutions that have eroded badly in the Erdogan era. If it doesn't, Turkey will find itself in chronic decline, like the economies run by the authoritarian regimes of Iran, Russia and Venezuela.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“I was preparing a birthday present for a woman friend – a small engraved gem for insertion into a ring. It was fixed in the centre of a piece of stout cardboard and on this I wrote the following words: ‘Voucher for the supply by Messrs. L., jewelers, of a gold ring … for the attached stone bearing an engraved ship with sail and oars.’ But at the point at which I have here left a gap, between ‘ring’ and ‘for,’ there stood a word which I was obliged to cross out since it was entirely irrelevant. It was the little word ‘bis’ [German for ‘till’].”</p> \n<p>An obscure article, in which Sigmund Freud subjects to analysis the clumsy text of a gift voucher he intended to give a woman friend, is the only place in his writings that offers a glimpse of his custom of giving as a gift ancient rings set with an intaglio (seal) stone and engraved by an artist. In the course of his life, Freud gave out about 20 such signet rings, set with ancient semi-precious stones from his collection of gems, bearing a figure from Greek and Roman mythology. He himself wore, during certain periods of his life, more than one ring from the collection.</p> \n<p>Six of these rings are currently on display in an exhibition, “Freud of the Rings,” at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem&nbsp;through March 2019. They represent the three main groups of those gifted with the rings: psychoanalysts who were members of the “secret committee”; friends to whom Freud was especially grateful; and female psychoanalysts whom he treated or of whom he was particularly fond. Also on show are several items from the Freud collection, together with a video work by American artist Amie Siegel, exploring the fetishistic aspect of maintaining Freud’s collections. Visitors will also see the ring that Freud himself wore, which is set with a green gemstone bearing a portrait of the god Zeus.</p> \n<p>“My old and dirty gods.” The archaeological metaphor first crops up in Freud’s writings in his description of the method by which he treated the woman he called Elisabeth von R., beginning in 1892: “This procedure was one of clearing away the pathogenic psychical material layer by layer, and we liked to compare it with the technique of excavating a buried city.” Archaeology also influenced the perception of the psychoanalyst’s role. He was expected to consider himself less a physician and more an archaeologist of the mind, uncovering the truth concealed in the depths of his patients’ unconscious.</p> \n<p>In 1856, the year Freud was born, Troy was a myth and archaeology was a speculative realm of knowledge. By the time of his death, in 1939, archaeology was considered a science and museums of the European capitals exhibited precious objects excavated in every part of the world. In the first half of the 20th century, even a private, impecunious collector like Freud could gradually build up a collection of archaeological artifacts that today would be worth its weight in gold.</p> \n<p>It was only after World War I that Egypt, Greece and other countries began to restrict the removal of antiquities excavated in their territory. For long afterward, the antiquities markets in Europe were flooded with items robbed from excavations across the globe.</p> \n<p>In December 1896, two months after his father’s death, Freud bought the first objects of what would become his collection, and wrote to his friend Wilhelm Fliess that he had decorated his study with two plaster replicas from Florence, which were a wellspring of rejuvenation and consolation for him. A few months later Fliess received from Freud an emotional interim summary of the self-analysis he had begun as one of the means of dealing with the loss of his father: “I have found, in my own case too, falling in love with the mother and jealousy of the father, and I now regard it as a universal event of early childhood.... If that is so, we can understand the riveting power of Oedipus Rex...”</p> \n<p>His father’s death did more than prompt Freud to embark on self-analysis; it transformed him from being a devotee of ancient cultures into a collector of their remnants.</p> \n<p>Once Freud started to listen to what was occurring in his patients’ inner world, with the aid of myths and images from humanity’s remote past, he apparently sought the physical presence of the heroes of antiquity in his room. “My old and dirty gods,” he called them. His collection, which grew apace from year to year, was compressed into the two studies in his apartment at Berggasse 19 in Vienna. Antiquities were not displayed anywhere else in his home.</p> \n<p>Among local antique dealers, Freud was known as a knowledgeable collector who would not be tempted into overpaying for an item. If he discovered that an object in his possession was inauthentic, he quickly got rid of it. Four decades later, the two rooms in his apartment were crammed with about 2,000 archaeological items. Amazingly, the Nazi authorities allowed Freud to leave Vienna in 1938 with his collection of antiquities in exchange for a trifling fine of 400 Reichsmarks and without confiscating even one object.</p> \n<p>The figurines and statuettes among which Freud spent most of the day helped him enter into the singular emotional and epistemic attitude for psychoanalytical listening. His non-neutral and non-sterile consulting room was an additional expression of the living, warm and involved presence of the physician of the mind, who saw no contradiction between a search for the truth concealed in the depths of the unconscious, and the need to accommodate uncertainty and to acknowledge the multiple facets and meanings that can accrue to every association raised by the patient.</p> \n<p>Among the antiquities in the collection are items directly connected to psychoanalytic theory – those that depict the myths of the sphinx and of Oedipus the king – along with others that Freud left shrouded in mystery. They added new layers and dimensions – spatial, visual, aesthetic, even tactile – to the highly developed verbal imagination of the inventor of the “talking cure.” Freud listens or writes and his finger caresses a statuette of the god Thoth – patron of medicine, witchcraft and writing in Egyptian mythology – in the form of a baboon. Occasionally he gets up and invites a patient to accompany him to the next room, to show her a statuette that their conversation evoked for him associatively.</p> \n<p>Keepers of the seal. The birth of the International Psychoanalytical Association in 1910 reflected the process of organization and expansion in which psychoanalysis was caught up in the years preceding World War I. But Freud, deeply disappointed with such brilliant pupils as Carl Gustav Jung, who rejected the cornerstones of his theoretical construct, sought a way to ensure a certain degree of agreement among his collaborators.</p> \n<p>Sandor Ferenczi, from Hungary, had an original proposal for ensuring the future of psychoanalysis: Freud himself would psychoanalyze a select group from among his students, and they would be the elite that would lead the psychoanalytic movement after his death. Freud preferred to accede to the suggestion of his British colleague Ernest Jones and formed a committee whose role would be to ensure that no member of the International Psychoanalytic Association would express public disagreement with the principal tenets of Freudian theory.</p> \n<p>Freud was undoubtedly ambivalent about the psychoanalytic oligarchy he had created with his own hands: He insisted that the committee’s existence be kept secret. The first time the its five members met, on May 25, 1913, Freud gave each of them a signet ring. And so, for more than a decade, and far from the eyes of the other members of the association, Freud’s five “knights of the sacred order” conducted regular correspondence and held secret meetings, whose declared purpose was to demarcate a clear boundary between psychoanalysis worthy of the name and other approaches.</p> \n<p>As functional as the “arrangements committee” of the psychoanalytic movement was, however, it would be no exaggeration to also fault this small band for the tendency of psychoanalysts in the post-Freud era to be drawn to the courts of psychoanalytic rebbes.</p> \n<p>The story of the “secret committee” is known to those familiar with the history of the psychoanalytic movement. In contrast, the story of the generous and demanding gifts that Freud gave his associates continues to be marked by collective repression to this day. Almost every analyst whom I told about the rings that Freud awarded to his successors reacted with a mixture of surprise, embarrassment and derisiveness. “Yes, right, he had a thing with rings. I knew that, but I never thought about it.” That’s the sound of repression.</p> \n<p>With this ring. In one of his passionate love letters to his fianc&eacute;e, Martha Bernays, Freud mentions a ring she received from her mother. The ring reminds Freud of the “fable of the rings” at the heart of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s play “Nathan the Wise.” He sums up for Martha the moral of the play; the question of whether a ring passed down as an inheritance is authentic or not, is of no significance. Based on this letter, Lessing’s fable of the ring can be seen as an additional source of inspiration for Freud in handing out the five rings. It wasn’t the only time that Freud played down a literary source of inspiration that was liable to underscore his Jewish origins.</p> \n<p>Lessing’s “Nathan the Wise,” which was published in 1799 and is set in the medieval Land of Israel, is considered a turning point in the relations between Jews and Germans. Nathan the Wise tells the sultan Saladin a fable about a ring that confers divine grace upon the person who wears it. The ring is passed down from father to best-loved son, and when it comes to a father with three sons all of whom he loves equally, he promises the ring to each of them. To keep his promise, the father creates two perfect copies of the original ring, so it is no longer possible to know which of the three is the authentic one. On his deathbed he awards one ring to each son and dies. The brothers argue among themselves about which of them received the real ring, but a wise judge warns them that it is impossible to make a decision, because no one can disprove the hypothesis that all three rings are actually counterfeit. The judge suggests that each of the sons should live his life as though he received the original ring from his father.</p> \n<p>Freud’s search for a preferred heir ended in bitter disappointment: Jung left the psychoanalytic movement about a year before the formation of the secret society. It’s plausible, then, that the implicit message in awarding non-identical rings to five pupils was that none of them was the “chosen son” and that they must keep watch over one another, overcome the tensions between them and function as lightning rods for the storms raging in the psychoanalytic world.</p> \n<p>Not one of the rings that Freud granted his knights of the sacred order was “real” in the fetishistic sense, and each was meant to derive its significance from its wearer; from whoever was willing to view it as a symbol of the love of psychoanalysis and not as a symbol of the love of the primal father of that discipline. The only person who saw the ring as a symbol of paternal love – and rightly so – was Anna Freud. She admitted to her father in one of her letters that she almost gave one of the two rings she received from him as a gift to the psychoanalyst who had helped her, Lou Andreas-Salome.</p> \n<p>The theatrical gesture embodied in the granting of the rings from Freud’s collection of ancient gems is certainly consistent with the authoritarianism latent in his personality. At the same time, it’s difficult to think of any gift other than an ancient signet ring that would better epitomize the dialectical tension between monolithic and diversified, between theoretical monotheism and cultural polytheism, and between radicalism and patriarchalism – all of which were revealed to everyone who was exposed to Freud’s personality and which continues to accompany psychoanalysis to this day.</p> \n<p>The creator of psychoanalysis didn’t really surround himself with yes-men. Each recipient of a ring was grateful to the genius who invented psychoanalysis but, when the time came, was able to find the right distance from him and claim his intellectual sovereignty. Jones would take the side of Melanie Klein in her dispute with Anna Freud, and didn’t hesitate to tell Freud his doubts about the quality of the analysis he conducted on his daughter. Otto Rank left the psychoanalytic movement, immigrated to America and is remembered as one of the most crazed short-term therapists that modern psychotherapy has known.</p> \n<p>Sandor Ferenczi placed psychoanalysis on a pre-Oedipal path that underscores the connection with the mother in early childhood, and challenges the fundamentals of Freud’s psychoanalytic technique. And Karl Abraham, who died prematurely, saw himself as Freud’s intellectual equal and expressed his sovereignty in a series of innovative articles. Even Max Eitingon, whose loyalty to the professor was unbounded, found a way to part from him. In 1933, shortly after the Nazis came to power, he emigrated from Berlin to Palestine, to Freud’s displeasure, and founded a new psychoanalytical society in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Psychoanalytic object. A certain tension prevailed in the room of the exhibition’s curators, Morag Wilhelm and Dudi Mevorach, after I tried on the ring found in the Israel Museum’s storerooms, which turned out to be the one Freud gave to a patient, the analyst Eva Rosenfeld. Until that moment I had observed the objects owned by Freud with equanimity. I’d always preferred the Freud house in Vienna over the Freud house in London. Hardly any items from his estate remain in the Vienna apartment where he lived and worked for most of his life, but his spirit pervades it to this day. I like working in the library in one of the rooms in the apartment. A visitor will find Freud’s walking cane on display there, and one of his hats. The two stereotypical museum artifacts that were given to the Vienna museum as a gift by Anna Freud only underscore what happened when Austria was annexed to the Third Reich. Freud doesn’t live here anymore.</p> \n<p>It is the elegant home in Hampstead where Freud spent his last year that contains all his personal effects. The crowning glories of the London house are the library, the study and the splendid collection of antiquities, all of them a gesture to the great person that Freud was. But the London museum, which “hit the jackpot,” comes across more as homage to Freud’s ego ideal and particularly to the father ideal of Anna Freud, who managed her father’s memorial industry with a high hand.</p> \n<p>I ran my fingers across the ring bearing the image of Nike, the goddess of victory, that Rosenfeld bequeathed to the Israel Museum, and which curator Wilhelm only recently identified as a Freud ring. The magic began to do its work, as in the “Indiana Jones” stories in which an ordinary object that was in a type of deep sleep is uncovered and is revealed to wield great influence. Psychoanalysis – a familiar inner object that has accompanied me for many years – and the ring – a foreign object I placed on my finger for a brief moment – became one. The foreign object and the internalized object merged.</p> \n<p>Psychoanalysts frequently reflect on the question of what the object of psychoanalysis is, or what a psychoanalytic object is. Can it be that questions relating to the nature of mental representations, and to the location, in reality or in fantasy, of primary objects – theoretical and clinical questions that occupied Freud during the years of his self-analysis, when he began to collect antiquities – impelled him to create rings from ancient seal stones in his collection? Is it possible that Freud already knew the answer to this, too? That precisely an old-new object like a signet ring, which would be passed from one generation of analysts to the next and would end up one day in Jerusalem, would turn out to be more appropriate than any manuscript, hat or cane to act as a ferry that would transmit something of the quality of the psychoanalytic object that feels most at home in the unconscious, that is, in a foreign country?</p> \n<p>A further hint about the meaning of the rings can be found in a letter that Eva Rosenfeld attached to her donation to the museum: “On January 5, 1930, which was my 38th birthday, Professor Sigmund Freud surprised me with the precious gift of his ring […] Throughout the years, the ring has been a very precious possession of mine. I am now getting on for 86, and I wish to leave it to the country which is our original home.” Rosenfeld, like Freud, never visited this country. Her choice to send the ring she received from Freud “home,” to Jerusalem, can be interpreted as an expression of a wish to restore it to the unconscious.</p> \n<p>Dr. Eran Rolnik is a psychoanalyst, psychiatrist and historian.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The saying that “insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results” has been attributed to several people over the years, including Albert Einstein. Now, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ latest report on the spectrum of options to help protect Palestinians seems like a perfect illustration of that statement.</p> \n<p>Guterres focused on four options:</p> \n<p>1) A more robust UN presence on the ground with more UN human rights, political and coordination experts to strengthen UN prevention capabilities and increase the organization's visibility&nbsp;</p> \n<p>2) Additional resources to strengthen UN programs and humanitarian and development assistance to address Palestinian needs</p> \n<p>3) Civilian observers, based on a UN or non-UN observer mission, with a mandate to report on the protection of Palestinian civilians</p> \n<p>4) Physical protection with an armed UN military or police force.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Hamas is desperate for a deal with Israel. Here’s proof | Opinion</p> \n<p>Over the years the Palestinians have been one of the major recipients of international aid; indeed, it has been argued that the Palestinians receive one of the highest levels of aid in the world. The expectation that adding more money for the protection of Palestinians to the equation would change the situation seems unrealistic, if only due to different needs of Gaza and the West Bank. The former requires an immediate humanitarian plan of action, and they both need a long-term development program for infrastructure, job creation and enhancement of democratic institutions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>From donor fatigue, to concerns regarding how the aid is distributed, more money will likely just mean more of the same.</p> \n<p>With over 100 international organizations on the ground and a robust UN presence based mostly in Jerusalem, the UN has senior political players such as the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov (UNSCO), the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), professional organizations like the World Food Programme and the usual alphabet soup of UN and international non-governmental organizations. Needless to say, all the international organizations act as advocates for the Palestinians, and are extremely visible, despite what the UN chief may say.</p> \n<p>The idea of civilian observers is also not new in our region. In Hebron, after the 1994 massacre of Palestinians by Baruch Goldstein, a Temporary International Presence in Hebron was established to guarantee the safety and protection of Palestinian civilians. Its mandate was revised over the years and its current one was determined in the Hebron Agreement in 1997, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>The force was established to guarantee the safety and protection of Palestinian civilians, the same logic and goals as the one the UN is now suggesting for Gaza. The problems of the one-sided mandate of such organizations can be clearly seen following the recent reports of a TIPH observer slashing tires of an Israeli vehicle, or a video that circulated of an observer slapping an Israeli settler child.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Finally, the idea of a UN military or police force to deter or protect civilians is useless in the Palestinian arena due to the already highly politicized reality. Israel has learned that it cannot depend on international forces like UNIFIL and UNDOF for its security concerns. When things get tough, these forces seem to only focus on Israeli violations, repeatedly failing to gain Israel’s faith or confidence in their contribution.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When the UN secretary general highlights another one-sided mandate focused only on Palestinian civilians, he once again makes the body he represents irrelevant for Israel. The Israeli civilians targeted by Hamas’ rockets and tunnels and the weekly Hamas-initiated and planned confrontations at the Gaza border fence, which result in unfortunate and unnecessary deaths, also need to be considered.</p> \n<p>When the UN ignores Hamas as a strategic regional actor – one that runs Gaza, uses the Strip as a staging ground for terrible, indiscriminate attacks, and abuses its civilians by making them into human shields, I would ask: What is the UN doing to protect the Palestinians in Gaza from Hamas?</p> \n<p>Lieutenant Colonel (ret.)

        "text":["<p>&quot;There are now in the world more than ten million Jews, about three-quarters of whom are in Russia, Poland, the Balkan States, and Turkey. If the movement toward Palestine should get the impulse that the Hirsch committee is able to give it, an imaginative person can conceive of the country's doubling or trebling its Jewish population before the close of our century&quot; - Zion's Watchtower&nbsp;1892, Nov. 1, p.329.</p> \n<p>Theodor Herzl published his pamphlet &quot;Der Judenstaat&quot; in 1896 and, two years later, organized the world's First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland. But in fact the notion of a Jewish state in Palestine had been making the rounds in European and American Christian circles, in various forms. One of its keenest proponents was a Christian preacher and Bible scholar named Charles Taze Russell (1852-1916).</p> \n<p>The proposition boldly put forward by Pastor Russell contrasted with the position of many Christian churches at the time, where the feeling was that God's covenant with the Jews had long since ended and they should convert to Christianity.</p> \n<p>The prescient pastor predicted a massive exodus of Jews from Russia and Eastern Europe. Much as he predicted, by 1924 more than 3 million Jews had emigrated from Russia and Eastern Europe. Russell himself did not live long enough to see his prophecy made manifest, dying in 1916.</p> \n<p>Russell's legacy as an enthusiastic, non-proselytizing Zionist has been acknowledged by none other than the incumbent prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, who said, “A recognition of Pastor Russell's important role as an early American Christian advocate of Zionism is long overdue.” The late Jeane Kirkpatrick, former the U.S. ambassador to the UN, called Russell a “neglected man and chapter in the history of Zionism.”</p> \n<p>Who was this forgotten father of Zionism, and why would he promote Zionism in the first place?</p> \n<p>In the aftermath of civil war</p> \n<p>In the mid-19th century, when covered wagons still rolled across the open plains carrying settlers to remote sectors of America, when vast herds of buffalo still roamed the range, Charles Taze Russell was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania on February 16, 1852. He was the second son of Joseph L. and Ann Eliza Russell, both of Scottish-Irish descent.</p> \n<p>Russell's mother died when he was nine years old. At 11, Charles entered a business partnership with his father, the youngster himself writing the articles of agreement under which their enterprise operated. At 15 he and his father were running a flourishing men's clothing chain with shops in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and more.</p> \n<p>Russell's formative years were colored by the devastating Civil War that ravaged America from 1861 to 1865, followed by an era of rapid industrialization. In 1869 the first transcontinental railway was completed. Come the the 1870's, electric light and the telephone came onto &nbsp;the scene. The electric streetcar would arrive in the 1880's, and by the century's end, a few automobiles would be noisily proclaiming their presence.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On the intellectual front, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, described in his 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species,&quot; had for the first time seriously challenged the Roman Catholic Church's version of history, giving rise to spin-off churches and creeds.</p> \n<p>Going back to basics</p> \n<p>This setting of breakneck development and intellectual progress is where Russell founded the Bible Student Association, which aspired to go back to basics by studying the Bible itself.</p> \n<p>Soon a class for systematic Bible Study was formed in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and in 1879 Charles Taze Russell was elected its pastor. The movement founded Zion's Watch Tower, the most widely circulated magazine in the world today,&nbsp;according to Business Insider, with an average of 70 million copies a month in 334 languages. For comparison, National Geographic has a circulation of something over 6 million and is published in 25 different languages.</p> \n<p>A few years later, in 1881, Russell was elected the first president of the Watchtower Society. Its purpose was to distribute his teachings in the form of tracts.</p> \n<p>Russell was a prolific writer, and his major accomplishments include a six-volume series of systematic theology, &quot;Studies in the Scriptures.&quot; By 1909 this series was one of most widely circulated works in the world, surpassed only by the Bible and The Chinese Almanac.</p> \n<p>His crowning achievement at that phase was &quot;The Photo-Drama of Creation,&quot; a ground-breaking innovation that combined sound and color in a motion picture for the first time in history. The film was, viewed by more then eight million people, an astronomical success in the terms of the times.</p> \n<p>In 1909 Russell moved The Watch Tower Society Headquarters to 124 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn Heights. It would remain there until 2016, when Jared Kushner, son-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump, bought the property.</p> \n<p>Early advocate&nbsp; of Zionism</p> \n<p>On August 18, 1891, now in Jerusalem, Russell wrote to the philanthropists Baron Maurice de Hirsch and Baron Edmond de Rothschild, or as he puts it “the two leading Hebrews of the world.” No less, he put forward a practical plan for Zionism.</p> \n<p>It &nbsp;involved purchasing all government-owned land in Palestine, i.e., land not held by private owners, from the impoverished Ottoman Empire. Years later Herzl would make similar proposals. &nbsp;(A copy of the letter is published in &quot;Zion's Watchtower and Herald of Christ's Presence&quot;, December 1891, pp. 170-171.)</p> \n<p>“As you will see from my books, we find the testimony of the prophets to be, that your nation will be greatly blessed and return to divine favor between now and the year 1915, A.D.,&quot; Russell wrote. The persecutions that Jews were suffering in Russia were &quot;a mark of divine favor rather then the reverse,&quot; the pastor suggested - and it would only get worse because the Lord's purpose was to drive the Jews &quot;out of all lands whither he has scattered them.&quot;</p> \n<p>To where? To Palestine, as apparently indicated by the prophet (Jeremiah 32:37-44; 33:6-22), Russell explained. Owning not an inch of that land, he had no vested interest, the pastor elaborated, and went on: &quot;My suggestion is that the wealthy Hebrews purchase from Turkey, at a fair valuation, all of her property interest in these lands: i.a., all of the Government lands (lands not held by private owners), under the provision that Syria and Palestine shall be constituted a FREE STATE…&quot;</p> \n<p>In his letter, Russell delicately gibes at alternative &quot;Jewish homeland&quot; ideas touted at the time in places other than Israel, though Baron de Hirsch was actually involved in resettling Jews elsewhere: &quot;But please note, my dear Sir, that the sacred Scriptures predict the return to Palestine, and not a further wandering to the ends of the earth—to America or elsewhere. And, therefore, it is my humble opinion that Israel will find no rest for the sole of his foot until he finds the land of promise; and I pray you, therefore, not to waste your efforts in assisting emigration elsewhere, but concentrate them in the direction where God has indicated success…”</p> \n<p>We cannot know whether he even replied to Russell, let alone be influenced by him. But a month after Russell's letter to the barons, on September 11th 1891, Baron Hirsch founded the Jewish Colonization Association to buy land, principally in North and South America but in Palestine too, where agricultural colonies could be established and resettled by Jews who were persecuted in Russia.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the pastor's message did not go unnoticed in the broader Jewish communities of the United States and Europe.</p> \n<p>Russell's Yiddish newspaper</p> \n<p>In 1910 Pastor Russell received a letter from a committee of Jewish leaders:</p> \n<p>&quot;Dear Sir: Your Sympathetic interest in the Jewish people for years past has not escaped our notice. Your denunciation of the atrocities perpetrated against our race in the name of Christianity has added to our conviction that you are a sincere friend,&quot; wrote the committee members.</p> \n<p>&quot;Your discourse on “Jerusalem and Jewish Hopes” has struck a responsive chord in the hearts of many of our people. Still we doubted for a time if any Christian minister could really be interested in a Jew as a Jew and merely from a hope of proselyting him…You may well understand how surprised we are to find a Christian minister acknowledging that there are prophecies of the Bible still fulfilled, which belong to the Jew and not to the Christian…</p> \n<p>&quot;These things, Pastor Russell, have led to the formation of a Jewish Mass Meeting Committee, which by this letter, request you to give a public discourse,&quot; they concluded.</p> \n<p>The pastor acceded and on October 9, 1910 gave a talk titled “Zionism in Prophecy” before an audience of about 4,000 Jews at the Hippodrome, New York's largest and finest auditorium at the time.</p> \n<p>As The New York American reported on that day, “The unusual spectacle of 4,000 Hebrews enthusiastically applauding a Gentile preacher, after having listened to a sermon he addressed to them concerning their own religion…where Pastor Russell, the famous head of the Brooklyn Tabernacle conducted a most unusual service. It was not long before all reserve, and all possible doubt of Pastor Russell’s entire sincerity and friendliness were worn away. Then the mention of the name of a great leader [Herzl] who, the speaker declared, had been raised by God for the cause -- brought a burst of applause.&quot;</p> \n<p>Russell held similar mass meetings in Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City and Cincinnati. In England he addressed 4,600 Jews in London's Royal Albert Hall, following which he appeared in Glasgow and Manchester, then gave talks in other European cities with large Jewish populations, including Vienna, Berlin, Krakow and Budapest.</p> \n<p>Make no mistake, his speeches got a mixed reception. After Russell had left one meeting, three Jewish groups got into such a row that 46 policemen were called to disperse them. A Jewish rabbi in New York who fiercely opposed Russell influenced his associates in Austria-Hungary to resist plans for meetings addressing Jews.</p> \n<p>However, the Herzl Year Book provides statistics of the printed preaching on the subject of Judaism and Zionism, which appeared in 107,000 copies of Anglo-Jewish newspapers and weeklies, and in 650,000 copies of the Yiddish Press. Russell even published a Yiddish-language paper of his own, Die Shtimme - &quot;the voice&quot;.</p> \n<p>Separate covenants</p> \n<p>Why would a devout Christian minister invest so much in advocating the idea of a national homeland for the Jews?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In May 26, 1911, Jacob De Haas, editor of the Boston Jewish Advocate and a personal confidant of Herzl, published an article in the Jewish Advocate praising Russell as a “Philo-semite” with no desire to convert the Jews.</p> \n<p>But question of Russell's motivation doesn't lead to philo-Semitism necessarily: &nbsp;rather it goes to the prophecies of restoration delivered to ancient Israel by prophets in the Bible&nbsp; (Jeremiah 30:18; 31-8-10; Amos 9:14,15; Romans 22:25,26).</p> \n<p>&quot;And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them&quot; - Amos 9:14, for example</p> \n<p>Russell was confident that these verses would be fulfilled and that God would restore the Jews to Palestine. In November 1892 he wrote in Zion's Watch Tower: &quot;There are now in the world more than ten million Jews, about three-quarters of whom are in Russia, Poland, the Balkan States, and Turkey. If the movement toward Palestine should get the impulse that the Hirsch committee is able to give it, an imaginative person can conceive of the country's doubling or trebling its Jewish population before the close of our century, and of its having a larger Jewish population fifty years hence than it had in ancient times, when its census ran up to three millions. Should the restoration be accomplished, all hail to the New Jerusalem!&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He also believed that God had a separate covenant with the Jews and a different covenant with Christians, writign in the Watch Tower, in January 1909, page 28: “The more closely we investigate the New Covenant, the more we must be convinced of this fact - that it belongs to Israel alone.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These were the sentiments on which Russell's advocacy of Zionism was based. While he may not have lived to see the fulfillment of his wishes, his legacy continued.</p> \n<p>He died in 1916. In 1925, his successor Judge Joseph F. Rutherford wrote the book &quot;Comfort for the Jews.&quot;</p> \n<p>Rutherford is rather more renowned for founding Jehovah's Witnesses, a religious group that emerged from Russell's Bible Student Movement.</p> \n<p>Before Russell, no Anglo-Jewish newspapers or Yiddish press had carried articles by a Christian minister. When he died on October 31, 1916, the Herzl Year Book observed:&quot;Russell himself, according to the testimony of the American Jewish Press from the years 1910 to 1916, maintained excellent and friendly relations with the leaders of American Jewry to his last days.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>WATERBURY, VERMONT – It’s been 50 years, but Christine Hallquist hasn’t forgotten the blows she used to get on the way to school, at school and on the way home. “The boys would hit me because I was effeminate and didn’t get involved with sports,” she tells me in a small caf&eacute; in this northern Vermont town. Three days earlier, she’d made history by winning the Democratic primary to become the party’s nominee for governor of the state of Vermont, in the election this November. Should she win, she would be the first transgender governor in U.S. history.</p> \n<p>The nuns and clerics in the Catholic school she attended, growing up in upstate New York, also had no patience for the unusual boy, then named Dave, who bugged them with irritating questions. “There was a lesson where we were taught about the difference between all kinds of sins,” recalls Hallquist, “and I asked what was meant by a venial [lesser] sin. Instead of answering, the nuns hit me with a ruler just because I dared to ask questions.”</p> \n<p>Hallquist, now 62, wasn’t out to foment a religious revolt with her questions. Perhaps it’s her sensitivity and the exceptional personal story of someone who felt, when growing up, like a woman imprisoned in a man’s body that sparked her inner urge to cross boundaries from an early age.</p> \n<p>“When I was a girl, we never talked about gays and lesbians, not at home and definitely not in the Catholic school,” she says. “It just didn’t come up. Gay people were in the closet, nobody even knew what&nbsp;a transgender person was, these people had to live in the shadows.”</p> \n<p>In eighth grade, the school’s senior cleric called Dave's parents to say that their son needed to undergo a religious rite to exorcise the demons in his head.</p> \n<p>“And here’s what a loving parent does,” she recalls now. “The Church said I needed an exorcism, and my parents said to them: ‘There is nothing wrong with our child.’ And they pulled my whole family out of Catholic school and sent us to public school. The good news is that in public school, I did not get beaten by the teachers.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, the beatings by students continued, for about a year. “By then I had learned how to act like a man,” she notes. “When&nbsp;I got to ninth grade, I realized I needed to act like a man, toughen up, be like a man, otherwise my schoolmates might even kill me. I took up running and skiing, and I was tough and scrappy. I became an intellectual terrorist – I used my intellect to beat people up. But I also got physical, until nobody ever bothered me again.”</p> \n<p>Even today, she could be considered by the conservative Christian religious establishment to be the personification of the ultimate sin, defying the act of divine creation. But Hallquist emphasizes that even after all the changes she’s undergone, she sees herself as a religiously observant woman who believes wholeheartedly in the Trinity of God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. “I never stopped believing in Jesus,” she says, adding, “But I also recognized that I am very much a person of science. The beauty of humans is that we can have faith and science in the same brain. Faith is not based on any science at all, faith is somewhat irrational.”</p> \n<p>She refuses to forgive the nuns who abused her in school. Her faith, she says, boils down to three words: “God is love.” Accordingly, “I evaluate everything based on those three words. Is this a loving act? If it’s a loving act, then you are doing the work of God. If it is hatred, murder, anything that deviates from love – it is bad.&nbsp;And what the nuns did to me was in no way a religious act. I remember, in eighth grade, after the teacher beat my head against the blackboard, I said, in front of all the students, ‘Forgive her, God, because she does not know who I am.’”</p> \n<p>Now just about everyone in the United States, and many across the Western world, knows who Hallquist is. This November 6, she has a good chance to become the first trans state governor in American history. To accomplish that, she will have to defeat the incumbent Republican governor, Phil Scott. But, she says, “After transitioning from man to woman, everything looks a lot easier to me.”</p> \n<p>Hiding from life</p> \n<p>Hallquist grew up as one of seven children in a Catholic family in the small town of Baldwinsville, in northwestern New York State, some four-and-a-half hours from Manhattan. After high school she attended Mohawk Valley Community College, in Utica, New York, and at the age of 20 moved to Vermont. She started her professional career as an engineer at IBM, then entered a training program at the University of Massachusetts to become an electrical engineer. In 2000, after working as an engineer and a consultant for several small companies, she joined the Vermont Electric Cooperative – a consumer-owned company providing power to much of northern Vermont – and served as its CEO for 12 years.</p> \n<p>She always knew she was different. “I remember that when I was 7, all the boys were interested in this girl, because I guess she was cute,” she relates. “But I just wanted to know what her perfume was, so I immediately realized that I was different from the rest of the boys because I was interested in the feminine things. I had another friend whose parents owned a women’s clothing store, so I was able to try things on and played dress-up, and I actually took clothes home.” &nbsp;</p> \n<p>And all this time your parents didn’t notice anything?</p> \n<p>“When I was about 11 years old, I got my mother to dress me up as Little Red Riding Hood for Halloween, and I remember how good it felt. I told her that I wanted to be a girl, and she said, ‘Never say that to anybody.’ I don’t think she understood, but she just realized that it was dangerous for me to say things like that. But you know, later on, when I was a teenager, I realized that they put people in mental institutions at that time for wanting to be a girl. My mother just wanted to protect me, as a good mother does.”</p> \n<p>From that point on, Hallquist says she went into a mode of repression. “I just knew I wanted to be a girl. And I knew that was not even in the realm of possibility and that I had to hide from my life and act like a man, which was what I did.”</p> \n<p>Didn’t that lead to great frustration or to an inner crisis – the need to be in denial all the time?</p> \n<p>“No. It was just like, okay, something unusual, I can live with it. I used to say to myself that sometimes people have serious things happen to them, maybe they lose their limbs. So you’ve got everything, you should be grateful. And believe me, I was grateful. I had a very successful career, three wonderful children, a wonderful wife, living in a beautiful state. So I am very grateful.”</p> \n<p>Hallquist has been married to Pat for 38 years. She’s careful to leave Pat out of the election campaign, and when she talks about her, something in her face softens. “Love is a beautiful thing,” she declares. “Before I met my wife, I thought the most important thing was to be the smartest person in the world. But she taught me something that is more important, and that is to simply be a loving person.”</p> \n<p>And you love her?</p> \n<p>“Yes, absolutely. I will take care of her until the end of time.”</p> \n<p>Does she loves you?</p> \n<p>“Yes. Even though she wishes Dave was back. It’s hard for her.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How did she find out about you?</p> \n<p>“Six years after we were married, she discovered my stash of women’s clothing and asked me about it. I explained that I always wanted to be a woman, and she thought it was something that would pass. She said, ‘I don’t care, I just don’t want to see it and I don’t want anyone else to see it.’ She didn’t marry a woman, she married a man.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Was there no drama or crying?</p> \n<p>“Not really. Some men like to hunt; her man just liked to dress up.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Is it true that Pat limited you to wearing women’s clothing for only two hours a day, and only when you played the piano? Looking back, aren’t you angry at the regimen she imposed on you?</p> \n<p>“Well, let’s call that a contractual agreement. She was afraid for me. It was truly a loving response on her part, she was afraid of what would happen to me if I went public with it. I found the piano almost like meditation; playing it was a time of reflection and peace for me. So we incorporated the dressing as a woman with that. It worked, and it was enough for me for quite a few years.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The conspiracy of silence lasted 14 years, until in 2000, after 20 years of marriage, there was a watershed moment from which there was no going back: “Twenty years into our marriage, I discovered on the internet that there was a whole community of people out there like me. And that’s when I learned what the term ‘transgender’ means – I didn’t even know the word existed until the year 2000.”</p> \n<p>She started to attend meetings of trans people. “I told Pat that I wanted to join these groups, and that’s when she realized things were changing. And I also told her that I couldn’t live with taking this secret to my grave. It’s one thing if you think you are the only person with this experience, then it’s okay to take it to your grave, because there’s nothing to learn from it. But when I realized there was a whole group of people out there, it becomes an injustice.”</p> \n<p>Why?</p> \n<p>“Because these people are living in the shadows and they deserve to live in the light. And I immediately felt an obligation to that community.”</p> \n<p>Hallquist decided to share the secret with her children, who until that moment were unaware of it. They told her that, in retrospect, there had been a few signs that could have hinted at the truth. “For example, whenever we were at a family gathering, I was always with the women, never with the men; you would find me in the kitchen with the women, just naturally. So the men would be watching some sports game and I was going to be with the women. And, you know, the women had more fun.”</p> \n<p>The next stage, after the conversation with the children, was family counseling. That went on for three years and was meant to prepare the family for the phase of acceptance of the upheaval and the public transition from Dave to Christine. “Our family grew closer, everyone grew closer, through this,” she says with a smile, “because that’s what unconditional love is.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>She describes the process of going public in terms of a military operation. Her senior post in the state’s electric cooperative had made her a well-known figure, a regular participant in business forums and the dominant figure in the professional life of dozens of employees. Clearly, she needed to take a cautious approach, as this was a big story in local terms.</p> \n<p>“I gave one TV station an exclusive interview and I gave a newspaper an exclusive interview, on condition that both interviews would be available to the public at the same time in that month, September 2015,” she recalls. “In July, I started calling people in the company and preparing them, and I called people nationally, because I was in a couple of national organizations. I contacted everybody in my business community ahead of time, to let them know that the story was coming out in September, when Pride Week was held. So that’s when I publicly transitioned.”</p> \n<p>Furthermore, as of that December 21, she told them, she wanted everyone to address her as a woman. Nearly all the responses were positive, she says now.</p> \n<p>I spent two hours with Hallquist in that small-town caf&eacute;. She seemed to enjoy the popularity that she hopes will pave her way to the governorship. Nearly all the customers came over to shake her hand, congratulate her on her impressive win in the primary and wish her success. Even people unfamiliar with her personal story would have a hard time overlooking her presence. On the one hand, she wears obviously feminine clothing and is heavily made up, but she also has a very muscular body.</p> \n<p>Hallquist takes pride in that contrast. “My daughters give me a hard time about it, like, ‘You have to lose those muscles now’ – but I don’t want to lose those muscles, I like those muscles! Just consider me a strong woman.&nbsp;Before the campaign, I was at the gym three days a week and I would lift 90 pounds in weights and I ran four miles every three or four days, so I was in good shape. And I wasn’t about to give that up. I am not trying to look like a woman; I am a transgender woman.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Do you plan to undergo surgery or treatments?</p> \n<p>“I’m at peace now. Being happy is not my goal. I will be happy when the world is at peace. And when everybody is treated with decency and love and respect, then I will be happy. I feel good. I love it when these trolls call me ugly – I’m 62, I’m allowed to be ugly, get over it. I have no intention of undergoing surgery, it’s a waste of time and energy. I do take estrogen, which is supposed to provide some level of feminization. But the only effect seems to be that it definitely makes me cry more.”</p> \n<p>Emerging from the ‘cocoon’</p> \n<p>Hallquist’s win is probably the most spectacular example of the historic wave of victories of diverse, non-traditional candidates that has swept the Democratic Party primaries. Some would interpret this as a response to the conservative, divisive and, in the view of many, racist presidency of Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>Hallquist joins two more women who made history in the party. Ilhan Omar, a Muslim of Somali origin and a member of the Minnesota state legislature, won her party’s primary for U.S. Congress, and, by all assessments, is set to defeat her Republican rival, Jennifer Zielinski, in November. If that happens, as the analysts are predicting, Omar will be one of the first two Muslim women in the U.S. House of Representatives. The other will be Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American, who earlier won the Democratic primary in a Michigan district where she will run unopposed.</p> \n<p>Tlaib, the eldest of 14 children, is the daughter of a Palestinian father from Beit Hanina, an East Jerusalem neighborhood, and of a mother who grew up in Beit Ur al-Fauqa, near Ramallah. And there’s also Jahana Hayes, who won the primary in her district in Connecticut and, if elected, will be the first black woman to represent that state in the House.</p> \n<p>To them we can add Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who perhaps provided the biggest surprise of all in the current round of primaries. An unknown 28-year-old field activist of Puerto Rican descent, Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, stunned the country by defeating Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent, for the nomination in New York’s 14th Congressional district on June 26.</p> \n<p>All told, no fewer than 90 candidates of Muslim origin and another 200 transgender people are running for public office across the United States, at both the local and the national levels.</p> \n<p>But Hallquist, as she made clear repeatedly in our conversation, has no intention of becoming the face of a social movement and is unwilling to be tagged in terms of her gender identity. “I am here to be the voice of Vermont,” she asserts, not of the LGBT community and not the trans community. In reply to a question about how, if at all, she will work to improve the situation of the transgender community, which has felt under constant threat since Trump’s victory two years ago, she says simply, “The best thing I can do for the transgender community is being successful, as governor.”</p> \n<p>Are you willing to accept the definition of “liberal” or “Democratic,” or are they also irrelevant in your view?</p> \n<p>“That’s why I’m glad I had nothing to do with politics, because what you’re talking about is a construct of politics. The attempt to divide us by labeling us Republicans and Democrats is a strategy that started with Ronald Reagan, and it was really a systematic attack on the working class. I will never accept a label personally. Providing people with a living wage and with health care isn’t a matter of Democratic or Republican, it’s something a civilized society does.”</p> \n<p>Don’t you think that the fact you’re a trans person played a part in your primary victory?</p> \n<p>“I don’t think my win has anything to do with my being transgender. The people of Vermont chose me because of the plight of the two-thirds of them who live in rural farming areas. That’s a phenomenon that goes beyond Vermont. What’s happening in Vermont is happening across rural America. We’re seeing increasing rates of poverty,&nbsp;we’re seeing people fleeing to the cities and we’re seeing an aging demographic, meaning we’re losing our young people.”</p> \n<p>You need to be familiar with Vermont politics to understand why Hallquist is so determined not to be tagged along party lines. In many ways, this is a state of opposites. On the one hand, Vermont is one the most liberal states in America – in 2016, it gave Hillary Clinton one of her largest victories over Trump. But it’s also a state that supports the almost-unrestricted right to bear arms, and its residents buy weapons the way people elsewhere buy shoes.</p> \n<p>Hallquist, who says she was never attracted to “masculine” pastimes such as ball games or hunting, nonetheless admits that she herself possesses no fewer than six licensed firearms. “Well,” she explains, “my son wanted to hunt, and people gave me guns, and somehow I ended up with a few more than I needed.” In Vermont, she adds, “We never thought of those guns as killing machines. If you look at our politics, this gun issue is really recent. We’re seeing these mass shootings, and that’s certainly new to our culture.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So you have no problem with the state’s gun laws?</p> \n<p>“I support common-sense gun laws. We’ve already passed two gun laws in the legislature this year, which make it possible to take weapons away from people who are at risk to themselves or others. That’s a mechanism that will take time to complete and to set clear criteria for, but if elected I will work to determine the procedures and parameters. The second thing is background checks for everyone who wants to purchase a weapon, and I would also support any additional legislation that would ban the sale or possession of assault weapons, because we don’t need assault weapons to hunt. In fact, automatic weapons are very poor for hunting, because they’re not accurate.”</p> \n<p>It was only earlier this year that Hallquist says she decided to enter politics. “After Trump’s election, I was in a bit of denial, because I thought Vermont is a wonderful state, it’s a loving state, I believed we were in a cocoon in Vermont and were protected from those negative headwinds coming out of Washington.&nbsp;But at the end of 2017, we started to see white supremacist activity in Vermont. We haven’t seen that since 1983, and in 1983 it totally failed.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The turning point was an event known as the “March for the Future” that was held in Vermont in January. “I heard these four young women do slam poetry – they were high-school seniors, they called themselves ‘Muslim Girls Making Change,’ and they talked about what it was like to be Muslim in Vermont. They talked about the bias they face every day here in Vermont in their schools and it brought me to tears, and that’s the moment I decided I would run for governor.&nbsp;I will do everything I can to make sure Vermont remains a loving state and a beacon to the rest of the country of what good democracy looks like.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How dangerous do you think Trump is?</p> \n<p>“After Trump won, I thought maybe America would revolt against this bigoted despot, but things just continued to get worse. Nobody called him on his bigotry, nobody called him on his hatred, nobody called him on his divisiveness. He is using the tactics of an autocratic leader from the Third World. I’m hoping that a couple of years from now we’ll be proudly flying the American flag, saying, ‘Isn’t it wonderful that our democracy has survived a despot!’ Because we will turn this around.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>She talks about the desire to restore America to its days of glory, but is vehemently opposed to the Trumpian slogan, “Make America great again.”</p> \n<p>Hallquist: “I’ll never say I’m great, because that implies that I’ve made it and I don’t need to do any more.&nbsp;America’s always been aspirational. Our greatness comes from continuing to improve in providing justice and opportunity for all.&nbsp;I wouldn’t say, ‘Make Christine great again’ – when the hell was I ever great?”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“Since I’ve started this job, I ask myself every morning whether abolishing the Jewish Agency would be a good or bad thing,” says Isaac Herzog. Conveniently for him – since he’s just left the Knesset and become the Agency’s new chairman – he’s reached the conclusion that it would be “a tragedy for anyone who believes in the centrality of Israel to the dialogue between what I call Jerusalem and Babylon.”</p> \n<p>Three and a half years ago, Herzog was on the brink of causing a massive political upset when his Zionist Union alliance was, in the polls at least, leading Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud on the eve of the 2015 parliamentary election. But instead of unseating Netanyahu – who then kept him waiting for the next two years for a national-unity government in which he would have received the Foreign Ministry as his consolation prize – he was unceremoniously dumped by his political party, Labor, which in July 2017 elected newcomer Avi Gabbay as its new leader.</p> \n<p>Herzog’s appointment as head of the largest Jewish organization in the world is a belated victory of sorts over Netanyahu – the first time the Agency has voted for a chairman from a rival party to that of Israel’s sitting prime minister. Netanyahu didn’t even issue a statement congratulating the new chairman.</p> \n<p>But it’s also a final concession of defeat for Herzog: he’s never going to be prime minister.</p> \n<p>This being Herzog, the man with the most impeccable manners in Israeli politics, he bears his defeat with grace. No longer the leader of the opposition, but now the man in charge of what he calls the “bridge between Israel and the Jewish people,” he can’t call out Netanyahu in his first interview since becoming chairman. At least, he tries not to, by not mentioning him explicitly by name.</p> \n<p>“Unlike the person who claims that the Diaspora will disappear in two generations, I claim that Babylon, the Diaspora, contains great intellectual and spiritual and Jewish wealth in its own right,” says Herzog. But the person who has repeatedly been quoted as privately predicting the disappearance of the Diaspora – more specifically, the liberal American-Jewish section of the Diaspora – is the prime minister of Israel.</p> \n<p>Inevitably, when Herzog lists the threats imperiling the bridge between Israel and the Diaspora (including the religious controversy between Orthodox Judaism in Israel and progressive Jews in America), he mentions the “massive political tension that’s hovering over the relationship, because of the voices within the American-Jewish community who oppose President [Donald] Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu.”</p> \n<p>But how can the Jewish Agency chairman rebuild the Israel-Diaspora relationship when the prime minister seems to be doing everything possible to sabotage it?</p> \n<p>“You’re dragging me into a minefield, I’ll tell you frankly,” Herzog responds. “Look, until not long ago I was leader of the opposition and Netanyahu’s biggest critic. And, clearly, I said then that I’m a better alternative – for those in Israel and the Diaspora as well. And yet I’m trying to explain to everyone that we have to respect Israeli democracy and the will of the voters.”</p> \n<p>Maybe that’s the deeper issue. After all, liberal Jews aren’t disputing the results of successive Israeli elections. They simply don’t like the motives of Israelis voting for right-wing governments. Herzog realizes this, and believes it can be confronted.</p> \n<p>“You can’t express your political frustration against the basic concept of the Jewish people’s nation-state,” he says. “It’s much deeper: Jewish life and the historical continuum – not to mention the immense national challenge that Israel was founded to answer. And I want to do everything to ensure its safe existence for generations. But support for Israel has to be way beyond affection for this or that politician, and that’s what I’m trying to tell American Jews.</p> \n<p>“It’s not about personalities, it’s something much larger,” he continues. “The historical panorama is much wider than any leader, even if you don’t accept his views. By the way, in the center-left camp we used to think that Netanyahu and Likud’s views are much more prevalent among Diaspora Jews. That’s why we were always against any notion of allowing Israelis or Jews living outside of Israel to vote: we thought they were all right-wingers.”</p> \n<p>This is an interesting observation, which indicates that ignorance about prevailing Diaspora views is as common among the ostensibly more worldly Israeli center-left as it is on the political right. Herzog himself, who claims he “knows most of the organizations and foundations and NGOs” in the Diaspora, quickly discovered he has a glaring blind spot.</p> \n<p>In an interview with Israeli news site Ynet immediately after his appointment was announced in June, Herzog listed intermarriage as one of the main threats to the Jewish people’s future. He called it a “real plague,” angering many American Jews as well as some Israelis. But after returning from his first trip to the United States as Agency chairman, he is apologetic. “I was speaking totally innocently to an Israeli website. I’ve learned since then to choose my words more wisely,” he notes.</p> \n<p>But does he still think intermarriage is a plague on the Jewish people? “I was talking about assimilation, which is a term every Israeli knows – and that’s the challenge. But the truth is – and I’m saying this with utmost frankness – I have no right, and it’s not my intention, to judge anyone. I’m not judgmental toward anyone and I’ve been in the U.S., meeting spiritual and communal leaders, rabbis and rabbas, and hearing their perspective that ‘We are bringing into the Jewish people those who want to be part of it.’ There’s a question which has to be part of the debate between streams and within streams: how do we ensure Jewish continuity? I personally, through my upbringing, believe in Jewish continuity through marriage between Jews. But I can’t in any way cancel out or, heaven forbid, patronize or give out grades for anyone else’s concept of marriage or partnership.”</p> \n<p>Shut up and learn</p> \n<p>Whether it’s Netanyahu, intermarriage or other conflicts between Orthodox and progressive Jews like the Western Wall prayer area agreement, it seems Israelis and Diaspora Jews simply don’t share that many common values anymore. A fact Herzog doesn’t deny.</p> \n<p>“I don’t expect them to have an identical world of values; I really don’t expect that. I expect at the first stage to have a dialogue, a constructive argument. With mutual respect. Since I’ve started this job, I am constantly appearing and talking to both sides. I went to every ultra-Orthodox member of the Knesset and asked them to shut up about this. To just learn. Listen, I spoke with all of them and I told them that what they say goes to the heart of every Jew anywhere – and they don’t understand the impact and the damage of what they’re saying. I explained that Diaspora Jews feel Israelis are condescending to them, and I told them that Diaspora Jews are Jews just like you.”</p> \n<p>But if he blames Israelis for patronizing Diaspora Jews, he also sees a lack of Diaspora awareness of Israeli affairs as a major reason for that disillusionment. “I was in North America now and I told them, ‘You guys aren’t aware of deep tectonic shifts that are, for example, taking place now in the ultra-Orthodox community.'”</p> \n<p>Herzog is also trying to act as commentator on Israel’s right-wing for American Jewry. “I appeared in one of the big communities, at their federation, and I said, ‘Listen, I led the opposition to the nation-state law in the Knesset. You are totally against the nation-state law and think it’s entirely racist. You forget that the law itself defines things that were defined by Zionism.’ It defined Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, the Law of Return and Jewish identity. At the same time, it’s perceived very differently because of the complete absence of essential components that you would expect there, such as equality, and a Jewish and democratic state, which we were always demanding.</p> \n<p>“But what I was trying to explain to them was that this is a 15-year process – a controversy over the powers of the Israeli judiciary,” he says. “A controversy that hasn’t reached at all from Jerusalem to the Jewish communities abroad. They don’t know there are Jews – sorry, citizens – here who say ‘We want a Justice Kavanaugh of our own.’ And when they don’t get their own Justice Kavanaugh, they reject the judiciary. So some American Jews don’t understand that and think this happened all of a sudden, not that it’s part of a process. So I’m inviting them to be involved and be part of the discourse.”</p> \n<p>Herzog knows there has been a tectonic shift in that discourse. “When I was a young man, the Jewish people didn’t have any demands of Israel. It accepted as a given that this is Israel and they can only give and help, and perhaps make a tiny protest when Israel angers them – because it’s Israel, and Israelis are busy building a state and a nation and they can’t disturb it. Today, the Jewish people are coming and saying to Israelis, ‘You’re our brothers and we want to be partners.’ Right, they don’t live here, but perhaps they would be happy if their children did. They see themselves as partners and want to have influence; they don’t vote in the elections but want to have influence. This is where there’s tension.”</p> \n<p>That tension is also the contradiction at the heart of the Agency’s role. Founded in 1929 to build the state-in-waiting, when Israel became a reality and then-chairman David Ben-Gurion was elected prime minister two decades later, the agency was not disbanded but instead received a new mission: To organize and encourage Jewish emigration to Israel from the Diaspora.</p> \n<p>For more than a decade now, the Agency has been undergoing a painful transition from its role as “Jewish travel agent.” Just like commercial travel agencies have struggled with the challenge of online ticketing sites, the Agency has had to contend with the fact that the days of “mass aliyah” seem to be over, and those who are immigrating have much less need of it.</p> \n<p>Still a central issue</p> \n<p>Herzog seems more enthused with his role as ambassador-at-large to the Jews, wherever they live, than acting as their potential travel agent. Like his immediate predecessors Natan Sharansky and, particularly, Zeev Bielski, who signaled the Agency’s shift, Herzog prefers to speak of the organization’s Jewish identity and education programs. However, he still lists aliyah as the Agency’s first role, and has already made the rounds of visits to absorption centers and greeted new arrivals at Ben-Gurion Airport, calling it “an amazing experience of renewal.”</p> \n<p>Herzog insists “aliyah is an important and central issue,” but admits the 30,000 new immigrants arriving this year are “not just thanks to the Jewish Agency.” He’s also aware of the tension between his role as aliyah facilitator and the fact his target audience is the millions of Jews who have no intention of emigrating.</p> \n<p>“Jews pray ‘When God will return us to Zion, we shall be like dreamers.’ But you know it isn’t always realistic. We have to facilitate aliyah at any moment, to encourage it. But we’re not naive. After 70 years, you know that you can’t bring everyone.”</p> \n<p>But doesn’t accepting that at least half the Jewish people will remain outside Zion somehow undermine a principle of traditional Zionism?</p> \n<p>Herzog describes that as “a philosophical question, irrelevant. I don’t see it in those terms. I think that Jewish continuity is essential in every place and I believe it will remain, and flourish. And I believe that Babylon can be very strong in its interaction with Jerusalem, and vice versa. I think one of the great things that Israel can do – as part of its aspiration to be a light unto the nations – is to respect the liberal-democratic set of values projected by the liberal Jewish communities of the United States.”</p> \n<p>Jewish dissent</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Israel seems to be trying to keep its American-Jewish critics out, detaining and questioning journalists and activists, and sometimes even just passengers with a leaflet in Arabic or political book in their suitcase. Herzog claims to have been against it before the issue even hit the headlines.</p> \n<p>“In May, when I first heard of academics arriving from abroad, being detained at Ben-Gurion [Airport], as leader of the opposition I wrote to Avi Dichter – chair of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee – and demanded we hold a review of this. Ask him why that hasn’t happened yet. What I do know is that the Foreign Ministry isn’t always in the loop and the Interior Ministry [in charge of border control] is making statements about people it knows nothing about.”</p> \n<p>It isn’t just a matter of a bureaucratic muddle: Herzog has a different attitude toward Jewish dissent. Unlike his predecessor Sharansky, who made fighting “delegitimization” of Israel and the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement one of the Agency’s core missions, Herzog doesn’t even mention this when listing the Agency’s main issues.</p> \n<p>When pressed, he insists that he “ascribes a lot of importance to the fight against BDS,” and calls the movement “a large, well-oiled operation, self-sustaining, that comes in many forms and has a dramatic influence in certain areas on the connection of the younger generation with Israel. On campuses, I’ve also seen the situation of terrible brainwashing of young Jewish students, who go in and hear all kinds of terrible stuff.”</p> \n<p>But he’s less eager to block BDS supporters from reaching Israel. “I abhor the BDS movement and will fight them in every way, but I’m prepared for them to come here so we can argue with them.”</p> \n<p>He’s certain all it will take is to give them the appropriate information. “They’re muddled because they don’t have the full picture of why we can’t, for example, allow tens of thousands of people to cross the border from Gaza violently and threaten Israelis in the kibbutzim. Part of our aim is, through our Israel fellows, to create a more balanced and true picture of Israel. Despite all its flaws, I think Israel is a flourishing and glorious democracy.”</p> \n<p>Not that he’ll rule out preventing entry all together. “That’s why I demanded a policy review in the Knesset – so we could have parameters. When there is a situation that calls for it, we can do what other countries do and prevent entry. There are cases where you have to ban them. There were cases in the past when even Jews were prevented from entering and some even deported. I’m not going to rule it out in every case. There are people who are lost causes, those carrying out entire campaigns against Israel.”</p> \n<p>So the Jewish Agency chairman believes there are Jews who are lost causes? “Of course there are. We’ve always had them in Jewish history.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Between Jerusalem and Babylon, Trump and Netanyahu: Read the full transcript of Anshel Pfeffer's interview with Jewish Agency Chairman Isaac Herzog&nbsp;&lt;&lt;</p>",

        "text":["<p>For as long as I’ve been cooking I’ve made honey cake for Rosh Hashanah. I do this just as my mother did, and my grandmother did, and likely my great-grandmother before her. I love my family’s recipe, and I have even made tweaks to it over the years.</p> \n<p>But the truth is, I like honey cake more for tradition’s sake than for its flavor. Last year it finally occurred to me that I don’t have to make honey cake for Rosh Hashanah.</p> \n<p>What did I actually want to eat and serve on Rosh Hashanah?</p> \n<p>I love sunken apple cake, but there are always so many apples eaten over the High Holidays that I wanted to make something featuring another fruit. I had just picked up a beautiful bag of plums from the market, and they called out to me. Why not make a sunken plum cake?</p> \n<p>The flavor of plum goes so well with honey. Like an apple, the plum’s tartness cuts through and complements honey’s sweetness. Their bold colors always add beauty to any baked good, and I love that plums are highly seasonal. They’re only at their best for a short window of time each year, which typically coincides with the Jewish New Year. For me, using plums at their peak is always celebratory.</p> \n<p>Ingredients: &frac12; cup (1 stick) vegan butter or unsalted butter, at room temperature &frac12; cup sugar &frac14; cup honey 2 large eggs, at room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract &frac12; teaspoon freshly grated ginger 1&frac14; cup all purpose flour or gluten free all purpose flour 1&frac12; teaspoons baking powder &frac12; teaspoon ground cardamom &frac14; teaspoon salt if using unsalted butter, pinch of salt if using vegan butter 4-5 plums, halved, pitted and sliced &frac14;-inch thick Turbinado/raw sugar, for sprinkling on top &frac14; cup honey for the glaze (optional)</p> \n<p>Directions:</p> \n<p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 F. 2. Grease and line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper, or you can also make this in a 9-by-9-inch baking dish. 3. Cream together vegan butter/butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes, using either a handheld mixer or stand mixer with the paddle attachment. 4. Add the honey to the sugar mixture and mix until well incorporated. 5. Add the eggs, vanilla and freshly grated ginger, and mix until they are also well incorporated. 6. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and cardamom. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and mix until just incorporated. Be careful not to over-mix. 7. Pour the batter into the lined and greased cake pan. Add the sliced plums on top of the cake; they will sink as they bake. Top the cake with a generous sprinkling of Turbinado/raw sugar, or regular sugar if you don’t have raw sugar. 8. Bake 35-40 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean when tested in the center of the cake. 9. If desired, you can brush honey on top of the cake once it has cooled: Heat &frac14; cup of honey until just warm, and then brush it over the cake. 10. Serve topped with whipped cream or ice cream. Can be made a day in advance.

But Shirin and Ahlam buy the traditional saj pitas – which in Israel are mistakenly called “Druze pitas” when they are in fact typical of the entire cultural and geographic region – from other women in the village. They do this to help them financially. “Not all women can work outside the home,” says Shirin, “but even those who can’t can still earn a livelihood, and there is mutual support among the women. We all help one another.”</p> \n<p>Ahlam, who keeps her hair and part of her face modestly hidden with a naqab, a white muslin headscarf, is fashioning whole-wheat yeast dough into elongated boat shapes to make pide. These warm pastries are inspired by the famous Turkish version, and the sisters make them with a variety of fillings. Local flavors are evident in the seasonings of the meat pide and the pide with labaneh and red pepper paste. The lahma ba’ajin – a flatbread topped with ground meat and dotted with hot peppers – is another common dish, found in several different versions in the Turkish-Syrian region. There is also arayis (pita pockets filled with ground beef and seared in the taboun or on the charcoal grill); and a selection of other baked goods based on the flatbreads of the Middle East and Mediterranean. After a long stint in front of the flames of the taboun, Ahlam steps outside for little break. “It’s hot by the oven,” she says. “People don’t understand why I sometimes look very stern and serious. It’s hard, but I really love baking.”</p> \n<p>Dad does the driving</p> \n<p>Shirin Faraj, born in 1979, is married and a mother of two. Ahlam (“My name means ‘dreams’) Seif, her younger sister, was born in 1983. “We always loved food, from the time we were little,” laughs Shirin, the more talkative of the two. Both are touchingly candid and serious. “We go to everything that involves food. To try, to taste, to learn. One night I saw online that there were cooking classes being offered by Chef Maher Araida at the culinary school in Yarka. I called Ahlam at midnight. She said I was crazy, but we signed up the next day.”</p> \n<p>The four-month course led the sisters to think about opening their own place, no small matter for pious Druze women. “Our father, who was the secretary of the local council for 22 years, is not a religious man,” says Shirin. “But I became religious at age 26 and Ahlam at age 22. Chef Araida really encouraged us, but he also told us that with the current state of the restaurant business in Israel, it would be very hard. It’s not easy to survive in this field, and in fact we were unable to get a loan to start the business. Ultimately, our father helped us get started with money he received from his pension.”</p> \n<p>In addition to the usual challenges of starting a restaurant, the sisters also faced the daunting challenge of doing so as women in Druze society, in which modesty is paramount and women have only limited contact with men who are outside their family circle.</p> \n<p>“We were worried that because we are religious, we’d have a problem with our society, especially with the religious folks. We worried that people – especially men – wouldn’t come to a place that belongs to two women,” says Shirin. “But our father and brothers and my husband and his family were all very encouraging. They told us – ‘You have a gift for this. Tasty food is an important thing and you can succeed.’”</p> \n<p>Their fears about opening an independent business also had to do with practical matters, such as the lack of a driver’s license. “Devout Druze women in the village aren’t permitted to learn how to drive,” says Shirin. “Our father said, ‘I’ll be your driver. It’s important for everyone to see that Druze women can work.’</p> \n<p>“Druze women in the area have nowhere to work. Once we worked in textile factories – the Delta factory in Hurfeish or Gibor in Ma’alot. Women from my generation were told that it’s forbidden to leave the village to study. Today the situation is better. I have a profession; I’m an assistant preschool teacher, but I left that to try to realize a dream and support myself. I respect all work, but it pains me to see Druze women going to work as cleaners for just 2,000-2,500 shekels a month because that’s their only option.”</p> \n<p>The sisters’ restaurant, Lahm Wa’ajin Baladi (Baladi Meat and Bread), opened two months ago. “We closed our ears to any negative comments and we went for it. We were pleasantly surprised. The whole village is supporting and welcoming us. Everyone comes – young people, old people, religious, nonreligious.”</p> \n<p>On the afternoon we visited, the women were working nonstop to prepare food for their customers. The menu focuses mainly on traditional local foods (“In the end, we all want to go back to mom’s cooking,” says Shirin), but there are also more modern items with a cream or pesto base. “People here have just started to eat and love pesto,” she says.</p> \n<p>Some customers sit at the few tables inside the simply designed restaurant space. Others choose to take their delicious fresh baked goods home or to work. Raleb Seif, the sisters’ father, comes in to say hello. A family acquaintance from neighboring Sakhnin sits down for a cup of coffee; conversation turns to the new nation-state law. “I’m not going to the demonstration. What’s the point?” the friend says bitterly. “A year from now I bet they’ll declare that the Jews are citizens and we Druze and Arabs are only residents. Our MKs should resign already.” Seif, a reserved and impressive gentleman, shakes his head in disagreement. “That’s just what they want. If we don’t protest, we’ll play into their hands. We have to fight it.”</p> \n<p>Lahm Wa’ajin Baladi, at the entrance to Yanuh-Jat from the direction of Kfar Vradim (next to the post office); 04-855135</p>",

We’re on one side. The Israeli government is firmly on the other.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;I'm Not the 'Right Kind of Jew' for Israel's Current Government – and I'm Proud of It&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>It’s true: we are ideologically opposed. And, speaking at least from our side of the line, we actually believe in what we say we stand for: Free speech. Democratic governance. Equal rights and equitable opportunities. An end to the occupation. Human rights for all people, including Palestinians. We fight for these principles. We are willing to sit in jail cells for them.</p> \n<p>But while we fight for our values, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for something else: Power.</p> \n<p>Avner, Achiya and Michael weren’t detained and taken away from the South Hebron Hills in a military jeep because the prime minister disagrees with them – though of course he does. They were detained for the same reason the settler terrorists who violently attacked peaceful Taayush activists last weekend weren’t arrested, though IDF soldiers witnessed the entire episode, which landed four Taayush activists in hospital. Politics. Elections. The environment most suited for another Netanyahu victory.</p> \n<p>Autocrats in power think about power. Netanyahu knows that elections are (still) about people and the choice they make when they go to the polls. But those choices are informed by the political atmosphere, by beliefs and assumptions – and those are malleable over time. The entire Netanyahu administration is all pointed toward cultivating the environment necessary for people to make the choice at the polls that will keep him in power.</p> \n<p>The prime minister and his advisors have made an assessment about where power lies, and for them, that is with the settlement movement, regardless of how much ire they raise among American Jews and some Israelis. They’ve decided they need those factions to maintain and consolidate Netanyahu’s power - and that has always been the primary objective, like it is for populist autocrats like him the world over.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So the Netanyahu government normalizes violent settler extremists. They regularly pay lipservice to radical, racist, semi-militia groups like the infamous La Familia, a fan group for Jerusalem’s soccer team Beitar which uses violent means to spread their racist ideology through their affiliate hate group Lehava.</p> \n<p>At the same time, they have decided that non-violent, law-abiding citizens and Palestinians are the terrorists. The criminals. We are the ones carried off in handcuffs. We are the threat.</p> \n<p>This is a particularly insidious piece of psychological warfare. By persecuting nonviolent activists who represent both ideological and political opposition as enemies of the state, Netanyahu is attempting to position human rights defenders and settler terrorists as equally extreme – albeit from different &quot;sides.&quot;</p> \n<p>He’s creating, in the eyes of the Israeli public, a false parallelism between people committed to nonviolent means in the struggle for human rights and those who beat them with iron pipes for photographing their illegally-constructed outposts. And he’s right there to normalize the wrong side – chanting &quot;Yalla yalla Beitar.&quot;</p> \n<p>Consider how the situation would be different if those who actually break the law and use violence regularly to further their aims were the ones carted off in handcuffs. Consider even an equivalent tour to the West Bank, but led by a right-wing NGO, accompanied by their legal advisor and several prominent right-wing MKs.</p> \n<p>It is impossible to imagine border police rolling up in their jeeps next to that tour bus, demanding to talk to those leaders – harassing them, identifying their attorney and then detaining them, roughly shoving them into the back of a jeep.</p> \n<p>It’s impossible to imagine this, because we all know it would never happen in the State of Israel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel's Racist Lynch Mobs Are Hunting Arabs, Incited by the Government&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>We often think about this double standard and the increasing efforts to silence and intimidate human rights defenders in terms of the impact it has on us – on the work, on the movement, and on the opposition, as if we are the primary audience. We talk about a chilling effect.</p> \n<p>But we are not the primary audience for Netanyahu’s spin tactics to normalize settler violence and delegitimize human rights defenders. His audience is Netanyahu’s own base, and above all else, the Israeli electorate.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu and his administration don’t care that we disagree with them. I’m not even sure he cares about his own purported ideology. He cares about remaining in power, and everything he does as prime minister is geared toward growing and consolidating that power to a point barreling quickly toward autocracy.</p> \n<p>We find ourselves in Netanyahu’s crosshairs because we threaten his power. This is not ideological sparring only – it is political sparring.</p> \n<p>In Maya Zinshtein’s 2016 documentary&nbsp;Forever Pure about Beitar Jerusalem and its ideological and political dynamics, President Reuven Rivlin, a Likudnik with a long political career, looks at the camera at one point and says simply, &quot;Politicians know that the road to elections goes through Teddy Stadium.&quot;</p> \n<p>So when we then see Prime Minister Netanyahu, on a podium there chanting &quot;Yalla yalla Beitar,&quot; we know why he is there. It is the same reason why Michael, Avner and Achiya were detained on Friday. It is dangerous political pandering.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies.</p> \n<p>“He’s been very good at creating expectations but not as good at managing expectations,” Dorsey said.</p> \n<p>Industry sources told Reuters late last month that both the international and domestic legs of the IPO had been postponed indefinitely. Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the government remained committed to conducting the IPO at an unspecified date in the future.</p> \n<p>“The reform process has to be judged on its entirety and over a period of years, but this will negatively affect perceptions of its credibility overall, considering that the IPO was promised in such high-profile terms,” said Richard Segal, senior analyst at Manulife Asset Management in London.</p> \n<p>Prince Mohammed launched his Vision 2030 program with promises to fundamentally transform Saudi Arabia’s economy and open up its people’s cloistered lifestyles. He has implemented a series of high-profile reforms, including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.</p> \n<p>But those moves have been accompanied by a harsh crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen now in its fourth year.</p> \n<p>The crown prince’s increasingly aggressive stance toward archrival Iran and in relations with supposed friends such as Canada and Germany has unnerved allies and investors alike.</p> \n<p>“The Aramco IPO was supposed to be an example of a new global level of transparency. Perhaps because there’s so much going on and so little explained, it looks like they’ve gotten worse at transparency,” a former senior Western diplomat said.</p> \n<p>But some bankers said the reform program was far bigger than the Aramco IPO and, despite the possible political fallout, many changes could still go ahead, or even accelerate, now that senior officials are no longer preoccupied by listing Aramco.</p> \n<p>“The reality is there is a lot of other stuff that the authorities could do before doing this huge move of the Aramco IPO,” said a senior banker whose institution pitched to help arrange the sale.</p> \n<p>Riyadh’s circumstances have improved greatly since plans for the IPO were first announced in 2016.</p> \n<p>Oil was about $35 a barrel at the time and the government was desperate for cash. Oil prices have more than doubled since and the state budget deficit has narrowed sharply, so Riyadh has more room to find other ways to finance projects.</p> \n<p>MSCI and FTSE Russell decided this year to add Saudi Arabia to their emerging market equity indexes, so even without the IPO the kingdom can expect an inflow of $20 billion or more of foreign funds next year.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Aramco flop: Beginning of the end for Crown Prince MBS' new Saudi Arabia | Opinion</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the authorities are proceeding, slowly, with other reforms to attract foreign direct investment.</p> \n<p>In July, Riyadh published draft rules for partnerships between the state and private firms to build infrastructure. Last week, the kingdom’s water utility said it was talking to international companies about involving them in water distribution and treatment.</p> \n<p>In addition to Aramco, authorities have said they aim to sell another $200 billion worth of state assets in the coming years. While many analysts say this looks ambitious, freezing the Aramco IPO may clear the way for smaller sales to go ahead.</p> \n<p>“The IPO always had important symbolic value but would not have affected the rest of the Saudi economy very much,” said Steffen Hertog, associate professor at the London School Economics and Political Science and a leading scholar on Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>“Challenges like private job creation for Saudis and improving the legal and regulatory environment for local and foreign investors are more important for kingdom’s long-term economic health,” he said.</p> \n<p>While Prince Mohammed put the value of a 5% stake in Saudi Aramco at about $100 billion, analysts reckon the IPO would have only raised some $50 billion to $75 billion as the prince’s valuation was overoptimistic.</p> \n<p>The money would have gone to the government’s Public Investment Fund, largely to fund projects creating jobs. With unemployment among Saudi citizens officially at a record 12.9%, finding ways to boost employment is seen as vital.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How the Saudis made Canada the loneliest country in the world | Analysis</p> \n<p>But even without the IPO, those projects could still go ahead because Aramco said in July it may buy a strategic stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries, or SABIC, from the Public Investment Fund — potentially giving the fund as much money as the IPO.</p> \n<p>At market prices, the sale of the fund’s entire 70% stake in SABIC to Saudi Aramco would raise about $70 billion.</p> \n<p>If the fund can create jobs, suspending the Aramco sale may even prove politically positive for Prince Mohammed because some Saudis were uncomfortable with the IPO.</p> \n<p>“The average citizen saw it as a misguided sell-off of the national patrimony. Many Saudi royals worried it would expose their source of wealth and privilege,” said Jim Krane, fellow for energy studies at Rice University’s Baker Institute.</p> \n<p>“So there is probably some level of relief in Saudi Arabia that the state is backing away from the plan.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel’s main aquifers are nearing their red lines, or are even below them now, as the end of the summer approaches. At the same time, the amount of water flowing in the streams feeding the Jordan River is continuing to drop, says the monthly report on Israel’s water sources issued by the Hydrological Service in the Water Authority.</p> \n<p>Israel’s two large groundwater reservoirs are the Coastal Aquifer and the Mountain Aquifer. Measurements of the water levels in both aquifers carried out on September 1 show that the Mountain Aquifer is only two centimeters above its red line in the south, and four centimeters above it in the center. If the groundwater level falls below the red line, there is a risk of saltier water penetrating into the aquifer from deeper geological levels. This will reduce the water quality and could make the aquifer unfit for drinking or for agriculture use.</p> \n<p>Part of the southern section of the Coastal Aquifer is already below its red line. This part is considered to be a future water reserve and this is particularly dangerous because seawater can now seep into the depleted freshwater.</p> \n<p>The groundwater basin under the Tel Aviv area, which is part of the Coastal Aquifer, has been observed to be sinking – relative to neighboring regions. The reason for the formation of this depression is widespread construction, including the work on the light rail project. As part of this digging, it is necessary to pump out groundwater to build the tunnels. The existence of the hydrological depression creates a risk that polluted water will enter the groundwater from nearby areas with a higher water table.</p> \n<p>The Western Galilee has another aquifer that is important for supplying water to the region. The levels in this basin rose during the winter because of a relatively large amount of rain. But over the past few weeks, the groundwater levels have fallen below the red line here, too. After a few months in which natural water flowed from the springs in the nature reserve in the area of Nahal Na’aman, the water has since stopped flowing and the reserve is now being supplied with water from a well that has been drilled in the area.</p> \n<p>Last month, the amount of water in the streams that feed the Jordan River fell again. The flow measured at the Dan Springs at the very northern tip of Israel was 3.12 cubic meters per second, compared to the multi-year average of 7.2 cubic meters this time of the year. The flow of water measured at the Banias stream was 0.43 cubic meters per second, compared to an average of 1 cubic meter per second this time of year.</p> \n<p>The water level in the Sea of Galilee continued to drop and fell by 27 centimeters in August. On September 1, the level of the lake was 1.22 meters below its lower red line. At the same time, the salinity level of the lake continued to rise because as the volume of water drops, the amount of salt remains the same and as a result the salinity rises.</p> \n<p>Over the past four years, the salt concentration in the Sea of Galilee has risen by 17 percent, a result of consecutive years of drought. The increasing salinity could make it more difficult to use the lake as a source of irrigation and drinking water.</p>",

        "text":["<p>This is anti-Semitic canard, the editor of the British newspaper would say, before shelving a piece that came from the Middle East desk. The editor at the German TV news channel would take one look at the pitch from her reporter in Jerusalem, take fright and say: “Forget about it, do you know how many protest letters and phone calls we’ll get if we broadcast this? They’ll say that we broadcast a chapter of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.”</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Because who could invent a story like this, if not Israel’s enemies? That the Jewish democratic state would present non-Jews with two options&nbsp;for where to live, either next to a garbage dump or next to a sewage plant?</p> \n<p>So that the area where they have been living for decades could be vacated in favor of expanding Jewish villas? Only Jeremy Corbyn could invent such an absurdity, Jewish community leaders in London would say. Unfortunately, this is not an invention by Jew-haters. It’s the truth.</p> \n<p>The High Court of Justice directed attorneys from the state prosecutor’s office to explain in writing their proposal to soften somewhat the edict of forced eviction of Bedouin of the Jahalin tribe from Khan al-Ahmar, which had been approved previously by a different panel of justices.</p> \n<p>Once again, here are the details, because the government’s tactics are to blur them. Here again are the details because this is not a singular event. Similar evictions have taken place since the Oslo Accords were signed. Now the intention is to continue to rid a huge piece of territory in the heart of the West Bank of Palestinian-Bedouins, so as to continue to expand the settlements. If the eviction of the community that went public thanks to the school it built out of tires, is successful, that will be the signal for mass evictions of other Palestinian communities.</p> \n<p>The High Court made its request, and attorneys Ran Rosenberg and Hadas Eran wrote:</p> \n<p>Those evicted will first be moved to tents, which will be supplied by the state, at a site known as Jahalin-West (near the Ma’ale Adumim garbage dump). Then at some time in the future, they and three other communities from the same sub-tribe, Abu Dahuk, will be allocated an area of 255 dunams (63.7 acres), on which to build their houses. If they want, “there is also a possibility of connecting the structures of the plan to be advanced to the water line that is 1.3 kilometers away.” Wow! Running water, what a tempting offer. The evacuees from Amona certainly didn’t get that.</p> \n<p>And that’s not all. There’s another advanced planning possibility, and that’s to connect them to the sewage system. This is what the attorneys wrote, backed up by an affidavit from Major Yaniv Ben-Shoshan, deputy head of infrastructure in the Civil Administration: “At the environmental level, in this area the possibility exists for connecting the sewage infrastructure to the sewage treatment plant of Vered Yeriho, which is near the proposed alternative (east of Mitzpeh Yeriho).”</p> \n<p>Thus, in an aside, a document presented to High Court justices states that the proposed alternative is next to the Vered Yeriho sewage treatment plant.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; EXPLAINED: Everything you need to know about the West Bank Bedouin village at the eye of a diplomatic storm</p> \n<p>Really? Aerial photos attached to the proposal, also given to the Bedouin’s attorney, Tawfiq Jabarin, were not clear. He asked and received clearer photos, which showed that the proposed site is not close to the settlement’s sewage treatment plant, but rather to the large, regional, Og Sewage Treatment Plant. That plant treats the sewage of the settlements of Ma’ale Adumim and Kfar Adumim. Oh, the irony. Those are the settlements pushing to evict the Bedouin from where they are now living.</p> \n<p>After Jabarin exposed this cover-up and the failings of the Civil Administration’s planning, it was buffed up a little. The size of the site will be reduced, so it will be a little farther away from the sewage. The improved version of the plan, submitted by the attorneys, conceals the previous cover-up.</p> \n<p>The attorneys once again baptized the large treatment site with the name Vered Yeriho, and only in parentheses did they add Og. But this name does not exist on other official documents. They make do with the name HaOg S.T.P. And we just have one question: Why conceal from the judges that they are being asked to approve an eviction to a site at the edge of a regional sewage treatment plant?</p>",

        "text":["<p>Sweden, a strong welfare state, has traditionally been a society where opposition to racism is instinctively considered part of decent conduct. Boasting a high rate of political participation (with an 86 percent turnout rate for the last national elections), the Scandinavian state has, in contrast to other western European states, long kept the far right on the fringes of the political system.</p> \n<p>But this has changed.</p> \n<p>For the first time after the end of World War II, the anti-immigrant, radical right Sweden Democrats passed the four percent threshold and entered the Swedish parliament in 2010. Subsequently, in 2014, it received a respectable 12.9 % of the vote to become the third largest political party in parliament after the Social Democrats and the Moderate Party. Currently, it holds 42 seats in the national parliament.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How Sweden Became a Thriving Base of neo-Nazi Ideology | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the lead up to general elections on September 9th, most polls suggest the Sweden Democrats will increase their share of the vote and even become Sweden’s second largest party. More alarmist voices argue that they may become the critical political kingmakers in the next parliament.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That prediction is based on a real political problem: Neither the current government, with its Social Democrat leader and Green Party junior partner, nor mainstream conservatives, will be able to form a government on their own.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Until now, there has been a mainstream agreement to freeze out the far right from coalition negotiations. While it is still unlikely that either political camp would agree to a formal coalition with the Sweden Democrats, the pressure will be intense if indeed they gain a sizable proportion of the popular vote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are already cracks in the wall of mainstream refusal to negotiate with the far right; last year, the smaller conservative Christian Democrats declared they were open to forming a government with Sweden Democrat support of the SD, and a conservative Moderate Party leader chose to &quot;dialogue&quot; with them.</p> \n<p>&quot;Distancing” themselves from Nazism</p> \n<p>Officially founded in 1988, the Sweden Democrat ideology has fascist roots that, despite its current leaders’ best efforts to muffle them, tend to re-emerge on a regular basis, just like within other right-wing parties built on a fascist or Nazi past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sweden has a century-long history of indigenous fascist ideologues and politicians and since the 1960s has been a key point for the emergence of both white supremacist and far-right parliamentary movements in Europe.</p> \n<p>Just recently, two members were excluded from the party for explicitly identifying with Nazism. One regional candidate had purchased items from the neo-Nazi extremist Nordic Resistance Movement; his Facebook account featured posts praising Hitler, calling Arabs rapists and pedophiles, as well as a photo calling Anne Frank &quot;the coolest Jew in the shower room.&quot; The other had purchased white power music and racist stickers online.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These two candidates were among 11 party members linked to&nbsp;online&nbsp;purchases&nbsp;from stores that sell Nazi memorabilia and racist goods. Another recent report indicated that several Social Democrat candidates were &quot;deeply rooted in the Nazi environment, including members of Nazi organizations, Nazi activists and those who actively spread propaganda.&quot;</p> \n<p>The party has serially attempted to distance itself from fascism by marketing a moderate face and by loudly condemning neo-Nazism, the same strategy followed by various other European hard right parties.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Those members of the Sweden Democrats - among them former MPs – angry about the need for such &quot;appeasement&quot; broke away and set up their own party, the Alternative for Sweden (Alternativ f&ouml;r Sverige, AfS), a name obviously inspired by the far right Alternative for Germany, which became third-strongest party in the 2017 elections for the Bundestag.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Alternative for Sweden boasts even more explicit far right policies, calling for the repatriation of immigrants. Its co-founder and chairman Gustav Kasselstrand warns, in language taken straight from white supremacists, of a &quot;replacement of our people&quot; and mobilizes against &quot;political correctness.&quot;</p> \n<p>For the Sweden Democrats, the Alternative for Sweden is both a benefit and a threat. The Sweden Democrats fully distance themselves from the AfS and describe it as a neo-Nazi movement, thus coming out in comparison as moderates. But the emergence of another party on the far right clearly creates more competition and may harm the Sweden Democrats’ ambition to become the second largest parliamentary party.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But while Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie &Aring;kesson declares a &quot;zero-tolerance&quot; policy on racism, that doesn’t seem to have resulted in a particularly effective filtering of the party’s candidates with Nazi sympathies. And, just as importantly, there is one form of racism that the party embraces publicly and wholeheartedly: racism against Muslims.</p> \n<p>Mainstreaming Islamophobia</p> \n<p>That the Sweden Democrats appear moderate next to the blatantly supremacist AfS should not give the false impression of moderation. The Sweden Democrats are still extremely radical in their anti-Muslim rhetoric.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One party member has suggested that all Muslims in Sweden must become members of the Church of Sweden; another said that, &quot;I hate all Muslims to the extent that I get sick when I see them,&quot; and a third declared that Muslims were the antithesis of being human.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The climate towards Muslims in Sweden is already becoming more hostile, with mosques being a particular target of vicious attacks. In 2017, mosques were attacked 39 times, a tenfold increase from the previous year. According to the Islamic Cooperation Council of Sweden, in 2015 seven out of 10 mosques were attacked.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As is typical for the hard right, the Sweden Democrats use the strategy of reversing the roles of victims and perpetrator. In 2010, the party’s general secretary stated: &quot;Just like Nazism was overturned, so does Islam need to be overturned.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Following the European far right playbook&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Europe’s much-evoked ‘refugee crisis’ - often parsed as a 'Muslim crisis' - undoubtedly secured Sweden’s far right extra popular support. But it does not fully explain its success.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Sweden Democrats are following the playbook of its European brethren from France to Germany to Austria to Hungary, who have successfully combined anti-establishment politics with anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant politics.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; What We German Jews Hear When the U.S. Ambassador Says He Wants to 'Empower' Toxic Populists | Opinion</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, as in other countries, the long-established political parties are weakening. The strongest governing party for a decade, the Swedish Social Democrats, are losing support just as the conservative Moderates are as well. The angry, energetic Sweden Democrats have been leading the tone and direction of political discourse for some time now.</p> \n<p>They call for a referendum on European Union membership, demand a freeze on immigration, including family reunification, and a crackdown on crime. Its party program accuses multiculturalism&nbsp;&nbsp;of &quot;lead[ing] to fragmentation and segregation where the clash of cultures occur.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Another similarity with other far right European parties is the support they enjoy from armies of online trolls and bots, with some pointing the finger at Russian interference.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Swedish defense research agency conducted a study of over 571,000 tweets sent between March and August this year. Their analysis paints a clear picture: Both the Sweden Democrats and the Alternative for Sweden received far more support from automated accounts than the other parties. The topics that the bots focus on are unsurprising, in terms of what we have already learnt about online interference in other elections: highly critical of immigration and refugees, the &quot;elites&quot; and the dishonest &quot;mainstream media.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Despite not having yet identified the origin of the bots, in the recent past&nbsp;Sweden's Security Service (S&auml;po) identified Russia as a possible actor aiming to divide Swedish society on just these issues.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For now, Sweden’s open, liberal society allows Muslims and immigrants to take their place in society. The current government even launched a national anti-racism plan that, for the first time, acknowledged Islamophobia as a form of racism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, the continuous, aggressive rhetoric towards Muslims in political life is having an impact, pressuring the mainstream to adopt anti-immigrant policies and contaminating its language towards Muslims.</p> \n<p>The Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan L&ouml;fven gave up his creed of &quot;my Europe builds no walls,&quot; and sealed Sweden’s borders. Other smaller parties on the center-right such as the Liberals and the Conservatives have started reproducing the Islamophobic discourse of the Sweden Democrats.</p> \n<p>There is still a chance the Sweden Democrats will not become part of a governing coalition after September 9. But the precedent from European states such as Austria and Italy show that in the end, their patience will be rewarded; and what was once considered beyond the pale will become politically acceptable.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Sweden Democrats’ outspoken anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant language has already influenced public discourse immensely. Longer term, it’s no longer quite so improbable that a party characterized by closeted neo-Nazi sympathizers and outright racists could even become the party of government in Sweden.</p> \n<p>Farid Hafez is a Senior Research Scholar at Georgetown University's&nbsp;Bridge Initiative&nbsp;and Senior Scholar at Salzburg University in the Department of Political Science and Sociology.

        "text":["<p>Next month will see the 25th anniversary of the first Oslo accord, while soon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will mark a decade in power – round dates that give us a chance to examine in-the-box thinking. The conventional view is that this land is full of settlers, that the right is taking advantage of its long stretch in power to deepen its hold, and that the two-state solution is dying. But is all of that really so?</p> \n<p>To address this issue, Haaretz analyzed the settlers’ population dispersal in the West Bank and compared the number of settlers in strategic centers on the eve of Netanyahu’s ascent to power and their number now. The examination revolved around two questions: 1) How many settlers were added to the isolated settlements over the past decade? 2) What is the minimum number of settlers who must evacuated in order to divide the land and draw a border between Israel and Palestine?</p> \n<p>The conventional wisdom on the right is that half a million settlers have created an irreversible situation and that the partition of historical Palestine and the establishment of a Palestinian state are no longer achievable. So often has that mantra been sounded that many groups on the left have started to adopt it.</p> \n<p>Just four months ago, the novelist A.B. Yehoshua wrote in Haaretz, “But above all, the two-state solution is fading because of the constantly expanding settlements in Judea and Samaria. Indeed, according to many experts who are familiar with the demographic and geographic reality, it is no longer possible to divide the Land of Israel into two separate sovereign states.”</p> \n<p>Yehoshua isn’t the only one to adopt this notion. Haaretz columnist Gideon Levy is awed by the number of settlers, regardless of where they’re concentrated. In an October 2015 op-ed, he said the two-state solution “has been missed. Those who wanted a Jewish state should have implemented it while it was still possible. Those who set it on fire, deliberately or by doing nothing, must now look directly and honestly at the new reality.”</p> \n<p>Long arms</p> \n<p>But Yehoshua and Levy are both wrong. Let’s look at the map. Most of the Israeli suggestions for resolving the conflict have included the territorial arms that extend deep into the Palestinian parts of the West Bank, which would necessitate the annexation to Israel of the settlement blocs. Two such arms exist in the center of the country, one to Ariel and the other to Kedumim, via Karnei Shomron. From Jerusalem an arm was extended eastward to Ma’aleh Adumim, southward to Gush Etzion and northward to Beit El.</p> \n<p>At the Camp David summit in 2000, Israel suggested extending a long arm from Beit She’an to Jerusalem so that the Jordan Valley would remain inside Israel. Another idea was to lease for a long period a stretch of land that would include several of the Hebron Hills settlements and Kiryat Arba.</p> \n<p>If these arms are lopped off, what would remain is a Palestinian area that enjoys territorial contiguity and includes 33 isolated settlements. The population of these settlements, which are completely detached from the settlement blocs, is listed at 46,000, meaning 9,800 families at most – a number comparable to a large neighborhood in Israel. More families live in Jerusalem’s Pisgat Ze’ev neighborhood alone.</p> \n<p>The evacuation of 33 isolated settlements would not be enough to attain the Palestinians’ consent to end the conflict; a final-status accord would call for complex solutions. But it would be enough to demarcate a border between Israel and Palestine, unilaterally or in an agreement for a limited period.</p> \n<p>In the past decade, the right has enfeebled the law-enforcement system, fought the media and incited against the left and the Arabs, but when it comes to settlement deep within Palestinian territory, it hasn’t achieved a strategic change. The Netanyahu governments have indeed diverted budgets to paving roads that will hamper partition, and the planning institutions are working away. But the growth rate in the isolated settlements under Netanyahu has been 400 families a year – not a number that shifts tectonic plates.</p> \n<p>How is it that the right boasts about hundreds of thousands of settlers, while actually it would be possible to divide the land with the evacuation of 9,800 families? There are two explanations. One is that the vast majority of the settlements were built near the Green Line in order to expand the waists of Israel’s two metropolitan centers, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The large settlement concentrations lie east of Tel Aviv (near the separation barrier) and around Jerusalem – in Gush Etzion, Ma’aleh Adumim and the Route 443 area.</p> \n<p>The second explanation is that the largest increase in the number of settlers has been in the neighborhoods of East Jerusalem and in the ultra-Orthodox cities of Modi’in Ilit and Betar Ilit, adjacent to the Green Line, which will remain part of Israel in every scenario, and which are thus irrelevant to the partition issue. A decade ago, the number of settlers in these two towns stood at 73,000; today this number tops 130,000. This neither improves nor reduces the prospects of a border being drawn between Israel and Palestine.</p> \n<p>Minuscule growth</p> \n<p>To scuttle partition, the right must increase the number of settlers who live in the areas between the Palestinian cities, thereby precluding territorial contiguity. But the map shows that the right-wing governments have left whole regions, in both the north and south of the West Bank, almost free of settlers.</p> \n<p>After the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and northern West Bank in 2005, only four settlements remain in the triangle between Jenin, Nablus and Tul Karm – Shavei Shomron, Hermesh, Einav and Mevo Dotan. One might have expected Netanyahu and Naftali Bennett’s Habayit Hayehudi party to want to beef up Israel’s hold in this area. But during the past decade these settlements have grown by a minuscule number, just 140 families.</p> \n<p>A similar situation exists in the southern West Bank. Between the southern approaches of Bethlehem, running east of the settlement of Efrat, and the northern approaches of Hebron, there is only one settlement, Karmei Tzur. In the past 10 years this strategic settlement has grown by only about 80 families.</p> \n<p>Another tactic for scuttling partition has been to seize the hills around metropolitan Palestine and surround them with Jewish settlements. That tactic was partially applied around all the West Bank’s big cities. Thus Elon Moreh, Itamar and Bracha are settlements that were established around Nablus. Together with the tactical reason for intensifying construction in them, the government had another reason to develop them: Itamar and Elon Moreh were the targets of two of the critical terrorist attacks in the past decade (the massacre of the Fogel family, in 2011, and the murder of the Henkin couple, four years later). Netanyahu and the right-wing ministers routinely declare that terror will be answered with construction. But declarations are one thing and actions another. In the past 10 years, only 350 new families have joined those three settlements.</p> \n<p>The maps and numbers leave no room for doubt: When it comes to construction in the settlements, Netanyahu is like an old refrigerator – freezing almost everything and making a lot of noise.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Ori Mark, the new editor of Haaretz’s Hebrew-language weekend magazine, is sure that the land can still be divided. In fact, it’s easy: Remove 9,800 families and the land is divided. Only 33 “isolated” settlements stand between the apartheid state or the binational democracy of the prophets of falsehood and destruction, A.B. Yehoshua and this writer, and the just solution of two states for two peoples, the vision of so many good people.</p> \n<p>To read Mark’s article, which appeared in English as well over the weekend, it seems as if peace and justice are still right around the corner. Here comes the Palestinian state, reach out and touch it, just one small evacuation and we’re there. And we haven’t yet mentioned its tiny area, restricted rights, demilitarization and lack of sustainability.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Mark’s optimism is enviable. Only the despondent and the grumpy wouldn’t get caught up in it. In his favor it should be said that he’s taking small steps. His mini-evacuation promises only a mini-agreement. The drawing of a border for a limited period. And what about afterward? Only God knows. Even if he tarries, the Messiah will yet come.</p> \n<p>Many in Israel and the rest of the world are still spreading this sweet illusion of dividing the land, an illusion that’s the most dangerous of all. Thanks to this fantasy, the occupation can be perpetuated. As long as a division of the land awaits, the occupation can continue.</p> \n<p>Under this thinking, even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s years in office haven’t locked the door on a solution. The Zionist left and the European Union are selling this illusion, and the Palestinian Authority continues to hold fast to it – without it, it has no hope. Even Donald Trump mumbled something about two states. It’s convenient for everyone. Fifty years of occupation thanks to 50 years of illusion. We can go for another 50.</p> \n<p>The map doesn’t lie. Removing 33 disruptive settlements would indeed allow for Palestinian territorial contiguity. There’s a state. True, a Palestinian who travels to Bethlehem and Ramallah would have to go through the Dead Sea, but who’s counting. There’s contiguity.</p> \n<p>Maybe one day the Israeli statesman will be found who can evacuate 46,000 settlers, but it’s doubtful. And maybe a Palestinian leader will be found to sign an agreement in exchange. That would be Oslo II or III, Illusion II or III; justice would not be done. Not even a little. And so the end of Illusion III will be the same as that of Oslo I.</p> \n<p>No map can overcome historical truth: Most of the Palestinian people’s land was taken from them in 1948. In 1967, the 22 percent that remained was robbed. And now they must compromise over that too, for the benefit of those who expelled them. Since 1948 the Palestinian people have been living under Israeli occupation or as refugees and in exile.</p> \n<p>Until Israel takes responsibility for this and changes its attitude to the Palestinians and their rights, which hasn’t changed since 1948, no agreement will hold water. The removal of a few settlements will allow for a few more years of denial of reality, but the reality won’t let go and Israel will not be absolved.</p> \n<p>Mark’s map obscures the truth. Netanyahu’s old refrigerator might freeze almost everything and make a lot of noise, as Mark puts it, but his years in power have distanced Israel even from the map of illusion.</p> \n<p>The map doesn’t show the flood of nationalist legislation intended to legitimize annexation without granting citizenship, the apartheid state on the way. The map doesn’t show the spirit of the times, which has declined to the extremes of racism, a thirst for blood and a loss of recognition of the Palestinians as human beings. The map shows 33 settlements and hides Israel.</p> \n<p>As luck would have it, reality peaks through in the pages that follow the hope offered by Mark. “What do they mean by sovereignty?” Carolina Landsmann asked in her piece on the issue, and presented the true spirit of the times. The education minister promises that the Palestinians will be able to travel by car, the Jerusalem affairs minister says the occupied territories belong to the Jewish people, the founder of the Israel Institute for Strategic Studies sends them to Indonesia and the Middle East affairs expert suggests they establish seven emirates for themselves.</p> \n<p>That’s where we’re going, step by giant step. The settlers have won, we’ve lost. Let’s at least admit it, Ori, and not illusion ourselves to death.</p>",

As if Israel didn’t have at the time – and still didn’t have – a rejectionist movement to dividing the land that has no connection to Palestinian terror, but rather is backed by a messianic theology and which operates with no legal or moral restraints.</p> \n<p>As if it weren’t actually a Jewish terrorist, Baruch Goldstein, who slaughtered dozens of Palestinians at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron, who ignited the chain of revenge attacks. As if it were Yasser Arafat who assassinated former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, rather than a Jewish terrorist who was a product of the messianists of the whole Land of Israel.</p> \n<p>Harel challenges the media to republish the moving texts and pictures that accompanied the signing ceremony. How wise he is after the fact – the fact of Rabin’s murder, of course. Would this expert of yesterday recommend reprinting the issues of November 5, 1995, and all the pictures of the criminal incitement that preceded the murder – incitement that was proudly presided over by then-opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu? Opposition that murdered and then inherited the government?</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Harel protests unfairness. “Then, in the days of ecstasy, you allowed no criticism to be voiced,” he writes. Nonsense. We lived through the shrieking opposition to Oslo, the demonstrations, the incitement.</p> \n<p>The ones who aren’t being fair about Oslo are Harel and the right. First, because they ignore the decisive role played by the Jewish rejectionist opposition in thwarting Oslo through its settlement arm, its propaganda arm (challenging the Rabin government’s authority to divide the land, the Jewish legal principle of din rodef that permits killing someone who intends to kill you) and its military arm (Goldstein and Rabin’s assassin, Yigal Amir).</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The real Oslo criminals | Opinion</p> \n<p>Second, because of the decisiveness with which rightists, of all people, call Oslo a failure. As if we weren’t living to this day in a reality shaped by Oslo. As if the right had actually done anything since Oslo (the work of the Labor Party) and the Gaza pullout (the work of the Kadima party).</p> \n<p>The right doesn’t have so much as a single line in the diplomatic record. What has it built other than real estate and bypass roads on stolen land? Let them show me one bridge of peace, one bit of infrastructure for coexistence.</p> \n<p>The political camp that inherited Oslo, including Netanyahu, has been nourished by its fruits: The army is out of Gaza and largely out of West Bank cities, the Palestinians are running their own affairs, and there’s security coordination. That’s also how they’ll exit – without leaving behind even a single diplomatic asset as a legacy.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu complains about the Palestinians’ incitement, their refusal to recognize the Jewish people’s right to self-determination and their insistence on a right of return for refugees. Look who’s talking; it takes one to know one. He is the inciter, he denies Palestinian nationhood, and the right is plotting to keep the entire land.</p> \n<p>Diverting the discussion to the right of return serves peace rejectionists like him who want to divert the discussion from 1967 to 1948 in order to reduce the conflict ad absurdum. As if there were a real demand for Jews to vacate the land. Netanyahu is an expert in false constructions, propagandistic manipulations and political marketing, all aimed at postponing the end, out of a pathological stinginess.</p> \n<p>Harel’s hubris – like the fact that the term “Oslo criminals” referring to Rabin and Shimon Peres has taken root among Israel’s leaders – reflects the fact that in their view, Rabin’s murder was a step in the right direction for history.</p>",

        "text":["<p>HAR BRACHA, West Bank – You thought BDS stood for “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions,” the international campaign to ostracize and economically cripple Israel?</p> \n<p>Think again. Determined to take on the world’s Israel-bashers – especially those opposed to Jewish settlement in the occupied territories – a Christian evangelical family is fighting back with a countercampaign inspired by the same three letters. Only in this case, BDS stands for “Blessing, Defending &amp; Serving.”</p> \n<p>Meet the Wearps, devoted advocates of the settler movement who hail from eastern Texas. They are the founders of Blessed Buy Israel, a new venture that helps small, Jewish-run businesses located in the territories sell their merchandise in the United States.</p> \n<p>Steve and Doris, along with their five sons, not only market the products. They also provide assistance with labeling and help their suppliers with other logistical matters like obtaining FDA certification.</p> \n<p>They see it as part of their crusade against anti-Semites around the world, especially those in Europe who require that goods made in the settlements be labeled as such. (In late 2015, the European Union adopted this requirement to make sure that products made in the settlements, which are not recognized as part of Israel, did not benefit from the same duty-free status conferred on products made within the country’s internationally recognized borders.)</p> \n<p>“For us, that was like painting a yellow star on a store window,” Steve tells Haaretz. “And when that yellow star went on the window, not only were we gonna walk through that store and purchase those products, but we were gonna empty that store of products and bring them out to the nations so that people who really want to stand with Israel can do it – in other words, this is not just about talk, but about actively opposing anti-Semitism.”</p> \n<p>The Wearps are currently promoting about a dozen small, family-run businesses in the settlements. The goods include olive oil produced in Shiloh; soap from Kochav Hashahar; cosmetics and ceramics from Itamar; honey and chocolate from the South Hebron Hills; and jewelry from Kiryat Arba.</p> \n<p>The Blessed Buy Israel website, which describes its mission as “supporting the courageous families rebuilding the very Heartland of Israel,” includes the personal stories of the families behind each business. As Steve explains, “We don’t want people buying olive oil from Israel – we want them buying olive oil from Erez and Vered. We want our clients to get to know the faces of the settlers.”</p> \n<p>Doris pipes in to correct her husband. “We don’t call them settlers,” she says. “For us, they are resettlers.”</p> \n<p>Acknowledging his mistake, Steve explains the difference. “The Jewish people have been here for thousands of years – so they’re coming back to where they always were.”</p> \n<p>On the road</p> \n<p>In 2017, their first year of operation, the Wearps sold $50,000-worth of merchandise from the settlements. This year, Steve predicts, they’ll double that to $100,000. The products are sold through their online site, as well as in churches and synagogues. Since they started the business, the Wearps have moved into a trailer home and travel around the United States visiting churches and synagogues, where they make their sales pitch. For customers anxious to get their hands on the products immediately – often the case, Doris notes, after they deliver their moving appeal – the Wearps keep a stash of products available for sale in their trailer home.</p> \n<p>Steve says the plan is to grow even bigger next year by getting the products into stores and shops as well. “Next time you’re in America,” he says, “don’t be surprised if you find us on the shelves of Whole Foods.”</p> \n<p>An engineer by training, Steve was born and raised in San Diego, which is where he met his Austrian-born wife. The couple eventually relocated to Texas, where they own and operate a ranch. Steve’s love affair with the Jewish people began at an early age. “I’ve had a heart for Israel since I was a little boy,” he says.</p> \n<p>For five years, he served as the U.S. national director of March of Remembrance, an annual prayer walk held to commemorate victims of the Holocaust. “It’s a way that we Christians can be active about our repentance for the Shoah,” he explains.</p> \n<p>The Wearps began making friends among the West Bank settlers when they joined HaYovel, an organization that brings Christian families to the settlements to work as volunteers in agriculture. The organization has its main “campus” at Har Bracha, a religious settlement (overlooking the Palestinian city of Nablus) where hundreds of volunteers – men, women and children – come each year to plant and pick grapes for Jewish-owned wineries. The Wearps spend six to seven weeks annually volunteering with HaYovel.</p> \n<p>They are there now with three of their boys, taking advantage of the time to check in with their suppliers and expand the pool. To the best of their knowledge, they say, there is no other business like this in the world.</p> \n<p>Initially, they had thought of promoting their cause through a nonprofit. But considering long-standing U.S. hostility toward the settler movement, their lawyers advised them to set up a for-profit business instead. “It doesn’t really matter, though,” says Steve, “because all the money that comes in goes back into promoting the products.”</p> \n<p>When asked why he would devote so much effort helping such a small fraction of the Israeli population (the West Bank settlers account for some 4 percent of the total), Steve responds: “This is the biblical heartland. This is where we see the real battle for the heart of Israel going on. You’re talking about Shechem [the biblical name for Nablus], Shiloh, Hebron. You’re talking about all the places where the patriarchs walked and lived. I mean, truly, without Judea and Samaria [the settlers’ term for the West Bank], what is Israel?

        "text":["<p>Nearly 150 years ago, three Arab horsemen were galloping through the desert of Transjordan after completing a secret mission on behalf of a French diplomat stationed in Jerusalem. Local Bedouin had attacked them, injuring one of the riders, but they still got away with an invaluable prize: an archaeological treasure that would reshape the early history of the Bible, of ancient Israel, and, in a way, of God himself.</p> \n<p>That treasure was a nearly 3,000-year-old inscription in which the king of Moab boasts of his victories against the Kingdom of Israel and its god YHWH. Called the stele of Mesha, it contains the earliest known extra-biblical mention of the deity worshipped by Jews, Christians and Muslims and, since its discovery in 1868, it has fueled the argument over the historicity of the Bible.</p> \n<p>On one hand, the stele confirms some of the names and circumstances found in the biblical texts on the monarchic period, and may even mention King David himself; and it attests to the existence of a strong cult of Yahweh in ancient Israel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; A strange drawing found in Sinai could undermine our entire idea of Judaism</p> \n<p>On the other hand, it suggests that the culture and religion of the ancient Israelites may have been radically different from Judaism today. The ancient Hebrews may have been much closer to their much-maligned Canaanite adversaries than the Bible lets on.</p> \n<p>“Scholars have had the Bible for millennia, and parts of it are considered plausible by historians, but when you find an inscription that comes from the distant past, from the very time when these things happened, it suddenly become real,” says Matthieu Richelle, a professor of Hebrew Bible and one of the researchers behind an exhibition at the College de France, in Paris, celebrating the 150th anniversary of the stele’s discovery.</p> \n<p>Found and lost</p> \n<p>The history of the artifact’s recovery is no less sensational than its content. The inscription was first reported by an Alsatian missionary, who had seen it among the ruins of Dhiban, an ancient Moabite town east of the Dead Sea.</p> \n<p>At a time when amateur archaeologists and explorers were already scouring the Levant for evidence of the Bible’s historical accuracy, the news set off a race between colonial powers – mainly France, England and Germany – to take possession of the stele. It was Charles Clermont-Ganneau, an archaeologist and diplomat at the French consulate in Jerusalem, who had sent those horsemen to take an impression, also known as a “squeeze,” of the text.</p> \n<p>This was done by placing a wet paper sheet on the stone and pressing it into the indentations created by the letters. But while the paper was drying, Clermont-Ganneau’s envoys became involved in a brawl with a local Bedouin tribe. With their leader injured by a spear, they snatched the squeeze off the stone while it was still wet (tearing into several pieces in the process) before escaping. This act would prove vital for the preservation of the text, because soon after, the Bedouin decided to destroy the stele, breaking it into dozens of fragments.</p> \n<p>Some historians claim they did so because they believed there might be a treasure inside, but Richelle says it was likely an act of defiance toward the Ottoman authorities, who were pressuring the Bedouin to hand over the stone to Germany.</p> \n<p>It took years for Clermont-Ganneau and other researchers to locate and acquire most of the fragments, but in the end the French scholar managed to piece together about two-thirds of the stele, reconstructing most of the missing parts thanks to that impression that had been so adventurously saved. The reconstructed stele is still today on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris.</p> \n<p>The vessels of God</p> \n<p>In the text, King Mesha recounts how Israel had occupied the northern regions of his land and “oppressed Moab for a long time” under Omri and his son Ahab – the biblical monarchs who reigned from Samaria and made the Kingdom of Israel a powerful regional player in the first half of the 9th century B.C.E.</p> \n<p>But Mesha goes on to tell how he rebelled against the Israelites, and conquered their strongholds and towns in Transjordan, including Nebo (near the traditional burial place of Moses) from whence he “took the vessels of YHWH and dragged them in front of Chemosh,” the main Moabite god.</p> \n<p>The &quot;Mesha&quot; in the stele is clearly identifiable as the rebellious Moabite ruler by the same name who appears in 2 Kings 3. In the biblical story, the king of Israel, Jehoram son of Ahab, sets out to put down Mesha’s rebellion together with his allies, the king of Judah, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom. The Bible tells of miracles wrought by God, who makes water appear to quench the thirst of the Israelite army, which then goes on to righteously smite the Moabites in battle.</p> \n<p>But the account ends with an abrupt anticlimax. Just when the Moabite capital is about to fall, Mesha sacrifices his eldest son upon the walls, “and there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.” (2 Kings 3:27)</p> \n<p>While the events narrated in the two texts appear quite different, one of the most surprising aspects of Mesha’s inscription is how much it reads like a biblical chapter in style and language, scholars say.</p> \n<p>Mesha explains that the Israelite king Omri succeeded in conquering Moab only because “Chemosh was angry with his land” – a trope that finds many parallels in the Bible, where the Israelites’ misfortunes are invariably attributed to the wrath of God. It is again Chemosh who decides to restore Moab to its people and speaks directly to Mesha, telling him “Go take Nebo from Israel,” just as God routinely speaks to Israelite prophets and leaders in the Bible. And in conquering Nebo, Mesha recounts how he massacred the entire population as an act of dedication (“cherem” in the original) to his gods – the exact same word and brutal practice used in the Bible to seal the fate of Israel’s bitterest enemies (for example the Amalekites in 1 Samuel 15:3).</p> \n<p>Although there are only a handful Moabite inscriptions out there, scholars had no trouble translating the stele because the language is so similar to ancient Hebrew.</p> \n<p>“They are closer than French and Spanish are,” explains Andre Lemaire, a philologist and historian who teaches at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris. “We hesitate whether to call them two distinct languages or just dialects.”</p> \n<p>So, the first key lesson of the Mesha stele may be that while the Bible often describes the Moabites and other Canaanites as vile pagans who conduct human sacrifices, there were huge cultural and religious overlaps between the early Israelites and their neighbors.</p> \n<p>“When the stele was discovered and published for the first time there were a lot of people who claimed it was a fake, because they couldn’t imagine there would be a Moabite inscription displaying the same ideology as the Bible,” says Thomas Romer, an expert in the Hebrew Bible and professor at the College de France and the University of Lausanne. “Today we can see that, on the contrary, the biblical authors were participating in a common religious ideology.”</p> \n<p>One god, two gods, many gods</p> \n<p>Based on the stele, it appears that the Yahweh that 9th century B.C.E. Israelites worshipped had more in common with the Moabite deity Chemosh than with Judaism’s later concept of a single, universal deity. The fact that Mesha found a temple of Yahweh to plunder in Nebo contradicts the Bible’s contention that the exclusive worship of a single God had already been established and centralized at the Temple of Jerusalem in the time of King Solomon.</p> \n<p>The biblical narrative is also sorely challenged by the findings at the site of Kuntillet Ajrud, in the Sinai desert, where archaeologists discovered inscriptions on rock dedicated to “Yahweh of Samaria” and “Yahweh of Teman” – showing that this god was worshipped in multiple incarnations at different sanctuaries.&nbsp;Dated to the &nbsp;early 8th century B.C.E. (just a few decades after the Mesha stele), these inscriptions at Kuntillet Ajrud also include a crude engraved drawing of a male deity and a female deity, and describe the latter as Yahweh’s “Asherah.”</p> \n<p>This has led many scholars to conclude that at that time, around 3,000 years ago, there was no prohibition on making images of God, and that Yahweh had a wife.</p> \n<p>This is another possible parallel with Mesha, who tells us that when he massacred the 7,000 inhabitants of Nebo, he dedicated them to “the Ashtar of Chemosh.” Just like Yahweh had his Asherah, it is possible that the Ashtar mentioned in the stele may have been Chemosh’s wife, notes Romer.</p> \n<p>Mesha also gives us a clue that perhaps there were even more gods that the Israelites embraced.</p> \n<p>Before taking Nebo, the Moabite king conquered another stronghold built by the king of Israel east of the Dead Sea, Atarot,&nbsp;where once again he wipes out the local population (as an offering to Chemosh himself this time), and drags “the hearth of the altar of his Well-Beloved in front of Chemosh.”</p> \n<p>Who was this Well-Beloved (DWDH in the original) who was worshipped at Atarot? Experts are divided on this point. Lemaire, the French epigraphist, suggests it was merely a different name for Yahweh. Romer and Richelle point out that since the conquest of Atarot is mentioned before that of Nebo, it would be strange for Mesha to use an alternative appellation first and only name Yahweh on second reference. They believe it is more likely that DWDH was a separate local deity worshipped by the Israelites of Atarot.</p> \n<p>Whatever the number of divine figures we are dealing with, scholars agree that the Mesha stele reflects a world in which both Israelites and Moabites were not monotheists, but practiced, at best, a form of monolatry, which is the worship of a principal god while maintaining the belief in the existence of many deities.</p> \n<p>“In this inscription, you see very clearly that by this time Yahweh was the god of Israel and Chemosh was the god of Moab,” says Lemaire. “It was not a universal god, each kingdom had more or less its own national, territorial god.” In this world, the gods of other peoples were not worshipped, and might even be reviled, but their existence was recognized.</p> \n<p>The idea of a universal, all-powerful God was adopted only much later by the Jews, probably as a way to explain the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile in the 6th century B.C.E., explains Israel Finkelstein, an archaeologist at Tel Aviv University.</p> \n<p>When human sacrifice works</p> \n<p>While the Bible, written and compiled from different documents over centuries, was edited to reflect this faith in a universal God, we can find echoes of the earlier belief system of multiple national deities between the lines of the sacred text.</p> \n<p>For example, Jephthah’s question in Judges 11:24 – “Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess?” implies that whoever wrote that verse believed that the Moabite deity really existed.</p> \n<p>The same goes for the abrupt conclusion of the Israelite siege of Mesha’s capital in 2 Kings 3.</p> \n<p>The Bible is very critical of human sacrifice, as in the parable of Abraham and Isaac, so it is surprising to find a story in which an enemy of Israel is rewarded for such an abominable act and manages to repel the chosen people. The biblical text does not specify to whom Mesha sacrificed his son and whose “wrath” arose to defeat Israel – though Chemosh is the best candidate for the role.</p> \n<p>These verses are likely the remnant of an older story, perhaps a chronicle of the Kingdom of Israel, which would have reflected the belief in other gods, says Romer.</p> \n<p>“This is memory of a military conflict that didn’t end very positively for the Israelites,” he says. “Maybe originally the text spoke of the wrath of Chemosh against Israel and then the redactor would have probably dropped the name of the Moabite god.”</p> \n<p>But is it possible to reconcile the very different version of events narrated in 2 Kings and in the Mesha stele?</p> \n<p>One possibility is that the two texts are somewhat out of sync, with the Bible relating a first part of the conflict, which Mesha barely survived, and the stele relating a subsequent, more successful expansion of Moab into Israel’s Trasnsjordanian territories, suggests Lemaire.</p> \n<p>“We should look at both texts critically,” cautions Finkelstein. The Biblical text has multiple layers and its original core was probably not compiled before the 7th century B.C.E., some two centuries after the events it narrates, he says.</p> \n<p>Although we cannot date it precisely, Mesha’s stele was written much closer to the facts, but may include elements of Moabite propaganda, Finkelstein says. The text likely reflects the realities of the Levant sometime after 841 B.C.E., when Hazael, the king of Aram-Damascus, conquered vast swaths of Israel and other neighboring kingdoms. Though Mesha keeps all the glory for himself, it is very likely that the Moabites were allies or vassals of the Arameans and simply took advantage of Israel’s recent defeat to liberate what they saw as part of their ancestral lands, Finkelstein says.</p> \n<p>King David in the house</p> \n<p>Hazael’s own victory is recorded in the so-called Tel Dan stele, discovered by Israeli archaeologists in 1993.&nbsp;In the inscription, which is believed to be more or less contemporary to Mesha’s, Hazael boasts of killing the king of Israel and the king of “beitdavid”, i.e., the House of David.Many researchers interpret &quot;beitdavid&quot; as a reference to the kingdom of Judah and its founding father, which would ostensibly make it the only extra-biblical mention of David. But in fact, Lemaire, the French epigraphist, has been insisting since the 1990s that Mesha’s stele also mentions “beitdavid” (in a section where the Moabite king talks about how, after beating Israel, he expanded his territory south by taking a place called Horonaim).</p> \n<p>This part of the text, at the bottom of the stele, is fragmentary and damaged. Only the letters B VD are clearly legible, and the other scholars interviewed for this article did not agree with Lemaire’s extrapolation of the missing letters. But if Lemaire’s reading is correct, this would be the second mention of King David outside the bible, and would further strengthen the argument that, at least in the 9th century B.C.E., he was considered the founder of the dynasty reining over Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>The fragile squeeze of Clermont-Ganneau is on a rare public display at the College de France exhibition&nbsp;from Sunday through Oct. 19, Richelle notes, adding that it is possible that some observant researchers may yet unlock more secrets of the Mesha stele.</p>",

Officials at the Israel Antiquities Authority oppose the use of the park for the event.</p> \n<p>Members of the Temple Mount Faithful seek to restore Temple worship, including animal sacrifice, and encourage Jews to visit the Temple Mount.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Number of Jews visiting the Temple Mount rising fast, and so is the controversy</p> \n<p>The concert was the idea of Prof. Hillel Weiss, a leader of the Temple Mount Faithful and spokesman for the New Sanhedrin, the organization behind the project.</p> \n<p>The date of the concert marks the first day of the start of the biblical Creation, 7 days before Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. Weiss says Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez is expected to attend the concert. Hernandez was slated to take part in the torchlighting ceremony on Israel’s Independence Day this year but canceled on short notice. The Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem said it had no information about a visit by the Honduran president this week.</p> \n<p>“This concert has been held since the Creation,” Weiss told Haaretz. “The director and the conductor is God.” Weiss said the idea for the concert came to him last year, but the Sanhedrin didn’t have the money needed for production. This year, he said, the organization raised the needed funds through the sale of medallions that it commissioned.</p> \n<p>“We would be happy if the state were to engage in what is meaningful instead of passing the nation-state law, that what all the Jews throughout the generations sought. We’re not afraid of the non-Jews and we try to explain and to welcome and to cause good, and not, heaven forfend, war,” Weiss added.</p> \n<p>According to the police permit issued for the concert, around 1,000 people are expected to take part.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For members of the group,&nbsp;&nbsp;the archaeological park is the nearest site in which events connected to the Temple can be held.</p> \n<p>During the Sukkot festival last fall, Temple activists reenacted the water libation ceremony and on Passover they held a partial animal-sacrifice exercise. In previous years the police prohibited the holding of such events so close to the Temple Mount, for fear of violence from Muslim worshippers, but both rites were held without major incident.</p> \n<p>This year the criticism is coming from the Israel Antiquities Authority, which seeks to preserve the park’s stated purpose as a tourism and educational site rather than an event venue. The growing number of private events at the park — two weeks ago a lavish and particularly large bar mitzvah was held there for a young member of the Safra family — has drawn the archaeologists’ ire.</p> \n<p>“The park was built almost entirely with donations from Friends of the Israel Antiquities Authority, the place is meant for archaeology, tourism and preservation, it’s not a bar mitzvah hall or a wedding hall or a place for events with a religious or ideological character, and this process is growing,” says Yuval Baruch, the Jerusalem District archaeologist of the IAI.</p> \n<p>Daniel Shukrun, the secretary of the government-owned Company for the Reconstruction and Development of the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem, rejects the criticism. “Why is it that in Caesarea, Masada and Beit She’an it’s OK to hold events and here it’s prohibited? It must be remembered that there are bigger events at almost all the other sites. There are almost no site where the authorities don’t hold events, because there’s an understanding that the connection between the authentic location and the audience is significant.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The song “I Won’t Steal Anymore” (composer and lyricist unknown) tells about a Jewish criminal who is incarcerated in a Warsaw jail sometime in the 1920s or ‘30s, and who declares his intention to turn over a new leaf: “I won’t steal anymore, I’ll just ‘take.’” The irony then becomes sharper: The criminal promises the Lord to follow his path, by which he means he will no longer get involved with unprofitable robberies: “If I get out of jail, I’ll steal a gold watch.”</p> \n<p>That song and four more like it – including one describing a conversation between a violent Jewish gangster and his moll, and another featuring impressions from a brothel – will be performed this week as part of the International Chamber Music Festival in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>The idea for the act, titled “Yiddish – 5 Songs for Voice and String Quartet,” came from the world-renowned Jerusalem Quartet, who will be joined by soprano Hila Baggio. The composer-arranger is Leonid Desyatnikov, a 63-year-old Jewish, Russian-born musician, and direction is by Shirit Lee Weiss.</p> \n<p>The raw materials of the composition are songs written in Yiddish by Polish- and Russian-Jewish composers and lyricists in the years before the Holocaust. The characters in the songs are also Jews – mainly from Warsaw’s underworld.</p> \n<p>Musicologist Gila Flam, an expert in Yiddish music, who helped to find the original lyrics and melodies, recalls that she was astonished by the quartet’s initiative to revive the forgotten songs, but was also apprehensive about it. She was primarily concerned that performing such pieces in concert without fully illuminating the broader context in which they were composed might damage the image of Jewry overall and in particular of pre-Holocaust Eastern European Jewry.</p> \n<p>The moving spirit behind the whole initiative is the quartet’s violist, Ori Kam. “A central trend in the classical music scene today is the search for new, ‘different’ things,” he tells Haaretz. “The people at [the record label] Harmonia Mundi, which records us, asked us to think about a special project. That was about three years ago. We hesitated; we knew that the fate of many projects like this is to be forgotten, in the best case, or also to embarrass acclaimed artists who became involved in them.</p> \n<p>“Nevertheless,” Kam continues, “we took up the challenge and started to look for a non-‘classical’ field of music that would allow for the integration not only of innovative and interesting works, but also high quality ones. And then I happened to hear a few performances of cabaret songs from interwar Berlin. Among the best of them, the Australian actor Barry Humphries appeared with the Australian Chamber Orchestra in London. The theme of the performance [called ‘Barry Humphries’ Weimar Cabaret’] was a story about a stolen suitcase that was brought to Australia by a Jewish refugee, which contained scores of music from before the war. The program combined classical works by Jewish composers and popular cabaret songs.</p> \n<p>“I discovered that German art between the wars was significantly influenced by Jewish and Yiddish culture. I think this comes through in the humor, the wordplay, the ability to express ideas and feelings that aren’t considered beautiful or sublime. I was a bit upset that the artists of today’s Berlin cabaret, which has become so popular lately, don’t know its roots, and I started to look for information about Yiddish cabarets in Warsaw. Very quickly I found materials about theaters and cabarets such as Azazel, which were among the pillars of the city’s Jewish culture.</p> \n<p>“All this led me to the conclusion – which was enthusiastically supported by my colleagues in the quartet – that our new project would be an homage to the interwar Yiddish cabaret. But then the question arose of which songs to choose. We were familiar with the sentimental, saccharine songs that are identified with our grandparents, such as ‘My Yiddishe Momme.’ We wanted certain songs, different ones, that would be worthy of being listened to today, in the context of their era, not through the [prism of the] tragedy that occurred a few decades later.</p> \n<p>“The result,” says Kam, “was that with the help of Gila Flam’s inexhaustible knowledge, we found songs that can be characterized as ‘dark.’ Songs about the street life of ‘simple’ Jews – cheats, prostitutes – songs that express black and sarcastic humor that did not exist in the authentic German culture. Songs whose performance as a whole will give the listener a glimpse of a particular aspect of the Jewish world of Warsaw in that period.</p> \n<p>“In order to build a fully formed work from the material,” he continues, “we needed a composer-arranger, and from the start it was clear to me that Leonid Desyatnikov was the appropriate person. I was familiar with works he had prepared for Gidon Kremer’s Kremerata Baltica ensemble, and knew he could write music that would make the quartet sound like a street band.”</p> \n<p>Following the premiere at the Jerusalem festival, Kam and his colleagues in the Jerusalem Quartet, together with singer Hila Baggio, will perform the work Desyatnikov created in Switzerland and Holland. They’ll also record them for a CD in December, together with works by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Erwin Schulhoff.</p> \n<p>What sort of arrangement did Desyatnikov do for these Yiddish songs?</p> \n<p>Kam: “Quite a drastic one, also at the harmonic level. The existing materials for these songs are very meager. In some cases there’s only a melody and a text, without any harmonies at all. He also took into account that some listeners wouldn’t understand the language, and tried very hard to make the music reflect the words.”</p> \n<p>As a general impression, would you say that his style here recalls Kurt Weill?</p> \n<p>“There’s something to that.”</p> \n<p>Dr. Flam says that the idea of mounting a public performance of these songs, which present a lowly aspect of Jewish life in the 20th century, makes her apprehensive.</p> \n<p>“That’s definitely understandable, but my approach is different. Our message in this project is that perhaps it’s time to talk about Polish Jewry in a way that goes beyond the context of the destruction, the perdition. After all, there’s an element of triumph in the scope of influence wielded by these Jewish creative artists of the last century on popular culture today, on the music industry in Hollywood and on Western culture in general.”</p> \n<p>With respect to the issue of the image of Jews – in particular, the concern of some that add negative stereotypes will take root that will cling to every Jew – it’s worth recalling what Theodor Herzl wrote at the end of the 19th century. Herzl, a Central European Jew in terms of his culture, whose native language was German, took a supercilious attitude toward the character of the poor, backward East European Jew who spoke a dialect (Yiddish): “Suffice it to look at him [at a Jew like that] or, heaven forbid, to touch him, in order to make us feel nauseous,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>After more than 20 years, during the heyday of the Berlin cabaret, assimilated German Jews were appalled to see shows in which Jewish actors portrayed buffoonish caricatures of East European Jews – for the purposes of entertainment. The shocked German Jews did all they could to censor such performances, ridding them of scenes that were liable to heighten anti-Semitism. As one senior official in the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith wrote, “We have a supreme interest in taking strong action against this corruption.”</p> \n<p>Jerusalem International Chamber Music Festival, Sept. 4-8.</p>",

        "text":["<p>What is it with you and drugs?</p> \n<p>I did my doctorate under Prof. Raphael Meshulam on the subject of cannabis. The truth is that it’s not something that I was aiming for. It turned out that I got to a lab that happened to be doing a study with Meshulam, who is the high priest of cannabis worldwide. The idea was to use substances that he synthesizes from cannabis to treat a liver disease. We used CBD, which is the non-psychoactive element in cannabis, and saw that it actually worked.</p> \n<p>Back when I was working on my Ph.D., I asked myself how it was possible that alcohol is legal and cannabis isn’t. That really bugged me. I knew from the research that it’s not a dangerous substance. As I extended my knowledge on the subject, I saw that the source of the ban on cannabis is actually cultural: racism toward Hispanics who immigrated to the United States in the 1930s. My interest only deepened. I began to collect material systematically, and at some point I started to lecture on drugs and to write articles. Somehow it gathered momentum.</p> \n<p>Today, in my day-to-day work I am investigating the disease ALS [Lou Gehrig’s Disease] from completely different directions, but I continue to take an interest in psychoactive drugs and to lecture and write on the subject.</p> \n<p>You are also active publicly on the subject. I saw an extremely sharp letter that you sent to the Israel Anti-Drug Authority.</p> \n<p>As someone who deals with the subject from the scientific angle, I consider it absolutely a mission to illuminate the issue from that perspective and perhaps also to uproot the ignorance that characterizes the authorities’ entire attitude toward drugs. I really don’t like the messages that the IADA transmits to the broad public. I don’t like the fact that the state authorities are lying, simply disseminating fake news – or presenting alternative facts, to put it more mildly.</p> \n<p>You are critical of the “gateway theory” – cannabis serving as the entryway to hard drugs, the joint that morphs into a syringe, etc.</p> \n<p>The IADA claims that there is scientific proof that cannabis leads to the use of hard drugs down the line. That is a total lie. Even the authority itself makes opposite claims on its web page. It presents many figures as being factual, even though they have no empirical basis. For example, that a chronic use of cannabis leads to addiction and that the attempt to stop smoking it involves rehab with harsh physical symptoms; or data about the physical damage that smoking weed entails, among them a heightened risk of fatal diseases, damage to the respiratory system and so forth – whereas there are conflicting and not unequivocal findings about all those effects.</p> \n<p>I think that the messages should be accurate and based on facts. In this era, in which people are exposed to a great deal of information, it’s anachronistic, not to say ridiculous, to continue to disseminate messages that are clearly far from the truth.</p> \n<p>Many influential people are meddling in the legalization issue.</p> \n<p>I think that certain enforcement agencies have an interest in continuing this line, because it’s easier to deal with people who smoke joints than with real criminals. They get very big budgets – the police, after all, are even against decriminalization, although they have no grounds for this other than the excuse that “this is how we catch dealers.” Do people who smoke have to be hostages of the police in order to catch drug dealers? Is the arrest of drug dealers useful in reducing the dimensions of the phenomenon?</p> \n<p>What about the pharmaceutical companies?</p> \n<p>I don’t have a smoking gun, of course, but there are hypotheses that the pharma companies are behind the super-slow progress being made in regard to medical cannabis. Its export has been bogged down for a few years [in Israel], and the prevailing conjecture, which to me sounds logical, is that the pharmaceutical corporations are behind this. Their interest is clear: They don’t want people to start using cannabis and then reduce or stop taking medications. So I see it as a mission: to free the public of its ignorance and to apprise it of the true facts.</p> \n<p>There’s a petition to the court now, submitted by Green Leaf [a political party that advocates the legalization of cannabis] against the criminalization of marijuana, on the grounds that it violates the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom. I was asked to write a professional opinion, and am doing so. It will be part of the petition.</p> \n<p>What do you plan to say?</p> \n<p>Naturally, I can’t reveal too much, but overall it’s about refuting mini-myths related to cannabis in order to persuade the justices that it’s not some monstrous substance that will lead to a disaster if the ban on its use is lifted.</p> \n<p>Drugs and immigrants</p> \n<p>Let’s talk about the process, which you address in your talks: namely, the gradual use of recreational drugs in medical treatment. You have a certain perspective on this, because the research you conducted ended a decade ago.</p> \n<p>At that time people didn’t talk about cannabis like they do today. There were occasional experiments. Attempts were made to use cannabis in treating anorexia, for example, but it didn’t gain momentum. Today, drugs like these are used to treat a great many diseases and phenomena, after many years during which drugs were considered anathema. In the United States, the process of outlawing drugs began during Prohibition. Alcohol, after all, is a psychoactive drug in every respect, and that law was a reaction to massive immigration from Europe to the United States and to the culture of drinking in Europe, which the authorities very much did not like.</p> \n<p>It’s interesting, by the way, that precisely at the stage when the prohibition on alcohol was lifted, the ban on cannabis began. The hypothesis is that the personnel who were in charge of enforcing the alcohol ban were left with no work to do, so they were sent to persecute cannabis users. Until the early 20th century, cannabis was legal and was even sold in drugstores. But when it arrived in the United States together with a wave of immigration from Mexico, it was outlawed. And it’s clear that economic interests were involved then, too.</p> \n<p>What about psychedelic drugs?</p> \n<p>Psychedelic drugs were very popular in South America and gradually penetrated the United States and the Western world overall. Aldous Huxley tried mescaline, and Timothy Leary, a professor [of psychology] at Harvard, conducted his famous experiment and aroused the fear and suspicion of the establishment. Leary’s experiment was halted and he became the darling of the hippies and of various proponents of the counterculture, who used LSD and mushrooms to the point where they became the very trademarks of the counterculture. Finally, LSD and the mushrooms were outlawed, which didn’t, of course, stop people from continuing to use them.</p> \n<p>In our time we’re seeing the opposite trend: recognition of their medical qualities. Why is this so? Why now? Is the approach “Let’s try all existing substances until we find something”?</p> \n<p>I can’t pinpoint the exact turning point when this trend started, but it certainly has to do with the discovery of the mechanisms of these drugs and their modes of operation. With cannabis, for example, until Prof. Meshulam discovered its active substances, no one knew what that it did, and that opened a window to a whole world.</p> \n<p>In other words, the new conception derives from progress in brain research.</p> \n<p>When it was discovered that psychedelic drugs work by activating serotonin, it was already known that illnesses such as depression are related to serotonin. So someone did the calculation that they might be useful for depression, too, but that really is progress made in the past few years. The psychedelic drugs specifically were like outcasts. They were feared because they generate hallucinations, and because most of them are synthetic. The objections to them were greater than for cannabis.</p> \n<p>Let’s talk a bit about neural conduction. Roughly and simplistically, information in the brain is transmitted when one cell fires a chemical substance – a neurotransmitter – at another cell. It’s in that encounter, in the space between the cells in which the substance exists, that the influence of drugs occurs.</p> \n<p>I like the analogy by which the chemical substance, the neurotransmitter, is like a key, and the receptor to which it attaches is a lock. Each key actually fits one specific lock, with the exception of a few substances that can attach to a number of receptors. Opening the lock causes electrical changes in the door that’s being opened. The drug can work on a particular neurotransmitter, it can inhibit the process of reabsorption into the cell that fired it, as in psychiatric medications; and cocaine and Ecstasy actually reverse the direction of the carrier, the substance that is responsible for returning the neurotransmitter to the cell that released it, so that instead of returning to the cell from which it was fired, it flows to the receiving cell, and thus its effect is prolonged.</p> \n<p>The psychoactive drugs intervene in the process of neural conduction in the brain. They can alter it, intensify it or weaken it, extend or abbreviate its duration. Because neural conduction has a direct connection to our feelings, our consciousness, our cognitive functioning, it influences us, as well.</p> \n<p>Reward and addiction</p> \n<p>What about the reward system in the brain?</p> \n<p>The reward system in the brain is actually intended to strengthen natural behaviors that are beneficial to our survival, such as sexual relations, which are critical for the species’ survival, or [a craving for] sweet foods that supply calories. All psychoactive drugs affect the brain’s reward system to one degree or another. Effectively, they deceive the system: We feel that we have done something that benefits us, even though in practice, of course, that’s not true. People use drugs to activate the mechanism by force, simply because that activation gives us pleasure even though it doesn’t serve any survival goal. The drugs trigger the reward mechanism – it signals us that we feel pleasure in the wake of the use of a drug, so we want to repeat the action over and over. That’s addiction.</p> \n<p>So the question is not why to use drugs to try to gain relief or to cure mental problems, but why it took so long to arrive at this solution.</p> \n<p>The answer is: cultural obstacles and vested interests. Conservatism. Across history, strange as it may sound, psychoactive drugs were not reviled. The ban is relatively new. The length of time in which cannabis, for example, has been prohibited is a tiny dot in our history, because there is evidence of its use going back thousands of years. All told, we’re talking about a hundred years, even less, since it’s been outlawed, but we’re brainwashed into thinking that this is natural.</p> \n<p>And in contrast, psychiatric medications are considered totally legitimate and normative, even though in many ways their effect and the way they work are similar.</p> \n<p>It’s only a matter of labeling. What’s the difference? A psychiatric medication is a chemical substance that affects the nervous system, and cannabis is a natural substance that affects the nervous system. In English the word “drug” also means medication – there’s no difference in the terminology. In Hebrew there’s a clear distinction [between sahm (drug) and terufah (medication)].</p> \n<p>One of things I try to emphasize in my talks is that we need to free ourselves from the dichotomous division between drug and medication and from the mistaken working assumption that a medication is something good and a drug is something bad. All these substances affect our body in one form or another, they affect our functioning and our consciousness.</p> \n<p>And in both cases we don’t know the full scope and consequences.</p> \n<p>Correct. Opiod medications in the United States are simply killing thousands of people today. It’s ridiculous to think that they should be legal while cannabis isn’t. It’s really only a matter of convention.</p> \n<p>Let’s turn to the use of psychedelic drugs for treatment of psychiatric problems. For example, ayahuasca, which has been found effective in the treatment of depression.</p> \n<p>Ayahuasca is a herbal brew that was used by Native Americans for ritual purposes. It contains two relevant active substances. One works on serotonin receptors, the second effectively inhibits the breaking-down, thanks to which it’s possible to achieve a prolonged effect of the substance, after we drink it.</p> \n<p>We should explain that the drinking of ayahuasca is a ceremony performed under the guidance of a shaman. I know a few people who have tried it. They described a psychedelic experience, hallucinations.</p> \n<p>Yes. Obviously, the well-known ceremony was not performed as part of the clinical experiment that was done in a Brazilian university. The subjects, all of whom were suffering from depression and had not been helped by conventional medication, received either ayahuasca or a placebo under the supervision of the researchers. The experiment found that ayahuasca reduced the depressive symptoms, whereas the patients who received the placebo didn’t report any improvement – in fact, in some patients the depressive symptoms became even more acute.</p> \n<p>But what was really interesting in that study was that a correlation was found between the intensity of the mystical experience, which was quantified through all kinds of questionnaires, and the improvement in the patients’ condition. The more powerful their experience, the more the depressive symptoms were weakened. That’s interesting, because in another study too, one that used psilocybin, which is produced by magic mushrooms, a connection was found between the intensity of the mystical experience and the level in the blood of a substance that is a product of the breakup of nicotine. In other words, the stronger the mystical experience, the less people smoked.</p> \n<p>So there is a correlation between the intensity of the mystical experience and the therapeutic effect.</p> \n<p>The conjecture is that the mechanism that causes the mystical sensations is also responsible for relief in the depressive symptoms. Of course, it’s impossible to prove the existence of a causal relationship.</p> \n<p>Yes, but it can be assumed that there’s a connection to the release from the shackles of consciousness. The question arises of the degree to which consciousness creates the pathology.</p> \n<p>These substances cause a blurring of the senses, liberation. They open the doors of perception, in the words of Aldous Huxley, and that allows us to be exposed to things and content that had been simply hidden from us. Brain scans done on people under the influence of LSD show that their whole brain lights up. There is very powerful activity, a great many regions in the brain are communicating with one another, the sensory experience changes.</p> \n<p>Studies on LSD found that one of its effects is to dissolve the sense of the self – a Buddhist truth for liberation from suffering.</p> \n<p>It’s not by chance that psychedelic drugs help in the treatment of mental illnesses more than other drugs. Cannabis also affects the physiological system, but with psychedelic drugs the effect on the body is minor; their primary influence is on the brain and on consciousness. Psychedelic drugs will not be used to relieve heart disease, say.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the description of heightened brain activity and a change in the sensory experience sounds similar to what happens in a psychotic attack.</p> \n<p>I suppose that’s true – people undergoing a psychotic attack have powerful experiences, hear voices, see colors. That raises the question of whether psychedelic drugs are likely to aggravate schizophrenia or ease it. In any event, they are not used in cases of psychoses. Depression, in contrast, is not a psychosis, and psychedelic drugs can be used in an attempt to treat it. A study conducted in England tried to treat people suffering from depression that is immune to medications by means of psilocybin. The subjects underwent three brain scans in the experiment and immediately after the mushroom treatment. All of them reported a relief of the depression. The scans showed a change in brain activity.</p> \n<p>That experiment examined long-term influences. How is it possible that it relieved the symptoms over time? After all, psychiatric drugs need to be taken daily.</p> \n<p>That’s an interesting question, to which I don’t think they have an answer. We can only surmise. I find it hard to believe that the use of a drug caused a change in the brain chemistry, in the neurotransmitters. Possibly it’s a matter of dosage. The patients reported that it worked on them like a reboot of the brain. Despite the positive results, it was a preliminary study with a small number of patients, and we have to remember that this substance has side effects, so I wouldn’t recommend taking it just for the fun of it, and certainly if anyone wants to use it to relieve depression, that has to be done under medical supervision.</p> \n<p>It’s interesting whether the patients themselves were able to overcome their prejudices about psychedelic drugs. It seems to me that when they’re used, the expectations shape the experience.</p> \n<p>In indigenous cultures the psychedelic drugs are perceived as legitimate and are used in ceremonies and so forth. Western culture views them as something foreign, because they come from a foreign culture, and Western culture is not tolerant of anything that is “other.” Consider cannabis, for example, which was in widespread use in pre-Mandate Palestine, but under the British was added to the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Why? In my opinion, because they wanted to make it clear that they intended to impose a different culture here.</p> \n<p>And the natives here are “drinking hashish” [reference to a line from the 1978 film “Lemon Popsicle”].</p> \n<p>Yes. When the Spaniards arrived in South America they also banned the use of psychedelic substances, and for the very same reason. It’s something deeper and bigger than the approach to drugs as such – it’s an approach to what is different from you, something that doesn’t exist in your culture. The very definition of certain substances as “drugs” is a matter of culture. What is alcohol? Isn’t it a drug? Isn’t nicotine a drug? The word “drug” is used to indicate something that is foreign, not to say threatening, to our culture.</p>",

        "text":["<p>UMAN, Ukraine - On the first morning of the year of 5779, most of the Shacharit prayers in Uman were over. Thousands were streaming out of the synagogues in search of wine and cakes to make kiddush. It was nearly eleven and a few stragglers’&nbsp;minyanim, huddled from the rain under leaky tarpaulin awnings, were still ongoing around the building containing the&nbsp;tziyun, the cloth-covered slab of marble above Rabbi Nachman of Breslav’s grave.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Where are we? Where are they up to?&quot; asked one late arrival as he stubbed out his cigarette. A bleary-eyed, overhung man, tallit over one shoulder and a wide white knitted kippa pushed back over his stubbly graying hair. Those standing around barely stifled their laughter, but didn’t speak. A shofar was blowing its 100 blasts. To everyone else it was clear at what stage they were.</p> \n<p>But nothing is entirely clear in Uman.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;In Uman, Jewish Pilgrims Bring Chaos to Ukraine During High Holidays</p> \n<p>Over 40,000 Jews, nearly entirely men, arrived this week for Rosh Hashanah&nbsp;to gather around the grave of Rabbi Nachman, who died here in 1810, in this poor and nondescript town in central Ukraine. In less than three decades, the site has been transformed into the largest annual Jewish pilgrimage outside of Israel.</p> \n<p>It is seemingly an incredible resurrection of the &quot;dead Hassidim&quot; - a once small sect who, during Rabbi Nachman’s life and even more after his death, were relentlessly persecuted, first by their fellow Jews, especially rival Hassidic sects, then by the Russian Czarist and Soviet authorities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But is this really a Breslaver revival? Only a tiny fraction of those arriving in Uman are descended from the original families who gathered around Rabbi Nachman and his original followers. Others are new adherents of one of the many Breslav offshoots that have proliferated in Israel, but the overwhelming majority do not lead anything coming close to a Hasidic way of life, and are Breslavers for barely a couple of days a year. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Why do they come? The standard answer is: &quot;We came for&nbsp;Rabbeinu&quot;&nbsp;(our rabbi/teacher). &quot;Rabbeinu,&quot; as a generic term, has replaced the name place Uman. Most Breslavers will say, &quot;We are going to Rabbeinu for Rosh Hashanah&quot; - echoing Rabbi Nachman’s words: &quot;My Rosh Hashanah is above all.&quot;</p> \n<p>There are hundreds of pages of sayings and exhortations attributed to Rabbi Nachman; most appeared only posthumously. In recent years, besides the Rosh Hashanah pilgrimage, the Breslaver custom that has become most widespread among traditional Jews is the&nbsp;Tikkun HaKlali&nbsp;- the General Healing, or Remedy. Ten chapters he selected from the Book of Psalms.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Before his death, Rabbi Nachman promised that, &quot;Whoever shall come to my grave and say these ten psalms there, and give a penny for charity in my name, even if his sins have grown great and mighty, God forbid, I will try and make an effort to the length and breadth [of all creation] to save and redeem him.&quot; He committed himself to pulling the sinner &quot;by his side-locks out from the depths of hell.&quot;</p> \n<p>Elsewhere he said these ten psalms are especially useful for cleansing oneself of the sin of &quot;an impure omission,&quot; or, as masturbation (or any other improper ejaculation) is described in Jewish tradition,&nbsp;p’gam ha’brit&nbsp;- defiling the covenant. (Rabbi Nachman also calls it &quot;Lilith,&quot; because obviously the she-devil is to blame).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The edition of the&nbsp;Tikkun HaKlali which can be found at the&nbsp;gravesite makes it clear already in the second paragraph of its introduction that &quot;the main issue of&nbsp;Tikun HaKlali is fixing the defiling of the covenant, which includes transgressions such as masturbation, nightly emissions, and also thought, words and actions that are connected to adultery.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One Israeli educator who has spent years working in Ukraine insists that, &quot;for many of the men who come to Uman, the fact that you can go to the&nbsp;tziyun, say ten&nbsp;tehillim, and be cleansed from your guiltiest thoughts and deeds is a major motive.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Rolling With the Na Nachs, the New, High-spirited Hasidic Sect</p> \n<p>Of the men I asked at Uman, all were aware of that particular attribute of&nbsp;Tikkun HaKlali, but none admitted that was why they were there. &quot;Sure, it’s in your mind when you say&nbsp;Tikkun,&quot; said Gilad, a contractor from Bet Shemesh. &quot;But it’s not like we’re Catholics who go to confession on Sunday and wash away all their sins. It’s simply something&nbsp;Rabbeinu said we need to do. So we do it.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I haven’t believed for many years in the rabbinical concepts of prayer, sin and God, but I do believe in&nbsp;minhag ha’makom&nbsp;- respecting the local custom, which is why when I’m in a synagogue, of any stream or persuasion, I’ll pray. So when in Uman.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Saying&nbsp;Tikkun HaKlali by Rabbi Nachman’s&nbsp;tziyun at any moment of Rosh Hashanah is nearly impossible, unless you wait, and inch forward patiently for an hour at least. The spot in the wall in the main synagogue, where the slab juts out, is constantly surrounded by thousands of people pressed against each other.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I chose my moment with care. As the new year began on Sunday evening, it started to rain in Uman, transforming the unpaved alleyways to channels of mud churned up by thousands of pilgrim feet, and tracked into the synagogue. As Maariv ended, they rushed out to queue for dinner at the massive communal kitchens - and I thought I would have my chance. But there were still hundreds who had the same idea as me.</p> \n<p>I picked up a copy of the&nbsp;Tikkun and began slowly saying the ten psalms, pushing in to the scrum, in the hope that by the time I reached the tenth, I would be by the&nbsp;tziyun.</p> \n<p>Towards the end of the ninth (Psalm 137 - &quot;By the rivers of Babylon&quot;), I was still a few feet away, and there were at least a dozen bodies between me and the wall. A tiny gap opened, not wide enough to get through, but as I reached in, I managed to grasp the smooth marble edge just as I was reciting &quot;Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the rock.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I managed to say the entire last psalm of Tikkun HaKlali (150 - &quot;Halleluya, Praise God in his sanctuary&quot;), holding on to Rabbeinu for dear life, as all around me men swirled, shoved and pushed to reach, frantically, his grave. Trying to stay on my feet, saying the psalm's six short verses, I had my moment.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I’ve been to every kind of Jewish ritual gathering you can imagine, but never been engulfed by such a disparate and diverse range of Jews. I could literally feel it. So many different fabrics and skin colors touching me at once.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I can recall to my right, elbowing me in the ribs, a stocky Hassid in a white silk&nbsp;bekitshe. In front of him, with his pelvis contorted backwards, a young guy in a stylish blue linen suit, weeping&nbsp;tehillim in a French accent. Pressed up against my face - an Ethiopian-Israeli, with a hassid’s ringlets and a shiny new black synthetic&nbsp;kappote, swaying devoutly back and forth, and crouching right beneath me, nearly-prostate and touching the&nbsp;tziyun with his fingertips, a teenage boy in a denim jacket.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I’ve got stuck in similar human compressions before, when thousands tried to reach out and touch their rabbi, or rabbi’s shrine. But they were always of the same color, dressed uniformly and praying or singing in indistinguishable accents. Now I was hearing the same words in every possible pronunciation of Hebrew.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I realized that I may be standing by the grave of a Hasidic rabbi, in a dreary backwater of what was once the Jewish Pale of Settlement, but most of the Jews surrounding me were not Ashkenazim. They were descended from families who had lived not long ago in the Maghreb, Yemen, Ethiopia, Iran and Iraq and every other non-European diaspora that ever existed. If I was writing for one of the more enlightened American Jewish publications, I would say that a majority of pilgrims at Uman are Jews of color. Jews of every color.</p> \n<p>&quot;You were hit by Uman’s&nbsp;achdus,&quot; a friend who I described my experience to later, and who has been on many a pilgrimage, said to me, using the Yiddish word for unity, rather than the Hebrew one. And he was right. Because Uman on Rosh Hashanah is a unique place of Jewish unity (if you overlook the fact that it’s only men), and as one American businessman described it to me on the flight over, &quot;a non-judgmental zone. A place where any Jew can come and be accepted.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Is the Idea of the Jewish People Chauvinistic and Antiquated?&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>If you want a picture of the Jewish future, head to Uman for Rosh Hashanah. It’s a hellish place - where Israeli and Ukrainian organized crime gangs and cults of violent rabbis have staked out their fiefdoms along the dank Pushkina Street, leading to the gravesite. A town where Haredi politicians, convicted rapists, dark money and blind devotion hold sway, and stories of miracles mix with rumors of rank prostitution, abandoned exploited teenagers and the whiff of low-grade weed. Uman is every progressive Jew’s nightmare.</p> \n<p>But look beyond the filth, and there’s also a more optimistic vision of the future. A blurring of divisions and breakdown of hierarchies. Uman is a place where the power of the rabbis, who tried to prevent their followers from participating, has waned. Where there is no longer any distance between Ashkenazim or Mizrahim, ultra-Orthodox and secular, Israel and the Diaspora.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At times it seems that in Uman,&nbsp;kedushe and&nbsp;tumeh, the sacred and profane, have combined - and you can see why rival Hassidic leaders in the nineteenth century tried, and failed, to brand Rabbi Nachman and his followers as Sabbatean heretics. And why his vision has become such a popular alternative to the other forms of Jewish life.</p> \n<p>I've been writing about the different strands of Judaism in Israel and abroad for the last 21 years but have always turned down any offer or opportunity of going to Uman for Rosh Hashanah. Other colleagues went, but I thought (and hoped) that it was a passing phase, just like the craze for certain holy men in Israel. I was wrong.</p> \n<p>The passion for&nbsp;mekubalim&nbsp;[mystics] and other alleged miracle-makers has weakened somewhat, as some died, and others were revealed as tax-evaders and sexual predators. But Rabbi Nachman is already dead and therefore can’t be diminished by scandal. The cult of Breslav has endured and the Uman pilgrimage has become a year-round industry.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel Is Not Becoming a Jewish Fundamentalist State&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>Entering Uman, just off the Kiev-Odessa Highway, it looks like just any other dirt-poor Ukrainian township, but go up a side-street just before the town center, and you find yourself in a Hassidic Diagon Alley.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Every available bit of land on Pushkina has been bought up by shell companies, and the street is lined with synagogues in various stages of construction, small kosher hotels and hoardings offering holiday apartments and time-shares &quot;right next to&nbsp;Rabbeinu.&quot;</p> \n<p>Facing the street are squalid eateries offering burekas baked in rancid butter, and rolls filled with questionable meat masquerading as Jerusalem mixed grill. The shops offer a wide range of Breslav-themed trinkets, knock-off Judaica and cheap jewelry for the &quot;wife of valor&quot; waiting back home.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For some original Breslavers, including the descendants of those who risked their lives trying to make the pilgrimage during Soviet times, and who rushed here the moment the Iron Curtain came down, the crass commercialization of Uman is too much. They now stay away. Rabbi Nachman may have exhorted his followers to come to Uman on Rosh Hashanah, but he also said that &quot;all my being is the land of Israel,&quot; providing a useful loophole for those who prefer venerate him in Zion. But there are many who complain - and continue to come.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Natan Geffen, a lifeguard from Tiberias who has been coming on and off since his ultra-Orthodox parents brought him twenty years ago as a child, says: &quot;I don’t like way it’s become a mass event, so I stay at a hotel outside the main area. I still feel connected to Rabbeinu, though I’m no longer Haredi, and to his teachings - that all you need is one moment for&nbsp;teshuva [repentance]. I find one moment to go to the&nbsp;tziyun and that’s enough.&quot;</p> \n<p>A walk down Pushkina also shows Breslav has won out, for now at least, against other streams of Orthodox Judaism which sought to deride it. Rabbi Nachman’s inclusivity and the Uman experience has drawn in so many members of other groups that their formal leadership have been forced to join as well.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;What the Radicalization of Israel's ultra-Orthodox Community Looks Like From the Inside</p> \n<p>On one large hoarding, there is a sign dedicating a communal kitchen in the memory of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, founder of the anti-Zionist Satmar Hasidic sect, rather aptly, right next to large pictures of Donald Trump and Mike Pence and the slogan &quot;Uman Loves Trump.&quot; Nearby is a synagogue named after Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who during his lifetime was one of the greatest opponents of the pilgrimage. &quot;Every good Jew, who has sense, dedicates the night of Rosh Hashanah to his family,&quot; he said, scathingly, in 2007. &quot;Everyone eats and drinks together. That’s the&nbsp;chag [festival]. What do you do on a&nbsp;chag? You have to rejoice. So do you rejoice - or go to a cemetery?&quot;</p> \n<p>Eleven years since Rabbi Ovadia gave that sermon, his visage smiles benevolently down on the revelers on Pushkina. As does that of another old rival of Breslav, the Lubavitcher Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson. His Chabad movement, with its ironclad hierarchy and cerebral theology, was always diametrically opposed to Rabbi Nachman’s anarchic ways. You can hardly find two more opposite ideologies within Hasidism. But now there’s a Chabad House on Pushkina as well.</p> \n<p>Another stream trying to gain a foothold in Uman are the religious nationalists, who have their own&nbsp;minyan and&nbsp;shiurim&nbsp;[lectures] here through Rosh Hashanah. The settlers’ ideological camp prefer, of course, to focus on Rabbi Nachman’s teachings on Eretz Yisrael, and many of its leading rabbis have also spoken out against leaving Zion for the pilgrimage, but they don’t want to miss out either.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to Breslav lore, Rabbi Nachman visited Israel in 1798, though strangely, he left after six months and never made it to Jerusalem. Breslav’s relationship with Israel remains complicated. One of the oldest Breslav groups, based around the old &quot;Shul&quot; in Jerusalem’s Mea Shearim quarter, are still members of the anti-Zionist Old&nbsp;Yishuv. Their presence was felt in the leaflets advising yeshiva students on how to avoid IDF service, but they are a small minority.</p> \n<p>Over three-quarters of the pilgrims are Israelis, though there were large contingents from the U.S., Britain and France. This year’s airlift from Ben-Gurion Airport consisted of over 80 flights; at one point I counted ten El Al jets on the tarmac at Kiev’s Borispol airport.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, this was about large numbers of &quot;ordinary&quot; Israelis leaving the holy land just before one of the holiest days on the calendar.&nbsp;And just as with many new mass religious movements and events, the motivations of the participants are highly disparate, and often far more earthy and escapist than mystical.</p> \n<p>&quot;I’d say that roughly only half of those who come to Uman do so for religious reasons, and the other half are simply the dregs who come to get drunk, take drugs and visit prostitutes,&quot; says an Israeli diplomat who has dealt with the darker side of the pilgrimage.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Rosh Hashanah ended on Tuesday night, in a small temporary office set up by the Israeli embassy in Kiev, a consul sat at one table dealing with a long queue of pilgrims who had managed to lose their passports. At another, two superintendents summed up the list of casualties. Twenty uniformed Israeli police officers, along with more discreet members of other security services, were deployed this year to Uman, to help keep order along with hundreds of their Ukrainian colleagues, some of whom, carrying Kalashnikovs, manned road-blocks at the entry-points to the area around the&nbsp;tziyun. In a nearby clearing, emergency vehicles and a Medevac helicopter were ready.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The official Israeli report mentioned &quot;a number of assaults, stabbing, theft, missing persons found, entries denied and lost passports.&quot; One of the diplomats told me, &quot;all in all, we came better prepared and it wasn’t as bad as last year, when one stabbing nearly ended in a death.&quot;</p> \n<p>Eight years ago, an Israeli Breslav Hassid was stabbed to death in an anti-Semitic attack. Three years ago, the body of 28 year-old Amir Ohana was found three days after Rosh Hashanah in one of the ponds near the&nbsp;tziyun. The cause of his death is still unclear. This year, a 23 year-old American citizen died in Uman&nbsp;of advanced terminal cancer, and one of the handful of Israeli women, who remained on the sidelines, gave birth on site.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Hasidic Pilgrims and Ukrainian Sex Workers: Prayer and Pleasure in Uman</p> \n<p>Regarding prostitution at Uman. I’ve heard all the stories, including from Israeli diplomats and law-enforcement officials. And I’ve spent enough of my career reporting on the ultra-Orthodox community to have no illusions that they are any less inclined to vice than any other community. But I walked and drove around Uman for two and a half days, and didn’t see anything to indicate much prostitution was going on. Uman isn’t a sex-tourism destination like Kiev or Odessa, where it’s pretty much out in the open.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Law professor Yuval Elbashan, who in the past headed the legal clinics and a program against sex-trafficking at Hebrew University, spent Rosh Hashanah this year in Uman and wrote on Facebook: &quot;I did not see any prostitutes or women being sold anywhere. And I didn’t stop looking.&quot;</p> \n<p>He based his conclusion, that the rumors are either baseless or greatly exaggerated, also on the sheer scale of the number of pilgrims, packed closely together. &quot;It’s too public, too exposed to your own community,&quot; he wrote. And on the economics of Uman, where even the most basic plane tickets, lodgings and food will cost a pilgrim at least 1000 dollars altogether. &quot;During this period, to go to a 'cheap' prostitute when there are (sadly) so many much cheaper and discreet opportunities,&quot; Elbashan concluded, &quot;is a bit illogical.&quot;</p> \n<p>I have never met an Uman pilgrim who admitted going to a prostitute there, but some have told me they know others who have. I agree, though, with Elbashan, that the image of &quot;a sin city filled with Haredi whoremongers&quot; is greatly exaggerated, and there is certainly no reason to believe it happens any more than with any other group of men traveling to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>From what I’ve been able to glean, whatever prostitution that does take place in Uman is out-of-sight, in discreet apartments hired for the pilgrimage’s high-rollers, members of Israeli crime families who control many of the businesses on Pushkina and are rumored to have a stake in the chartered flights cartel, which keeps the prices of a round-trip at over 700 dollars. And of course there are those who spend a day or two on a stopover in Kiev or Odessa, but most of the pilgrims are bussed straight from the airport, to Uman and back again.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Why write about the ugly things here?&quot; so many people asked me in Uman. &quot;You should write about the incredible uplifting moments here. About thousands of people shouting &quot;Barchu&quot; [&quot;Let us bless…&quot;] at the start of the first&nbsp;Maariv prayer, and &quot;HaMelech&quot; [&quot;the King&quot;] at Shacharit. About&nbsp;the sound of shofars from dozens of minyanim blasting simultaneously. And what about the&nbsp;tashlich [a symbolic ‘throwing away’ of sins] on the river? Some young men even threw their iPhones into the water.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And yes, all that does go on in Uman, but I’m a recovering addict of religious ecstasy - and suspicious of spiritual highs that are so often followed by despair.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And I met so many Jews in Uman who admitted that they didn’t come for spirituality, and barely went to any of the prayers.</p> \n<p>Some admitted they were just there to hang out with friends, or to see for themselves what all the fuss was about. &quot;Just like I went to India to see Hindu pilgrimages, I decided why not see a Jewish pilgrimage,&quot; one Israeli told me. Others wanted &quot;just a moment on Rosh Hashanah with Rabbeinu,&quot; and some simply felt so out of place in their own communities, they just wanted to be somewhere on the holy days where they wouldn’t be judged for dressing differently.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;I grew up in a religious family but I don’t keep mitzvot anymore,” said Nerya, a former special-forces soldier and currently a computer sciences student. “I come to Uman and here I’m religious for one week each year. Here I feel somehow connected, this is where all the barriers between the groups collapse.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Everyone here has some kind of Jewish PTSD,&quot; says Chaim, who was born in to a Haredi family in Bnei Brak, and is today a secular winemaker living in Ramat Gan. &quot;It’s like one long group therapy session. This is the one place where you can believe, pray, speak to God. Out of choice.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Tuesday night, as Rosh Hashanah ended, there was a rave on Pushkina. After two days of prayers, hundreds of pilgrims were dancing in a frenzy to electronic music and lasers, while the more staid ones packed or shopped for souvenirs and gifts at little stalls set up by local Ukrainian residents, anxious for their piece of the action.&nbsp;Young men and boys, some looking no older than 12, begged for tzedaka, money for their ticket back home.</p> \n<p>Beneath the large portrait of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, I met Gad Shushan, a 29 year-old scribe of Torah scrolls, who made contact with me through Twitter. Gad is on his third pilgrimage.</p> \n<p>Like most religious Sephardi Israelis, he abides by Rabbi Ovadia’s rulings but says that, &quot;many Sephardim like me, who don’t have a natural community, feel at home here.&quot; He came for the first time eight years ago, but says that in the intervening years, he stayed away. “I was in a period of overload, worshipping God beyond my capability. Coming here was too much.&quot;</p> \n<p>Like so many in Uman, he has also been on a religious journey, which led him to leave the Haredi township of Beitar Illit in the West Bank and move south to the Negev town of Arad, where he prefers to live in a secular neighborhood.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This time he came with his brother Avraham and friends. &quot;I came less for spiritual strengthening and more for rest. Besides praying, we spent our time eating and drinking together. There’s a special atmosphere here, and around Breslav in general. They don’t care how you dress or look.</p> \n<p>&quot;As someone who grew up in a hardcore Haredi environment but left that environment, though I’m still religious, that’s the key. Other Haredim, the moment you start looking different, they have a problem with you. Breslav doesn’t. It’s religion without rabbis, without rabbinical authority. I think that’s much better.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Maybe that’s why 40,000 Jews left their families on Rosh Hashanah and flew to Uman. The other traditional or modern brands of Judaism have become too stultifying. None of them offer a similar sense of acceptance. Most Jews leave Uman and don’t become Breslavers in their daily lives, but they return for something that’s unavailable anywhere else.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Despite coming to Uman mainly for a vacation, Gad still felt uplifted in one place. We walked away from the raucous main strip on Pushkina to the Kloyz.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In eastern Europe, a &quot;kloyz&quot; was a synagogue and place of learning that was privately-owned and functioned independently from the main Jewish community, usually belonging to a separate Hassidic sect or other religious group, operating by its own customs. In the nineteenth century, the Breslav Kloyz in Uman was shunned by most of the local Jews who despised Rabbi Nachman’s followers. It was destroyed by the Soviet authorities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While for many, the synagogue over the&nbsp;tziyun is the focal point of Uman, the Kloyz, nowadays a large prefabricated structure packed with hundreds of long wooden synagogue benches, is where the traditional Breslav&nbsp;niggunim [Hassidic melodies]&nbsp;and&nbsp;minhagim are observed in full.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Despite being recommended to me by connoisseurs as the best place to pray in Uman, I steered clear of the Kloyz for most of Rosh Hashanah. In recent years it has been the scenes of fights between various Breslav factions, chiefly the violent Shuvu Banim sect, led by Eliezer Berland, who was convicted in 2016 on three counts of sexual assault against wives of his followers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rabbi Berland’s prison sentence was cut short last year due to bowel cancer, but despite being shunned by many in Breslav, he still retains a considerable following and last Rosh Hashanah, a fight broke out as they forced his way in to the Kloyz. This year, the 80 year-old Berland was there again.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To preserve a tense ceasefire, none of the Breslav rabbis was honored with an aliyah, so the Shuvu Banim thugs couldn’t claim Berland was disrespected. At one point in the prayers, Berland began singing a particular&nbsp;niggun. There was shushing from other parts of the Kloyz, as others tried to drown him out, but finally his tune was allowed to catch on, just to preserve the peace.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But now, with Rosh Hashanah over and Berland gone, all was sweetness and light in the Kloyz. The benches had been moved back and smiling Hassidim were dancing in a circle. In the center an improvised klezmer band, with a fiddler in a white&nbsp;kittel, was playing&nbsp;niggunim, and the clarinet-player was perched atop of the&nbsp;bima.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>No synagogue in the world, no matter its religious persuasion, would ever allow someone to defile a&nbsp;bima, the place where the Torah scrolls are read from, with their shoes. Nowhere else. But here in Uman, it made perfect sense.&nbsp;</p>",

The family said it informed Palestinian security forces, but those were unable to locate him in the tomb's vicinity.</p> \n<p>Jabarin's mother said after the attack that she came to a checkpoint in the Southern Hebron Hills, where she turned to Israeli soldiers and warned them that her son intends to carry out&nbsp;an attack.

He lived in Efrat, a settlement outside of Jerusalem&nbsp;that is especially popular among religious nationalist American immigrants.</p> \n<p>Fuld was active on Youtube and Facebook and co-hosted a show on i24, an Israeli English-language cable station. Among the videos he posted was a series called: “Ari Fuld: Fighting Action with Truth.”</p> \n<p>His younger brother Hillel Fuld who also describes himself as a tech vlogger and blogger, tweeted: &quot;He lived as a hero and died as a hero. My big bro is gone. Thanks for the messages. Really.

        "text":["<p>Thousands of Israelis walked out of their workplaces and took to the streets Sunday, to protest the government’s denial of gay men’s rights to have children through surrogacy.</p> \n<p>The protest over the legislation highlights how in a country where marriage is governed by religious authorities, parenthood is seen as the key to equality.</p> \n<p>The new legislation loosened surrogacy regulations in Israel, giving single women and women unable to become pregnant for medical reasons the right to apply for state support for surrogacy. However, an additional clause that would have granted the same rights to single fathers – and, by extension, gay couples – was nixed.</p> \n<p>What sparked the protest?</p> \n<p>Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stunned and infuriated the LGBT community with a dramatic flip-flop on a commitment that would legalize supporting surrogate births for single people in Israel. Netanyahu promised, but then withdrew, his support for a clause that would allow single men, as well as women, to access surrogacy.</p> \n<p>Until last week, eligibility for legal surrogacy services in Israel was only available to “a man and woman who are a couple.” The bill brought to the Knesset by the country’s Health Ministry proposed also giving the same right to single women who wished to have children.</p> \n<p>All attempts to explicitly make single-sex couples eligible were rejected early on in the legislative process.</p> \n<p>The LGBT community rallied behind a widely supported effort to also allow single men – whether heterosexual or homosexual – to be allowed to father children using a surrogate under the new law. Early last week, the prime minister pledged he would back such a change, even making a video declaring his support.</p> \n<p>But at the last minute he reversed his position in the face of opposition from ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) parties, who threatened to withhold their support for the Jewish nation-state bill – a top priority for Netanyahu – and threatened the stability of his governing coalition.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu defended his decision, saying he did so in order not to derail the entire bill and deprive single women from accessing the right to surrogates. He promised that if a separate bill extending rights to men was proposed, he would support it.</p> \n<p>Wait, didn’t Israel just have a massive Gay Pride Month? Is it LGBT-friendly or not?</p> \n<p>Israel has made tremendous inroads when it comes to public acceptance of LGBT lifestyles in recent decades. Homosexuality is not only accepted in liberal left-wing circles, but a leading member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, MK Amir Ohana, is also openly gay. In fact, it was Ohana who proposed the clause on the Health Ministry’s bill that would allow for the inclusion of single men.</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv in particular has a thriving LGBT culture: it was recently named the world’s leading gay travel destination.</p> \n<p>Openly gay and lesbian individuals can also be found in leading roles in the business community – hence the unusually high levels of corporate support for Sunday’s protest, particularly in the high-tech community.</p> \n<p>For a time, Israel led the way among Western nations when it came to legally establishing equality for gay partners on financial rights, particularly the Tel Aviv Municipality. The Israeli army has also pioneered the creation of guidelines for both gay and&nbsp;transgender soldiers, due to the fact that the country’s universal draft brings these populations into the military at a far higher rate than armies that rely solely on volunteers.</p> \n<p>But when it comes to matters of personal and family status, the LGBT community hits a glass ceiling: All matters of marriage, divorce and the status of children are either completely controlled or heavily influenced by the ultra-Orthodox parties, who push back against any legislation condoning homosexuality – which in their eyes contravenes Jewish law.</p> \n<p>There’s no same-sex marriage in Israel. Why is this anger over surrogacy and not marriage rights?</p> \n<p>The inability of gay couples to legally marry in Israel is indeed frustrating and infuriating for the growing number of same-sex couples, who must marry abroad for their status to be officially recognized in Israel or hold alternative ceremonies in Israel that don’t carry legal weight. The idea of legalizing same-sex marriage enjoys widespread public support.</p> \n<p>But in this struggle, the LGBT community understands that its problem is part of a much larger issue: There are many groups who are unable to legally marry in Israel due to the absence of any form of civil marriage.</p> \n<p>Because of the stranglehold of the Orthodox Chief Rabbinate in Israel on marriage, there is no framework that allows two individuals of different religions to legally marry. Furthermore, Jewish citizens are often required to go through agonizing efforts to “prove” their Jewishness before the state will agree to marry them as Jews.</p> \n<p>Within the Jewish population, there are other groups forbidden to marry, such as divorced women who wish to wed a Cohen (people with the surname Cohen are descendants of the priests on the Temple 2,000 years ago, according to Jewish tradition), or those who are considered mamzers (certain illegitimate children under Jewish religious law).</p> \n<p>Repeated efforts to introduce legislation that would establish civil marriage have failed. So LGBT couples are not alone in their fight for marriage equality. And like the other groups who are discriminated against in marriage, their weddings abroad are legal: they have been recognized as such since 2006.</p> \n<p>However, when it comes to having children – in both the case of adoption and now in surrogacy – the LGBT community is the sole target of what it views as a violation of a basic right.</p> \n<p>What makes this protest uniquely Israeli?</p> \n<p>Whether it is embedded in Jewish DNA or the scars of losses in the Holocaust, Israel is an unusually child-centric country, with a culture and social norms that emphasize and revolve heavily around family life.</p> \n<p>This is borne out in the country’s fertility rates. Israel is an outlier in the Western world when it comes to the number of children per family: Its rate of fertility has been rising, not falling.</p> \n<p>Even when one excludes the two populations with the largest families – the ultra-Orthodox and Arab communities – the Jewish state stands out compared to the rest of the developed world when it comes to its enthusiasm for being fruitful and multiplying.</p> \n<p>Since the establishment of the state 70 years ago, Israeli government policies have been explicitly pro-family. In recent years, this has been evident in the accessibility and affordability of IVF for couples and single women facing infertility issues. Fertility treatments take place in Israel at 13 times the level of the United States on a per-capita basis.</p> \n<p>In Israeli society, bearing and raising children is viewed as a basic right. And LGBT culture has been singled out for how central a role child-rearing has played in it.</p> \n<p>Part of the success in penetrating the Israeli cultural mainstream has been that, for the most part, gay men and lesbians have been deeply interested in settling down and establishing families. Over the past decade, Israel has seen a baby boom among both gay men and lesbians. But due to biology, only gay men have been forced to invest tens of thousands of dollars and face years of bureaucratic hurdles in the efforts to realize their dream of becoming fathers.</p>",

The sign is entirely in Hebrew, as if only Hebrew-speakers left the village every day on their way to work or school.</p> \n<p>Further down the road, on the busy street that passes through one of the big Arab villages, all the businesses – the grocery stores, the beauty salons, the car dealers and the restaurants – have Hebrew signs and Western-sounding names like “Aphrodite in the Village,” “America Restaurant,” “Fashion Attraction” and “Tr&egrave;s Jolie.” Most are written just in Hebrew; a few are also written in Arabic.</p> \n<p>The only signs that are in Arabic alone are those advertising doctors or lawyers. Those aren’t meant for Jews. Jews generally don’t frequent the clinics of Arab doctors or the offices of Arab lawyers. (Many would also prefer to be served by Jewish pharmacists, but those seem to be fast disappearing from the landscape.) So there’s no point spending money on Hebrew signs for the small number of Jewish customers.</p> \n<p>The signs and posters aren’t the only evidence of the weakening of the Arabic language. Ordinary conversations on Arab streets resemble conversations between Hebrew-speakers and new Jewish immigrants. But in that case, Arabs are speaking a Hebraized Arabic to each other. It feels rare to hear an entire string of thoughts that doesn’t bounce back and forth between Arabic and Hebrew.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israeli Arabs are strangers in their own language&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>The poor state of knowledge of Arabic is one of the greatest failures of the Arab public schools. When Arab college students can’t phrase an answer in proper Arabic, or understand scholarly literature written in Arabic, the question of Arabic’s standing – whether it’s an official language or only has “special status” – becomes secondary.</p> \n<p>The outcry from liberal Jews against the section of the nation-state law&nbsp;that demotes Arabic from an official language is certainly heartwarming. But how can we complain about the law when Arabs themselves treat their mother tongue so disdainfully? What point is there in holding up the language banner when just about all matters of livelihood, business, studies and communications are conducted in Hebrew?</p> \n<p>If Arabic’s status symbolizes the equality enjoyed by Arab citizens, or at least their recognition as a minority, the fight over it can’t be a monopoly of liberal Jews making the Arabic issue part of a broader struggle against the government and its racism. Above all, this cause belongs to the Arabs, and it has to go further than replacing Hebrew signs with Arabic signs, using Arabic words for Hebrew words that have crept into the language, and having Arabic-language forms in government offices.</p> \n<p>Arabic’s status is closely linked to the Arab community’s status. And an Arab who isn’t willing to fight for his language’s prestige in his own community can’t then complain about his language’s inferiority nationally.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Arab citizens want to integrate into Israel but refuse to be a trampled minority | Analysis</p> \n<p>Last year, for example, 47,000 Arab students were enrolled in colleges and universities in Israel, about 15 percent of the total. How many courses (aside from Arabic language courses) include an Arabic reading list? How many courses are taught in Arabic? Did any Arab Knesset member or other Arab leaders, the Arab student council or Arab chambers of commerce call for a strike at the universities or a boycott of the banks until they treated Arabic as an integral part of their Arab identity?</p> \n<p>If Israel’s Arabs are ready to leave it to liberal Jews to worry about their identity, they shouldn’t be surprised by the state that things have come to.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Maybe it’s a matter of publicity and accessibility, but between the reviving Levinsky Market and the Hacarmel Market, already a tourist magnet, the Hatikva Market remains an underdog that’s not striving to impress anyone. It’s cheaper than Hacarmel and certainly more spacious, and although you won’t yet find stylish little places packed with young people, like you do at Levinsky, the Hatikva Market offers an unpretentious shopping experience and some of the best fare you’ll find anywhere in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>The Hatikva Market was built in the mid-1930s as a response to the Arab Revolt, when residents of the village of Salama stopped coming to the neighborhood to sell their goods. What began with a few produce stalls put up by local residents of Iraqi, Yemeni, Syrian and Iranian background grew into a sprawling market spread out along the triangle of Ha’Etzel, Hahagana and Hatikva Streets. Thirteen years ago, the market was renovated in an effort to attract more shoppers and make it more accessible to locals and tourists. It’s no secret that the market and the neighborhood frequently are sources of unflattering stories related to the new mix of residents in the neighborhood, but if you can leave the news reports and any prejudices aside, you’ll find a lively and authentic place that is definitely worth a visit – especially now, before the PR machines try to turn it into another soulless cash cow.</p> \n<p>Where to shop</p> \n<p>The big surprise at the Hatikva Market are the stands that specialize in just one product, like olives or pitas or amba. There are also quite a number of small bakeries from a whole spectrum of ethnic backgrounds – Yemenite, Iraqi, Georgian – as well as stands that sell fresh rolls at very low prices, and sourdough breads as well. And there are many wandering peddlers offering sambusak, ices, pomegranate juice or lemonade for just five shekels: This market offers a tour of aromas and flavors, in addition to shopping.</p> \n<p>Ilanit’s Deli</p> \n<p>This small family-run stand was opened five years ago by neighborhood natives Ilanit and Koby Yosef. At first they mainly sold fries, stuffed vegetables and salads. Word quickly spread, and the business grew to include Ilanit’s marvelous home cooking. Last year, the couple moved to a large space in the market and added some local friends to the staff. Now their business offers a very wide selection of ready-made foods to take home – all kinds of stuffed vegetables (carrots, onions, mini-eggplants, vegan stuffed cabbage and more), vegan patties, meatballs, kubbeh with rice, kubbeh with beets, and of course – Iraqi kubbeh, the dish the shop is known for. On Fridays, twice as many dishes are on offer, including roast beef, couscous, chreimeh, stuffed chicken, baked salmon, cigars, chicken and fish schnitzel, excellent stuffed grape leaves and a large selection of vegan foods.</p> \n<p>20 Hatikva Street; Tuesday - Wednesday 7 A.M.- 5 P.M., Thursday 7 A.M.- 6 P.M., Friday 4 A.M.- 5 P.M.</p> \n<p>Uzi’s Cookies</p> \n<p>Close to the entrance to the market you can’t miss the impressive bakery run by Uzi Zefadia, which has been in business here for almost 20 years. Here you’ll find what seems like an endless selection of sweet and savory cookies – with strawberry jam, chocolate, sesame, poppy seeds and more – as well as a huge selection of pastries in every shape and form – super-fresh burekas filled with cheese, spinach, potato or mushrooms, and sweet pastries like classic chocolate rugelach and mini-croissants filled with cheese or vanilla cream, to name just a few. Almost everything is baked on the premises. There are plans to open a seating area and counter where you’ll be able to order Turkish burekas with yogurt on the side and other treats made in the bakery.</p> \n<p>8 Hatikva Street; Sunday -Thursday 7 A.M. - 7 P.M., Friday 7 A.M. until one hour before Shabbat.</p> \n<p>Shadi’s nuts</p> \n<p>Among the numerous market stands selling sweets and nuts is a branch of this excellent chain, which opened in the market six years ago. Here you’ll find dried fruits, tahini, granola snacks, jelly candies and coated candies in every shape and color. Besides the store’s famous roasted cashews, there is also an amazing selection of roasted nuts and seeds (shelled and unshelled, roasted and unroasted) that come straight from the factory in Bil’in.</p> \n<p>19 Hatikva Street; Sunday - Tuesday 8 A.M. - 3 P.M., Wednesday - Thursday 8 A.M. - 4 P.M., Friday 8 A.M.- 4 P.M.</p> \n<p>Salumi Butcher Shop</p> \n<p>Until five years ago, there was a little restaurant in the market, called Salumi’s kebab, that served the best kebab around. The restaurant is gone now, but Salumi’s butcher shop, now on its third generation, is still in business in one of the market’s alleyways. There you can buy the splendid kebabs to take home and other excellent cuts of meat – whatever you need for your home barbecue.</p> \n<p>1 Nuriel Street, Monday - Thursday 7 A.M. - 6 P.M., Friday 7 A.M. - 3 P.M.</p> \n<p>Na’ama’s Spices</p> \n<p>Another place that over the years has become an institution in the market. Na’ama’s spices was started in 1963 by Na’ama Ovadia, a neighborhood resident who sold spices and nuts. Later a roasting house was added, where her famous spices and nuts are made before being shipped all over the country. This huge place offers a golden opportunity to buy pretty much everything in the way of spices, sweets, chocolates, candies, nuts and dried fruits, all sold by weight.</p> \n<p>4 Hamevaser Street; Sunday - Thursday 8 A.M. - 8 P.M., Friday 6:30 A.M. - 3:30 P.M.</p> \n<p>Amiga Deli</p> \n<p>Yitzhak Amiga opened his small convenience store in 1950. Today the place has grown into a large deli and shop where you can find just about anything. But with all due respect to the numerous other delicatessens in the market, the main attraction here is the amba – big tubs of amba in various stages of preparation and the intoxicating aroma of mango. You’ll also find a wide selection of wonderful pickles, olives, cheese, halvah, herring, sausages, cigars and other savory stuffed pastries.</p> \n<p>8 Nuriel Street, Sunday-Wednesday 6 A.M. - 7:30 P.M., Friday 5 A.M. - 4:30 P.M.</p> \n<p>Buchari bread bakery</p> \n<p>What a pleasant surprise right at the edge of the market. This family bakery has been in operation since 1996 and has two main specialties: lepyoshka – a round Bucharan bread with a thin center, and beef sambusak. In addition, there’s tuki – a Bucharan pita that’s somewhere between a matza and a cracker; it is supplied from here to many restaurants and banquet halls. If you ask nicely for a glimpse of the brick oven, you’ll appreciate the thin line separating heaven from hell when you take in the sight of 100 loaves baking at 200 degrees.</p> \n<p>52 Hanoch Street; Sunday -Thursday 7 A.M.- 5 P.M., Friday 7 A.M.- 4:30 P.M.</p> \n<p>Deli on Ha’Etzel Street</p> \n<p>This small, nameless establishment has been around since the ‘90s, but eight years ago current owner Rosie Melech took over and revolutionized the place. Here you’ll mainly find a vast selection of cheeses (most made with whole milk and without preservatives) that come straight from the manufacturers, which include small local producers as well as some of the well-known dairies. There are also Italian pastas and sauces, fresh and smoked fish and gluten-free pastas made from chickpeas or lentils).</p> \n<p>2 Ha’Etzel Street; Monday - Thursday 8 A.M.- 6 P.M., Friday 8 A.M. until two hours before Shabbat</p> \n<p>Where to eat</p> \n<p>The Hatikva neighborhood is a largely unknown culinary gem. Not that there are fancy chef restaurants, but you will find plenty of homestyle food of a kind you hardly see anywhere else, dishes that could easily vie for the title of “tastiest in town.” Yes, Ha’Etzel Street is filled with eateries that rate a tour on their own, but here we’re focusing on the market itself and everything it has to offer.</p> \n<p>HaSalouf Bakery</p> \n<p>Promise us you won’t eat anything before you go to HaSalouf. Here you’ll find all the traditional Yemenite foods – kubana, salouf, jahnoun, lahuh and malawah, all of them delicious. You have two options: The first is to take some food home and eat it there in peace and quiet. Or, even better, grab a spot at the wooden bar, order one of the aforementioned items or pick something else from the menu, like shakshuka, soup or a salad. We went for the kubana with egg and crushed tomato. It was soft and airy, like a fine brioche, and absolutely hit the spot.</p> \n<p>1 Hatikva Street; Sunday - Wednesday 7 A.M. - 7 P.M., Thursday from 7 A.M.- Friday one hour before Shabbat</p> \n<p>Zeitun</p> \n<p>The first hummus place in the market opened five years ago when two brothers who worked in New York restaurants and a friend of theirs from the neighborhood joined forces. It just moved to a new location in the center of the market, offering especially good hummus (be sure to try the hummus with Portobello mushrooms), all kinds of kubbeh – beet, okra, bulgur, fried kubbeh, yellow kubbeh and more, as well as various pita sandwiches (schnitzel, omelet, sabich).</p> \n<p>22 Hatikva Street, corner of 24 Hodaya Street; Sunday - Thursday 10 A.M. - 5 P.M., Friday 10 A.M.-2:30 P.M.</p> \n<p>Fuls</p> \n<p>This inviting hummus restaurant has only been on the scene here since March 2017, but the location has been in owner Yuval Shimshi’s family since the 1930s. His father, “one of the Yemenites who built the shuk,” according to Yuval and his wife Michal, opened a deli that went through several incarnations before becoming a hummus restaurant (Michal’s mother and her friend Tzipi are also part of the staff). There are no French fries, but there’s a terrific shakshuka and chopped salad, and you won’t want to miss the main attraction here, the “trio” – masbaha, ful and hummus. The service and atmosphere are very pleasant too.</p> \n<p>10 Hatikva Street, Sunday - Friday 7:30 A.M. - 3:30 P.M.</p> \n<p>Shaul Mutzafi restaurant</p> \n<p>It’s a common subject of debate around here as to where to find the best grilled meats on skewers (shipudim). Not an easy question to resolve, especially when you have two excellent places right across from one another – the original Shemesh Grill and Shaul Mutzafi, where kebab is king. The Shaul Mutzafi restaurant was opened in 1951 by Ephraim Mutzafi. His son Shaul later took over the reins. Besides the kebabs, you can enjoy any other grilled meat you like, including lamb, hearts and sweetbreads.</p> \n<p>15 Hamevaser Street, Sunday-Thursday 11 A.M.-11 P.M.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s been a troubling fortnight for those already concerned about the place of women in Israel and the broader Jewish community.</p> \n<p>Last week, a pre-eminent scholar of the American Jewry, Steven M. Cohen, was accused of sexual harassment by five women. Cohen says he is now engaged in a process of &quot;education, recognition, remorse and repair.&quot;</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, Ari Shavit gave an interview in Haaretz, detailing his &quot;journey of tikkun&quot; after a retreat from the limelight following allegations of assault by journalist Danielle Berrin in 2016.</p> \n<p>Straight on the heels of publication, another accusation surfaced, describing Shavit gripping the neck of his daughter’s ex-partner. The Shavit of cerebral restraint in the interview - who declared he was &quot;blind to the power [he] had as a privileged white man&quot; - responded with a hysterical and incriminating loss of control, live on national radio.&nbsp; &quot;What was done to me is cold-blooded murder.&quot; He furiously hurls allegations back: the accusations against him are &quot;radical and disproportionate,&quot; a &quot;blood libel.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Jewish community ponders what to do, as the intellectuals it celebrated fall from grace. Yet what should focus our attention is that , although the #MeToo movement has done much to break taboos of silence, there are clearly more stories that haven’t come to light.</p> \n<p>That’s because the Jewish institutional world suffers a sickness of ingrained, unethical gender and power relations. And power, not sex, lies at the heart of #MeToo.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Shavit writes he had no idea of his elevated position, nor of the correlation between his status and perceived sexual entitlement: the worldview, as one accuser puts it, where &quot;both knew he was deserving.&quot; Steven Cohen also enjoyed a lofty perch. Described as the &quot;gatekeeper&quot; of Jewish academia, if a woman chose not to work with him, her career was over.</p> \n<p>How dispiriting that collaborators and interlocutors of those accused have tried to lay &quot;disproportionate&quot; blame on their alleged attackers , despite the status those accused enjoyed.</p> \n<p>Interviewing Shavit, Kamir was sympathetic to the danger of disproportionate blame, expressing concerns of conflating &quot;mild&quot; attacks with severe. Academic Sylvia Barack Fishman, Cohen’s colleague, cautioned the &quot;dishonest&quot; nature of failing to &quot;distinguish between ambiguous and egregious situations.&quot; That echoes the apology made by actor Henry Cavill, after he had complained about the difficulties post #MeToo of &quot;wooing and chasing women.. I don't want to go up and talk to her, because I'm going to be called a rapist or something.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But we know better. Men are not so bewildered, they cannot differentiate courtship from aggression; not least, academics, who make a living from identifying nuance.</p> \n<p>No one can feasibly mistake flirting with grabbing someone’s neck. They are capable of recognizing when they inflict more subtle forms of harassment – when lines of over-personal questioning, directed at female colleagues, are inappropriate.&nbsp;A staffer of Cohen potentially had to tolerate enquiries regarding her plans regarding the occupancy of her womb, ludicrously warranted by his interest in continuity, how he &quot;would justify his invasive questioning.&quot;</p> \n<p>Claims of hysterical disproportionality let men off the hook. The true danger lies in denying the problem’s sheer scale. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>We need to examine entrenched power dynamics in the Jewish world. For if a women is inferior, it’s not a jump to denigrate her. It’s not much more of a leap to assault her, either.</p> \n<p>I’ve worked in Jewish organizations, worldwide. I’d love to write that being passed over for promotion on the bogus pretext that a man was &quot;more political&quot; was a defining moment. It wasn’t. I internalized a hierarchy that took years for me to disassemble.</p> \n<p>The Jewish woman is vulnerable because she is invisible in a way the Jewish man is not.&nbsp;The Jewish woman is unequal in a way the Jewish man is not.</p> \n<p>The Jewish woman, as Berrin wrote, jeopardizes &quot;jobs, social standing or even the opportunity to convert&quot; in naming sexual aggression. Cheryl Moore wrote recently of her decision to leave the Jewish non-profit world, where she felt she was being &quot;pimped out&quot; to engage with rich male donors with wandering hands, and that their &quot;public, outrageous and/or crude comments and behavior&quot; was &quot;observed by others, but questioned by no one. It was machismo at its core.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Jews we recognize everyone has a right to ask for forgiveness, and we have an obligation to forgive. But this cannot be the community’s main concern. To agonize over how we can still appreciate the leadership of accused men is morally dubious: it prioritizes salvaging egos over realizing the human suffering those accused have caused to others. It deters us from recognizing talented women who feel they’ve had no choice but to leave the Jewish community's institutions.</p> \n<p>Wringing our hands dissuades us from a critical reckoning. Recent events should keep anyone who cares about Jewish community policymaking up at night. Who have we let set the agenda? What are the ideas, who are the people we as a community have disenfranchized?</p> \n<p>How far have agendas been pushed to reinforce, in, ironically, Shavit’s own words, &quot;inequity, misogyny and exploitation,&quot; the power structures that already exist?</p> \n<p>Ari Shavit was lionized by the U.S. Jewish community as an iconic voice of liberal Zionism. Yet &quot;My Promised Land&quot; was told by an Ashkenazi man about, mostly, Ashkenazi men. Even its description of the social protests of 2011 was narrated through the eyes of men, not the women who largely led its cause.</p> \n<p>As a community, we unthinkingly granted an academic the power of a policy maker, who told women, in effect, to fill Jewish baby carriages, and led a movement that prioritized reproduction over meaningful Judaism.</p> \n<p>Chauvinism has distorted those we choose to laud, those we’re able to hear; the thinking we’re exposed to, and the ideas that shape our community.</p> \n<p>#MeToo offers Israel and the Jewish community in America and elsewhere a precious opportunity to push back against how normalized defective gender relations have become. Undoing this is not just women’s work.</p> \n<p>The issue isn’t whether we should pardon the men we hallowed, too readily. Rather than pining for their mythic return, we must find and celebrate women and men, with the inclusive and innovative thinking we so desperately need, to inspire us. We must examine the entrenched gender assumptions on which our Jewish lives are built.</p> \n<p>And we must tackle the inequalities and abuses of power that lie at the heart of our Jewish community.</p> \n<p>Clare Hedwat is a&nbsp;writer and trainee psychoanalytic psychotherapist.&nbsp;Clare has worked worldwide in Jewish education and community development.

        "text":["<p>Two weeks ago, a demonstration was held in Tel Aviv in opposition to the nation-state bill. It was an urgent protest intended to prevent the passage of a Basic Law that touches on almost every aspect of life in Israel and discriminates against one-fifth of the country’s citizens. Still, only about 1,000 people took part in the event, which left almost no mark on the public debate.</p> \n<p>A week later, a demonstration was held in Tel Aviv about one of the most marginal issues imaginable: the right of same-sex parents to surrogacy. We have to remember that only a few dozen surrogate births a year take place in Israel – less than 0.1 percent of all births. Yet tens of thousands of people turned out for the demonstration, marking the high point of a protest movement that preoccupied the media for days.</p> \n<p>What accounts for the disparity between the two demonstrations? The feebleness of the protest against the nation-state bill isn’t surprising. For years, demonstrations on behalf of Palestinian rights – whether in the territories or in Israel – haven’t interested more than a few thousand people and have been treated suspiciously by the media.</p> \n<p>More intriguing is the explanation for the huge popularity of the LGBT community. In recent years, LGBT demonstrations and pride parades have become the largest mass events in Tel Aviv. Pride Week has become the city’s national holiday, with rainbow flags adorning every avenue and almost every caf&eacute;, store and the like. Nationally, LGBT events are comparable in size only to the demonstrations of the ultra-Orthodox in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Apparently, equality for the LGBT community is the current flagship struggle of Israel’s liberal-secular camp. So thoroughly has it taken over that group’s agenda that it’s now possible to talk about the LGBT-ing of Israel’s secular identity.</p> \n<p>What’s the secret of success of the LGBT struggle, at a time when other liberal causes are at a standstill or moribund? How does this particular struggle muster such broad support at a time when many journalists and artists are afraid to express an opinion on controversial issues? There are several possible answers.</p> \n<p>Even ultra-Orthodox legislators are wary</p> \n<p>To begin with, Israelis have a high regard for forcefulness and shamelessness, two areas where LGBT politics excels. The community’s organizations never suffice with their gains, but are constantly expanding their demands. Like the settlers, LGBT leaders are extremely adept at creating disproportional panic over imagined injustices in order to shift the consensus in their direction. A decade ago, hardly anyone talked about same-sex marriages in Israel. Today, if a Knesset backbencher expresses opposition to gay marriage, he’s hit with a traumatizing media assault. Even ultra-Orthodox politicians now hesitate to voice sharply anti-gay opinions.</p> \n<p>Second, the LGBT agenda is no longer identified with the old and despised form of left-wing politics. LGBT people aren’t old elites and aren’t regressing. On the contrary, theirs is an up-to-date identity with young and dynamic brand values. It’s attractive mainly among the young generation, whose support for the left is nonexistent. It’s an aesthetic politics that requires no concessions. The demand to end the occupation, or demands put forward by feminists and socialists, call for significant concessions by the possessors of power and resources. The LGBT demand for equality requires nothing in return.</p> \n<p>Third, this agenda has the enthusiastic support of the business sector, which was threatened by the social protest of 2011 and engineered its demise at a certain stage. The LGBT protest learned its lesson and recruited the business community to its side. It also invented something that’s all but unprecedented: a strike that takes place under the patronage of the employers. In this way the business sector can show its strength and thus warn the nationalist and insular forces in the government not to stretch the rope too much.</p> \n<p>Fourth, the surrogacy protest ingratiates itself with the way of life of the straight majority. Gay politics in Israel is anti-sexual. The more the LGBT community has extended its rights and its public representation, the more puritan it has become, by degrees purging itself of the advocacy of free sexuality that in the past marked gay culture.</p> \n<p>In other countries, LGBT people are fighting to lower the cost of PrEP – the drug that can prevent HIV infection. In practice, PrEP allows for unprotected sex with a low risk of infection. Many gay men in Israel take PrEP, but the subject is buried deep down on the community’s political agenda. What brings thousands to the demonstrations is the sacred family. Effectively, the subliminal message of support for the surrogacy protest is, “let’s let gay guys have children so they’ll stop having sex.”</p> \n<p>And fifth, paradoxically, the protest is effective precisely because it addresses an issue that doesn't directly affect many people. Politics in our time has gone into a tailspin. Refugees aren’t really the main danger facing Europe, yet the opposition to immigration is toppling governments and threatening to blow apart the European Union. The Iranian danger is also largely imaginary, yet leaders like Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are changing the global order to combat it. The LGBT protest is a camp event, a performance. And that’s what makes it attractive.</p> \n<p>Pink, not golden, calves</p> \n<p>It’s not surprising that the LGBT protest has become a phenomenon that reaches far beyond the gay community. Not that a genuine political promise underlies it. The notion that the protest is the start of a new civil revolution is unconvincing. But the protest does possess importance as a cultural phenomenon. It’s positioning gay people as the frontline fighters of Israel’s secular-liberal camp. If the kibbutzniks personified the ideal of socialist Israel, and the settlers are the avant-garde of Likudnik Israel, gay people are the symbol of secular Israel in the 21st century.</p> \n<p>When Jeroboam split the kingdom and founded the Kingdom of Israel, he prepared two golden calves and placed them in Bethel and Dan as an alternative to the Temple of the Kingdom of Judah. From certain points of view, the secular kingdom of Tel Aviv is also splitting away from the Jewish nation-state whose capital is Jerusalem. It has its own leaders and rituals.</p> \n<p>But in its main public space, Rabin Square – formerly called Kings of Israel Square – stands a stage on which are two gay priests of fertility, walking talismans of the god of familial secularity.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When Samuel Green talks about Israel’s West bank security barrier with the Birthright groups he guides, he first explains the Israeli view that the barrier was built to prevent Palestinian terrorists from breaching Israeli territory and that Israelis generally feel it has saved lives.</p> \n<p>But then he’ll talk about what the barrier – which is part wall, part fence – means for Palestinians: how it cuts into West Bank territory, how it has separated people from their farmland, how they see it as an imposing wall.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Between Adelson and BDS, Birthright has become a political battlefield&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>“It’s a disservice to the people in front of me to leave out such information,” Green said. “So if you’re trying to understand why there’s conflict, you have to understand why people are annoyed. It’s important to talk about.”</p> \n<p>That approach contrasts with the one viewed by 2.7 million people in a viral Facebook video taken by activists of IfNotNow, a group of young American Jews who oppose Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. In the video, a Birthright tour guide spars with a participant on a Birthright bus over the status of the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Rather than aim to present a range of views on Israel’s control of the territory, the guide says “Israel sees the West Bank as part of Israel” – a misleading claim that does not accord with the legal status of the territory or encompass the variety of ways Israelis see it.</p> \n<p>Soon after the bus argument, several participants on that Birthright trip staged a walk-off from the tour and visited Palestinian areas. It was one of three such walk-offs conducted in recent weeks – all organized by IfNotNow – to protest what the group calls Birthright’s silence on Israel’s occupation.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Principled activists or entitled brats? What's wrong with the Birthright walk-outs&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The walk-offs have sparked a debate over whether Birthright – a popular 10-day free tour to Israel for young Jews -- has a responsibility to grapple with Israel’s control of the West Bank. Some 40,000 young Jews, mostly from North America, go on Birthright every year. For some it is their first exposure to the country.</p> \n<p>But Birthright tour guides say the debate is unnecessary. While acknowledging that they speak from an Israeli perspective, the guides said they make an effort to represent a range of opinions on the tour – including Palestinian views – and are happy to answer any questions.</p> \n<p>“In general, what tour guides are taught is that it’s not about us,” said Daniel Rubenstein, an immigrant to Israel from Texas who is about to lead his fourth Birthright trip. “As educators, it’s our job to teach what the various players in this region, in this conflict and in this shared society are saying, and for us to articulate the basic vision of Zionism as well as Palestinian national identity.”</p> \n<p>In addition to completing Israel’s two-year certification course for tour guides, most Birthright guides must complete a three-week course run by Birthright. Guides said the course focuses on how to engage groups in discussion, how to make Israel’s history and nature come alive, and how to relate to a North American audience.</p> \n<p>But the guides said the Birthright training course was light on politics. It instructs guides to represent a range of perspectives, they said, but doesn’t provide a list of Israeli talking points on contentious issues like the status of Palestinian refugees or the security barrier. Green scoffed at the idea that right-wing donors to Birthright, like casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, dictate how they conduct their tours.</p> \n<p>“They don’t have a lot of control over what guides say in the field,” Green said regarding Birthright. “They’re trusting the guides to execute their vision. It’s not like Birthright says ‘do this’ and the guide parrots something.</p> \n<p>“In the Birthright training we were encouraged to represent different points of view. So this idea that Adelson is dictating how we talk about the conflict is bonkers.”</p> \n<p>The guides acknowledged that their tours are inevitably given from an Israeli perspective. One of Birthright’s explicit goals is to strengthen American Jews’ connection to the country, along with the Jewish identity of participants. And most if not all of the guides are either native-born Israelis or Diaspora Jews who chose to make their lives in Israel.</p> \n<p>“Personally, I’m going to value and weigh some perspectives differently than others,” said Rubenstein, who worked at the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC in Washington, D.C., before becoming a guide after moving to Israel. “I’m an Israeli by choice, so I’m not Wikipedia-neutral, but people are looking to engage with me because of who I am. I strive to represent different perspectives and make sure all voices are heard.”</p> \n<p>The tour’s itinerary is transparently geared toward giving participants an appreciation of Israel’s natural, historical and cultural attractions. All trips must visit a series of sites, from the beachfront metropolis of Tel Aviv to the Western Wall in Jerusalem’s Old City to Masada, the ancient hilltop fortress where a group of Jewish rebels held out against an invading Roman army before committing mass suicide.</p> \n<p>Groups will also visit the City of David, a Jewish archaeological site and community in a Palestinian neighborhood in eastern Jerusalem, over Israel’s pre-1967 border. Palestinians condemn the site’s presence as an illegal settlement.</p> \n<p>All groups receive a lecture on geopolitics from an Israeli expert. Meeting Palestinians, and seeing Palestinian life, is not part of the itinerary. Optional programs that take place immediately following the trip offer Birthright participants the opportunity to see Palestinian society.</p> \n<p>“Part of tour education is that you’re educating about the things you see in front of you,” said a Birthright guide. “If the route of your trip didn’t take the road next to the Israeli [security] barrier, you’re not going to start a discussion about the Israeli barrier.”</p> \n<p>The guide also said that he presents Palestinian viewpoints, but that “it’s clearly not a comprehensive exposure to Palestinian views if you’re not meeting a Palestinian.”</p> \n<p>IfNotNow activists, unsurprisingly, take a far less generous view of the tours’ approach.</p> \n<p>Rebecca Oliver, one of the participants who walked off the bus shown in the viral video, said their guide did willingly answer their questions and discuss the conflict with them. But she said Palestinians were mentioned only when she and other participants asked about them. And she said the guide did not present a spectrum of Israeli views on sensitive issues.</p> \n<p>In the video, the guide does not appear to attempt to be evenhanded when discussing the West Bank. He inaccurately claims that Israel sees the West Bank as part of the country (While Israel controls the West Bank to varying degrees, it has not annexed the territory and treats it differently, in legal terms, than its recognized territory.). He also claimed that Israel does not demarcate the West Bank on its maps, which is true of some maps but not all.</p> \n<p>“They provide a really, really biased version of what Israel is and what that education is, and in doing so, they are upholding the Israeli government and the military occupation in Palestine,” Oliver told JTA. “They either provide misinformation or biased information without clarifying that it’s biased, or omit it.”</p> \n<p>Tour guides chafed at the suggestion that discussing the conflict should be more of a focus. They said that not all participants are interested in a political debate. And they appreciate that the trip’s focus is on Jewish identity.</p> \n<p>“When IfNotNow says, ‘Oh, Birthright doesn’t present the full picture of the Palestinian occupation,’ well OK, but that’s not the purpose of this trip,” said an American Jewish communal official who has organized and co-led many Birthright trips, but who didn’t want to be named without approval from Birthright. “The point of the trip is not to learn all of every single aspect of the occupation. It’s to learn about Judaism and Jewish heritage and make friends and have a good time.”</p> \n<p>Plus, the official added, if Birthright is seeking to drive American Jews politically rightward, it’s doing a bad job. American Jews tend to hold markedly more liberal views on the conflict than their Israeli counterparts.</p> \n<p>“I’m sure the Israeli government gives money [to Birthright] because they have whatever their goals are,” the official said. “I’m not sure how much that translates to a micro level. If their goal is to transform a generation of Jews into Likud supporters, they’ve clearly failed.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>All the big periods in Natan Sharansky’s life have, coincidentally, lasted the same length of time. He spent nine years in Soviet jails as a Prisoner of Zion, another nine years in Israeli politics (both as a lawmaker and government minister) and this week concludes nine years as chairman of the Jewish Agency.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Looking back, this latest chapter in his life will probably be remembered more for what he did not accomplish than what he did.</p> \n<p>Indeed, the fighting spirit that earned Sharansky worldwide fame as a Soviet dissident in the 1970s was hardly evident during his stint at the Agency, where he spent a good deal of his time trying – though mostly failing – to get the Israeli government to show more respect and consideration for Diaspora Jewry.</p> \n<p>The high point of Sharansky’s term in office at the Agency was meant to be a deal granting recognition to the non-Orthodox movements at Jerusalem’s Western Wall.</p> \n<p>The deal called for creating a new and enhanced egalitarian prayer section at the southern expanse of the Kotel, which would enjoy as much visibility and access as the existing gender-segregated prayer plaza on the northern side. Another key element of the deal was providing the Conservative and Reform movements with representation on a new authority that would supervise the newly created prayer space.</p> \n<p>The space was supposed to be Israel’s way of showing Diaspora Jews it wanted them to feel at home in the country.</p> \n<p>It was more than five years ago that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu first summoned Sharansky to his office and asked that he come up with a solution to the ongoing clashes at the Western Wall between ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) worshippers and Women of the Wall – a feminist prayer group that holds a monthly service at the site.</p> \n<p>Sharansky proposed moving the group from its regular spot in the women’s prayer section to the egalitarian space located farther away, and at the same time significantly upgrading the area as a gesture of goodwill to Reform and Conservative Jews.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu initially loved the idea and set up a committee to flesh out the details. It took several years, but eventually a detailed plan – based on the Sharansky blueprint – was hammered out.</p> \n<p>But no sooner was it approved than it began to unravel. Netanyahu came under pressure from his ultra-Orthodox governing coalition partners to cancel the deal, and he ultimately succumbed.</p> \n<p>Sharansky tried to warn Netanyahu that he would be jeopardizing Israel’s relations with Diaspora Jewry if he caved, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Meanwhile, the Conservative and Reform movements took their battle for equal rights at one of Judaism’s holiest sites to the Israeli High Court of Justice, where the case is still pending.</p> \n<p>This is not the legacy Sharansky hoped to leave behind. In his defense, he has argued that not all is lost, since certain elements of the Western Wall deal appear to have been salvaged. For example, Netanyahu has vowed to move ahead with plans for a physical upgrade of the existing egalitarian prayer space (though that, too, has stalled because the ministers who were supposedly overseeing the project recently resigned out of fear of an ultra-Orthodox backlash).</p> \n<p>The unhinging of the Western Wall deal was not Sharansky’s only major setback in office. As chairman of the Agency, the former Soviet dissident saw one of his major functions as representing the Jewish World to Israeli government leaders.</p> \n<p>Israel’s policy on conversions to Judaism and its attitude toward converts has long been a sore spot for Jewish World leaders. In addition to not recognizing non-Orthodox conversions, Israel has also in recent years begun questioning the validity of conversions performed by many Modern Orthodox rabbis abroad.</p> \n<p>Sharansky had hoped to provide at least a partial solution through a rather bold initiative he unveiled, with much fanfare, three years ago. That initiative called for the establishment of a special conversion court that would dispatch rabbis from Israel to overseas communities increasingly challenged by the stringent requirements and vetting powers of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate.</p> \n<p>Nothing ever came of this proposal, though – in part because it required the cooperation of the Israeli Interior Ministry, which is currently under the auspices of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party.</p> \n<p>Neither has Sharansky been particularly successful in getting Israel to recognize emerging Jewish communities. A case in point is the Abayudaya community in Uganda, whose members have on several occasions been denied entry to Israel because the Interior Ministry does not recognize their conversions performed by Conservative rabbis. Sharansky’s appeals to the Interior Ministry to reconsider its hard-line position and show some compassion have thus far gone unheeded.</p> \n<p>Political hawk</p> \n<p>Born in Donetsk (now Ukraine) in 1948, Sharansky became involved with the refusenik movement in the early ’70s after being refused an exit visa to Israel. In 1978 he was sentenced to 13 years’ forced labor in the Soviet Union, after being accused of high treason and spying for the Americans. After spending nine years in Soviet prisons, he was released in February 1986 and swiftly moved to Israel, where he joined his wife Avital – who had led the campaign for his release.</p> \n<p>Ten years later, he founded a political party, Yisrael Be’aliyah, which targeted the huge wave of Russian-speaking immigrants who had arrived in Israel in the ’90s. (It ultimately merged with Likud.)</p> \n<p>From 1996 to 2005, Sharansky served as minister and deputy prime minister in four consecutive governments and was considered a political hawk. As industry and trade minister, for example, he prioritized investments in West Bank settlements.</p> \n<p>Since leaving politics, however, he has embraced a more moderate position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Although he supports a two-state solution in principle, in a recent farewell interview with Haaretz he said he didn’t harbor much hope for reaching an agreement in the near future – laying the blame squarely on the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>The world’s most famous Soviet dissident, Sharansky is often seen as the poster boy for immigration to Israel. Ironically, though, under his leadership, immigration promotion stopped being the Agency’s top priority.</p> \n<p>There were many who criticized him for de-emphasizing what had long been considered the key raison d’&ecirc;tre of the organization and allowing private organizations – such as the controversial, evangelical-funded International Fellowship of Christians and Jews – to fill the void.</p> \n<p>But there was a logic to the move. By the time Sharansky assumed the helm at the Agency in 2009, immigration to Israel had been stagnant for quite a few years, with no signs of rebounding. As he noted in his recent interview with Haaretz: “The days of rescue aliyah are pretty much over. Those who come today come out of free choice because they believe this is a better place for them to live as Jews.”</p> \n<p>To justify its continued existence, Sharansky believed the Agency needed to reinvent itself and put its energies elsewhere. Rather then immigration and absorption, its chief priorities during his tenure became Jewish engagement with Israel, and strengthening ties between Israel and Diaspora communities.</p> \n<p>“I don’t believe in telling people they have to make aliyah, and if they don’t make aliyah they’re bad Jews,” he told Haaretz in March. “If we want more immigrants here, that means we have to make sure there are more Jews. And the way to do that when assimilation rates are so high is to make sure there are more people connected to Jewish life and to Israel.”</p> \n<p>One of his key legacies in this respect was the expansion and promotion of Masa – a project that brings some 12,000 young Jews to Israel each year on a wide assortment of study, volunteer and internship programs. Sharansky likes to boast that a disproportionately large percentage of the young Jews choosing to make their home in Israel in recent years are Masa graduates.</p> \n<p>Masa was actually launched a few years before Sharansky took office, but under his patronage it has come to rival Taglit-Birthright as the top Israel experience program.</p> \n<p>His other pet project has been the Campus Israel Fellows, which was his own initiative. Through this program, close to 100 young Israelis are today stationed on college campuses in North America, where they work on strengthening Jewish student leadership and engaging Jewish students with Israel. Sharansky sees them as a major force in the struggle against the international BDS Movement, which calls for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel.</p> \n<p>Yet despite all these efforts, survey after survey shows that Jewish millennials in recent years have been increasingly distancing themselves from Israel. Sharansky is certainly not to blame. What is indisputable, though, is that it happened on his watch.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Another spectacular mosaic has been found in the city of Lod while doing groundworks for a museum to house the spectacular mosaics already found there in previous years.</p> \n<p>The mosaic was found in a late Roman-era house dating to about 1,700 years ago. The sheer quality of the stonework indicates the owner was extravagantly wealthy.</p> \n<p>“The villa included a large, luxurious mosaic-paved reception room triclinium and an internal columned courtyard, also with mosaics, and a water system,” says archaeologist Amir Gorzalczany, the director of the present excavation.</p> \n<p>In fact, this is the third mosaic discovery in this structure – which, in embarrassing contrast to modern construction, seems to have existed for centuries.</p> \n<p>The archaeological find indicates the house survived in one form or another from the Roman era – the first century – to the late Roman era, around the late third century or early fourth, says Gorzalczany.</p> \n<p>Based on other Roman-era homes found in the area, which also had mosaic decorations, it appears that this luxurious manse of yore had been in the elite neighborhood of Roman-era Lod, he says. The Israel Antiquities Authority excavators also found Roman-era coins, ceramics and marbles, as well as other signs of luxury such as fragments from frescoes typical of the finer houses of Rome itself.</p> \n<p>To whom might this lovely domicile have belonged? The newfound mosaic depicts nothing but animals and nature. No people. But it has a motif of three fish in the middle – all of which boils down to nothing concrete, Gorzalczany clarifies.</p> \n<p>One theory could be that the inhabitants had been Jews who eschewed the human figure in art due to divine prohibition. Or maybe the house belonged to early Christians, based on the fish representation of the religion – but no other artifacts typical of Christian faith have been discovered there, Gorzalczany points out. Or maybe the owners were pagans, clinging to the ancient Roman beliefs.</p> \n<p>Whoever made this mosaic needed great tiling skills – which begs the thought that it was the same person who made a strikingly similar high-quality mosaic found on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. It also depicts very similar animals and geometric patterns. But instead of the three fish in the middle, the Mount Zion mosaic features the goddess Gaia. At least that is what we call her 2,000 years later. Then she was called “Ge” in Greek, from which the word “geography” would arise, Gorzalczany says.</p> \n<p>Move your car</p> \n<p>The Lod mosaics were first found in 1996. In what’s becoming a clich&eacute; in Israeli archaeology, the initial discovery was made by construction workers, in this case building a sewage system, supervised – as is the norm in Israel – by archaeologists. Somebody noticed a bit of colorful stone.</p> \n<p>“It was a total surprise,” Gorzalczany recounts. So was the quality of the work, so extraordinary that the mosaic with its animal motifs has been taken around the world for exhibition.</p> \n<p>“The smaller the stones used in the mosaic, the more you can put into the picture and the better the quality – it’s like pixels,” Gorzalczany explains. “This quality was outstanding, featuring a vast range of colors and gorgeous artwork, with shadowing, volume, plays on light and dark, and even use of gold-gilted stones and glass tiles, which was very rare.”</p> \n<p>That was in 1996. Then, in 2014, excavators found another mosaic in what had been the courtyard of the house. Digging it up, the archaeologists could see the corner of yet another one peeping. But they couldn’t get at it because it was under the neighborhood parking lot.</p> \n<p>Now in 2018, following agreements reached with everybody concerned – including the neighbors who live there and liked parking there – the mosaic glimpsed four years before has been dug up. (The one found in 2014, meanwhile, has been re-covered with earth for the sake of its preservation.)</p> \n<p>Given that it is smack in the middle of land used by Lod’s modern residents, this new one had to be quickly conserved, rolled up as one does with 1,700-year-old mosaic floor decorations, and moved..</p> \n<p>Where did they sleep?</p> \n<p>Back when the excavators noticed the corner of the “new” mosaic peeping from under the parking lot, they thought they had found the bedrooms of the ancient mansion. They had not, they realized, going on rectangular marks on the floor that seem to show where couches had once been placed for the feasting elites to recline. In short, they think they found a secondary reception or banqueting hall.</p> \n<p>In other words, the house was grander than originally thought and they haven’t found the bedrooms yet, which could have been on a second story – in which case they won’t be found.</p> \n<p>At this stage, the mosaic has been rolled up and taken away for painstaking preservation works by the antiquities authority.</p> \n<p>“They’ll put all the stones back and strengthen and clean it,” says Gorzalczany, “working like doctors with scalpels, one stone at a time.” Eventually, presumably, it will be housed in the future Lod archaeological museum, to be called the Shelby White and Leon Levy Lod Mosaic Center, which is going up about where it had been found in the first place.</p>",

        "text":["<p>So how is it that Donald Trump won the American presidential election? According to Joshua Green, author of the bestselling book “Devil’s Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump and the Nationalist Uprising” (Penguin Press), the key to the explanation is simple: Steve Bannon. He’s the person who made the impossible possible, and the possible actual.</p> \n<p>Of course this is not an explanation Donald Trump would accept. And the thing is that Bannon apparently did not reject it vigorously enough, something that added to his problems in the White House. Green’s book helped induce Trump to oust Bannon from his job as White House chief strategist.</p> \n<p>No commander-in-chief likes the intimation that someone else is pulling the strings. And in this case, the talk started soon after the election, when Time magazine ran a frightening picture of Bannon on its cover, dubbing him “the great manipulator.” It continued in the form of a theory that there is such a thing as “Trumpism,” as distinct from Trump himself, and that Trumpism is actually “Bannonism.”</p> \n<p>The announcement of Bannon’s dismissal in August 2017, a year after his star rose in Trump’s campaign, was undoubtedly a persuasive example of typical Trumpism: “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,” Trump said. “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.” Now he’ll learn “that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country.”</p> \n<p>That’s all nonsense, of course. For one turbulent year, Bannon was a senior partner and close confidant of this president, the most controversial the U.S. has had in many years. And he seems to have understood the upheaval better than others, including Trump himself. A conversation with Bannon is therefore perhaps one of the few existing keys – there aren’t many – to understanding what drove this upheaval, and what continues to drive it, if indeed there is a coherent force behind it all.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t hard to make initial contact with Bannon. An acquaintance from right-wing circles introduced us by email, after she was persuaded that there was no malice behind the inquiry. Bannon himself replied promptly and kindly. But even after more than 10 exchanges, I wasn’t able to set up anything concrete. He is infamously disorganized. I was about to pack and return to Israel when, at the last minute, an email arrived from Alexandra Preate, his right-hand woman, who has followed Bannon through fire and water, to the White House and back. Preate wanted to know what the subject of the intended article was. Then came a phone call from one of his associates, Raheem Kassam, a young British Muslim of Indian origin, who was formerly editor-in-chief of Breitbart UK and adviser to British politician Nigel Farage. He asked whether I would send my questions in advance. I said yes, but that I couldn’t promise not to ask other things as well. The meeting was set for the place known as the “Breitbart Embassy,” a brownstone townhouse in Washington D.C., a stone’s throw away from the Supreme Court building, and long Bannon’s headquarters and residence.</p> \n<p>We sat around a heavy table in the “embassy” basement. A small stack of copies of Green’s book sat on the mantelpiece. Contrary to the protective impression I got from his aides, Bannon doesn’t come across as cautious, though his experience with journalists has not always been pleasant, to put it mildly. He speaks with intensity and rapidity, moving from one topic to another without losing his train of thought, gradually creating the sense that everything is interconnected: Behind the simple exterior of things, a vast clock is ticking, and if we don’t wake up in time, we will discover, too late, that it had been counting down to the demise of Western, Judeo-Christian culture. Accordingly, even though Bannon is not necessarily the most modest person in America, he actually doesn’t think that he is the reason for Trump’s victory. Nor is Trump the reason. Yes, the right people were in the right places. And he’s one of them. But the forces that generated the upheaval were vast and impersonal. They sometimes seem even metaphysical: Listening to Bannon you get a sense that the problem is not just that America has ceased to be great. It is that it has ceased to be itself.</p> \n<p>“There is no capitalism for the rich in this country,” Bannon says. “We have socialism here. Socialism, for the very wealthy, and the very poor. And we have a brutal Darwinian form of capitalism for everybody else. That’s why Donald Trump is president.” The very poor receive welfare services from the state, while the very rich are bailed out from financial trouble by the same state. After Obama bailed out the financial system in 2008, saving it from collapse, the architects of the disaster paid no price, and got no punishment. Whose money was it that saved them? The taxpayer’s money. “The little guy pays,” Bannon says. Working people, many of whom lost their homes and savings, to cover for the mistakes of the rich. And those multitudes of working people – there was no one to bail them out. The globalist elite took care of itself. The result is that, “one percent of the country own 40 percent of the wealth. The concentration of wealth It’s not a conspiracy. It’s in your face for everybody to see.”</p> \n<p>On Saddam’s couch</p> \n<p>Stephen Kevin Bannon was the third of five children in a Catholic family of Irish descent, born in 1953. His mother was a homemaker and his father a telephone technician. They sent young Steve to a Benedictine-Catholic military high school for boys. It was in Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy. There he received a classical education.</p> \n<p>All those elements – Irishness, Catholicism, Southernness, exclusively boys, classical education, and Richmond, too – don’t add up to an easy liberal optimism or confidence that history has reached its end and we can now rest. Bannon’s worldview is tragic and bleak. For him Judeo-Christian culture’s conflict with Islam didn’t begin yesterday. It started with the inception of Islam, when it began to spread. We in our time are heirs to the same challenge Charles Martel faced when he blocked the Muslims from conquering Europe in the year 732 at the Battle of Tours. The challenge has since changed form, and maynow appear in the guise of mass immigration, but the essential conflict has not disappeared, and we cannot afford to let our guard down. Good will is not going to cut it.</p> \n<p>The dangers inherent in Islam became concrete for Bannon during his navy service, following his graduation from Virginia Tech College in 1976. He was in the Persian Gulf during the American-hostage crisis in Iran, as an officer on a destroyer that escorted aircraft carriers. It was from that perspective that he saw the preparations for President Jimmy Carter’s failed operation to rescue the hostages. That debacle led him to abandon his parents’ political home – they were Kennedy Democrats – and become a supporter of the hawkish Ronald Reagan. His encounter with the alienness of Iran and afterward of Pakistan, persuaded him that the struggle with Islamic civilization was only going to grow more acute.</p> \n<p>As chance would have it, one of Bannon’s daughters also served in the American military in the Persian Gulf. Above the mantelpiece in the Breitbart Embassy is a photo of her in camouflage fatigues, sitting on Saddam Hussein’s throne in one of his palaces, which became an American base. “Now I can die a happy man,” Bannon says, looking fondly at the picture.</p> \n<p>After returning from years at sea, Bannon aspired to pursue a military career in the Pentagon, but quickly realized that the road to the post of secretary of defense would be long and slow. He left to study business administration at Harvard (graduating cum laude) and then landed a prestigious job with the Goldman Sachs investment bank. But he was restless, and after a few endeavors in different fields he went to Hollywood. For a time he was involved in producing movies, moving from entertainment into political films. His 2004 film “In the Face of Evil” was based on the book “Reagan’s War,” whose author, Peter Schweizer, Bannon would later recruit to write a book about the Clintons. This would become, as we shall see, a central piece in the effort to torpedo a potential Hillary Clinton presidency.</p> \n<p>Through filmmaking he gravitated closer to Tea Party circles, and even made a movie about Sarah Palin, who for a time seemed to him like she might be able to lead the populist movement he began dreaming of. In Los Angeles he also met Andrew Breitbart, who was building his own alternative right-wing news outlet. So the contours of the palette of skills he acquired began to come into focus: Classical education, a global and military perspective, business school and business experience, and the film industry, from which it was easy to jump to political journalism.</p> \n<p>He first appeared on the national political radar in October 2015. And even then just as a momentary blip. Joshua Green, long before “Devil’s Bargain,” identified him as the head of a far-right battle planned aimed against both the Democratic and Republican establishment, aimed equally against Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, who was then a leading Republican candidate for the presidency. Bannon declared ideological war against the entire American political elite. The piece Green wrote about Bannon for Bloomberg Businessweek was titled, “This Man Is the Most Dangerous Political Operative in America.”</p> \n<p>Still, Bannon remained relatively unknown until the evening on which Rebekah Mercer, the daughter of the eccentric right-wing billionaire Robert Mercer, catapulted him into the heart of the Trump campaign.</p> \n<p>It was August 2016, less than three months before the election. Clinton was well ahead in the polls and constantly widening the gap. Trump’s campaign seemed like it was heading for collapse. The rats started to desert the sinking ship, hoping at least to save something in the Senate and House elections. And then Rebekah Mercer arrived by helicopter at the estate of Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets football team, who was hosting Trump. She had a message to deliver to the candidate, and she wanted to deliver it in person: Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway would be taking control of Trump’s campaign from now on. The candidate didn’t argue.</p> \n<p>Rebekah Mercer and her father are major donors to the American hard right, including some Steve Bannon projects. The Mercers originally backed Ted Cruz. But some of what they did would have been useful to any Republican candidate, and this now included Trump. To the extent that Clinton was right in saying that there was a “vast right-wing conspiracy” working against her, the Mercers were its funders and Bannon the effective strategist behind it.</p> \n<p>There are people in the American right who had made careers out of attacking the Clintons. They did not impress Steve Bannon. In his view, none of this would be effective if it didn’t break out of the right-wing echo chamber to influence center and moderate-left voters. And to accomplish that, other means – more restrained, more fact-based – were called for. Bannon himself didn’t leave his post at the head of the militant Breitbart News Network (to which the Mercers were also generous donors) but he looked for additional channels as well.</p> \n<p>Long before Trump was ever a candidate, Bannon approached Peter Schweizer, who had already written an investigative book on the shady connections of capital and politics in Washington. With funding from the Mercers, Schweizer started working on what would become the 2015 book “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.”</p> \n<p>The plan worked, at least partially. In the wake of Schweizer’s revelations, The New York Times published a major investigative report of its own on one of the stories he exposed, confirming his main findings. Other mainstream media followed suit and helped the book break out of the confines of right-wing media, which is often dismissed as conspiratorial and irresponsible.</p> \n<p>“Clinton Cash” begins with such questions as these: How did it happen that Bill Clinton earned at least $136.5 million between 2001 and 2012, in the period when his wife was a senator and then secretary of state? How did the Clintons jump in one decade from being virtually &quot;broke&quot; (as they said of themselves at the end of Bill's presidency) – to the status of multimillionaires?</p> \n<p>The book doesn’t exactly answer those questions. Schweizer only documents coincidences of time and proximate events, and leaves it to the reader to connect the dots. But the dots are so dense that there’s not much left to connect. And therein lies the book’s power. It shuns not only conspiracy theories, but shrill tones in general. And indeed, as Bannon predicted, this made the book credible in the eyes of respectable media on the left and center. When the book appeared, it already had the imprimatur of The New York Times, the Washington Post and many other outlets of the “opposition party,” as Bannon calls the mainstream media.</p> \n<p>What the book unearthed was truly stunning. The story that The New York Times picked up, for example, begins with a Bill Clinton visit to Kazakhstan in the private jet of a Canadian millionaire named Frank Giustra. After Bill and Giustra dined with the country's despotic billionaire president, Giustra surprisingly obtained a license to mine uranium in the country. He then contributed generously (more than $30 million) to the Clinton Foundation, merged his company with another, which gained access to American uranium, and was financially taken over by Russians, with the approval of the U.S. government, including its State Department – headed by Hillary Clinton. In the meantime, Bill received half-a-million dollars from a Russian bank that was involved with these uranium stocks, for a lecture he gave in Moscow.</p> \n<p>The book caused limited, but still palpable, damage to Clinton’s candidacy. And now, having been planted smack dab in the middle of the Trump campaign, Steve Bannon was in a position to reap some of his own vision’s fruits.</p> \n<p>Total metaphysical confidence</p> \n<p>In August 2016, when Bannon appeared on the scene of the presidential race, Clinton was so complacent that she took a two-week break from campaigning, spending some of that time in the Hamptons. Bannon now reconstructs what she thought, in his view, at that time, when she “came off the beach,” as he put it, to respond to the changes in the Trump team: “Trump knows he’s going to lose by a historical margin, and he brings this mad bomber from Breitbart? We’re going to take the House and the Senate and the Supreme Court,” he says in her name, adding, “They had it all worked out for the next 50 years.” But then “she came off the beach,” because she thought she spotted an opportunity. She made a speech in Reno, Nevada, linking Trump to Bannon, Bannon to the alt-right and the alt-right to racism and Islamophobia. Here, she thought, was a chance to expose the true face of the Republican candidate! This “new low,” as she called it in her book “What Happened,” offered an opportunity not to be missed.</p> \n<p>“I sat there with all the young guys [from the Trump campaign], and we’re looking at the TVs,” Bannon recalls, “and I said, ‘She comes off the beach to talk about Steve Bannon and Breitbart?’ Are you kidding me? I told the guys: It’s over – we’ll crush her.”</p> \n<p>In other interviews, with The American Prospect and with Charlie Rose, Bannon explained why that speech boosted his confidence so much. He wanted the Democrats to go on playing the identity-politics game. Let them keep shouting “Racist!” They’re just digging their own grave. Because Americans, he explained, are an immigrant nation and mostly, in fact, they are not racists. If the Democrats keep playing the race card, the campaign would evolve something like this: Trump will say that the Mexicans are taking Americans’ jobs, that they are making wages fall. He will rage against them with his trademark bluntness. Hillary will respond with the standard Democratic reflex: The way Trump talks about Mexicans is racist, she will say. The voter whom Bannon is targeting will look at both candidates and say to himself: Here’s a candidate who’s talking about my problems; and here’s a candidate who says that it’s not nice to talk about my problems. No brainer. Such ordinary Americans will fall right into Trump’s lap. Now there’s a basket to collect the “deplorables.”</p> \n<p>It would be the same with terrorism and Islam. Trump will refer to “Islamic terrorism”; Hillary will call him an Islamophobe. The ordinary American will ask himself which of them will be better at dealing with terrorism – the one who talks about it, or the one who’s afraid to call it by name.</p> \n<p>“I told Trump,” Bannon says, that if she continues in this vein, “100 percent metaphysical certitude – you will win. One hundred percent.”</p> \n<p>Bannon seems to have discovered something that for members of the American intelligentsia is not only strange, but practically incomprehensible: Racism is not an issue that interests the majority of Americans. The economy, not racism, was the issue of the election. What truly interests Americans is not the Mexicanness of illegal migrants, but the illegality of so much Mexican migration. “The Democrats,” Bannon told an infuriated Robert Kuttner at The American Prospect a few days before he was sacked from the White House, “the longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.”</p> \n<p>“Economic nationalism,” Bannon says now, “doesn’t care about your race, it doesn’t care about your ethnicity, it doesn’t care about your religion, it doesn’t care about your gender, it doesn’t care about your sexual preferences. It only cares about one thing: You’re a citizen. We’re going to maximize the value of citizenship.”</p> \n<p>Those who maintain that arguments about racism necessarily underlie the arguments about migration eliminate the possibility of a substantive argument on the subject of citizenship and of illegal migration. And those who have nothing of substance to say about these central issues won’t get far, in Bannon’s view. Which is why he thinks Bernie Sanders was never a threat. “With Bernie,” he says, “it’s a pillow fight.” Anyone who talks about the economy without talking about immigration can at best strike next to the target. But he can’t win, Bannon believes.</p> \n<p>“Economic nationalism” means a double struggle against the forces that depress the wages of American workers: illegal immigration, and the export of jobs to China and the developing world through trade agreements from which the elites profit. In other words, it’s a struggle that focuses on the critical nexus between the economy and borders. It is therefore also a struggle to reinvigorate an international order in which nation-states are the pillars of stability. It is a fight against globalism, internationalism, “the party of Davos,” the EU, and other international organizations that compete for sovereignty against nation-states. This is not an abstract issue for experts. This is something ordinary Americans feel instinctively because it hurts them in their pocket: They see the jobs disappearing; they see the factories closing; they see their wages dropping with the influx of the cheap labor of illegal immigrants.</p> \n<p>Bannon saw that the Democrats had no idea what was happening around them. Without noticing, they’d become the definitive party of the elite. They stopped seeing “the little guy.” And they hooked their social policy to the sham of identity politics. Political correctness is a game of the elite, for the elite, by the elite. Clinton may have thought she was extending her protection to the downtrodden when she talked about diversity, but the real downtrodden were more disgruntled by the loss of their savings. So, when Clinton depicted Trump’s voters as racists and denigrated them, or some of them, by branding them “deplorables,” she stepped on a land mine.</p> \n<p>She meant to say that Trump’s voters are abusive to marginalized groups, but she herself seemed to be abusive, or at least contemptuous, of those who were less fortunate than she. Bannon isn’t one to overlook a rhetorical gift like “deplorables.” He adopted the term warmly, in the same way that black rappers appropriated the N word. Who paid for the bailout of the rich bankers from the crash of 2008, he asks today. The “deplorables,” of course, he says.</p> \n<p>Not a political force</p> \n<p>None of this means, of course, that there are no racists among the right-wing Americans who voted for Trump. On the hard edge of the right there are all kinds of dark streams, whether overt or covert, of neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klanners. You have people like David Duke and Richard Spencer, and the loathsome types who constitute their milieu. In the rest of the right wing, the attitudes toward those extremes range from hidden identification to limp acceptance, through lack of interest and burning hatred.</p> \n<p>Andrew Breitbart, the founder of Breitbart News, where Bannon worked for quite a spell, belonged to the last category: burning hatred. He spent a considerable part of his time fighting against the attempt to brand the whole conservative movement with what he thought was truly and utterly deplorable: racism.</p> \n<p>The Bannon school is in a way the opposite of Breitbart’s. Bannon doesn’t do battle against those who identify his views with the far edge of the racist right. Bannon once dismissed Duke and the neo-Nazis as “clowns.” They are not a political force, in his view. They’re a curiosity. In the eyes of some of his critics, that stance is unforgivable. It’s probable that this derisive approach is exactly the way he unnerves like Hillary Clinton. And it defies the tactics of framing the debate in such a way that anyone on the right would have to first sign a disclaimer.</p> \n<p>Many people are unwilling to forgive Bannon and Trump for what they see as short-of-forceful condemnations of self-declared neo-Nazis. Following the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville a year ago (in which a member of the white-supremacist movement ran over and killed a woman who was protesting against the rally), Trump initially condemned “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.” The point, on this view, is not that there’s nothing to deplore also about extreme left-wing organizations such as Antifa, or that many of the Trump and Bannon critics shouldn’t be castigated for maintaining an odd silence when anti-Semitism appears on the left. But in the face of overt Nazi racism, it’s necessary to be as clear as Kristallnacht with all one’s might and without hemming and hawing.</p> \n<p>Trump directly condemned those white supremacists in the end, apparently under pressure from his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. But some thought it was too little, too late. His adversaries in the Hillary Clinton camp rolled their eyes contemptuously. If they’re really not racists, up there in Trump Tower, why don’t they set themselves apart more clearly?</p> \n<p>With regard to anti-Semitism, Bannon rejected the criticism from the outset. Andrew Breitbart himself was a Jew, he said. The site employed Jewish journalists. Bannon himself recruited Milo Yiannopoulos, who sometimes identifies as Jewish (his maternal grandmother was Jewish), to Breitbart. Breitbart News’ support for Israel has always been consistent, loud and unapologetic. So is Trump’s support for Israel. And then there is also the fact that Trump's daughter converted to Judaism. So, what anti-Semitism are we talking about? How can anyone even imagine such a thing? “Hey, I’m a Christian Zionist myself,” Bannon told me.</p> \n<p>As for the accessions of racism in general Bannon thought it could be not just deflected, but turned against the accusers. In a sense, this was true for the Trump campaign even before Bannon. He seems only to benefit from accusations of racism, and not for any immediately obvious reasons. Consider his announcement of his candidacy. It’s hard to remember now that the initial concern around Trump was that the media and the public would simply ignore it. After all, he’d flirted with the idea so many times before, that now the danger was that no one would take him seriously. But the media didn’t ignore him. Far from it. Why? Because on the occasion of the announcement itself, he went into a rambling denunciation of Mexican immigrants. They were not Mexico’s best sons and daughters, he said. “They’re rapists,” he declared. And then he added a feeble disclaimer, “And some, I assume, are good people.”</p> \n<p>If there was ever a danger that Trump’s candidacy was going to be ignored, it disappeared then and there. The entire media echoed with reports that the presidential candidate had branded Mexicans “rapists.” The attempt to delegitimize Trump transformed him into a candidate, and afterward into a leading candidate. This is what would keep happening, exactly like it did with Hillary’s “deplorables” comment. Accordingly, Bannon fanned the flames, instead of dampening them. Let his candidate lash out. All the more. Let him hammer home the controversial slogans. It won’t hurt him in the least.</p> \n<p>That thesis faced its ultimate test when an old off-screen segment from the “Access Hollywood” television program suddenly surfaced. In it, Trump told the show’s host, Billy Bush, that he would “grab [women] by the pussy.” Now even the Trump camp thought that everything would come crashing down. It was no longer a matter of good manners, it was encouragement to rape. Anyone who thinks that women can be referred to like this must want to turn them back into chattels, into the slaves of violent patriarchs. Or so it appeared.</p> \n<p>But it turned out Trump’s voters, including many women, did not think that there was any such connection between words and actions, between symbol and reality. They apparently didn’t think that Trump, as president, would, for example, reduce the punishment for rape. They didn’t think there was a connection between what he would do as president and his “locker room talk,” as his defenders immediately characterized his repulsive remark. And they didn’t think he was about to revoke women’s rights (though many undoubtedly hoped he would take action against Roe v. Wade, but that’s not because he’s rude to women, but rather as part of his alliance with the conservative religious right).</p> \n<p>There was indeed momentary panic in the Trump camp, and, as Joshua Green notes in his book, even Trump, “who made it a point never to apologize for any offense, took the unprecedented step of expressing remorse in a hastily produced ninety-second Web video. ‘I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,’ Trump said to the camera.” But immediately afterward, he went on the offensive, as usual. Even Bannon was astounded that his candidate didn’t feel even a slight tremor of shame. The strategy was, again, to drive a wedge into the weak hinge of political correctness: the conception of words as equal to deeds, and view of symbols as if they were reality. He might not speak nicely, Trump admitted. But Bill Clinton, who did speak nicely, sexually assaulted women in the real world, and his wife then bullied and silenced them, he said. That’s a lot more serious than the boastful talk of men’s locker rooms.</p> \n<p>A week later, according to the polls, all of that turned out to have constituted a slight blip on the graph. Everything returned to normal. Clinton had led in the polls before, and she maintained her lead now, but there was no dramatic crash. It was a shattering moment, because it exposed a disparity and raised a nagging suspicion: Perhaps the media is addressing the wrong issues? Maybe it doesn’t know how to measure what people actually think? Is it possible that all its polls – all of them almost to the last! – are wrong? Bannon was positive: Yes, the polls are wrong. No, the media had no clue.</p> \n<p>America in decline</p> \n<p>In the hardest days of the campaign, when Trump’s prospects seemed to be nil, Bannon kept tabs on the statistics and polls of the Democratic Party. What stood out, in his perception, was that 75 percent of those polled thought that America was in decline. But even more important, two-thirds thought that this was absolutely unacceptable. And if so, they needed to be offered an alternative. The elites can ridicule Trump as much as they please, Bannon thought, but he hit on something dramatic with the slogan “Make America great again.” Trump was here, according to Bannon, to do just that: stop this decline.</p> \n<p>And can he do it? His critics say he shoots in every direction, without any method.</p> \n<p>“He is completely consistent.”</p> \n<p>Take the sanctions on Iran, I say to Bannon. They’re harsh sanctions, even toward those who trade with Iran. Excellent. Many Israelis are pleased, myself among them. Because European firms are being forced to leave Iran, even if Merkel and Macron want to maintain the agreement. But if at the same time, you raise tariffs against Europe, you’ll push European firms out of the United States and back to Iran.</p> \n<p>Bannon dismisses this with a wave of his hand. In his view, Trump is changing the rules across the globe, and they’re the same rules everywhere. Even if the engine sputters at the start, like in a test-run, it will soon warm up and synchronize. Everyone will understand that you can’t mess with him. Trump is showing, if a translation into Israeli parlance is required, that the United States will not be anyone’s sucker.</p> \n<p>So does this mean that at heart, you’re an isolationist? Is Trump an isolationist?</p> \n<p>“At least a third of the populist movement are isolationists,” he says, and then qualifies: “Trump’s America First doctrine means that where the United States has security interests, it also cares about the security interests of its allies. Take the Middle East, for example. The two important things that Trump did at the start of his term in the region were the war on ISIS and the Riyadh summit [in May 2017].”</p> \n<p>But placing ISIS at the top of the order of priorities was one of the Obama administration’s strategic mistakes. Obama effectively became a partner of Iran’s against a very vocal terrorist organization, instead of restraining the more cogent source of terrorism, namely Iran itself. Or worse, he thought that if he made Iran a regional policeman, it would become more moderate. Didn’t this administration repeat that mistake at the outset by declaring ISIS such an important enemy?</p> \n<p>“No,” Bannon says. Trump, he recalls, took a completely different approach. In his inaugural address, which Bannon himself had a part in shaping, Trump stated: “We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.”</p> \n<p>When Bannon read those lines, which Trump wrote himself, he tried to dissuade the president-elect from using them. It’s a very large check that you’ll have to make good on, he and another adviser told Trump. But Trump insisted. And, according to Bannon, even though the president waged a bitter war on ISIS, he placed that policy in a different context from that of Obama. At the Riyadh summit, Trump accomplished three things, in Bannon’s view. “Number one is no more games. No financing of radical Islam terrorism. Whether that’s a mosque in Gaza, or the importation of radical Islamist Jihad into Western Europe. No more games. This stuff can’t be financed. Number two, Islam is going through [an] issue with modernity, and Islamic states themselves have to work against radicalization. The West can help, but it’s up to you guys,” Trump told his Arab interlocutors. “And [Egyptian President] al-Sissi, and the Saudis, and UAE said, ‘Yes, we’re going to do this.’ The third was the beginning of some sort of military alliance against Persian expansion.”</p> \n<p>The nuclear agreement, Bannon notes, freed $150 billion for the Iranians to develop offensive capabilities across the entire Middle East. Now that the sanctions are squeezing them, large numbers of Iranians are rising up and will start to ask why, with a 40 percent unemployment rate in Iran, the regime is continuing to invest in military capabilities for long-distance operations such as developing Hezbollah’s forces. How does that serve the citizen in Iran?</p> \n<p>How about North Korea? It started with threats and ended with hugs, but there’s still no nuclear disarmament.</p> \n<p>“Denuclearization is the goal. That’s what he said. It’s worth remembering that in the meantime, the sanctions [against North Korea] haven’t been lifted. We’ll see. But North Korea is a sideshow. It’s not important. It’s a client state of China’s. The problem is China.”</p> \n<p>Bannon takes out a small notebook and pen and draws a triangle. The three vertices are the new axis of evil: Iran, China and Turkey. Turkey, he says, will turn out to be the worst of the lot. President Erdogan wants to establish a caliphate in the spirit of the Ottoman Empire, and so, behind the scenes he is pushing for international control in the holy places of Islam. “He believes in his heart of hearts that he is a world-historical figure,” Bannon says.</p> \n<p>Our conversation took place before the July 16 Helsinki summit, and did not center on Russia. But from what we know about the meeting since, it was consistent with the approach Bannon outlined before the summit took place. I asked him whether Russia is a potential ally or a potential enemy. “The Russians are part of the Judeo-Christian culture,” he said. “We don’t need to pick a fight with them. The Cold War has got to come to an end. We can’t be fighting everyone all the time.”</p> \n<p>What the U.S. needs to do, he believes, is avoid pushing the Russians into the arms of the Chinese (which is critical for Israel with regard to the Iranian problem, where Russo-Chinese collusion could prove very problematic) Just as Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon wanted to improve relations with China in order to isolate Russia, Bannon wants to improve relations with Russia in order to isolate China. That’s something Trump understands deeply, he says.</p> \n<p>And the Russians’ meddling in the election campaign?</p> \n<p>“Ted Kennedy – it’s an open thing, it’s in a bunch of books – he went to the Soviet ambassador here in Washington D.C., about how they can assist Carter to beat Ronald Reagan, because they thought Reagan was a madman.”</p> \n<p>That’s all Bannon has to say on the subject, which he considers, it seems, quite marginal.</p> \n<p>Full steam ahead</p> \n<p>Almost from the first day the Trump administration was in power, a battle erupted for the ear of a president known to be particularly capricious. As the (mainly gossipy) book by Michael Wolff, “Fire and Fury,” reported in detail, the tug of war between Bannon’s anti-establishment populism and the Republican establishment (in the person of Reince Priebus) was difficult enough, before both realized how difficult it would be to contend with the faction suspected for being New York-style Democrats, in the person of Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. Family are not likely to be fired. So for the first few months chaos reigned supreme.</p> \n<p>Ideological rigidity and biting sarcasm didn’t help to ensure Bannon the stability of the status he’d enjoyed during the campaign. The flood of leaks from every direction, including his, didn’t advance the different agendas of the leakers but undermined the standing of all of them. The merry-go-round grew dizzier and dizzier around a hot-tempered, easily offended president, and ultimately it was Bannon and his people who fell off.</p> \n<p>But Bannon didn’t miss a beat, announcing that he would continue to support Trump’s populist revolution from the outside. He will in all probability not reject an offer to return to the White House staff, and it’s clear that he’s learned that if he’s frustrated by Trump’s management style it will be sounder policy to keep that to himself. I wasn’t able to extract one word of criticism of Trump from him in a conversation that lasted more than two hours.</p> \n<p>Isn’t it problematic that he behaves so emotionally, and hardly ever retracts or apologizes?</p> \n<p>“That’s his style. It’s a matter of style.”</p> \n<p>But why lie?</p> \n<p>“He has his own house style.”</p> \n<p>Lying isn’t a matter of style.</p> \n<p>“Every president has his own style. Obama had a different style: He looked you straight in the eye and lied to you about the nuclear agreement with Iran.”</p> \n<p>According to Bannon, the populist revolution is moving full-steam ahead in domestic realms as well. “The left is in total meltdown,” he says. And they know why. Because this is just the beginning. The Supreme Court is changing and will play a central role in what Bannon calls “the deconstruction of the administrative state,” the bureaucratic system that in his view has usurped power and colonized the processes of decision making that belong with elected officials. But all that is on the way out, he believes. And now the end of the doctrine of judicial supremacy and the judicial activism that flowed from it is also in sight. The death of Justice Antonin Scalia, in Bannon’s view, signified the end of an era, and Justice Neil Gorsuch's appointment heralds a new one.</p> \n<p>Where George W. Bush (who Bannon thinks was the worst president in the history of the United States) failed, Trump will succeed. He will change the face of the Supreme Court for many years to come. He will also fill 140 vacancies in lower federal courts. This will be a systemic overhaul.</p> \n<p>Indeed, Bannon avers, the Trump presidency is a transformative presidency. America will not go back to being what it was. Or perhaps, more accurately, he believes it will return in some ways to its mythical self, when the market was truly free and the “nanny state” had not yet come into being. Free and equal citizens will compete fairly in a truly competitive market, in which small businesses and the entrepreneurial spirit thrive. That’s the heart of the revolution, as Bannon envisions it. “It’s about giving the little guy a piece of the action.”</p> \n<p>And for that the state needs to be retracted and the political sphere reduced?</p> \n<p>“Absolutely. The main two differences between right-wing populism here and in Europe is that in Europe, even my right-wing brothers in Italy, they still look to the state for solutions. The question there is just who controls the state. Here, right-wing populism under Trump, Trumpism, is fundamentally different. It strives to take the state’s long tentacles out of the lives of working citizens.”</p> \n<p>Wouldn’t that mean reducing people from citizens to consumer-subjects?</p> \n<p>“Not at all.” For Bannon, freedom is largely, freedom from the political. “We are for entrepreneurial capitalism,” he says. “What we oppose is crony capitalism and what we call state capitalism, where a handful of big companies is in cahoots with big government. And they keep out the entrepreneur. We’re all about the little guy, whether he’s a shopkeeper, or some college kids in their room trying to start a business.”</p> \n<p>Isn’t that a na&iuml;ve portrait of the modern free market, though?</p> \n<p>“Not at all. 65-70 percent of jobs are created by small businesses.”</p> \n<p>What about social benefits? Who will look after health insurance? Isn’t universal state-sponsored health insurance, European style, the most reasonable arrangement for such a rich country as the U.S.?</p> \n<p>“Companies will have to compete for the rights they offer workers, and the workers will come to companies that offer the most attractive benefits.”</p> \n<p>But is that how it really works?</p> \n<p>“Absolutely.”</p> \n<p>What about the state level?</p> \n<p>“Hey, I’m a federalist.”</p> \n<p>States’ rights?</p> \n<p>A smile. I get a feeling the question has been asked of him before. “Well, not in the Confederate sense, of course. I think of states as laboratories.” They try different things and see if they, or maybe others, will like them. The people of Vermont will do for themselves what the Texans won’t. States can enact various laws and levy various taxes, and citizens can choose where to live. New York State has a high taxation rate. Which is why, in Bannon’s opinion, people are leaving it.</p> \n<p>But can we turn back the wheel? Take the internet, for example. When it was launched we were told that it was a return to totally free competition. Everyone can create a site and publish his opinions on it or sell his products without a middleman, invent an application, sell handmade jewelry or compare prices. It was supposed to be a free-market paradise. But what happened? Google and Amazon, Apple and Microsoft swallowed up all the little guys. So who is this little guy? Does he actually exist?</p> \n<p>&quot;This is the reason I opposed the Time Warner-AT&amp;T merger. I think this kind of consolidation of [economic] power in the country is scary. But then people say you need this to compete with the world, and I say, bullshit. Only if we let the world unfairly compete with us, which you see in those [international trade] agreements. It’s all inextricably linked.”</p> \n<p>But if you want to dismantle the giant monopolies, and also retract the state, which means reducing regulation, won’t you trip yourself up? Because, without state regulation, who will prevent huge mergers?</p> \n<p>“I am definitely not against all forms of regulation. I am not a libertarian and I am not a nihilist. And I am also not in favor of dismantling the FBI or the CIA.” (Indeed, Bannon opposed Trump’s firing of FBI director James Comey.)</p> \n<p>But perhaps the “deconstruction of the administrative state” is also a danger to the institutions of democracy? Where does the deconstruction stop? Who will guarantee that Bannon’s populism won’t slide into dictatorship, say, as happened in South America? What guarantee is there that leaders who speak directly to “the people” will not void the parties, the separation of powers and the powers themselves of content?</p> \n<p>“I am an originalist.”</p> \n<p>Originalism means adherence to the literal language of the Constitution. In other words, originalists oppose any change in the original structure of the American republic, with the exception of Constitutional amendments, as set forth in Article 5 of the document. This means, by and large, institutional minimalism at the federal level.</p> \n<p>It’s unlikely that clinging to an originalist interpretation of the Constitution will allay the fears of those who were alarmed when they saw Bannon storm the White House with Trump and immediately issue an executive order, without any legislative procedure, banning the entrance into the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority countries. As is Bannon’s habit, both the order and its announcement were couched in contrarian language, maximally provocative, in order to knock the president’s political rivals off- balance. Just like Bannon advised throughout the campaign. Let them scream and stomp their feet. Let them call Trump “racist,” and “bigot.” Just look them in the eye and never flinch. Trump would thus make clear he was here to change the rules, not to abide by the elites’ restrictive niceties. And there’d be an extra benefit. It would tear the mask of hypocrisy and cowardice off the face of the established political classes.</p> \n<p>But then it turned out that provocations that work on the campaign trail aren’t always best for getting things done in the Oval Office. The order immediately encountered judicial appeals and stayed stuck there until recently, when the Supreme Court – the new Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court – greenlighted it. So maybe it is better, after all, to line up your forces carefully before dropping bombs.</p> \n<p>Bannon came to the White House with a lot of credit. His supporters believe that he transformed Trump’s instincts into a coherent doctrine, a series of positions on domestic and foreign policy, that overall can be termed “populism” or “economic nationalism” or “Trumpism” (or, in a whisper, “Bannonism”). And it was he who insisted, against all odds and all polls, that this agenda would bring Trump victory. When it turned out he was right, he acquired the status of a wizard, or at least a master of manipulation, as Time magazine said of him. Nor is there any doubt that within Trump’s close circle during the first months, there was no ideologue comparable to Bannon, neither in intellectual heft nor in charisma. But additional – some would say different – skills are needed in the White House. Trump aides were aghast at the seething ideological waters into which Bannon pushed Trump even before the president had warmed up his chair in the Oval Office. Doubts surfaced about the place of such a rigid ideologue so close to Trump’s ear, a proximity over which there is a brutal Darwinian struggle in every White House.</p> \n<p>Pitchfork-wielding rabble</p> \n<p>Bannon talks much about the decadence of America's political elites. In his view, in almost every realm, their policy is no more than acceptance of what he calls “managed decline.” In this way they resigned themselves to globalization, to the decline of American power, to illegal immigration, to unfair trade agreements and much else. The best they dare hope for is managing this process of decline. As an Israeli, the first example that came to mind for me was the Iranian nuclear project. The Obama administration accepted a slow decline toward the military nuclearization of Iran, and made do with managing the decline: framing the process with an agreement, placing it under review, perhaps even effective scrutiny. But Obama had no intention of halting the process itself. Along came Trump with what Bannon terms “creative destruction.” He denied the necessity of the decline, tore the agreement to shreds and started to impose aggressive sanctions on Iran.</p> \n<p>For Bannon, the term “creative destruction,” which had long since become part of the folklore of capitalism , transcends the economic sphere. It also designates his attitude to the bureaucracy he despises and to the flaccid policies of previous presidents. It’s the opposite of the attitude of “managed decline.” Still, the term also resonates with voices from the hard European right: violent vitalism as an antidote to the “decline of the West,” which Oswald Spengler feared, instinctive nationalism as the remedy to liberal feebleness, the ties between blood and soil in contrast to the contractual conception of the democratic society. All these associations undoubtedly played a part in the panic Bannon stirred in his opponents, who portrayed him, sometimes to his delight, as the dark knight bringing chaos in his wake.</p> \n<p>It’s difficult to say how closely that image reflects his concrete plans, because Bannon’s rhetoric, too, shifts between militant interviews and quiet conversations, like the one we held in the Breitbart Embassy, in which he sought to place his views methodically on a factual, rational foundation. In his militant moods, the populism he talks about sounds like the revenge of a torch- and pitchfork-wielding mob straight out of “Frankenstein.” In his quieter moods, he describes populism as the struggle of decency against injustice, a wave from which every honest citizen can benefit, minorities included as a matter of course.</p> \n<p>But the question is ultimately not one of style but of degree: How far will Trumpism’s creative destruction go, and where exactly will it stop? The God of ideology is in the details of politics.</p> \n<p>But whatever Trump does, he will not acquiesce to “managed decline to unacceptable outcomes.”</p> \n<p>China is one case in point. The political class, in both parties, has “told us for 25 years that the rise of China is like the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It’s physics. There’s nothing you can do about it,” Bannon says. “In fact, the only thing we can do about it is take them off the banking system. Or keep them out of the capital markets.” But this leads to unacceptable outcomes. It takes jobs away from Americans, it weakens America world-wide. It de-industralizes the U.S. “Trump showed in the last 90 days that there are any number of weapons we can use to blow them up. One is tariffs. They said we can’t do 10 billions of tariffs, that would be too much for any American president. He’s done a half a trillion. And then another 400 billion. And if that won’t work, maybe there’s more. Then there is the biggest weapon, the one he announced [at the end of June]: to stop all Chinese investment in this country. They can’t invest in any technology company here. They can’t just take our innovations anymore. And if this is tightly enforced, they can become a Third World country in 10 years.</p> \n<p>“Because they are taking, and I’m not talking about stealing – they steal, too, but that can be dealt with – I am talking about taking our technology, because they are partners through their government funds, in investments in American companies that develop [these technologies]. We are giving them these things. Why? Because all kinds of geniuses here and in Western Europe think that if we trade with them freely, if we let them share in the market, they will become like us, democrats and liberals. Bullshit. They are not like us. The Chinese did something historic. They raised 350 million people from working poverty into the middle class; and they raised another 400 million from abject poverty to working poverty. That’s a vast improvement in the living conditions of three quarters of a billion people. But who financed that? We did. We and the rest of the West.</p> \n<p>“Because we exported all the jobs to them. There is no reason for there to be poor people In America. No reason. Except for the fact that the elites reconciled themselves to managed decline to unacceptable outcomes. That is, they are acceptable for the elites, because they profit on the way down just like they profited on the way up. The outcomes are unacceptable to the deplorables. They are the ones that pay the price. Then along comes Trump. And he shows China the iron fist but also the velvet glove.”</p> \n<p>‘Sloppy Steve’</p> \n<p>If you ask Bannon what changed since he was banished from the center of action, the official answer, perhaps in contrast to the personal one, will be: nothing. The populist revolution is proceeding apace: Trump’s plan, whose existence and methods continue to be denied by the media, is steaming ahead in full throttle. And Bannon will continue to support it, albeit now from the outside. Wherever Trump goes on Air Force One, Bannon will also go, by other means of transportation, and he will go on disseminating the message from the outside, explaining it, promoting it, defending it. After all, populism (or Trumpism) is bigger than him and bigger than Trump.</p> \n<p>There are some, even in the American right, who think that Bannon is trying to impose his ideas on Trump by persuading the media, and hopefully Trump himself, that they share the same views. Some of them think Bannon was ejected precisely because this is not the case. This would mean that he will not be coming back into the administration anytime soon.</p> \n<p>The truth, though, probably lies somewhere in the middle. And not because the truth is an average between contradictory arguments, but because when one examines Trump’s concrete policies, beyond the roiling emotions and the daily noises of the media, there seems to be a considerable correlation with Bannon’s vision. One possibility is that the two are in agreement, even if they reached their conclusions in different ways. Another possibility is that it’s all just a long string of coincidences. But it is also likely that Bannon who had Trump’s ear for a long stretch of the campaign, influenced him considerably. Or perhaps it’s a combination of the three. In any event, it appears that Bannon’s delight in the success of the “economic nationalism” revolution is not just a PR stint. Much is going as he wanted it to.</p> \n<p>I tried to insist on hearing something that would nonetheless be critical of Trump. In the books and in media leaks Bannon had quite a few critical remarks – witty and acerbic – over time, concerning what went on in the White House. But the sarcasm has faded completely. Is there nothing, I ask him? It was all rosy and pink? Short silence. A smile. And then: “Maybe he shouldn’t have called me ‘Sloppy Steve,’” Bannon says. But that was 80 percent humor and only 20 percent resentment. “Sloppy Steve” is the term Trump invented for Bannon because of his defiantly careless appearance: cargo pants and a few shirts on top of each other, sometimes with a jacket, sometimes without. Not the standard look for a chief strategist at the White House. Probably, if it were the first step toward a return to the White House, Bannon would even be ready to wear a suit. He doesn’t deny that he would like to return. That is, to the degree that it has to do with Trump’s White House; to return to the White House himself, as president, is not in the cards now. Bannon did not say anything that would hint in such a direction, of course. But where the more distant future is concerned, it’s too early to guess. He’ll be only 65 this November. The future is still before him. And we have certainly not heard the last of him. That you can bet on.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Rabbi Jacob ben Asher was scandalized when he found out his congregants were eating stork. “Don't they know the Bible explicitly prohibits the eating of the bird?” the young community leader must have asked himself.</p> \n<p>There was much he didn’t understand about the congregation he had recently begun to lead, including their Judeo-Spanish language, for one.</p> \n<p>Jacob had come to central Spain in the late 13th century with his family, to escape persecution by Emperor Rudolf. Jacob’s famed father Asher ben Jehiel, known as ha-Rosh - “the head,” was appointed rabbi of Toledo’s Jewish community, and Jacob and his brothers became the rabbis of satellite communities in the surrounding area.</p> \n<p>When young Jacob learned his congregants were eating stork, he wrote to his father, asking what he should do. When no response ensued, he wrote again.</p> \n<p>This time the father answered and in no uncertain terms, advised the son to stick to the traditions of &quot;the wise men of Ashkenaz (German Jewry), whose learning was an inheritance from their fathers from the days of the destruction&quot; (of the Temple).</p> \n<p>Essentially, Asher was telling his son not to trust the customs of Spanish Jewry. French and German Jewish tradition, that of the family, had been faithfully preserved since the time of the Temple, while theirs – who knows. In other words: Don’t fall into sin and eat stork with them!</p> \n<p>But not everyone agreed. One of Asher’s pupils, Rabbenu Yerucham, who settled in Toledo after the Jews were expelled from France in 1306, disagreed with his great teacher. In his book “Toldot Adam ve-Khava” Yerucham wrote that according to the regular methods of determining kashrut of birds, the stork is kosher.</p> \n<p>According to the Mishnah, Yerucham pointed out, “Any bird of prey is prohibited. Any bird that has an extra digit, a crop, and gizzard that peels is permitted” (Chullin 3:6). The stork meets these criteria, so, he argued, it's kosher. Furthermore, “I have received a tradition that it is a clean bird and I have seen several places where tradition dictates that one can eat it,&quot; he wrote.</p> \n<p>Eat not of the vulture</p> \n<p>The crux of the argument, which must have been quite heated in 14th century Spain, was what bird exactly the bible was prohibiting.</p> \n<p>The Bible did not say “stork,” of course, being written in Hebrew. It has not one but two lists of around 20 unclean birds, in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14. One of the banned birds is a bird called khasida.</p> \n<p>The rabbis of medieval France and Germany identified this mysterious khasida as the stork, a tradition they believed went back to Moses and Mount Sinai.</p> \n<p>But Yerucham wasn’t certain that their identification was accurate. “We shouldn't trust names of which we are uncertain,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>So who was right? Does khasida indeed mean stork as the North European rabbis said it does or does it mean something else as Spanish Jews suspected?</p> \n<p>In the end, the whole question boils down to this: does the Hebrew word khasida mean stork or not?</p> \n<p>Looking at how the six mentions of the khasida in Bible were translated by the ancient translators might be helpful.</p> \n<p>The oldest translation, the Septuagint, was into Greek. It twice translated khasida as heron, once as pelican, once as hoopoe, and twice - evidently because the translator didn’t know what bird was meant at all - just transliterated the Hebrew word into Greek.</p> \n<p>Somewhat later the rabbis translated the Bible into Aramaic. They were more consistent, translating khasida as &quot;white one&quot; or &quot;white daya.&quot; What kind of bird or group of birds the Aramaic word daya referred to is not clear but it is quite certain we are talking of a bird of prey. In one exception, Zechariah (5:9), the rabbis translated the khasida into the Aramaic for vulture.</p> \n<p>A different translation into Aramaic, the Samaritans translated khasida into sparrow, while the Christian translation into Syriac was &quot;khorba,&quot; and what kind of bird that was is anyone’s guess.</p> \n<p>St. Jerome’s translation of the Bible into Latin, the Vulgate, basically followed the Greek translations, with minor adjustments.</p> \n<p>The bottom line is that no one in antiquity seems to have thought that the khasida was a stork.</p> \n<p>Eat not of whatever that is</p> \n<p>While there seems to have been quite a bit of disagreement on the question of what bird the khasida was, by Talmudic times (the 3rd to the 5th centuries C.E.) agreement had been reached among the rabbis in the center of world Jewry (which – after the Romans put down the Bar Kokhba Revolt in the late second century – had moved from Palestine to Babylonia).</p> \n<p>The Talmud doesn’t record any arguments on this issue, only providing the Aramaic definition of Rabbi Judah that the khasida was a &quot;daya khavarita&quot; (Khulin 63b), meaning some kind of whitish bird of prey. That agreed with the rabbinic translations of the Bible into Aramaic; but again we cannot know which bird was meant. The Middle East and Levant do not have naturally white birds of prey, though there are some light-bellied ones, which could be the intention.</p> \n<p>This consensus that the khasida was a bird of prey, but not a stork, was maintained for hundreds of years in Babylonia, well into the time of the Geonim (9th-11th centuries C.E.). Sa’adia Ga’on and his bitter enemies the Karaite Jews agreed that khasida is best translated using the Arabic word saqar. </p> \n<p>Today saqar is the Arabic word for falcon, but at the time, it was used for any kind of bird used for hunting, not just falcons. Sa’adia explicitly tells us in the introduction to his translation of the Bible, that he did not just make up his translations of the names of the unclean birds listed in the Torah: he received their identity from his rabbis.</p> \n<p>This Babylonian tradition identifying the khasida as a “saqar” made its way from Babylonia to Spain. That is the word’s meaning given in the dictionary of Jonah ibn Janah, written in the first half of 11th century Spain. So we can see why Spanish Jews thought storks were kosher. They had the hallmarks of a kosher bird prescribed by the Mishnah - and they weren’t on the list of those 20 birds in the Torah.</p> \n<p>The question is what happened in Europe that caused the Jews there to identify the khasida with the stork.</p> \n<p>Eat not of the heron, I think</p> \n<p>The answer apparently is Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki of Troyes, France, known by all as Rashi.</p> \n<p>During the second half of the 11th century, Rashi labored on his commentary of the Bible and the Babylonian Talmud, which became and still are highly influential. It was in these that Rashi identified the khasida with the stork, apparently for the first time.</p> \n<p>Rashi could not read Arabic and was thus cut off from the traditions of the Geonim. He based his commentary of the oral tradition he received from his teachers, and his own power of logic.</p> \n<p>With regard to the identity of the 20 unclean birds listed in the Bible, Rashi apparently did not receive a precise identification of each one. He writes in his commentary that the anafa, the bird coming right after the khasida in the list, was a heron - “I think.”</p> \n<p>He may have been more certain regarding the khasida, since he doesn’t qualify that its identification was based on conjecture, but it probably was.</p> \n<p>This was a habit of Rashi's: he would provide translations for words in the Bible and Talmud based on conjecture, without necessarily telling his readers.</p> \n<p>For example, Rashi very confidently tells us in his Talmud commentary that the sigaley (Shabbat 50b) is a flower known as the violet, but this could not have been the case. Violets do grow in France but they did not in Babylonia, where the Talmud was compiled, so the Talmudic rabbis couldn’t have been talking about them.</p> \n<p>Another example is the bdolakh mentioned in in Genesis 2:12 and Numbers 11:7. Rashi tells us that this is lead-glass crystal. But that is a modern invention: we now know that the word refers to the fragrant resin known as bdellium. That is what the word meant in the original Akkadian.</p> \n<p>So it seems that Rashi basically guessed that the khasida was a stork, not that he didn’t have good reason to assume so. Storks don’t meet our modern definitions of birds of prey, but they do eat frogs, reptiles, fish, and small mammals. Anyway, the Jews of France in his day were not eating them.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the Bible says that the khasida &quot;knoweth her appointed times&quot; (Jeremiah 8:7), and the stork does indeed keep to an accurate schedule with its migration, arriving in France each year in the spring and leaving in the fall. Also, while natural storks have black wings, most of the bird certainly is white.</p> \n<p>But most importantly, khasida, the Hebrew word for stork stems from a Hebrew root meaning piety, the same root that gave us the words &quot;Hassid&quot; and “Hassidic.” In the European culture which Rashi lived in, the stork was believed to be an extremely pious bird. It’s got to be a stork, Rashi reasoned.</p> \n<p>The influence of Rashi’s commentaries was immense. Once Rashi identified the khasida with the stork, this became the traditional view among European Jews with in just a few generations. Over time this tradition spread throughout the Jewish world, and into Christian vernacular translations of the Bible.</p> \n<p>The identification of the khasida with the stork began to spread throughout Spanish Jewry as we have seen with the arrival of Asher ben Jehiel and his family at the turn of the 14th century, and Spanish Jews gradually stopped eating the bird.</p> \n<p>When the Jews of Spain were expelled in 1492, they took the ban on stork to Jewish communities throughout the Arabic-speaking world, and these communities too stopped eating storks. Eventually all Jews accepted Rashi’s identification of the biblical khasida with the stork and today all Jews accept that storks are not kosher.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In May 2018, a group of more than 50 British Jews –&nbsp;old and young, Orthodox and progressive, Zionist and non-Zionist&nbsp;– gathered in London’s Parliament Square to mourn the Palestinians killed by the IDF in Gaza. Through songs and prayer, including the recitation of the mourner’s prayer, Kaddish, we expressed&nbsp;our sorrow over the conflict engulfing Israelis and Palestinians. Drawing on the values of compassion and justice instilled in us by the Jewish community, we called upon British Jewish leadership to condemn Israel’s siege of Gaza and the occupation.</p> \n<p>In the aftermath of that protest, we were vilely abused, harassed, and threatened by members of our community. Our fellow Jews accused us of desecrating the sanctity of the Kaddish while in the same breath threatening violence and wishing us dead.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>We were no longer the present and future of the Jewish community, despite being active in synagogues, the Board of Deputies of British Jews (British Jewry’s main representative body), youth movements, and charities. We were now Kapos. Traitors. Scum. What was missing in that heated debate was mention of Palestinians, Israel’s occupation, and the siege on Gaza. Those, once again, were swept under the rug.</p> \n<p>That experience drove us to found&nbsp;Na’amod: British Jews Against Occupation in July 2018. We were galvanized by the British Jewish community’s complicit silence on Israel’s transgressions against Palestinians and the severity of abuse levelled at anti-occupation Jews.</p> \n<p>For generations our community leaders have sat comfortably on the sidelines, cheering for a team that employs dirty tactics of occupation: demolishing Palestinian homes and taking their land, building illegal Israeli settlements, and violently suppressing Palestinian protests.</p> \n<p>Our community has been morally corrupted by this complicity. As children we were taught “Tzedek Tzedek Tirdof” (Justice, justice you shall pursue), yet no mainstream British Jewish organization has pursued justice by taking unequivocal action against Israel’s occupation.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;A radical split: How anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are dividing British politics | Analysis&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;Why Corbynism is a threat to Jews throughout the Western world&nbsp;■ Opinion:&nbsp;Dial down the hysteria on anti-Semitism in Corbyn's Labour&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Plenty have paid lip service to “peace,” but this is simply not good enough. We want to see action. Although it may be painful for British Jews to challenge a state to which they feel deeply connected, the right path is not always the easiest. If our communal leaders will not willingly change, we must force them to decide: Will they support a system which deprives Palestinians of their dignity and human rights? Or will they support freedom and equality for all Israelis and Palestinians?</p> \n<p>Na’amod has formed a proudly broad British Jewish synagogue. We welcome religious pluralism, with representation from almost every British Jewish denomination. Some organizers are halachically observant; others are entirely secular. Our members are affiliated with numerous Jewish organizations, and we do not take a common position on BDS, Zionism or borders. We embrace this political diversity&nbsp;and welcome anyone who identifies with our aims.&nbsp;Through direct action, protests, and education,&nbsp;we will challenge the dominant narrative peddled by Jewish leadership (such as the Board of Deputies) – a narrative which normalizes occupation and Palestinians’ oppression – and push for alternative voices to be loudly represented within our communal institutions.</p> \n<p>Across the pond in the United States, IfNotNow has led the way in building a mass movement of committed Jewish anti-occupation activists since its foundation four years ago. Although we are influenced by their work – our recent information campaign targeting Birthright participants at a London airport was inspired by similar action from IfNotNow – we are entirely independent.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In some ways, Na’amod has an easier task than IfNotNow. British Jews give much less financial support to the occupation and our leading institutions are not quite as doggedly hawkish as their American counterparts. Our community is relatively small, meaning that leading establishment figures are more likely to have interacted with individuals within Na’amod - especially in London. It is simply harder to dismiss someone as a hateful irritant when they teach your child Hebrew at synagogue.</p> \n<p>Na’amod is part of a growing global movement of Jews opposed to our communities’ complacency and complicity; anti-occupation movements exist throughout Europe and in South Africa, Australia and Canada. Diaspora Jews must act together in actively challenging our leaders and ensuring they unequivocally oppose the occupation. Only a global effort will succeed in holding Israel to account for what it does to Palestinians in our name.</p> \n<p>Those who uphold the status quo will attempt to silence, smear, and ostracise us. They will seek to have us expelled from our youth movements; barred from our synagogues; dismissed from our jobs in Jewish organizations. They will do this because they cannot dismiss us as an irrelevant fringe movement; we are active and engaged members of the community.</p> \n<p>British Jewry, like other diaspora communities, is not immune to progress. Na’amod is part of the next chapter on the road to freedom and dignity for all Israelis and Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Sonia Resnick is an organizer with Na'amod: British Jews Against Occupation and an incoming post-graduate student at Oxford University.

        "text":["<p>Standing on a stone floor near an open balcony, we first-time visitors to Jerusalem with Birthright-Taglit closed our eyes, entrusting our hands and safety to friends. We rounded the corner and formed a small crowd at the edge of the balcony, opening our eyes to one of the holiest and certainly most iconic views in Judaism: the Western Wall.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With gasps, tears, hugs, and quiet comradery, we took the time to truly appreciate the significance of where we stood. For many, this was the moment we finally began to feel we were home.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But that is all it was - just a moment - before it was shattered by a live-streamed, politically motivated, and carefully planned announcement by six members of our trip.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>They announced they would be leaving the trip to visit a Palestinian family. The activists said that their questions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had not been answered during the first few days of the trip, and they were appalled at the way Birthright had hidden the truth from them and presented a biased, right-wing agenda.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Principled Activists or Entitled Brats? What's Wrong With the Birthright Walk-outs&nbsp;| Analysis &gt;&gt;&nbsp;Birthright's So Scared of Arabs It's Banned Them&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is not an accurate portrayal of our trip. Their speech gave them the media attention they were seeking, but it was filled with misrepresentation and distortion. We, the remaining participants of Taglit Israel Outdoors Bus 428, are here to set the record straight.</p> \n<p>Throughout their abbreviated participation, these protesters used every opportunity to vocalize their viewpoints, using group discussions, evening relaxation time, bus rides, and hiking rest stops to share their emotionally-charged rhetoric about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with the group.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At first, most of us were receptive to their questions – we considered them an important dialogue to include in a trip well-known to be heavily funded by right-wing American donors and the Israeli government.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When one activist stressed the need to include conversations about the conflict in our trip, our group leaders generously allowed her to lead a dialogue on the evening of our first full day, during which we discussed and debated the topic for hours. From the first day, the trip schedule had been altered to make space for their ideas.</p> \n<p>Many of us, like the activists, had come to Israel intending to ask difficult questions as a meaningful and integral part of our experience. After the first night, one of us even volunteered to lead an effort to pen a group letter to Birthright expressing our disappointment at the lack of importance given to the Palestinian crisis on the trip.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The rhetoric flowing from select group members, however, quickly became unreasonably aggressive and directed at our tour guide, who never avoided the topic, silenced their speech, or seemed to take offense at their disregard for his perspective. He answered each question calmly, patiently, and to the best of his ability, providing an extraordinarily neutral view of the conflict and acknowledging his bias as a former IDF soldier when necessary.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When questions became incessant and repetitive, our guide repeatedly reminded the group that our schedule included a geopolitical discussion with a professor of Middle Eastern history later in the week, and that the professor would be better equipped to answer some of their specific questions. In fact, during that lecture, the professor answered questions in an open and honest way and encouraged us to do our own research and fact-checking on the information he presented us with.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, the activists did not stick around long enough to attend that discussion. Nor did they make any effort to connect with or ask questions of the seven Israelis who accompanied our trip, having lived in the midst of the conflict throughout their entire lives.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The narrative being portrayed in the media, and the carefully selected scenes from a particularly frustrating bus ride, do not fully capture our group’s willingness, even eagerness, to discuss the conflict.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;IfNotNow Is So Noisy About the Occupation. Why Is It So Quiet About Israel's Right to Exist?&nbsp;| Opinion &gt;&gt; After Giving Them the Finger, Birthright Co-founder Slams ‘Stupid Left-wing Jews’ at Protest&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It became apparent only after the walk-off that everything had been premeditated. Four of the six protesters had already been working prior to the trip with IfNotNow, an activist group with the goal of changing how Birthright presents the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It did not matter that the reality of our group and our tour guide did not match with the traumatic, partisan experience that IfNotNow led them to believe they would have - part of that &quot;preparation&quot; suggesting their tour guide would be crudely pro-Israel, and even Islamophobic. The genuine efforts of our guide and our group leaders to create space for dialogue were not enough for them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So, at our most vulnerable moment, they pulled out their cameras and turned us into a media spectacle for political gain. They filmed us without our consent and sent videos of our group to news outlets to be broadcast to the world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When our guide expressed that he understood their decision and asked for ten minutes to follow procedure and contact Birthright’s office to prepare for their departure, they refused and stormed off. After their departure, they presented an incorrect narrative to the media, asserting that they could not grapple with the fact that Birthright refused to bring Palestinian perspectives to the table.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yet, we all knew what we had signed up for; we saw the itinerary ahead of time and agreed to Birthright’s terms. Our tour guide said it best: Birthright is paid for by the Israeli government and that government is not going to allow an anti-Israel activist to speak to the group. We came on the trip with the knowledge that we would be seeing Israel as the Israeli government wants it to be seen.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Furthermore, we were brought to Israel to connect with our Jewish heritage and to bolster the Israeli economy, not to solve a major geopolitical conflict in ten days. We were Israel’s guests and we were not &quot;owed&quot; anything on this all-expense-paid trip.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It is not wrong to challenge the narrative you are presented with, to ask difficult questions, and to seek out multiple opinions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, these activists took advantage of the trip and took spots away from others in order to stage a political stunt, and then pretended that the structure of the trip surprised them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The activists had many options to see the other side of the conflict and to promote change. They could have, as our own tour guide encouraged them to do, extended their trip to visit the West Bank and hear from Palestinians. This would have allowed them to remain on the trip for its entire duration and calmly encourage further dialogue and education about the conflict within our group. They could have written a letter to Birthright, as our group had planned, to express their discomfort with the program’s omission of the Palestinian perspective.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;U.S. Jews Have Enabled Israel's Occupation. Now We Must End It&nbsp;| Opinion &gt;&gt;&nbsp;It's Only About Them: U.S. Jews' Outrage on the Wall, Silence on the Occupation Is Obscene&nbsp;| Opinion &gt;&gt;&nbsp;U.S. Jewish Liberals Won’t Be Manning the Anti-occupation Barricades Anytime Soon&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>If they had not isolated themselves, they could have worked within the system to gain support and create a network of Birthright alumni who could push for future change to the trip’s itinerary. Instead, they left and took their viewpoint with them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>They were not interested in seeing both sides of the conflict, as they claimed. They came on the trip with clear &quot;right and wrong&quot; sides in their heads and refused to hear anything that might contradict their ironclad opinions. Instead of responsibly hearing from both sides, they chose to hear a one-sided narrative from the Palestinian perspective.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Fostering discourse and political debate is a positive thing; many of us writing this letter have differing political opinions. Judaism has always included critical thinking and the importance of discussion in its teachings. One of the fundamentals of being a good Jew is to be inquisitive. We are taught to ask questions and to debate, but also to be open-minded.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We support the activists’ right to speak their beliefs, but we do not support the method by which they were expressed. We wish they had chosen to stay on our trip and had continued the conversation that we began on our first night in a more productive and friendly way.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sara Lodgen is a higher education professional from Boston, MA.

Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff&nbsp;here</p> \n<p>VIEW IN DEBUT:&nbsp;An early version of today’s Daily Kickoff was available in the app-based&nbsp;Debut Inbox for newsletters&nbsp;starting at 7:08&nbsp;AM EDT and later updated throughout the morning.&nbsp;  TOP TALKER: A Couple Dozen Neo-Nazis Got The Red Carpet Treatment From DC Law Enforcement — by Jessica Schulberg, Travis Waldron, and Doha Madani:&nbsp;&quot;When the small band of neo-Nazis approached a park in front of the White House, there were several hundred counterprotesters awaiting them. In some ways, the scene was a victory for anti-racist organizers. Unlike last year, when racists overwhelmed the city of Charlottesville, white supremacist organizer Jason Kessler could scarcely pull together enough racists this year to fill a train car.&quot;[HuffPost]&nbsp;  --&nbsp;&quot;Kessler had tried to book former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and neo-Nazi Patrick Little as speakers, but they didn’t come.&quot;&nbsp;[DailyBeast]&nbsp;  Anti-hate protesters far outnumber white supremacists as groups rally near White House —&nbsp;by&nbsp;Joe Heim,&nbsp;Reis Thebault, Peter Jamison&nbsp;and&nbsp;Marissa Lang:&nbsp;&quot;At the Vienna Metro station, VJ Hyde, a 38-year-old music teacher from Fairfax County, pulled a new stack of posters and a roll of tape from his Whole Foods shopping bag and doled them out to his wife and two daughters...&nbsp;to post the “Hate Free Zone” and “Hate Has No Home Here” fliers. “We’re here because this is a very messed up time in our country and our community is front and center,” Hyde said. He and his family are Jewish and their friends are Asian American.&quot;&nbsp;[WashPost]&nbsp;  Ron Halber, Executive Director of the&nbsp;Jewish&nbsp;Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, tell us...&nbsp;&quot;The big lesson of [yesterday] was that hate didn't win. I think people should take comfort in that. The white supremacists failed miserably. They were dwarfed by the counter-protesters. But even more important were the over 200 congregations, representing over a dozen states, that signed a declaration of unity. The protesters came here to inspire hate and they only became the stimulus to love, unity and for equality. This is a wonderful day of rejecting hate in America, and it makes it even more significant because that rejection took place in our nation's capital.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;But this cannot be the end,&quot; Halber continued. &quot;I would hope that the bringing together of people might translate into a lowering of the rhetoric in U.S. political discourse on both sides. Our elected officials, in general, have to do a better job in setting a tone of bipartisanship and compromise, and not hurling political bombs at each other. There must be constant vigilance&nbsp;in all sectors of society —&nbsp;and I don't mean just the White House. I mean Governors and members of Congress, clergy, community leaders, business and labor leaders —&nbsp;to reject polarization. We need to bring back civil discourse that used to be a hallmark of American politics. We used to able to disagree without being disagreeable. Today, we disagree and are disagreeable. And there clearly has to be immediate and unequivocal condemnation of racism, bigotry against any group by both sides of the aisle whenever it&nbsp;rears its ugly head.&quot;&nbsp;  Rabbi Aaron Alexander of Adas Israel, who spoke at the United to Love rally on&nbsp;the National Mall yesterday, emails us...&nbsp;“I sounded the shofar —&nbsp;just feet from the Capital Building —&nbsp;for a large and diverse crowd of faith leaders and followers, those who united to share how the power of expansive love brings joy and light in God’s world. That potency of sight and sound reaffirmed for me the narrative of this great country that is one of its core value—we are in this together—all of us. It is because of our diversity that we generate opportunities for human thriving, not despite them...”  ADL's Jonathan Greenblatt writes... &quot;Five lessons of Charlottesville one year later:&nbsp;White supremacist hate groups are not going away any time soon. The reports of their demise are premature. We see signs of this all around us. There are&nbsp;nine&nbsp;white supremacists&nbsp;running for elected office this year&nbsp;and we’ve seen a big increase in their use of fliers to deliver their&nbsp;messages&nbsp;on college campuses... Confronting this resurgence of hate will require our best community building and coalition efforts.&quot;&nbsp;[USAToday]  Ivanka Trump&nbsp;tweeted&nbsp;on Saturday night:&nbsp;&quot;While Americans are blessed to live in a nation that protects liberty, freedom of speech and diversity of opinion, there is no place for white supremacy, racism and neo-nazism in our great country. Rather than tearing each other down with hatred, racism and violence, we can lift one another up, strengthen our communities and strive to help every American achieve his or her full potential!&quot;  LongRead — How Bill Browder Became Russia’s Most Wanted Man — by&nbsp;Joshua Yaffa: &quot;Browder, who is fifty-four, with a dusting of silver hair and rimless eyeglasses, has a forceful yet understated authority and a talent for telling a coolly suspenseful tale. In 2015, he published a memoir, “Red Notice,” which sold three hundred and fifty thousand copies in the U.S. and was described by a reviewer in the&nbsp;Times&nbsp;as “riveting” and “marred only by Browder’s perhaps justifiable but nevertheless grating sense of self-importance.” He is a persuasive speaker, and careful in selecting the details of the story he presents. (He declined to talk to me for a profile.)&quot;[NewYorker]  --&nbsp;Hacked Emails Take Us Inside the Billionaires’ Club Around Vladimir Putin&nbsp;[DailyBeast]  Kushner’s Ties to Russia-Linked Group Began With Kissinger Lunch — by&nbsp;Caleb Melby,&nbsp;David Kocieniewski and&nbsp;Gerry Smith:&nbsp;&quot;In March 2016... Jared Kushner was invited to lunch for a think tank urging detente with Russia and struggling for influence in Washington... The main attraction of the March 14th event was Henry Kissinger, the [Center for the National Interest's] honorary chairman, who gave a talk that included analyzing U.S.-Russia relations for a small group of attendees. Kushner, who remained quiet and unobtrusive during the lunch, introduced himself to Kissinger afterward.&nbsp;He also met Dimitri Simes, the Russian-born president of the center and publisher of its magazine, The National Interest.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;[Kushner] and Simes organized Trump’s &quot;America First&quot; speech at the Mayflower Hotel the next month, with writing input and a guest list from the center. It was at the Mayflower that Kushner first met Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak...&nbsp;Kushner had been involved in a previous foreign policy speech, one Trump gave to The American Israel Public Affairs Committee. But as a religious Jew, he had long been interested in Israel. The Mayflower event illustrated to other members of the campaign his broader interest in foreign policy.&quot;  &quot;Kushner’s invitation to the March lunch came from a Time Warner executive. Richard Plepler, CEO of television network HBO, and his boss, then-Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, sit on the board of the center. Attendees that day included Jeffrey Zucker, president of CNN.&quot;&nbsp;[Bloomberg]  ULTIMATE DEAL WATCH:&nbsp;Trump Administration Seeks to Withhold Millions in Aid to Palestinians — by&nbsp;Colum Lynch:&nbsp;&quot;The White House is seeking to withhold up to $200 million in relief aid for Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the West Bank...&nbsp;The amount represents nearly all of the humanitarian aid the United States provides directly to the Palestinians...&nbsp;U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and top Middle East advisor, decided on the cuts in a high-level meeting earlier this week. Congress had already appropriated $230 million in economic support funds for private relief groups in Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. But the officials decided they would ask lawmakers to withhold most of the funds.&quot;  &quot;Pompeo initially opposed the sweeping cuts, arguing that it would be better to redirect U.S. funding to other international relief efforts. But Kushner pushed back, maintaining that ending the assistance outright could strengthen his negotiating hand when he introduces his long-awaited Middle East peace plan.&quot;&nbsp;[ForeignPolicy]  Dave Harden, former director of USAID's West Bank and&nbsp;Gaza&nbsp;mission under the Obama administration, writes...&nbsp;&quot;Kushner is right to demand a fundamental re-ordering of UNRWA.&nbsp;The UN agency serves as a welfare and humanitarian relief provider which after 70 years subsidizes despair and continued conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis... Disrupting the UNRWA’s organizational model is essential if the Middle East wants to see a different future.&quot;[ToI]  VIEW OF JERUSALEM: Israel asked the U.S. not to cut funding for UNRWA in Gaza — by Ariel Kahana:&nbsp;&quot;Israel has asked the U.S. not to cut UNRWA's budget in Gaza in order to avoid exacerbating the humanitarian situation in Gaza and to reduce the chances of violence. Sources involved in the matter&nbsp;said that Israel's position was presented to representatives of the Trump Administration several months ago, and is still valid today.&quot;&nbsp;[IsraelHayom]&nbsp;  REPORT:&nbsp;Egypt losing hope to partner with Trump for Middle East &quot;deal of the century&quot; —&nbsp;by Jacob Wirtschafter:&nbsp;&quot;Egyptian zeal to partner with&nbsp;Mr. Trump’s special envoys...&nbsp;has dimmed in recent months with a lack of concrete progress...&quot;&nbsp;[WashTimes]  ON THE GROUND —&nbsp;With One Eye on Syria, Israel Reluctantly Seeks Gaza Truce — by David Wainer:&nbsp;&quot;To keep his military focused on the northern front, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pursuing a long-term truce with Hamas, the militant group that rules the Gaza Strip. Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the negotiations, carried out through intermediaries, serve both Israel and Hamas.&quot;[Bloomberg]  HAPPENING TODAY —&nbsp;President Trump will sign the&nbsp;National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 into law in Fort Drum, NY. The bill&nbsp;includes the U.S.-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2018, which&nbsp;authorizes&nbsp;the 10-year MOU with Israel, and allocates additional&nbsp;funding for&nbsp;U.S.-Israel missile defense cooperation.&nbsp;  Iran's top leader bans any negotiations with Washington:&nbsp;“Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's remarks were carried by Iran's state television Monday. He says &quot;along with sanctions, Americans have recently raised two more options, war and talks. ... War will not happen and we will not enter talks.&quot; Khamenei added that &quot;negotiations with the U.S. would definitely harm us and they are forbidden.”&nbsp;[AP]  INSIDE THE ADMIN —&nbsp;Trump’s diplomatic learning curve:&nbsp;The president has often perplexed foreign officials and his own aides as he learns how to deal with the world beyond America's borders — by Daniel Lippman&nbsp;[Politico]  Has Stephen Miller Become a Shadow Master at the State Department? —&nbsp;by&nbsp;Abigail Tracy:&nbsp;&quot;Miller has been particularly attentive to the refugee program at the State Department, which flows through the bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, cultivating attach&eacute;s to assist his agenda... “He is definitely in empire-building mode and succeeding at it,” a former administration official who worked on refugee policy told me...&quot;&nbsp;[VanityFair]  &quot;Stephen Miller is an Immigration Hypocrite. I Know Because I’m His Uncle&quot; — by David Glosser:&nbsp;&quot;I have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew, who is an educated man and well aware of his heritage, has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family’s life in this country. I shudder at the thought of what would have become of the Glossers had the same policies Stephen so coolly espouses— the travel ban, the radical decrease in refugees, the separation of children from their parents, and even talk of&nbsp;limiting&nbsp;citizenship for legal immigrants— been in effect when Wolf-Leib made his desperate bid for freedom.&quot;&nbsp;[PoliticoMag]  PODCAST PLAYBACK —&nbsp;Former McCain campaign strategist Steve Schmidt&nbsp;discussed John McCain's decision to pick Sarah Palin over Joe Lieberman as his running mate in 2008&nbsp;on the new &quot;Words Matter&quot; podcast with Elise Jordan:&nbsp;&quot;I have regret about that every day that I wake up. But what happened here was —&nbsp;that my idea, and McCain supported it, was that he was going to pick Joe Lieberman...&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;What I thought the path for McCain could be was to basically go out and say, 'I put the uniform of this country on when I was 17 years old, and I have spent every hour of my adult life in service to America, except for the period of time when I was a candidate for Congress after I retired from the navy, and I have been an imperfect servant of the country. But if the American people so honor me, I have one last mission, and I have asked to join me in that mission as my wingman and partner a great patriot, a great member of the Democratic Party, Joe Lieberman. We are going to work together, we are going to take a timeout from this poisonous, toxic partisanship, and we are going to fix this country's four biggest problems...'&quot;  &quot;What happened though is Lindsey Graham went out,&nbsp;not maliciously, but he let the secret&nbsp;spill, it leaked when he was talking to a group of activists in South Carolina, and within a very short period of time we had heard from [Rush] Limbaugh from [Sean] Hannity, directly from President Bush, from Karl Rove saying 'you just can't do it.'&quot;&nbsp;Minute 19:07&nbsp;[Podcast]&nbsp;h/t Playbook  MIDTERMS:&nbsp;Jews Poised For 14% Boost In Congress As Democratic Midterm Wave Looms — by Ben Fractenberg:&nbsp;&quot;The Forward’s analysis predicts that the new House will include at least 25 Jews — a hefty 14% increase from the 22 Jewish representatives today. The analysis says there is a 72% chance of at least 25 Jewish seats, with lesser chances of one or two more seats.

But a victory in the Oct. 30 election would make him the first Palestinian representative at City Hall — and the personification of a political shift that isn’t making headlines... The way Mr. Dabash sees it, the chances of a peace deal are nil. With Hezbollah, Hamas, the Islamic State and the Syrian war all within a three-hour drive from here, an Israeli pullout isn’t happening anytime soon. To get things done, Mr. Dabash has been willing to play ball not just with Israelis but with the Israeli right, the only real political force in this conservative city.

        "text":["<p>Following his highly publicized detention&nbsp;last week for officiating at non-Orthodox weddings, a prominent Conservative rabbi in Israel says he has been inundated in recent days with requests from other young couples that he marry them, too.</p> \n<p>“Eight couples have already approached me and asked that I officiate at their weddings,” Rabbi Dov Haiyun, of Moriah Congregation in Haifa, told Haaretz. “Ordinarily, I don’t get more than two requests a month, or at most, one a week. I expect that the numbers will continue growing, and all I can say is that I should probably deliver the rabbinate authorities here in Haifa a bouquet of flowers for all the good publicity they’ve given me.”</p> \n<p>Last Thursday, Haiyun was detained for questioning by the Israel Police after a complaint was filed against him by the Rabbinical Court in Haifa for allegedly “marrying those who are not eligible to be married.” This was the first attempt to enforce a law passed in 2013 that prohibits Jewish weddings performed outside the framework of the rabbinate and carries a two-year jail sentence.</p> \n<p>The rabbinate later clarified that the bride was suspected of being a mamzer (a person who is born of a forbidden relationship and is thus prohibited from marrying, according to halakha, Jewish religious law). Haiyun, however, said he had already checked her situation and ruled out that possibility before marrying the couple.</p> \n<p>At 5:30 A.M., Haiyun was woken up and taken in for questioning by the police, and released immediately afterward. Subsequently Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit instructed the police to suspend their investigation.</p> \n<p>The rabbi's interrogation, just days before the Jewish fast of Tisha B’Av (commemorating the destruction of the two temples), has drawn widespread condemnation, including in Orthodox circles. The fallout from the incident has also been financial: In recent days, many Israelis have donated small sums of money to the Conservative movement to show their support for Haiyun.</p> \n<p>According to Yizhar Hess, executive director of the movement in Israel, thousands of shekels has thus far been raised. On Monday, the movement responded to this outpouring of solidarity by launching an official fundraising campaign. A similar effort, Hess said, has been initiated by its international sister organization, the World Masorti movement.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Haiyun said that he plans to lodge an official complaint against the rabbinate in Haifa with the State Comptroller’s Office.</p> \n<p>“The rabbinate claimed that I was trying to avoid them, when in fact I have tapes that prove that I told them exactly when I was available to meet with them,” he said. “Also, they published the names and identification numbers of the couple I married, which is an outright invasion of privacy.”</p> \n<p>Haiyun is receiving legal representation from Rabbi Uri Regev, the executive director of Hiddush, a nonprofit that promotes freedom of religion and Jewish pluralism in Israel.</p> \n<p>Haiyun heads a new list dedicated to religious pluralism that will run in the municipal elections in Haifa in October. “A key goal of mine will be to change the composition of the religious council in the city, and I’ve been told that’s one of the reasons the rabbinate decided to go after me,” he told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>A long'standing member of the Labor Party who describes his politics as “center-left,” the rabbi adds that after gaining experience in city politics, he plans to make a run for the Knesset.</p> \n<p>“It is my belief that the only way to really affect change in this country is through politics,” said Haiyun.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Seventy years too late the Knesset passed the Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People, which if examined carefully turns out to be more a platform of an extremist sect than a constitutional-force law of a properly-run country. It pains me to inform those who labored over this legislation that they’ve missed the boat of history. And things done too late generally become tricky business.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Seventy years ago this law suited the spirit of the times, when David Ben-Gurion expelled more than 750,000 Palestinians. But for some reason the man delayed finishing the job, which would have meant also expelling the 160,000 Palestinians who remained in the new State of Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One could say it was a blunder, an eternal tragedy, a historic mistake, but the die was cast – now there is no Jewish state here unless people roll up their sleeves and forcefully expel not just 160,000 people, but 2 million. And that’s without counting the Palestinians in the West Bank, if one considers that part of the Jewish state.</p> \n<p>Here’s a scoop: U.S. President Donald Trump told a senior Palestinian official that when he heard Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explain how troublesome it was that 20 percent of Israel’s population is Arab, Trump answered – in a moment of clarity – that with a statistic like that, Israel was not a Jewish state. If Trump understands this then every toddler can understand it.</p> \n<p>This law missed the boat also because a shared life has developed here and it is impossible to run a modern state with two types of citizens, masters and servants. The era of slavery collapsed because industry demanded the employment of free people. How much more so today, when in almost every field there is a need for workers who aren’t just free people, but also creative people.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Druze lawmakers file first court challenge to Israel's nation-state law ■ Palestinian leaders to seek UN sanctions after Israel passes nation-state law ■ Planted by Netanyahu and Co., nation-state law is a time bomb exploding in Netanyahu's face | Analysis &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>But the Nation-State Law has other shades, which aren’t necessarily black. It presents a fitting understanding of what has been going on here for 70 years. If this law states that Israel is a nation-state only for Jews, without a word about its Arab citizens, then it is a subliminal but very clear declaration that the Arabs are not wanted here.</p> \n<p>Therefore, if we read the law retroactively with this new understanding, the Nation-State Law confirms the Palestinian version of the events of 1948-9, according to which the Nakba was a premeditated, evil-hearted enterprise. And stop telling us that either the Palestinians did not heed the calls to stay, or that Palestinians heeded their leaders’ calls to flee. We can thank the Nation-State Law for revealing the absolute wickedness behind the expulsion.</p> \n<p>Now it is also impossible to hide behind the argument that Ben-Gurion agreed to the Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947. The truth has been bared to all, since the basic law declares that “The Land of Israel is the historic homeland of the Jewish people and the place of the establishment of the State of Israel.” Nothing about a partition or a Palestinian state. Nothing. The Land of Israel is for the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>The law’s other hue, which would be funny if it weren’t so tragic, is embodied in the image of the mother of the law in its first version, MK Tzipi Livni, who had also demanded that the Palestinians recognize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>At the time, we explained to the sane people that with the approval of the UN Partition Plan, the entire world had recognized Israel as the expression of the Jewish people’s self-determination. We also said that this nationalist move would not bode well, as it was the work of the extremists. Now that this shameful racist-state law has passed, it would be interesting to hear the position of the ideological priestess of the law’s first incarnation, Prof. Ruth Gavison, who is currently enveloped in media silence. Perhaps the distinguished professor doesn’t care, since her place is safe with the masters, not with the servants.</p> \n<p>While the law has indeed missed the boat of history, this is what makes it dangerous. Its executors are operating outside the historical context and the clash with reality will be painful for us all.</p> \n<p>If Trump understands that Israel is not a Jewish state when 20 percent of the population is Arab, then every toddler can understand it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>MILAN – When Matteo Salvini became Italy’s new interior minister in June, one of the first public events he attended was a party at the Israeli Embassy celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Jewish state. In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he is in favor of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Salvini has made clear throughout his political career that he supports Israel, yet in the past few months has received an unprecedented wave of criticism from Jewish organizations.</p> \n<p>UCEI, the umbrella organization of Italy’s Jewish community, has issued two formal statements criticizing Salvini and his government. In June, its governing board compared Salvini’s plan to hold a special census of the country’s Roma community to the anti-Jewish laws of the 1930s. And earlier this month, UCEI President Noemi di Segni warned against a general climate of “growing intolerance, racial hatred and radicalization,” adding it was “unfortunately fomented by certain members of the institutions.”</p> \n<p>The Italian media was quick to interpret this as criticism of the new government’s crackdown on asylum seekers and its anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p> \n<p>What gave the statements added prominence is that the Jewish organization is usually extremely cautious about taking a political stance. In fact, it has a history of turning a blind eye to contentious political matters, such as when Silvio Berlusconi flirted with neofascists while serving as prime minister. Indeed, when another Roma census was proposed a decade ago (and was even partially carried out before being ruled unconstitutional), the organization issued no formal statement even though individual Jewish leaders were against it. (Di Segni declined to speak with Haaretz for this article.)</p> \n<p>So why has the usually cautious Jewish group been vocally critical of the new government, and of Salvini in particular?</p> \n<p>Salvini is the leader of the far-right League party, which is seen as the Italian equivalent of France’s National Front. At the beginning of June, the League formed a coalition government with the Five Star Movement – a populist, antiestablishment party that eschews the left-right distinction and whose political positions are inconsistent at best. Technically, the League is a minority partner in the cabinet that is headed by an independent prime minister (law professor Giuseppe Conte). However, Salvini has managed to establish himself as the public face and de-facto leader of the government.</p> \n<p>Since the government was sworn in last month, it has been extremely active in opposing immigration from African countries – in some instances, preventing refugee rescue ships operated by NGOs from docking at Italian ports.</p> \n<p>Besides the refugee crisis, the government’s stance on international affairs is not very clear either: While the League is unapologetically pro-Israel, the Five Star Movement tends to be more pro-Palestinian. Both parties, meanwhile, are close to Russia.</p> \n<p>The League is also unabashedly xenophobic, often attacking Muslims, Roma and African immigrants. However, it has never expressed anti-Jewish sentiment and, unlike other far-right parties in Europe, doesn’t have historical roots in anti-Semitic fascism (it was originally born as a Northern secessionist party). It has cozied up to various neofascist groups, though – for instance, organizing a protest with CasaPound, a hard-line, neofascist Italian group.</p> \n<p>The Five Star Movement, meanwhile, has been traditionally less aggressive toward immigrants but has endorsed anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.</p> \n<p>Surge in anti-Semitism</p> \n<p>Asked what makes the current situation different, Gadi Luzzatto Voghera – chairman of the Jewish research center CDEC – says the main source of concern is that the current political climate might empower anti-Semites.</p> \n<p>“After the elections we noticed a surge in anti-Semitism, even though it’s mostly verbal and takes place online,” Luzzatto Voghera said. “Anti-Semitism has remained quite stable in Italy for the past 10 years, since we began monitoring it. Some people – like [architect] Adachiara Zevi – are receiving hate mail with open threats, which is quite unprecedented.” Zevi, the daughter of renowned Jewish writer Tullia Zevi, filed a complaint with the Rome police last week after receiving a threatening letter with a picture of Hitler on it.</p> \n<p>Luzzatto Voghera said a possible explanation for the new mood is that anti-Semites “feel emboldened, less inhibited.” The climate has become so tense, he said, that being pro-Israel is no longer enough to reassure the Jewish community.</p> \n<p>“The Jewish community used to get courted by right-wing parties who claimed to support Israel,” he said. “But Italian Jews are suddenly more woke. They made it clear that they are not willing to close an eye [to racism] just because someone is pro-Israel.”</p> \n<p>But others say the situation is more complex.</p> \n<p>“Italian Jews are surprised and perplexed: this is an unprecedented situation,” said Maurizio Molinari, editor-in-chief of daily La Stampa and one of Italy’s best-known Jewish intellectuals.</p> \n<p>“The League and the Five Star Movement are both extremist forces,&quot; he said. “It’s not like they have an official position hostile to Jews, but both parties include representatives who have shown hostility to Jews. Just think of what happened in Rome recently, when members of the city council proposed to have a street named after [Giorgio] Almirante [who headed the neofascist Italian Social Movement until 1987]. Or in Turin, where members of the city council asked for a boycott against Israel.</p> \n<p>“It’s too early to have a clear answer, but there’s definitely a question of whether the League and the Five Star Movement are Jewish friendly or hostile to Jews,” continued Molinari. “The fact Salvini has often expressed pro-Israel views is reassuring. But what makes the situation more complicated is that the League and Five Star Movement lack deep historical roots – so they don’t have the antibodies to contain the extremists in both camps. But we can still be optimistic; maybe they will develop them eventually.”</p> \n<p>However, the question remains of how representative the Jewish institutions are. When umbrella organization UCEI openly criticized the government recently, was it really speaking for all Italian Jews?</p> \n<p>Unlike the United States, Italy doesn’t have political opinion polls based on religion or ethnicity, so there’s no way of officially knowing which parties are more popular among Italian Jews. Anecdotal evidence, though, suggests that the League enjoys at least some Jewish support: After UCEI issued its statements against Salvini, some Jews distanced themselves from them.</p> \n<p>Fiamma Nirenstein, an Italian-Israeli conservative pundit, wrote that “populism is not anti-Semitic,” while Hatikwa – the newspaper of young Italian Jews – published an Op-Ed by young journalist Nathan Greppi urging Jewish leaders not to attack the League.</p> \n<p>“This government has its supporters inside the Jewish community – not so much the Five Star Movement, but the League does,” said political historian David Bidussa. “Some Jews appreciate the League because they perceive it as being pro-Israel and anti-Islam. Not to mention that they share some skepticism of the European Union because of its criticism of Israel.”</p> \n<p>The bottom line, Bidussa said, is that “when someone is pro-Israel, that’s still a passport to forgive other sins.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>It was early 2015 in Paris and the attacks came one after the other. On January 7, there was the shooting attack on the editorial offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo that took 12 lives; the next day a terrorist shot a policewoman dead, and the day after that brought the siege on the Hypercacher kosher supermarket that ended in the deaths of four Jews.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>On January 11, some four million people marched through the streets of Paris and other French cities in a protest against terror; some 50 world leaders marched in Paris, among them Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who a few hours later spoke at the Great Synagogue in Paris and urged French Jews to make aliyah.</p> \n<p>[You have] the right to live in our free country, the one and only Jewish state, the State of Israel,” he said, to applause from the crowd. “The right to stand tall and proud at the walls of Zion, our eternal capital of Jerusalem. Any Jew who wishes to immigrate to Israel will be welcomed with open arms and warm and accepting hearts.” The Immigration Absorption Ministry estimated that more than 10,000 French Jews would make aliyah that year.</p> \n<p>That forecast was premature. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2014, there were 6,547 olim from France, while in 2015, the number rose only to 6,628. In 2016, the number of immigrants dropped to 4,239, and last year, there were only 3,157. Based on the first five months of this year, it seems that the downtrend is continuing; in the first five months of 2018, there were 759 olim from France, while during the comparable period in 2017, the number was 958.</p> \n<p>Joel Samoun, a married father of four from Troyes and a nurse by profession, remembers Netanyahu’s speech. “The speech definitely moved me. It was also a period when we weren’t feeling safe in France,” he says. He began the aliyah process: He made contact with the Jewish Agency and even had his professional credentials and recommendation letters translated into Hebrew. But when Samoun discovered what a lengthy procedure he would have to undergo to work in his field in Israel, he decided to give up on the dream, at least for now. “It’s somewhere in my head,” he said. “Maybe when I reach retirement age.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; France’s star female rabbi fights a lonely two-front battle against anti-Semitism and Islamophobia &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>Nor is Annaell Asraf, 23, of Paris, hurrying to leave. Her sister made aliyah four years ago, did national service, and somehow managed. She herself worked in Israel for six months, then returned to France, finished her degree in business administration and founded an online fashion business.</p> \n<p>“I have a good life in France,” she told Haaretz. Many of her friends, she said, “tried to make aliyah, waited two years to find work, and came back. On paper it looks easy, but it’s much more complicated.”</p> \n<p>What are the primary obstacles? Gaps in language and mentality that aren’t easy to bridge, she says, plus, for anyone who didn’t serve in the army, it’s harder to find work. Moreover, she now feels safe in France. “Maybe someday,” she says, when asked if she sees herself returning to Israel to live.</p> \n<p>Ariel Kendel, director of Qualita, the umbrella organization for French immigrants in Israel, says, “On the one hand, we see that aliyah is down, but on the other hand, the potential is great. If you know Jews in the community in France – it’s hard to find people who’ll say they don’t want to come to Israel.”</p> \n<p>According to Kendel, the drop in aliyah has a number of causes. The primary ones are absorption difficulties; transitioning from the welfare state they are used to; and the fact that there are no aliyah programs tailored specifically for the French. “Where will I live, how will I make a living, what happens to my kids between 2 and 6 [P.M.],” he says. “In France, there is a developed welfare state. We don’t expect it to be like that here, but you can’t tell an immigrant at the airport to take the absorption basket [of services] and that’s it. Apparently every office in Israel should be asking itself these questions.”</p> \n<p>Another problem he cites is the process of having professional credentials recognized in Israel. Although certification for physicans has been streamlined (to a trial period), nurses must undergo a test.</p> \n<p>“People are asked to take an exam after 30 years of experience, it’s a scandal,” says Kendel. “We have at least one hundred nurses – 50 in Israel and 50 in France – who cannot work here. I don’t think that anyone in France is afraid to go to the hospital; [health care] is not at a low level. You can’t tell someone, ‘come, but chances are that we won’t accept your diploma.’”</p> \n<p>Daniella Hadad, a bookkeeper who made aliyah with her husband and five children in 2015, works now in childcare. “When we made aliyah, there was a lot of terror and they said that we should immigrate more quickly,” she says. “They told me to work as a bookkeeper I would have to take all the courses from scratch, and that’s hard in Hebrew.” Now she’s looking for new avenues of employment and wants to improve her Hebrew.</p> \n<p>Hadad is convinced that being able to make a living is the most important element in a successful landing in Israel. “I know a woman who made aliyah with her husband and children, but they had a hard time and now they are going back after two-and-half years.</p> \n<p>Olivier Naz&eacute;, a father of four, is a dentist who made aliyah eight years ago. He had to invest a great deal in order to be able to work in his profession in Israel. Before moving the family, he came a few times on his own, to pass the required exam. He says his brother and family are worried about making aliyah as a result.</p> \n<p>“If you have a profession, and you’re making money, it’s hard to get in because it’s like starting from zero,” he says. “In France I made a lot of money, and in Israel at the beginning, I was making a tenth of that. Now it’s slowly rising, but not everyone can afford to wait.” Despite everything, he says, “the quality of life is better here, for the children as well.”</p> \n<p>According to a survey conducted by Zeev Hanin, the Absorption Ministry’s chief scientist, the results of which were published in June, 47 percent of French immigrants say their standard of living is not as good as it was in France, while 32 percent said their standard of living had improved. In terms of income, 80 percent responded that their situation was less favorable than in France, whereas 5 percent reported an improvement. But while many people indicated a worsening of various conditions compared to what they had in France, 67 percent said that they felt more at home in Israel, and 78.3 percent said they do not intend to leave.</p> \n<p>Drop in incidents</p> \n<p>It’s not surprising to learn that a drop in the incidents of anti-Semitism in France has been accompanied by a lack in emigration to Israel. Riva Mane, a researcher at the Kantor Center for the Study of European Jewry at Tel Aviv University, says that in 2015, the French Interior Ministry reported 808 anti-Semitic incidents in the country, whereas, in 2016 the number dropped to 355, and in 2017 to 311. Although not all incidents are reported, she said, the trend is clear.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Mane says, “There is an increase in the number of violent attacks on Jews; 97 such incidents were reported in 2017, compared to 77 in 2016.” She added that there is still a sense of insecurity in the Jewish community, and that in recent years there has been an increase in internal migration. “Tens of thousands are leaving the poorer neighborhoods that also have a significant Muslim population and where there have been many incidents, for central Paris and other wealthier areas, where there are fewer Muslims,” she says. She also noted that Jewish pupils are increasingly leaving the public schools for private ones, where they are also likely to encounter fewer Muslim students.</p> \n<p>“There’s always a reason for a wave of aliyah,” explained Immigrant Absorption Minister Sofa Landver. “Not all the olim come because of Zionism. There was a reason for this wave from France – fear of terror. Olim came from Ukraine a year ago when there was a security crisis there vis-&agrave;-vis Russia. And now people are coming from Argentina and Brazil due to the economic situation.”</p> \n<p>Landver says that her ministry is fighting to remove barriers to successful absorption. “I’m out in the field and I meet with olim from France who are very satisfied,” she reports. Although the minister knows that the immigrants from France cannot receive what the welfare state provides there, such as schools that are open late and two years of unemployment payments, her ministry continues to encourage aliyah.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Citing 'radical Islamists,' over 250 top French figures sign letter condemning anti-Semitism &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>Landver says that she has instructed ministry staff to make home visits to people who have opened an aliyah file, and that the ministry provides money for the translation of documents and removes employment barriers insofar as possible. “We, together with the municipalities, are doing everything possible to increase the number of olim. I really want them here and I’ll do everything to ease their absorption and to support this aliyah.”</p> \n<p>Valerie Halfon, a family financial consultant from the organization Paamonim, said she has met with hundreds of families in France before their aliyah, helping them to prepare an economic assessment, so they’ll know what to expect. For example, she says, she consulted with a young couple who were hesitant, because friends told them that they would need 20,000 shekels a month ($5,500) to get by. She said that after making their calculations, “we got to 8,000-9,000 shekels. There are rumors, and they’re not all true. You have to adapt, you have to make changes.”</p> \n<p>Still, whether it’s the improvement in the security situation in France, or the fear of making a new start – or a combination of these – there has been a decline in aliyah. “Today there’s a feeling that things have calmed down in France,” says Arie Abitbol, director of the European division of the Jewish Agency’s Masa programs. “There’s a president [Emmanuel Macron] who’s empathetic, and there’s a sense that he cares about the Jews and wants them to stay. The feeling is that the threat of Islamic extremism is a threat to everyone, and not only to the Jews.”</p> \n<p>He says that from his experience working with young people in France, “People don’t say that they don’t want to come, they say that at the moment the circumstances are unsuitable and they’ll wait a little more – maybe in a few more years.” He doesn’t blame only the Israeli government and absorption difficulties: “When there’s a trigger of a security situation, people find the strength to leave, but the biggest enemy of aliyah is the routine. From 2014 to 2016, there were unusually high numbers, and now there’s a return to ordinary dimensions, because as far as they’re concerned, the situation is back to routine.”</p>",

Anything short of decisive international action will achieve nothing but ushering in the second half of the first century of the occupation.”</p> \n<p>These words, which I addressed to the UN Security Council in 2016, have earned me the honor of being barred from speaking in Israeli schools – thanks to Amendment 17 to the State Education Law. This amendment, enacted in 2018 (and also known as the Breaking the Silence Law), applies to “anyone who operates overseas to help institutions that promote diplomatic steps against Israel.”</p> \n<p>I understand that most Israelis have chosen to continue ruling over, oppressing and violently dispossessing the Palestinians. To do so, we’ve defined almost any opposition to our rule as “terror,” including demonstrations, appeals to international public opinion or legal institutions, appeals for economic action, and virtually everything else.</p> \n<p>We’re stronger and, for most of us, it’s more comfortable to continue the way we are. The Palestinians are weak, the world is enabling it. So why see the Palestinian under our boot if reality allows us another day, another year or another generation of blindness?</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, this repulsive practice also demands control over Israelis’ consciousness. If too much of a stench rises upward, our sense of smell might cause something to happen somewhere between our kidneys and our heart. Therefore, it’s necessary to mark those Israelis who loathe the boot as traitors and gag them. I understand this very well, and I also understand the public popularity of such moves.</p> \n<p>But when you draw a circle defining who’s outside, it’s impossible not to pay even more attention to who’s inside. Who, by law, is worthy of speaking to your children?</p> \n<p>Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who calls for bombing 8-year-old children, is permitted to speak to schoolchildren in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (“Arab voters are going to the polls in droves”) is permitted. So is Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked (“Zionism won’t continue to bow its head to individual rights”), the inflammatory Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan (“arson terror”) and the corrupt Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman (“There are no innocents in Gaza”).</p> \n<p>Nor is it just our elected officials who are allowed. So are Supreme Court justices, who routinely approve house demolitions, collective punishment and prolonged detention without trial. So is Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit, our diligent moral compass who proposes creative ways of legalizing more and more crimes and violence. So is Military Advocate General Brig. Gen. Sharon Afek, who is responsible for giving advance approval to the rules of engagement – which permit the shooting of unarmed demonstrators – and is also skilled at whitewashing any violations after the fact. The doors of the education system are open to all of the above.</p> \n<p>Your children can also hear our devoted diplomats. These are the ambassadors who keep themselves busy “explaining” such “image failures” as the Palestinian medic who insisted on jumping into the deadly path of an Israeli bullet. They also disseminate propaganda that equates international opposition to the occupation with anti-Semitism and, at the same time, pave a path to the hearts of anti-Semites in Hungary, Austria and Germany.</p> \n<p>It turns out that all of the above are worthy of being heard in Israeli schools. These and others – the voices of the Israeli “center,” the “normative” voices whose essence is legalizing injustice and perverting human morality – are heard loud and clear, and have been setting the tone for decades already.</p> \n<p>Yet despite all this, the truth and the facts have a tendency to peek out from behind the propaganda. Therefore, the occupation project and the gagging project are both destined to end the same way: in utter failure. It’s possible to pass stupid laws, but it’s impossible to erase that “b’tselem” – the Hebrew word for “in the image” – from the first chapter of Genesis: “And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him.”</p> \n<p>Therefore, the Israeli consciousness will continue to be exposed to the reality of our rule over the Palestinians – but this exposure isn’t enough to remove Israelis from their comfort zone.</p> \n<p>And that brings us back to the international community’s responsibility to change all of this, as I explained in my Security Council address: “I am a citizen of that country. It is my homeland. For most of my country’s existence, the world has allowed it to occupy another people. I have lived my entire life, every single day of it, with that reality. Millions of Israelis and Palestinians know no other reality. We need your help.”</p> \n<p>Hagai El-Ad is the Executive Director of B’Tselem</p>",

        "text":["<p>You might have thought every ounce of insight had already been extracted, but no: five years after the once-in-a-generation survey of American Jewish life, the Pew Center Portrait of Jewish Americans, its data is still being parsed and its consequences played out.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And this is why you should care: How that survey is interpreted, and how future surveys are constructed, will affect the organization, funding and character of untold aspects of Jewish life in America for years to come.</p> \n<p>You should also care because this is part of an ongoing conflict over who gets to define Jewish identity in America today - a debate in which you have a stake.</p> \n<p>The Pew survey was, in many ways, already anachronistic when it was produced. It was written for an imagined 20th century American Jewish community, one largely homogenous and with little to mark it off from America at large save for differences based on religious preference.</p> \n<p>Pew's questions, and thus its data, had a sustained weakness on other aspects of communal life, such as race, language, and, especially,&nbsp;culture and the multiplicity of Jewish cultures today. Those omissions obscure some of the most important aspects of 21st century Jewish life. And American Jewish leaders are only just now starting to catch up to the gulf between survey and reality.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One of those is JTS Chancellor Arnold Eisen, who spoke to yet another Pew related gathering a few weeks ago. Eisen suggested new ways of thinking about our relationship to worship and religion and about contemporary Jewish identity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Happily, the intermarriage scaremongering so prevalent in discussions about U.S. Jewish life is absent from Eisen's agenda. Unfortunately, so&nbsp;are diversity, inclusion, and literacy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nor does he acknowledge how the survey itself fails to provide the data that could support these emerging issues.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As perhaps everyone knows by now, the Pew findings that captured most of the headlines in 2013, and beyond, were related to intermarriage rates. Compared to the previous two demographic surveys in 1990 and 2000, the intermarriage rate had increased, to something like 58% of all marriages, and 71% of non-Orthodox marriages.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The survey included other shocking numbers, including the 48% of American Jews who didn’t know the alef-bet and scant 13% who could read all or most Hebrew words.</p> \n<p>Yet it was intermarriage which was termed a crisis, even though rates of intermarriage had been climbing precipitously in surveys and estimates going back to 1965 while Hebrew illiteracy is a serious stumbling block for most basic ritual competency, access to 2000 years of traditional texts and exposure to modern Israeli culture.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How the Jewish-American Elite Has Manufactured the Intermarriage 'Crisis'&nbsp;| Opinion &gt;&gt;&nbsp;A Shul for Secular Jews in America&nbsp;| Opinion &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>But the problem with the Pew study goes far beyond which number we deem a ‘crisis.’ Indeed, crises may be a useful way to organize and legitimize leadership, but they don’t do much in terms of providing insight or new paradigms for inquiry.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It’s not surprising that there has been little attention to what the survey doesn’t say, given the shock of the data it&nbsp;did provide. The lack of reflection on the survey itself, its inherent limitations, flaws, and biases, mirrors the crucial lack of self-reflection among American Jewish leaders.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Our legacy Jewish leadership - largely male, white, Ashkenazi, strongly Israel-identified - can no longer assume it is merely a mirror of those they look to serve. They may not be capable of conceiving other ways of being or identifying as Jewish than those outside their bubble. And Pew provides little to no data on the diversity of American Jews and gives them no prompt for reflection.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Further, the survey reflects the focus of its consultants. Data on intermarriage is abundant and analyzed extensively, reflecting the concerns of Pew consultants like Steven M. Cohen, who has often framed intermarriage as the existential crisis facing the Jewish people. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>The survey does have a section on race, telling us 94% of American Jews identify as white (non-Hispanic). Considering the vigorous conversation happening right now around race, whiteness and the inclusion of Jews of color, the survey totally fails to give us anything beyond the 7% of Jews identifying as non-white. Were any Jews of color asked to consult on the survey? How might they have constructed questions on Jews and race?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Questions of Jews and race are thorny for many reasons. For one thing, &quot;race&quot; as a social construct extends farther back in time than our present American black-white binary.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And from the inside, Jews have their own classifications which are not quite racial, not quite ethnic, not quite nationality based. Surprisingly, the Survey does not contain one question on identifiers like &quot;Ashkenazi,&quot; &quot;Mizrahi&quot; or &quot;Sephardi.&quot; (The list could be much longer, but you get the idea.)</p> \n<p>Eisen does seem to be aware of Pew's problems, even if he references them obliquely. His first point is that we must, &quot;recognize that yes/no questions about belief in God and measures of attendance at synagogues or seders will not get at the important question.&quot;</p> \n<p>Indeed, yes/no questions about belief and synagogue attendance reflect the biases of a deracinated, synagogue-oriented 20th century American Judaism and its movement-focused leadership.&nbsp;Even if the numbers come out &quot;bad&quot; for that leadership, the construction of the survey still places them at the center of Jewish life, further reinforcing an outdated conception of American Jewish life.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Eisen’s most crucial point is that, &quot;It is no surprise that most of the Jews who identify Judaism as their religion say that religion is not the primary element in their Jewishness. It is intermixed with family, tradition, community, history and so much more.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Eisen is referencing the statistic that 85% of respondents said that being Jewish implicated a mix of religion, ancestry and culture. And yet, as he himself seems to point out, the survey is hampered by a focus on questions about &quot;belief&quot; and synagogue attendance in a population for whom belief and synagogue attendance are, if not irrelevant, perhaps beside the point.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What might culture and ancestry actually mean? If it means heritage languages like Yiddish, Ladino, Arabic and more we’ll never know, because the only language question in the survey is about Hebrew.</p> \n<p>Culture and ancestry aren’t just added value, for the vast majority of American Jews, they are core ways of experiencing Jewishness, a truth utterly irrelevant to the designers of Pew's poll. That should shock all of us.</p> \n<p>Surveys like the Pew Center Portrait, large demographic samples looking for big picture information, are by their nature not ethnographic or anthropological studies. They cannot give us the rich narrative contours of contemporary Jewish life that many of us would like to see.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, there are many concrete ways future surveys can be improved to give us data on the &quot;real&quot; Jewish America.&nbsp;One of the most important conversations happening today is around inclusivity and how the mainstream Jewish community excludes or alienates demographics like the non-white, non in-married, single, non-heterosexual, non-Israel identified, and non-synagogue affiliated.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That conversation can be strengthened and amplified with data, and that in turn can help us build more inclusive and dynamic institutions and organizations.&nbsp;But it will take a leadership truly committed to uncomfortable self-reflection, and diversity, to get us there.</p> \n<p>Rokhl Kafrissen is a cultural critic and playwright, the author of&nbsp;A Brokhe/A Blessing, a Yiddish English gangster ghost romance in three acts.

He says that lately he has frequently been detained, sometimes for a short time but other times for an hour and a half or two hours. He says that at the checkpoints he is told by the soldiers that Yehuda Brigade Commander Itzik Cohen has ordered not to let him pass and that there is a “verbal” injunction against him.

On April 15, Maj. Hagai Rothstein wrote that a “closed zone order was issued for Amro with the individual approval of a brigade commander. There is no blanket prohibition on his movement in the area.” However, a few days later, on April 22-23, Amro was detained at checkpoints.

This harassment is part of the separation policy that the army has followed in Hebron for almost two decades. A policy that has turned the center of Hebron into a ghost town and made the movement of Issa Amro and the city’s other protected residents impossible.”</p> \n<p>The IDF Spokesperson says: “Issa Amro has been regularly disturbing the public order in Hebron for years, hindering the activity of the security forces and, more than once, has used violence toward them. Amro is entitled to move about Hebron in accordance with the rules that apply to all the inhabitants, and there is no order that limits his movement personally.

        "text":["<p>Israel’s new nation-state law is loathsome, damaging, divisive and mainly superfluous, but its passage won’t make Israelis’ blood boil. Some agree with the law and others are apathetic, while its staunch opponents quickly recognized that the campaign to fight discrimination against gay men, sparked by the concurrent passage of a new Knesset bill on surrogacy, has a greater potential of sparking mass protests. The nation-state law injects poison into the country’s relations with its non-Jewish minorities, but in the final analysis, after the removal of some of its more controversial clauses, it won’t make much of a difference in the day-to-day lives of most Israelis.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, as far as Israel’s standing and image are concerned, the new law is a mega-attack, a thermo-nuclear onslaught, a landmark that will henceforth divide before and after. Benjamin Netanyahu was right, therefore, to describe it as a “defining moment.” Scores of Breaking the Silence activists, hundreds of B’Tselem reports on the occupation and thousands of BDS proponents, all of which the government cynically holds responsible for its bad name, could never have inflicted such profound, comprehensive and long-lasting damage as Netanyahu and his coalition did by passing the new bill. In Donald Trump’s America, they might have been accused of treason.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The damage won’t be expressed in the few formal protests issued by foreign governments, especially European. The international community has other, more existential concerns right now, emanating from the growing awareness that the world’s greatest superpower is headed by a president who is unintelligible, at best, unstable, at worst and possibly beholden to a foreign government. In any case, the only protest that Netanyahu and most Israelis care about would have to come from the White House: Barack Obama personally blocked passage of the nation-state law, but Trump probably hasn’t heard about it, and if he has, is clueless as to what it all means, and even if he understands, then he doesn’t give a hoot. This is the glory of what Netanyahu describes as the greatest era of relations between the two countries: Israel can cut its wrists to its heart’s content, and America won’t lift a finger.</p> \n<p>But a dearth of diplomatic d&eacute;marches won’t mitigate the inherent destructiveness of the nation-state law. It comes with a built-in time-release mechanism that ensures that it will taint Israel’s good name for many years to come. The law, in fact, marks the ground zero of a new Israel. Its first clause grants the Jewish people exclusive rights to self-determination, and Netanyahu’s coalition was quick to self-determine, in essence, that Israel is arrogant, belligerent and ethnocentric. This is the country’s new reflection in the mirror, and even if most Israelis prefer to look the other way, the whole world is watching, and reaching its own conclusions.</p> \n<p>The Knesset, with dogged determination and clear intent, notified the world of Israel’s withdrawal from the ranks of liberal democracies and of its new affiliation with illiberal, nationalistic states, in which the values of equality and civil rights, like those enshrined in Israel’s non-binding Declaration of Independence, are subservient to the needs of the nation and its land. Just when Western democracies are on the defensive, and in some cases fighting for their lives, Israel defects to the other side. It is moving over into the darkness.</p> \n<p>The law accelerates Israel’s transformation from a liberal democracy into an electoral democracy, in which the right to vote is enshrined but not the commitment to equality, minority rights or the rule of law. Last month, even before the nation-state law was passed, the Sweden-base research group Varieties of Democracy, or V-Dem, acknowledged the mutation. Thus, it was only proper and fitting that when the law was being approved, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was still in town as Israel’s most honored guest. Orban, who has been accused of anti-Semitism, was undoubtedly pleased with his disciples. Israel and authoritarian, immigrant-hating Hungary now belong to the very same club.</p> \n<p>But the new law’s biggest casualties so far are American Jews. Many Jewish organizations, including those who normally refrain from criticizing, lambasted the nation-state law as discriminatory. For the many more who stayed silent, the new law is like a poisoned dagger to the heart. The loyalty of most, though far from all, Jewish Americans relies on the perception - or the illusion, if you prefer - that Israel is a “shining city on the hill”, as Ronald Reagan described the United States, and not a bully country that torments its minorities. But in a week in which the Knesset proudly tries to silence Breaking the Silence, Israeli police arrests a Conservative rabbi for allegedly betrothing someone the Orthodox define as a “mamzer,” a bastard, and the Knesset shamelessly declares Jewish superiority and relegates Arabic to a lower league, many American Jews be forced to admit that something is rotten in the State of Israel. For those who gnashed their teeth and stayed loyal despite Israel’s unilateral nixing of the Western Wall deal, its refusal to recognize Reform and Conservative Jews, Netanyahu’s hostility to Barack Obama, his groveling to Donald Trump, the ongoing occupation and the death of the peace process - not to mention the spate of undemocratic laws already approved by this toxic Knesset - the nation-state law could prove a bridge to far, a straw that breaks the camel’s back, the last nail in the coffin of their long-held allegiance.</p> \n<p>The new law’s supporters have offered myriad excuses and detailed explanations purporting to prove that the outrage is overblown. Slovakia and Latvia have similar laws, they rejoice, as if these two countries, with anti-Semitism running through their historical veins, are now our new role models. In any case, the problem is with the forest, not the trees. Whatever its fine print, the Nation State law is perceived abroad as a contemptuous show of strength by an aggressive Jewish majority against its Arab minority, which, justifiably or not, suffers enough discrimination as it is. Even if the new law does not make Israel into an apartheid state, it certainly seems to be laying the groundwork, and in any case provides a stellar talking point for those who claim that apartheid is already here. The great patriots of Netanyahu’s coalition gave Israel’s enemies a gift of gold, which they couldn’t have hoped for even in their wildest dreams.</p> \n<p>And the truly horrendous thing is that Netanyahu, his ministers and their legislators perpetrated this crime against their country for no good reason, out of their own free will, for pure self-interest and short-term gain, to garner a few brownie points for their faux-patriotism, to outflank the rabid right, to portray the left, which opposed the law, as defeatists and traitors. For such measly returns, the ruling coalition shamed Israel, tarnished whatever is left of its good name and cast it as chauvinistic and narrow-minded. The only democracy in the Middle East, many will conclude, has grown tired of itself.</p> \n<p>The proximity to the mourning day of Tisha B’Av, which falls on Sunday, is a good opportunity to remember that the Second Temple didn’t really fall because of “baseless hatred”, as the Talmud asserts, nor because of idol worship, incest and bloodshed, as their disciples contended. The seeds of destruction were planted many years before, in the days, among others, of King Alexander Yanai, aka Janneus, the Hasmonean dynasty’s greatest conqueror. He expanded the territory of Israel, declared himself king, vested all legal and judicial powers in himself, incited and spread division, sparked a civil war, misread his strategic situation and abandoned the alliance with Rome, which had sustained his predecessors.

        "text":["<p>All signs indicate that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will wage a Hungarian campaign in advance of the next election. In fact, this campaign started a long time ago. Just as with the Eastern European regimes that are pulling away from democracy, hurting minorities is merely a means, a tool, for the assault on the real objective: the &quot;enemies from within.” And those are not necessarily the minority groups.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s friends in Eastern Europe don’t really have a “minorities problem.” That problem was mainly solved 70 years ago and that’s why my parents didn’t know their grandparents. The enemies from within – the “traitors” – are actually members of the majority, but people who don’t toe the line with the government’s whims.</p> \n<p>Viktor Orb&aacute;n, Hungary’s prime minister, sees himself as the savior of Christian culture in his country in the face of Muslim immigration. That is pure demagoguery: There are hardly any Muslims in Hungary – a few thousand out of a population of 10 million. But this is precisely the point: The “Muslim threat” is a tool to be used to strike a blow against the Hungarian opposition.</p> \n<p>The face most prominently featured in Orb&aacute;n’s campaign is not his own, nor is it a burqa-clad immigrant woman. It’s George Soros, the Jewish-American, Hungarian-born billionaire whom the prime minister accuses of plotting to take over Hungary by financing various political organizations. Soros appears on the posters of Orb&aacute;n’s right-wing party, embracing members of the opposition, under the slogan “Stop the Soros candidates!” – those “threatening” to flood Hungary with foreigners. The posters have been pasted to the floors of subway cars so passengers will step on them.</p> \n<p>You don’t need to be a historian to understand that Soros is being presented as the image of the “eternal Jew,” the anti-Semitic myth of the Jew who seeks to control the world by means of his hold on banking and commerce. This campaign shocked the large Jewish community in Hungary, and the Israeli ambassador was asked to protest and denounce it.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu was also shocked – but not at the anti-Semitic campaign. He was shocked at the ambassador’s protest. At the prime minister’s instruction, the Foreign Ministry eventually rescinded its protest, one of Israel’s most shameful moments. Its people echoed the message disseminated throughout Budapest: Soros is dangerous, undermines us and compromises security.</p> \n<p>We should study the Hungarian campaign so we can prepare for things to come, here as well. At an election rally a few months ago, Orb&aacute;n said that this was a war against &quot;an enemy that is different from us. Not open, but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; not national but international; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the whole world.&quot;</p> \n<p>Replace the word “enemy” with “eternal Jew,” “Soros,” &quot;the New Israel Fund,&quot; &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot; or “the left” – and you’ve got Netanyahu’s campaign. The nation-state law, which enshrines discrimination and prioritizing of citizens, is a springboard for such a hate campaign. Anybody who opposes it is not “loyal to the state.” And who is leading this opposition, in Netanyahu’s opinion? Who is “inciting the Druze” and fomenting revolt? “The left-wing organizations,” of course. And so the campaign has an almost obvious goal: a demand/promise to outlaw these groups.</p> \n<p>They have been laying the groundwork for this for years: imposition of restrictions on “foreign funding” (only for groups from the left, of course); special reporting requirements; a ban on the representatives of such organizations appearing in Israeli schools or other public institutions; and unceasing delegitimization.</p> \n<p>This is being made possible thanks to the opposition as well, which is (for the most part) afraid to be identified with those who have been “targeted,” and sometimes signs on enthusiastically to show its patriotism. The opposition must understand that this has nothing to do with patriotism: The opposition is the real target of the move to mark as enemies entire communities and political camps.</p> \n<p>Prof. Moshe Halbertal defines the difference between the nationalist and nationalistic thus: The nationalist opposes the external enemy, the nationalistic focuses on the enemy within. History shows all too well what the nationalistic lead to – everywhere. It’s all clear, it’s all known and it’s all coming back as if we’ve learned nothing.</p>",

Officers also seized “multiple weapons throughout the day,” police said.</p> \n<p>A reporter for The Oregonian/OregonLive was bloodied when he was struck by a projectile. Eder Campuzano said later on Twitter he was “okay.”</p> \n<p>Demonstrators aligned with Patriot Prayer and an affiliated group, the Proud Boys, gathered around mid-day in a riverfront park.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of demonstrators faced them from across the street, holding banners and signs with opposition messages such as “Alt right scum not welcome in Portland.” Some chanted “Nazis go home.”</p> \n<p>Officers stood in the middle of the four-lane boulevard, essentially forming a wall to keep the two sides separated.</p> \n<p>The counter-protesters were made up of a coalition of labor unions, immigrant rights advocates, democratic socialists and other groups. They included people dressed as clowns and a brass band blaring music.</p> \n<p>The rally organized by Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson was the third to roil Portland this summer. Two previous events ended in bloody fistfights and riots, and one counter-protester was sent to the hospital with a skull fracture.</p> \n<p>This time, Gibson changed the venue from a federal plaza outside U.S. District Court to a waterfront park so some of his Oregon supporters could carry concealed weapons as they demonstrate.</p> \n<p>Gibson disputed the group’s classification by some as a hate group.</p> \n<p>“We’re here to promote freedom and God. That’s it,” Gibson told Portland TV station KGW while walking with demonstrators. “Our country is getting soft.”</p> \n<p>Protesters saw a significant police presence that included bomb-sniffing dogs and weapons screening checkpoints. In a statement, police said weapons may be seized if there is a violation of law and added that it is illegal in Portland to carry a loaded firearm in public unless a person has a valid Oregon concealed handgun license.</p> \n<p>Among the things police confiscated were long sticks and homemade shields.</p> \n<p>Just before 2 p.m., police in riot gear ordered people to leave an area downtown, saying demonstrators had thrown rocks and bottles at officers.</p> \n<p>“Get out of the street,” police announced via loudspeaker.</p> \n<p>Gibson’s insistence on bringing his supporters repeatedly to this liberal city has crystallized a debate about the limits of free speech in an era of stark political division. Patriot Prayer also has held rallies in many other cities around the U.S. West, including Berkeley, California, that have drawn violent reactions.</p> \n<p>But the Portland events have taken on outsized significance after a Patriot Prayer sympathizer was charged with fatally stabbing two men who came to the defense of two young black women — one in a hijab — whom the attacker was accused of harassing on a light-rail train in May 2017.</p> \n<p>A coalition of community organizations and a group representing more than 50 tribes warned of the potential for even greater violence than previous rallies if participants carry guns. It called on officials to denounce what it called “the racist and sexist violence of Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys” and protect the city.</p> \n<p>Gibson, who is running a long-shot campaign to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, said in a live video on Facebook earlier this week that he won’t stop bringing his followers to Portland until they can express their right-wing views without interference.</p> \n<p>Self-described anti-fascists — or “antifa” — have been organizing anonymously online to confront Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys in the streets.</p> \n<p>Organizers say that while Patriot Prayer denies being a white supremacist group, it affiliates itself with known white supremacists, white nationalists and neo-Nazi gangs.</p> \n<p>“Patriot Prayer is continuing to commit violence in our city, and their events are becoming more and more violent,” said Effie Baum of Pop Mob, a coalition of community groups organizing the counter-demonstration. “Leaving them a small group to attack in the streets is only going to allow them to perpetuate their violence.”</p> \n<p>Dueling protests a month ago ended with Portland police declaring a riot and arresting four people. A similar Patriot Prayer event on June 4 devolved into fistfights and assaults by both sides as police struggled to keep the groups apart.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Over and over, across decades and cities throughout the United States, sociologist Steven M. Cohen painted a picture of American Jews using a consistent set of questions.</p> \n<p>How much do Jews love Israel? How many Jewish friends do they have? Do they attend a synagogue? Do they belong to one? Perhaps above all, are they married to Jews and raising Jewish children?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: 'Anti-Semitic, anti-Zionist': Palestinian issue shakes up most famous U.S. Jewish camp</p> \n<p>Through countless papers, opinion pieces, speeches and books, Cohen’s research and interpretations have shaped how the organized Jewish community views itself and sets its priorities. They guided a national Jewish population study in 2001 and a New York study in 2011. Two years after that, Cohen consulted on the Pew Research Center’s landmark study of American Jews, which asked many of these same questions.</p> \n<p>But in light of allegations of sexual harassment from several women, Cohen’s role as organized Jewry’s top sociologist is bound to diminish. Last week, the UJA-Federation of New York, the country’s largest federation, announced it would no longer work with him. Already some are wondering what his absence will mean for his research priorities, which have become the standard for the Jewish establishment.</p> \n<p>And according to others in the field, a reconsideration of those proprieties — which they say emphasize the size of the Jewish population and outmoded measures of Jewish observance over the inner lives of American Jews — is long overdue.</p> \n<p>The titles of articles that Cohen has written over the years reflect the demographic concerns — and anxieties — of a generation of Jewish planners:&nbsp;“Lessons Learned From Orthodoxy’s Dramatic Growth.” “Can Intermarriage Lead to an Increase in the Number of Jews in America?”&nbsp;“Conservative Jewry’s Numbers Plummeting, but Core Engagement Steady.”</p> \n<p>“We would argue that numerical strength is inherently valuable and essential to the meaningful Jewish life of American Jewry,” he wrote with a colleague, Mijal Bitton, in a 2015 article titled “More Is Better When It Comes to Jewish Numbers.”&nbsp;“More engaged Jews mean stronger communities able to mobilize more people and more resources, critical to achieving political influence, social diversity, cultural creativity and religious vitality. Synagogues, day schools, Israel trips, camps and more all depend on Jewish numbers, and so do institutions devoted to bettering the world — such as American Jewish World Service, Repair the World and Mazon.”</p> \n<p>A number of colleagues say that,&nbsp;with or without Cohen, Jewish communal organizations would be — and should be — focused on questions of population, intermarriage, birth rates and levels of traditional observance.</p> \n<p>“Not just researchers, but the American Jewish community has been concerned with the size of the population and changes in the population of different communities,” Leonard Saxe, director of the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University, wrote in an email to JTA. “This concern shouldn’t be surprising in light of Jewish history. Our leaders are from a generation who grew up in the shadow of the Shoah and concern about questions of survival seem perfectly understandable.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The Jewish world's #MeToo crisis is much deeper than Ari Shavit and Steven Cohen | Opinion &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>But Cohen’s departure from the Jewish communal scene, at least for the immediate future, has prompted some of his colleagues to call for a shift in the questions the Jewish community asks about itself. Those questions, they say, shape a view of how American Jews should live and what programs their institutions should create and fund.</p> \n<p>Cohen would “ask questions according to a very rigid model of what Jewish continuity and good Jewish life is,” said Lila Corwin Berman, director of Temple University’s Feinstein Center for American Jewish History. “I think the categories he constructed about what makes a good Jewish life, I think those categories have a particular worldview and particular set of values that he and others might believe in, but not every scholar does.”</p> \n<p>Along with using objective metrics concerning marriage, traditional observance and connection to Israel, Berman and others say, Jewish organizations should ask how Jews experience their own Judaism and go from there.</p> \n<p>Some take issue in particular with Cohen’s focus on Jewish continuity — the question of how many Jews will exist, identify as Jews and affiliate with Jewish institutions in future generations. Cohen has long cited statistics to conclude that the ever rising numbers of Jews marrying people of other faiths&nbsp;is “the greatest single threat to Jewish continuity today.”</p> \n<p>“What I would love to see change are some of the questions that get asked, and specifically the questions that shape the debates over continuity and the birth rates of Jews,” said Deborah Dash Moore, a professor&nbsp;of American Jewish history at the University of Michigan. “Stop assuming that there are gradations of being Jewish that make one better than the other, that intermarriage is a bad thing or that intermarriage is a good thing.”</p> \n<p>Cohen wrote his doctoral dissertation on intermarriage and has done studies for a variety of Jewish organizations, including Jewish federations, Jewish community centers, Hillel International and overnight camps. He has taught at Hebrew University, the Jewish Theological Seminary and Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, where he is currently a professor.</p> \n<p>In July, The New York Jewish Week&nbsp;published an article&nbsp;detailing allegations from eight women accusing Cohen of sexual harassment and assault, including forcibly groping and kissing women in professional settings. In a statement, Cohen acknowledged that he had engaged in inappropriate behavior and apologized.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How privileged white leaders frame what we know about Jews in America | Opinion &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>Jewish organizations are already cutting ties with him. He&nbsp;resigned&nbsp;as president of the Berman Jewish Policy Archive, a database of Jewish communal policy research at Stanford University. He was removed from the board of the Jewish Student Press Service (of which this reporter is also a member). And Hebrew Union College has opened up a Title IX investigation against him but has not released a statement directly commenting on the allegations.</p> \n<p>“We contracted with Professor Cohen on multiple projects over the years, as did many other Jewish organizations seeking his expertise,” UJA-Federation CEO Eric Goldstein wrote in a statement on July 27. “We will do so no longer. We respected and trusted him, and we were deeply pained and shocked to learn of these allegations.”</p> \n<p>The 2011 population study that Cohen co-authored for the New York federation illustrates his focus in determining Jewish engagement. In addition to measuring the size of the population, its economic state and the intermarriage rate, the study’s executive summary defines Jewish involvement using traditional practices.</p> \n<p>“More than half of all Jews feel that being Jewish is very important, give to Jewish charity, attend a Passover seder, light Chanukah candles, fast on Yom Kippur, and report that their closest friends are mostly Jewish,” the survey says. “At least 40% feel that it is very important to be part of a Jewish community, feel very attached to Israel, visited a Jewish museum or participated in a Jewish cultural event ”</p> \n<p>Cohen promulgated his findings in hundreds of op-eds and papers published in Jewish publications, writing that rising intermarriage rates and declining Jewish birth rates correlate with lower rates of Jewish observance and affiliation.</p> \n<p>A JTA&nbsp;opinion piece&nbsp;he co-wrote last year is titled “Fewer marriages and fewer children means fewer Jews doing Jewish.” A 2016&nbsp;piece&nbsp;he co-wrote in the Jewish Journal said that the high intermarriage rates and low Jewish engagement found in Western states “would be unfortunate for Jewish continuity, not only in the West but throughout the United States.”</p> \n<p>Cohen’s approach to studying Jewish intermarriage does not tell the whole story, said Keren McGinity, director of Hebrew College’s graduate program in Interfaith Families Jewish Engagement. McGinity also wrote an op-ed in The Jewish Week in June accusing a senior colleague, whom she later identified as Cohen, of sexual harassment.</p> \n<p>According to McGinity, the root cause of Jewish disengagement is a lack of Jewish education. She added that gender is part of the discussion, citing data that Jewish women who intermarry raise Jewish children at higher rates than intermarried men.</p> \n<p>“Intermarriage is used as the lightning rod,” she said. “But in reality it’s lack of Judaic knowledge. So it’s not people who intermarry, people who fall in love with people of other cultures, faiths or backgrounds, it’s the challenge of greater access to, and matriculation into, Jewish education.”</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>A few experts said that the measures Cohen applied imply a set of traditional priorities. Instead, they said, the Jewish community should ask Jews how they define their own Jewishness, and then follow up on those priorities — be they engagement with the arts or social justice activism.</p> \n<p>Cohen “doesn’t tend to ask about how people feel about being Jewish, or how they make meaning about being Jewish,” said Bethamie Horowitz, co-director of the education and Jewish studies doctoral program at New York University. “Other approaches have looked at how people relate to Judaism, however they understand it — letting individuals describe what they experience and what is meaningful to them.”</p> \n<p>Cohen’s defenders say the numbers don’t lie and point to studies demonstrating that few children of intermarriage who identify as Jews are likely either to marry other Jews or raise their children as Jews. And Cohen himself has long championed&nbsp;Jewish educational programs&nbsp;and&nbsp;social networks&nbsp;that aim to deepen individuals’ and families’ Jewish engagement and sense of meaning.</p> \n<p>Some have tied the content of Cohen’s work to the behavior that led to the accusations against him.&nbsp;Writing in the Forward,&nbsp;Berman and Jewish professors Ronit Stahl and Kate Rosenblatt asserted that the sexual harassment allegations “reflect the troubling gender and sexual politics long embedded in communal discussions of Jewish continuity and survival, the focus of Cohen’s work.”</p> \n<p>“These norms make it okay to tell women how to use their bodies, whom to marry, when to have babies, and how to allocate their time,” they wrote. “They have also told people who fall outside of the parameters set primarily by men that their ways of being Jewish are not valued or valuable.”</p> \n<p>Another leading Jewish demographer, Ira Sheskin, told JTA that confronting and responding to the allegations against Cohen is the right thing to do. But regarding the content of Cohen’s work, Sheskin said, “his opinions are well founded and he does look at the facts and come to conclusions.”</p> \n<p>“He’s going to be on the outside for a while now, and the field will suffer for that,” said Sheskin, chair of the department of geography and regional studies at the University of Miami. “The field is going to be better off in the long run that we’re dealing with this issue. If this results in people being more sensitive to how people behave toward one another regardless of gender, in the long run, Jewish social science will be better off.”</p> \n<p>McGinity said that Cohen’s departure from the field will create space for more people to do the same work, opening the door to different perspectives and methods.</p> \n<p>“The field could change by making room for a greater diversity of voices to be heard,” she said. “And more voices will generate new sociological questions about American Jewry.”</p>",

Since the law went into effect there the number of women engaged in prostitution dropped by two thirds. The law managed to block the entry of new women into the world of prostitution. The legislation reduced the number of users, and public support for the law there grows every year.</p> \n<p>The Swedish model has since been adopted by other countries such as Norway, Iceland, Canada, Ireland and France. Legislation based on the Swedish model publicly and legally brands sex consumers as criminals. Consumers are the hidden components in the chain of trafficking in women and prostitution, but their money is what drives and feeds crime organizations.</p> \n<p>The face of prostitution in Israel has changed over the last decades. At the beginning of the previous decade it was based on victims of human trafficking from countries belonging to the former Soviet Union, who were brought here under coercion and false pretenses. Today it is based on Israeli women from all reaches of society, including women who suffer from hunger or are overwhelmed by debt (most of them mothers), women addicted to drugs, at-risk youths, transgender people, youths thrown out of their homes due to their sexual orientation and asylum seekers. Over the last four years trafficking from abroad has returned, using more sophisticated and covert methods.</p> \n<p>The government-sponsored bill has chosen to adopt a softer version of the law than that of the Swedish model, and the softer version includes administrative enforcement rather than a criminal one. But one should not take lightly the fact that Israel has formulated a clear and unambiguous statement regarding the uprooting of prostitution, and its willingness for the first time to take responsibility for the many years of neglect of a population that was prone to slide into prostitution. One can only hope that it will quickly be brought to an initial Knesset vote, and that the government adopts an inter-ministerial program for dealing with prostitution, one which will expand the range of options available to these women, as promised by Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked.</p> \n<p>“It moves me to tears” said Einat (not her real name), a 28-year-old single mother who was sexually assaulted by a relative throughout her childhood and who started working as a prostitute at 19. She worked in massage parlors and discreet apartments almost up to the day she gave birth. “My greatest fear is returning to that world. I stopped five years ago but the fear is still there. I think of women who don’t want to be doing that but who remain there since there aren’t any other options available to them. If the state manages to develop suitable solutions, no woman would be a prostitute.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>A plan to expand the&nbsp;mixed-gender prayer area &nbsp;at the Western Wall has won final approval, following pressure from the Prime Minister’s Office.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The plan, whose details are reported here for the first time, was approved under a special regulation that created a fast-track process authorizing the municipal engineer, in this case Jerusalem’s, to approve work to make a site handicapped-accessible. Such access was called for in the plan, in addition to the expansion of the area and its entrance.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised to expand the mixed-gender prayer space, known as the Ezrat Israel, to compensate non-Orthodox Jewish groups for the government’s cancelation, under&nbsp;ultra-Orthodox pressure, of a broader deal to grant them greater rights at the Western Wall. But the expansion was challenged by archeologists who petitioned the High Court of Justice&nbsp;claiming the work&nbsp;would cause irreversible damage to the important archaeological sit.</p> \n<p>Since then, Netanyahu’s office has been working to legalize the work already done and secure formal approval for the rest of the planned expansion. The Israel Antiquities Authority prepared a detailed plan, and a special government committee approved it in principle after two ministers who objected to it – Culture Minister Miri Regev and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked – were replaced. The authority then submitted it to the Jerusalem municipality.</p> \n<p>In early August, the Jerusalem city council discussed the plan together with the municipal engineer and three officials from the Prime Minister’s Office, headed by Drorit Steinmetz, director of the office’s budget and projects department.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sources familiar with what happened at the meeting said that to eliminate red tape, Steinmetz pressed to get the entire plan approved under the regulation that allows fast-tracking work to make sites handicapped-accessible. That would eliminate the need to get the plan approved by the local and regional planning committees, since under this regulation, approval by the municipal engineer is sufficient.</p> \n<p>A representative of the Attorney General’s Office who attended the meeting opposed this idea, saying a plan this extensive and sensitive couldn’t be slipped through under the pretext of making the site handicapped-accessible. But the city’s legal advisor, Eli Malka, disagreed, and a week ago, he authorized use of this regulation to approve the entire plan.</p> \n<p>Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel (Habayit Hayehudi)&nbsp;responded to the plan's approval, saying that the Western Wall should be under the authority of the Chief Rabbinate, which the Prime Minister's Office is trying to bypass. &quot;The argument is about who has the authority in the Western Wall and it's not the Prime Minister's Office, it's the Chief Rabbinate. Can the prime minister bypass the defense minister in things under his purview? The prime minister needs to follow the rules,&quot; he said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Gilad Erdan is a great success story of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, as is the Strategic Affairs Ministry that he heads. So is the anti-boycott law. Every human rights activist who is expelled from Israel or questioned at Ben-Gurion International Airport is a BDS success story. The European Broadcasting Union’s letter is another success of the global movement to boycott Israel.</p> \n<p>More than Lana Del Rey canceling her visit, more than SodaStream moving its factory from the West Bank to the Negev and more than the achievements of the economic, academic and cultural boycott, BDS has succeeded in a different area, effortlessly and perhaps unintentionally. It has undermined the greatest asset of Israeli public diplomacy: Israel’s liberal and democratic image in the world. It was the European Broadcasting Union, of all things, a nonpolitical organization, very far from BDS, that best described the extent of the damage to Israel: The organization compared Israel to Ukraine and Azerbaijan in the conditions it set for these countries to host the Eurovision Song Contest.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Ukraine and Azerbaijan, which no one seriously considers to be democracies, in the same breath as Israel. This is how the Eurovision organizers see Israel.</p> \n<p>The song contest was held in Jerusalem twice before, and no one thought to set conditions to guarantee the civil liberties of participants. Now it is necessary to guarantee, in advance and in writing, what is self-evident in a democracy: freedom of entry and freedom of movement to everyone who comes for the competition.</p> \n<p>In Israel, as in Ukraine and Azerbaijan, this is no longer self-evident. In the 13 years since it was founded, the BDS movement couldn’t have dreamed of a greater triumph.</p> \n<p>The main credit, of course, goes to the Israeli government, which in declaring war on BDS and made a great contributions to the movement. With a commander like Erdan, who is outraged over the interference with the “laws of a democratic state” and doesn’t understand how grotesque his words are, and with a ministry that is nothing but an international thought police, the government is telling the world: Israel isn’t what you thought. Did you think for years that Israel was a liberal democracy? Did you close your eyes to the goings-on in its backyard? Did you think the occupation was separate from the state, that it could be maintained in a democracy, that it was surely temporary and would be over momentarily? That at least sovereign Israel is part of the West? Well, you were wrong.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Can Netanyahu and Trump Downgrade the Palestinian Issue for Good? |&nbsp;Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The government has torn off the mask. Not only BDS, but all supporters of human rights, should be grateful to it. The war on BDS, a legitimate, nonviolent protest movement, has dragged Israel into new territory. Omar Barghouti and his colleagues can rub their hands together in satisfaction and pride. They have begun to dismantle the regime inside Israel as well. No democracy has a strategic affairs ministry that spies on critics of the state and its government worldwide and draws up blacklists of people who are banned from entry on account of their worldview or political activities. No democracy asks its guests for their opinions at its borders, as a condition for entry. No democracy searches its visitors’ computers and their lifestyles when they enter and leave. Perhaps Ukraine and Azerbaijan do, Turkey and Russia too.</p> \n<p>It could have, and should have, been argued previously as well that Israel did not deserve to be seen as democracy, on account of the occupation. But now Israel has crossed the line. It hasn’t erased only the Green Line, it has begun to the task of annexation, including a gradual westward movement of the regime in the West Bank. The gap between the two regimes, in the occupied territories and in Israel, is still huge, but laws passed in recent years have narrowed it.</p> \n<p>The state’s fancy display window, with all the bright neon and rustling cellophane of freedom and equality; of Arab MKs and pharmacists; gay-friendly, with a vibrant night life and all the other shiny objects, is beginning to crack. The Eurovision organizers recognize this.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The High Court of Justice denied a petition on Wednesday that had been filed by the residents of the West Bank Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar and gave the state the green light to evacuate the entire village.</p> \n<p>The village had been built on state-owned land and its houses were constructed without permits. Khan al-Ahmar had been slated to be evacuated last month before the eviction of its residents was halted by the court to consider the petitions.</p> \n<p>Justices Hanan Melcer, Yitzhak Amit and Anat Baron said the main issue in the case was not whether the eviction could be carried out, but where the residents would be relocated.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion: The eviction of Khan al-Ahmar stinks up to high heaven</p> \n<p>In turning down the petitioners, the court also rescinded the temporary injunctions issued in July&nbsp;that had barred authorities from proceeding with the evictions. Justice Melcer added, however, that unlike the eviction of Jewish residents of the&nbsp;illegal outpost of Amona last year, which proceeded as soon as it was ordered, in this case, no immediate eviction was required, and a future date could be set at the government's discretion. Technically the ruling allows the state to evict the villagers within seven days.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Wednesday's court session discussed a petition against the wording of the eviction order and one claiming the Israeli Civil Administration had not examined the residents' request to legalize the village, which was filed shortly before the appeal.</p> \n<p>Justice Amit called the court's earlier ruling permitting the evacuation of the site &quot;the starting point and the finish line,&quot; adding: &quot;The main petition is an attempt to reopen a final verdict, which is sufficient to have it rejected out of hand.&quot; Amit also rejected the petitioners' request to delay the eviction until they find somewhere else to live, and referred to the Amona case as precedent.</p> \n<p>Criticizing the Bedouin's decision to reject the state's offer to resettle them at a West Bank site near the sewage treatment plant in the vicinity of Mitzpeh Yeriho, Amit said: &quot;We should lament the petitioners' quick rejection of the new alternative, before an in-depth examination.&quot;</p> \n<p>It is difficult to be impressed by the petitioners claim that the state has failed to provide a solution, Amit said, when they themselves persisted in maintaining things as they are. He also criticized the claim that the land does not belong to the state, as the petitioners failed to prove it was privately owned land.</p> \n<p>In July, a high court justice issued a temporary injunction on the eviction and demolition of Khan al-Ahmar following the petition and after criticism from member countries of the European Union. Khan al-Ahmar is also home to a school that attracted international attention as it was initially constructed of tires.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Following the ruling, Defense Ministry Avigdor Lieberman wrote: &quot;Khan al-Ahmar will be evicted! I commend the high court justices for a brave and necessary decision in the face of the hypocritical attacks orchestrated by Abu Mazen [Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas], the left and European countries. No one is above the law. No one will prevent us from exercising our sovereignty and responsibility to the state.&quot;</p> \n<p>Reacting to the court's decision, Joint List Knesset member Dov Khenin called it &quot;a major injustice that should outrage any person of conscience.&quot; He noted that the residents of Khan al-Ahmar had relocated to the site after being expelled in the 1950s from the Negev, &quot;and now they are facing forced expulsion again.&quot;</p> \n<p>Khenin said the expulsion is also an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians. &quot;A major and dangerous annexation plan designed to create a continuous string of settlements from Jerusalem to Jericho, to cut to West Bank in two, preventing the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, to prevent the possibility of achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace is behind the demolition.&quot;</p> \n<p>UN Middle East envoy&nbsp;Nickolay&nbsp;Mladenov tweeted Wednesday that &quot;Demolitions undermine prospect for two state solution and are against international law.&quot;</p> \n<p>For its part, the Palestine Liberation Organization called the eviction of the residents of Khan al-Ahmar a war crime and a &quot;flagrant violation of international law and every international convention.&quot; In a statement issued through the official Wafa news agency, the PLO called the ruling by the High Court of Justice a political decision and called for international intervention to stop Israel &quot;from continuing its conduct without any regard for international law.&quot; The ruling proves that the Israeli judicial system is subject to political influence, the PLO said, adding that the international court must therefore intervene and launch an investigation against Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Internal Housing Ministry documents indicate that the waiting list for public housing in Israel is expected to grow threefold in the coming decade and total 28,000 people.</p> \n<p>The ministry calculated the number of families waiting for public housing, both through the Housing Ministry (3,968 families and disabled persons, some living on their own, and whose number rose by 50 percent in the past two years) and through the Absorption Ministry, for a total of about 9,000 families in 2018, Haaretz and Yedid (the Association for Community Empowerment) have learned.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The documents were presented to the public housing committee headed by ministry director-general Hagai Resnick. Finance Ministry representatives were ousted from this committee this week, with Resnick saying they tried to thwart the program. It is not clear in what format the team will continue its work or whether it will convene again tomorrow as originally planned.</p> \n<p>The ministry’s internal forecasts show that if no dramatic change occurs in the inventory of public housing and the Housing Ministry continues to acquire housing units at the same pace it has for the past three years (in which 2,000 units were purchased), the number of people on the waiting list is expected to reach 27,860.</p> \n<p>The Housing Ministry estimates that the waiting list will grow by more than 1,700 families per year. The ministry made a further calculation which found that even if enough housing units were acquired in 2018 to cover the entire current waiting list, without regular and massive acquisitions, in 2019 the public housing waiting list would shoot up to 1,731, then to 3,463 in 2020 and 17,313 by 2028.</p> \n<p>The ministry also foresees that barring a massive purchase of housing units, the number of public housing units will continue to erode so that by the end of the coming decade, these units will total just 1.74 percent of the total number of housing units in Israel, significantly lower than in many European countries, where public housing units sometimes account for as much as a quarter or third of all housing units, according to an international survey.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; In West Bank settlements, it’s a bull housing market</p> \n<p>In Holland, the percentage of public housing units is 34 percent, in Austria 26 percent, in Denmark 22 percent, in France 18.7 percent, in Britain 17.6 percent, in New Zealand 5.8 percent and in the United States 4.3 percent, while in Israel the current percentage is just 2.5 percent. The Housing Ministry calculations show that if Housing Minister Yoav Gallant’s “To Live in Dignity” plan, which seeks to add 72,000 public housing units within a decade, is adopted, in 2028 Israel will reach 4.06 percent and overtake Hungary, Germany and Japan in the percentage of public housing units. If the plan is not adopted, the proportion of public housing in Israel will go down to 1.74 percent.</p> \n<p>In 1959, public housing units accounted for 23 percent of the total housing units in Israel, but the rate has steadily declined since then, due to a halt to construction and the sale of these apartments to tenants. In early 2000, there were more than 107,000 public housing units in Israel; today the number has fallen below 60,000.</p> \n<p>“The lack of solutions for public housing is a ticking social time bomb. If the government does not take serious action to follow up its decision to prepare a genuine, funded emergency plan, we can expect to see tens of thousands of people who are eligible for public housing end up in severe hardship,” says Yedid deputy director Ran Melamed.</p> \n<p>This week a fierce dispute arose between the housing and finance ministries after the Housing Ministry director ousted Finance Ministry representatives from the steering committee for the “To Live in Dignity” plan, on the grounds that they seemed to be attempting to thwart the plan’s implementation. Resnick said yesterday that the Finance Ministry informed him that the plan to increase the stock of public housing units would not be allotted any budget, and so he decided to oust the ministry’s representatives on the committee.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Housing prices in Israel see sharpest rise since October 2016</p> \n<p>“Zero budget, that’s what they told me they would invest,” he said. “I was explicitly told – ‘You led the committee, you got yourself into this and you’ll get yourself out of this, there won’t be any budget.’” Adds Resnick: “These are typical bureaucrats who create committee after committee to no end. That’s not what I’m here for. The public housing tenants are too important.”</p> \n<p>The committee was established in late July to make recommendations on a government plan of action to increase the stock of public housing following a cabinet decision on the matter.</p> \n<p>The document also shows that top Housing Ministry officials feel the eligibility criteria for public housing should become more flexible, and that even now there are many more families that should be eligible for public housing. Currently, only families with three or more children who have been living on public assistance for more than 24 months, or disabled persons who meet the strict eligibility requirements, are entitled to public housing – and this comes to less than 4,000 families.</p> \n<p>The document indicates that the Housing Ministry seeks to adjust the criteria so that another 24,571 people would be eligible for public housing: 17,461 disabled individuals, 2,850 single-parent families that receive alimony but not public assistance, 400 homeless people and 3,860 couples and single individuals who do not meet the “income test” and live on very low wages, i.e., a couple whose total income is 5,685 shekels ($1,580) or a couple with two children that lives on 7,633 shekels.</p> \n<p>Currently, single-parent families with three or more children living off support from the National Insurance Institute, due to second parent’s failure to pay child support, are not eligible for public housing. As Haaretz reported yesterday, just 25 million shekels are required from the Finance Ministry to include such families on the list of those eligible for public housing assistance, but the Finance Ministry says there is no source of funding to pay for this.</p> \n<p>Melamed also presented the Resnick committee with a number of proposals last week for immediate solutions to create an inventory of housing units that would be rented by the government, via the public housing companies, and given for free to those eligible for public housing until their eligibility is fully realized.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 'Economic interests trampled the community idea': Why WeWork sold its flagship space to Microsoft | Analysis</p> \n<p>Says Resnick: “In this way the government would relieve the tenants of the need to go in search of apartments, when it is very difficult to find guarantors or even checks to prepay rent, which many of those eligible do not have.”</p> \n<p>Other models that the organization proposed to the committee include developing a long-term, supervised rental market designated for those who have an eligibility certificate for public housing and those who receive rental assistance; shared rental units for older single tenants who cannot afford to rent decent housing with the rental assistance they receive; and converting apartments belonging to the Development Authority into public housing units. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>In response to Resnick’s ousting of Finance Ministry representatives from the committee, the ministry’s deputy budget director, Ariel Yotzer, sent a scathing letter to Resnick, saying the Housing Ministry could find money for public housing in its own budget if it had its priorities straight.</p> \n<p>“The Finance Ministry is prepared to help you rethink budget priorities and focus the budgets of the Construction and Housing Ministry toward public housing, which you have defined as an acute need that is underfunded,” Yotzer wrote.</p> \n<p>He noted that Resnick had been in his position for three years, “And during that time, the Construction and Housing Ministry has found it proper to allocate budgets to various issues, which, important though they may be, certainly don’t correlate with your statements about the importance you ascribe to dealing with public housing. For example: soccer clubs, courses for the psychometric exam and professional training, the agricultural volunteers project, advancing a heritage project to mark the falling of the Nili underground and more.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>It happens every few years. A leading conductor or some other music authority seeks to play the music of Richard Wagner in Israel. The attempt generates a controversy, and those in charge ultimately apologize and promise never to do it again.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The latest instance came last week when Israel public radio’s &quot;As You Want&quot; program broadcast an excerpt from Wagner’s &quot;Gotterdammerung.&quot; Afterwards, the radio station apologized, and promised that it would return to abiding by the informal ban on the playing of Wagner’s music - because of its desire to avoid giving pain to Holocaust survivors.</p> \n<p>Thus, Kan Kol Hamusika now joins conductors like Zubin Mehta and Daniel Barenboim who have tried and failed to break the Wagner taboo. Others will, no doubt, follow in their footsteps. Nevertheless, given the anger the question provokes not only among the dwindling number of survivors but other Jews who choose to believe upholding this tradition is a matter of principle, it’s not clear that future attempts will be any more successful.</p> \n<p>But the idea that this does the Jews, Israel or the arts any good is another question entirely. Like all attempts to merge the arts with politics and to punish artists whose beliefs or actions we oppose - even when, as with the case of Wagner, there is a good historical reason for anger - such bans are almost always a very bad idea.</p> \n<p>The instinct to punish artists who voice opinions we don’t like is understandable. Some Israelis will delete the songs of Lana Del Rey from their Spotify accounts because she succumbed to pressure from BDS activists and canceled a concert in Israel.</p> \n<p>There’s an even better argument for declaring Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters off limits since he has integrated his odious ideas about Israel and Jews as well as support for BDS into his concerts. In the world of classical music, there are also those who boycott Barenboim - whose recording of Wagner was the one that caused the trouble on the radio - because of his pro-Palestinian views.</p> \n<p>The starting point for the discussion of Wagner must always be one of respect for the feelings of Holocaust survivors. The notion that Wagner provided the soundtrack for the Shoah is, at best, an exaggeration. Yet it is also true that for some of those who lived through it, memories of the horror of Nazi Germany are linked with the music of Adolf Hitler’s favorite composer.</p> \n<p>Wagner’s bizarre theories about the role of Jews in perverting German music had an outsized influence in his own day and helped prepare subsequent generations to make the leap from hate to mass murder. Indeed, during his lifetime it’s likely that far more people read his anti-Semitic essays than the relative few who had the opportunity to hear his music played live in the time before recordings or broadcast media existed.</p> \n<p>But that is not the same thing as saying he was a Nazi. Wagner died in 1883 and, despite his vile ideology, had a complicated and inconsistent attitude toward Jewish colleagues as well as politics. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for his widow, children and grandchildren, some of whom allowed Hitler and his followers to hijack the Bayreuth Festival&nbsp;- the prestigious music institution founded by the composer to perpetuate his work - and to turn it into a prop of the Nazi regime.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yet to assert, as some do, that Wagner’s operas are anti-Semitic is false. While Wagner’s anti-Semitic screeds are today read only by scholars, his operas continue to be enjoyed by audiences around the world&nbsp;who know little or nothing of his anti-Semitism - because they are life-affirming in nature and say nothing about Jews or Judaism.</p> \n<p>Those who seek to project the composer’s racial and political opinions onto the broad canvas of his myth-based theater works are inevitably reduced to strained analogies that can’t stand up to scrutiny.</p> \n<p>So long as the work itself is not something that promotes hatred (which can be said of a play such as &quot;The Merchant of Venice,&quot; even though no one seeks to enforce a ban on the writings of William Shakespeare) one must separate the artist from their art.</p> \n<p>Unlike literature, attempts to classify any music as intrinsically good or evil always fail because the power of the art form is ethically neutral.</p> \n<p>For example, Theodor Herzl, the founder of the Zionist movement and a man who held liberal views about culture and society, was a great supporter of Wagner’s music. Herzl confided to his diary during the period when he was planning to write &quot;The Jewish State,&quot; &quot;Only on those nights when no Wagner was performed [at the Paris Opera] did I have any doubts about the correctness of my idea.&quot; He later insisted that music from Wagner’s &quot;Tannhauser&quot; be played at the opening of the Second Zionist Congress in 1898.</p> \n<p>No one should be forced to listen to anything that conjures up associations with the Shoah for them, and that will likely keep Israel’s Wagner ban alive. But while, contrary to Wagner’s own theories, art cannot stand outside of or above humanistic principles, once we view it only through the prism of politics and make it the prisoner of our ideologies - whether good or bad - we diminish both it and ourselves.</p> \n<p>It can only be hoped that Israelis, who wouldn’t let Hitler’s opinions influence theirs on any other subject, will eventually relent and come to appreciate Wagner as music - rather than solely as a symbol of a tragic past.</p> \n<p>Jonathan S.

        "text":["<p>How did ancient Israel come to be? Did the early&nbsp;Israelites&nbsp;reach Canaan from the eastern wilderness by crossing the&nbsp;Jordan River opposite Jericho, as the Book of&nbsp;Joshua says? Or did the Israelites originate in Canaan in the first place, as part of the indigenous population?</p> \n<p>No archaeological evidence has ever been found of the migration of the Israelites from the wilderness of Sinai via the Jordan Valley to the fertile land of Canaan, as described in the Bible. Nor has evidence of the pitched battles the Israelites were said to have had, as described by the Prophet Joshua, with the locals, whether in Jericho or elsewhere.</p> \n<p>It is not odd that a migrating people would not leave evidence behind. By definition, nomads travel light and don’t build permanent structures. Except that some of the Middle Eastern ones did exactly that – live in tents themselves, but make stone fencing for their beasts. Today’s Bedouin tend to do the same thing.</p> \n<p>And now archaeologists are excavating strange ruins previously found in inhospitable parts of the Jordan Valley, hoping to prove or disprove the theory suggested by the late archaeologist Prof. Adam Zertal of Haifa University: That the stone structures found there were erected by the ancient Israelites as they slowly crossed into Canaan 3,200 years ago.</p> \n<p>Interestingly, if the Israelites did build these structures, they may have done so not to shelter themselves but their livestock, says Prof. David Ben-Shlomo of Ariel University.</p> \n<p>A horrible place to live</p> \n<p>The Jordan Valley is a stretch along the Dead Sea Transform, the yawning crack in the earth formerly known as the Great Rift Valley. Stretching over 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Dead Sea to the Sea of Galilee, the valley is long, narrow, deep – and hot and dry. One side of the valley is in Israel and the West Bank, the other in Jordan.</p> \n<p>This is not an inviting place to live on a permanent basis. Temperatures in the Jordan Valley can easily reach 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summer and annual rainfall is wretched, at 100 to 200 millimeters (4 to 8 inches) a year.</p> \n<p>Archaeologists therefore assumed that, given other options, people would not choose to settle in the Jordan Valley, except in spots fed by oases like Jericho – which is one of the oldest-known cities in the world. But north of it is precious little settled life, because the conditions are so nasty.</p> \n<p>Yet a meticulous survey of 1,000 square miles of the western part of the valley, headed by Zertal and his team from 1978 onward, found the remains of hundreds of ancient settlements in the Jordan Valley. (One seems to be shaped like a foot, with toes and all.)</p> \n<p>Of the hundreds, Zertal estimated that about 70 had been erected in the early Iron Age. That is, about 3,200 years ago, which is when the ancient Israelites were said to have been led by the Prophet Joshua from the wilderness to fertile Canaan, where summer temperatures were more likely to be in the 30s.</p> \n<p>No signs of the builders’ identity have been found as yet. The only reasons to associate the structures in the bitterly inhospitable valley with the ancient Israelites are their location and the estimated timing of their erection.</p> \n<p>But Ben-Shlomo and Ralph K. Hawkins of Averett University, Virginia, are continuing where Zertal left off: they are excavating the sites, hoping to find more clues to their provenance and use.</p> \n<p>They began with a large and very strange settlement called Khirbet el Mastarah (which could be loosely translated as “hidden ruins”).</p> \n<p>While today the only sign of life there is the occasional Bedouin shepherd passing by with their herd, Mastarah seems to have once housed a large Iron Age village, says Ben-Shlomo.</p> \n<p>It is the oddity of the settlement’s location that begs thoughts about its founders.</p> \n<p>And how exactly does a significant village with stone houses square with the idea that the builders were a people on the move?</p> \n<p>Strangely empty structures</p> \n<p>Khirbet el Mastarah is 8 kilometers north of Jericho and 2 kilometers from the outlet of a spring named 'Uja (or 'Auja). The whole Jordan Valley area north of Jericho is pretty miserable, says Ben-Shlomo: No reason for people to have decided to spend their lives eking out a living there. So there were few “fixed” towns. Yet one was Mastarah.</p> \n<p>The mysteries at Mastarah are multiple. One is that it wasn’t built by a spring, as far as we can tell, yet seems to have developed into a respectable hamlet, some 2.5 acres square.</p> \n<p>A second oddity is that no sign of human habitation was found inside the stone structures, with the exception of grain grinding stones that could have been placed there later, or kept there.</p> \n<p>What few pottery sherds were found lay outside the structures – which is spectacularly unhelpful to archaeologists trying to date a site. “Maybe somebody came by 1,000 years later and left them there,” Ben-Shlomo points out.</p> \n<p>The archaeologists are, therefore, tapping other advanced techniques to date the site: they sampled soil beneath the walls to test with optically stimulated luminescence analysis – a technology used to date ancient materials based on the buildup of electrons that get trapped over the years and are released by exposure to light – and expect to get the findings in some months.</p> \n<p>In normal towns, broken pottery sherds are found inside the houses, not outside. Yet that anomaly could be explained in a number of ways.</p> \n<p>The less likely possibility is theft over the generations since the town’s abandonment: robbing sites of antiquity goes back to, well, antiquity. However, Ben-Shlomo points out that thieves might steal whole pots but wouldn’t help themselves to fragments. Those would have remained behind.</p> \n<p>A second possibility is that the pottery remains were washed away: a hot dry valley area is a recipe for flash flooding and the ruins had been on the surface, not buried under sand, the archaeologist notes.</p> \n<p>A third possibility is that the structures were occupied by people for a short time, which fits with the theory of a migratory people taking a break for a decade or two.</p> \n<p>A fourth possibility is that stone structures were for the animals, while the people themselves, as befits nomads, lived in tents.</p> \n<p>The archaeologists hope to see whether the “homes” actually housed goats and the like by chemical analysis of the ground inside. Theoretically, if dung had accrued in them, the ground will, even thousands of years later, be richer in phosphorus.</p> \n<p>There is precedence. Ancient and modern Near Eastern Bedouin, who tended to nomadic lifestyles, also seem to have lived in tents but to have housed their animals in stone compounds – to protect their precious livestock from rustlers.</p> \n<p>But Mastarah’s key anomaly is where it was built. It nestles between a small hill to the south and the foothills in the northwest. It was built on a low spur 40 meters below sea level between two small tributaries of Wadi Nabiris, which is now dry.</p> \n<p>In short, the settlement was topographically isolated. Its very name, Mastarah, means “hidden” in both Arabic and Hebrew.</p> \n<p>Locating a new settlement not adjacent to a water source or a main land route and concealed from its surroundings is highly unusual. It could imply its inhabitants were a new population in the region, possibly hiding from a local hostile population.</p> \n<p>So it is possible that the ancient Israelites did come from the wilderness, did cross the Jordan Valley – and then stayed awhile, Ben-Shlomo explains. While the environs were not paradisal, at least there were not many people. The weary Israelites could rest, even for a generation or two, build up strength and then continue on.</p> \n<p>Fortified city on a hilltop</p> \n<p>Next year, the researchers plan to excavate the nearby site of ‘Uja el-Foqa, which lies on a prominent hill overlooking the Jericho Valley, from which the 'Uja spring can be controlled, Ben-Shlomo says.</p> \n<p>The survey showed the site to be fortified, meaning it had strong syrrounding walls designed to drive any besieging enemy to despair.&nbsp; It has been dated it to the Iron Age as well – around 1,000 to 586 or 587 B.C.E. It seems to have had at least two phases of occupation.</p> \n<p>'Uja el-Foqa has dozens of structures, some up to two meters in height, as well as a casemate wall. The ancient town could reasonably have been a regional administrative center for the Kingdom of Judah, since it controls an important water source and is one of the only large fortified sites from this period in the region.</p> \n<p>Based on its location, Zertal suspected that 'Uja el-Foqa was the biblical town of Ataroth, which is mentioned in the description of the Manasseh-Ephraim boundary in Joshua 16:5 (note, tellingly, that it is on a hilltop and the Hebrew word ateret means “crown”).</p> \n<p>“We plan a large-scale excavation of the site and will try to examine the nature of the site, it inhabitants, and the date of its founding, and to determine whether it could also be linked to the early Israelite settlement of the region in biblical times,” Ben-Shlomo says.</p> \n<p>Thus, the answer to the puzzle of early Israelite origins may yet remain hidden in the sands.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the end found the bureaucratic opening to help him put off the solution to yet another crisis – the one over the mixed egalitarian prayer area at the Western Wall.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The solution involved using handicapped-accessibility regulations, which allow the expansion of structures without a permit. The regulations are intended, of course, for people with disabilities, but if they can be used to shut the Reform movement up for a while, why not?</p> \n<p>To complete the farce, Minister Uri Ariel opposed the expansion of the prayer site in the name of good government. “The authority for the entire Western Wall is in the Chief Rabbinate’s hands … and the Prime Minister’s Office is trying to bypass the Chief Rabbinate,” he said. Ariel, one of the orchestrators of the symphony of robbery in the West Bank, for whom good government was always at best a bonus, has become a champion of Israeli law. It was worth living this long to see it.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;Israel is not becoming a Jewish fundamentalist state</p> \n<p>But Ariel also spoke the truth: “The argument isn’t about expansion – if it’s another four meters – the argument is about who has authority over the Western Wall.” The Western Wall plan, which the government revoked, stipulated that authority over the expanded prayer plaza would be taken from the Chief Rabbinate, the Religious Affairs Minister and the Western Wall rabbi, and given to a new public council. This means paving the way to state recognition of other religious streams in Judaism – the Reform and Conservative ones – and that is something the ultra-Orthodox parties cannot live with.</p> \n<p>But their fear is not only for Judaism. They fear the breach of Orthodox Judaism’s monopoly on all official religious institutions in Israel, and the political power that this monopoly has been generating for them over the past 70 years. The argument is whether Israel will grant a monopoly over Judaism to the corrupt, crumbling institution of the Chief Rabbinate, or whether Israel is willing to accept the Judaism of rabbis like Yizhar Hess and Gilad Kariv as well.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is a struggle for Israel’s identity, and Netanyahu hopes to turn it into a fight over parcels of land. Take a few meters, he tells the Reform and Conservative movements, recognition we’ll discuss some other time, I have a window in my schedule in 2040.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu isn’t the first prime minister being forced to compromise for coalition reasons. The compromises he’s made to preserve his position are important. He made alliances with the darkest forces in Israeli society, and one of his pacts is with the Rabbinate mafia, a factory for jobs and political wheeler-dealers that has spun out of control. Netanyahu is not the one paying the price.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For this government, there are very few real Israelis, all of them reflecting its image. All the rest are barely Israelis, they’re Israelis on probation. It’s okay to call them “Israel haters,” to say “they should stay in America,” and that they’re “the destruction of the people of Israel.” All this has been said about Reform Jews. (Not about leftists, heaven forbid.)</p> \n<p>I’ve always wondered how people who hate so many Israelis accuse others of hating Israel, but politics is indeed the art of the possible. The prime minister is supposed to represent the Israelis and the non-Israelis, but he wants to keep his job and for that he is ready to toss all values into the garbage heap.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism looked at the Jewish texts and tried to figure out how to live as a Jew in a way that regards women as equal, that doesn’t humiliate people for their sexual inclination, and respects the other and the foreigner. This movement offers Israel a choice between a state that celebrates its citizens, that sees them as an asset, and a suspicious state that is scared of its citizens, that sees only a small, dwindling part of the population as legitimate. Netanyahu made his choice long ago. Now we must make ours.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Sweden headed for a hung parliament after an election on Sunday that saw support for the nationalist Sweden Democrats surge, as one of Europe's most liberal nations turned right amid fears over immigration.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Far-right parties have made spectacular gains throughout Europe in recent years as anxieties grow over national identity and the effects of globalisation and immigration following armed conflict in the Middle East and North Africa.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In Sweden, an influx of 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 - the most in Europe in relation to the country's population of 10 million - has polarised voters and fractured the long-standing political consensus.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With almost all districts having reported, the ruling center-left Social Democrats and Greens and their Left Party parliamentary allies had 40.6 percent of the vote, while the opposition center-right Alliance was at 40.3 percent.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That gave the centre-left 144 seats in the 349-seat parliament against 142 for the Alliance, suggesting weeks of uncertainty before a workable government can be formed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the white supremacist fringe, won 17.6 percent and 63 seats, up from 12.9 percent and 49 seats in the last election four years ago, the biggest gain by any party in Sweden's parliament, the Riksdag.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The process of forming a stable government out of the deadlocked parliament could take weeks and, potentially, end in failure.&nbsp;Acrimony between the two main political blocs has defined Swedish politics for decades, and the rise of the Sweden Democrats - long a pariah grouping in parliament - has hugely complicated the political landscape.</p> \n<p>The Sweden Democrats' success follows&nbsp;a surge in popularity&nbsp;for other far-right parties in Europe amid growing anxiety over national identity and the effects of globalisation and fears over immigration following armed conflict in the Middle East and North Africa.</p> \n<p>The election will add to concerns in Brussels as the European Union enters campaign mode ahead of the European Parliament election in May, which could give more voice to eurosceptic groups and thwart efforts at closer EU integration.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Sweden is Europe's last liberal bastion. The elections might change that&nbsp;■&nbsp;Sweden’s 'moderate' far right has a Nazi problem</p> \n<p>The results were largely in line with the conventional opinion polls tracked by Reuters in the run-up to the election but well below some online surveys that had predicted the Sweden Democrats could become the largest party.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While the results also fell short of leader Jimmie Akesson's predictions of 20 percent of the vote or more, he told a party rally it was nevertheless the winner of the election.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We will gain huge influence over what happens in Sweden during the coming weeks, months and years,&quot; Akesson told party colleagues.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Akesson hopes his party, which wants Sweden to leave the European Union and freeze immigration, can play a decisive role in negotiations over forming a government.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He called on Ulf Kristersson, the centre-right Alliance's candidate for the premiership, to choose between seeking support from the Sweden Democrats for an Alliance government or to accept another four years of Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan Lofven.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Kristersson called on Lofven to resign, but rebuffed Akesson.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We have been completely clear during the whole election. The Alliance will not govern or discuss how to form a government with the Sweden Democrats,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Sweden Democrats, shunned by all the other parties since entering parliament in 2010, have promised to sink any Cabinet that refuses to give them a say in policy, particularly on immigration.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lofven said he would not resign and called for cross-party cooperation to resolve the political impasse.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;There is no side with a majority. Then it is only natural to work across the political divide to make it possible to govern Sweden,&quot; Lofven said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Growing Chorus of Euroscepticism</p> \n<p>The election will add to concerns in Brussels as the European Union enters campaign mode ahead of the European Parliament election in May, which could give more voice to eurosceptic groups and thwart efforts at closer EU integration.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The record levels of those seeking asylum in 2015 magnified worries about a welfare system in Sweden that many voters already believe is in crisis, even though refugee numbers have fallen sharply since then.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lengthening queues for critical operations, shortages of doctors and teachers and the failures of police to deal with inner-city gang violence have shaken faith in the &quot;Swedish model&quot;, built on a promise of comprehensive welfare and social inclusion.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Akesson had labelled the vote a choice between immigration and welfare in a campaign that was unusually antagonistic.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Voting in central Stockholm, student Katze Collmar, 32, said the campaign had been &quot;really unpleasant&quot;.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;It feels like Sweden could take a step in this election that we won't be able to recover from very easily.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lofven could hold on to power unless the Alliance accepts some kind of support from the Sweden Democrats, at a likely cost of the populists having more say over immigration policy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But he would need to overcome decades of acrimony between the two blocs and get support from parties on the centre-right, something they have ruled out.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>One of the Mossad's finest hours is back on cinema screens this week when &quot;Operation Finale&quot; opens in the United States. The thriller recreates its successful abduction of Adolf Eichmann to Israel from the streets of Buenos Aires in May 1960, with Ben Kingsley playing the Nazi war criminal who was one of the chief architects of the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>Who was Eichmann, and why was his abduction headline news around the world? Haaretz has reportedly extensively on the subject over the years, including details of Operation Finale, the 1961 trial in Jerusalem, Eichmann's legacy in Israel and even previous attempts to capture him.</p> \n<p>The operation to abduct Eichmann</p> \n<p>Fifty years after Eichmann's execution, the Mossad finally released information about Operation Finale&nbsp;– including how 70 percent of the participants in the abduction were Holocaust survivors or had come from Europe. A Tel Aviv museum was the unlikely site for these revelations:</p> \n<p>An Inside Look at Israel's Operation to Capture Nazi Criminal Adolf Eichmann</p> \n<p>It wasn't just Mossad agents who were involved in the abduction. In 2015, Haaretz reported on the late Dr. Luba Volk, an El Al flight attendant who soon started to suspect her flight bringing an Israel delegation to Buenos Aires for a celebration of Argentina's independence in 1960 was not all it seemed:&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The El Al Stewardess Who Helped Capture Eichmann</p> \n<p>In 2010, the Israel State Archives published over 100 documents related to the Eichmann abduction – although some details remained state secrets. One of the biggest revelations was the war criminal's own thoughts on how the Mossad's daring operation was conducted:</p> \n<p>50 Years After Eichmann Capture, Much Information Still Withheld</p> \n<p>The trial in Jerusalem&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israeli citizens were stunned by the news of Eichmann's capture. But while most celebrated his being brought to trial, there was one man who questioned its political purpose:</p> \n<p>The Jewish Philosopher Who Tried to Convince Israel Not to Try Eichmann</p> \n<p>Writer Ora Herman explored the connections between the Eichmann trial and Israel’s relations with West Germany with a book on the subject, specifically Israel's attempts to defend itself against another Holocaust:</p> \n<p>Eichmann and the Bomb: How Israel's Fledgling Nuke Program Impacted the Nazi's Trial</p> \n<p>Fifty years after Eichmann was brought to justice, the men who captured, investigated and prosecuted him reunited in the Jerusalem hall where his famous trial took place:</p> \n<p>Eichmann Trial Veterans Reunite to Remember Landmark Case</p> \n<p>And in the documentary &quot;Memories of the Eichmann Trial,&quot; David Perlov approaches the trial not as a formative event that brought the story of the Holocaust into Israeli consciousness, but as a formative event that turned into a memory itself:</p> \n<p>'Memories of the Eichmann Trial' / From Testimony to Proof</p> \n<p>After being found guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes against the Jewish people, Eichmann was sentenced to death. He was eventually executed on the night between May 31 and June 1, 1962:</p> \n<p>This Day in Jewish History: Israel Hangs Adolf Eichmann</p> \n<p>The Eichmann legacy</p> \n<p>Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt famously coined the term &quot;the Banality of Evil&quot; while covering the Eichmann trial in 1961. Eva Illouz recently examined this term in the context of Israel's &quot;current colonialist regime&quot;:</p> \n<p>Rethinking the 'Banality of Evil' Theory</p> \n<p>Much has been written about Eichmann over the years, but perhaps the definitive study was German philosopher-historian Bettina Stangneth's &quot;Eichmann Before Jerusalem.&quot; Haaretz called it a revealing portrait of &quot;a man who was far from being a dutiful clerk&quot;:</p> \n<p>Eichmann, Anything but an Ordinary Man</p> \n<p>Other Mossad operations</p> \n<p>While Operation Finale is lauded as one of the espionage agency's greatest successes, it didn't always enjoy such success. In May 1961, for example, it messed up an attempt to kill the war criminal who had been Eichmann’s assistant and who helped deport and murder thousands of Jews during the Holocaust:</p> \n<p>The Mossad’s Botched Assassination Attempts on Nazi War Criminals</p> \n<p>It emerged in 2011, meanwhile, that the Mossad had previously tried to apprehend Eichmann in 1949 when he was hiding in Austria:</p> \n<p>Israel Tried to Abduct Adolf Eichmann 11 Years Before His Capture, Report Says</p> \n<p>Eichmann on film</p> \n<p>&quot;Operation Finale&quot; is not the first time Eichmann has been shown on screen. American filmmaker Milton Fruchtman, for example, was charged with videotaping the actual Eichmann trial in Jerusalem. Fifty years later, he recalled the politically, and technically, challenging job:</p> \n<p>Capturing Eichmann – on Video</p> \n<p>At the other end of the scale, U.S. comedy show &quot;Drunk History&quot; offered its own unique take on the Eichmann affair, featuring the talents of Rachel Bloom and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, the latter as the Nazi war criminal:</p> \n<p>Comedy Central's ‘Drunk History’ Covers the Tale of Nazi Adolf Eichmann</p> \n<p>Finally, Ben Kingsley himself reflected recently on the challenges of playing Eichmann in &quot;Operation Finale,&quot; explaining why he carried a photo of Elie Wiesel with him at all times on set:</p> \n<p>Starring as Eichmann in New Film, Ben Kingsley Dedicates Performance to Elie Wiesel</p>",

        "text":["<p>“Our friends all over the world, the Noahides… You are the lucid persons in a perplex world. You are the hope of the world. Happy good day.” Thus, in somewhat broken English, Rabbi Oury Cherki, head of the Noahide World Center, greeted his followers in a video clip on the occasion of “Humanity Day,” the holiday of the Noahides (also known as Children of Noah), which was last celebrated on the 27th day of the Hebrew month of Marheshvan (Nov. 10, 2017). According to Jewish tradition, it was on that day that Noah and his family emerged from the ark and received the seven commandments that apply to all human beings, among them the prohibitions on idol worship, on murder and on eating flesh torn from a living animal. When Noah left the ark, he built an altar and made a sacrifice. Which is why the Noahides eat grilled meat on their holiday.</p> \n<p>But who are these Noahides? They are members of a new religion, subordinate to Judaism, founded by rabbis from Israel, mainly from Chabad and the religious Zionist movement. According to the World Center, there are dozens of Noahide communities across the world, with more than 20,000 believers. That’s a hefty number, given that the religion was only founded at the beginning of the decade. Small Noahide communities exist in various countries, with the largest one in the Philippines.</p> \n<p>Cooperation between Israel and the Philippines is constantly growing, and this week reached new heights with the visit to Israel of the country’s president, Rodrigo Duterte. The Philippines are a key arena of Chabad activity, and one of the primary venues where the new religion is being disseminated. There are four Chabad centers in the country, and in addition to assisting Jews, they support 10 Noahide houses of prayer. The Hasidic emissaries view the Philippines community as the model for Noahide communities in other countries. A group from the community was brought to Israel two years ago, and its members met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has also sent his greetings to all the communities worldwide.</p> \n<p>That there are countries in which groups and communities identify themselves as belonging to the Jewish people, or as descendants of the 10 lost tribes of Israel, is nothing new. Similarly, we’re familiar with Christians who admire Israel. But the Noahides are a theological phenomenon of very recent vintage. It’s a form of Zionist mission, which seeks to create a world religion whose believers adore the Jewish people and the State of Israel – without belonging to either. The believers are required to accept the supremacy of Judaism but are not accepted into the Jewish people and are even barred from upholding such commandments as Sabbath observance. Anyone who wishes to be a Noahide is called upon mainly to recognize the Jewish people and its state.</p> \n<p>Last month, Nova Religio, a journal devoted to emergent and alternative religions, published an article by Rachel Z. Feldman, assistant professor of religious studies at Franklin and Marshall College, in Pennsylvania, titled “The Children of Noah: Has Messianic Zionism Created a New World Religion?” In the summer of 2017, Feldman visited Noahide communities on the Filipino island of Cebu, which are supervised by Chabad rabbis. Like most Noahides around the world, the members of the Cebu community came mostly from Protestant churches, but had abandoned their belief in the New Testament.</p> \n<p>One of the groups Feldman observed lives in a mountainous, “financially challenged” rural region. In the past its members were cave dwellers who belonged to a Sabbath-observing church called Sacred Name Believers. Their leader is the Noahide preacher Emmanuel Villegas. For years he visited poor communities on various islands and converted them to the Children of Noah. He called on them to renounce Christianity and to burn their holy books – though not before cutting out the Tetragrammaton (God’s Hebrew name) from the texts.</p> \n<p>About 20 years ago, the community’s members moved to the village of Lamac, where they built a house of worship marked with a large Israeli flag at the entrance. In accordance with the directives of Chabad rabbis, they no longer observe Shabbat, as this precept is reserved for the members of the Jewish faith alone and is denied to Noahides. They are permitted to greet each other with the words, “Happy seventh day,” but not to utter the word “Shabbat.” Instead of the Kabbalat Shabbat ceremony used by Jews to welcome the Sabbath, the Chabad rabbis invented a ritual for them in which they light seven candles (to denote the Seven Noahide Laws).</p> \n<p>Feldman quotes one members of the community, who explained to her, “You are very lucky because you are white, and white people are rulers of the earth. But you are also a Jew. You are very gifted because you have blood from the Chosen people, from Abraham and Isaac.” In his sermons, Villegas explains why his community is forbidden to uphold Jewish commandments, and dwells on the essence of the difference between Noahides and Jews. Jews, he says, possess an inner sanctity that draws them close to a divine level: “The Jew has five levels of soul while the Noahide only has three levels and remains on an animalistic level, and this is written in the Kabbalah.”</p> \n<p>Noahides are incapable of reaching the level of the Jews, but they can learn how to improve themselves by way of the seven commandments. The questions-and-answers site asknoah.org also instructs the Children of Noah on how to cope with animal cravings. In the meantime, Chabad is making efforts to spread the word among non-Jews in Israel, too – a project that was introduced by the late Rabbi Boaz Kali, from Haifa.</p> \n<p>Ethnic hierarchy</p> \n<p>Liberal Jewish philosophers of the modern era, such as the German-Jewish thinker Hermann Cohen, viewed the Seven Laws of Noah as the universal basis of the Bible, which prove that Judaism contains a general moral outlook that transcends the question of the fate of the Jewish people. But the interpretation of Rabbi Cherki and the Chabad rabbis uses the Noahide precepts to lay down an ethnic hierarchy between Jews and gentiles. Feldman notes that the Noahide religion constitutes a new form of colonial relations and racial ideology in which the rabbis are shaping a new faith for the inhabitants of the “global south” as an instrument to advance religious and nationalist goals.</p> \n<p>Feldman points out that the first Noahide gathering, which took place in Texas in 1990, was attended by Rabbi Meir Kahane. After Kahane’s assassination, that same year, the Temple Institute, which advocates the building of the Third Temple on Jerusalem, on the site of the first two, started to promote the Noahide project. In the view of the institute’s rabbis, the gentiles’ upholding of the Seven Laws is an important stage in the messianic process at the height of which the temple will be built and Israel will become a theocracy that will gain the gentiles’ support.</p> \n<p>This is the world order being promoted by the Noahide Project, which has the support of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate and of the Israeli government. The Noahide theological project is closely related to Netanyahu’s foreign policy approach, which is based on religious support for Israel. As he worded the theological message he offered on Humanity Day in 2015, “The Seven Mitzvot of the Children of Noah are matters of both faith and morality, which according to our sages obligate all of the non-Jewish peoples of the world. These commandments serve as a basis for establishing a civilized society.”</p> \n<p>The final goal of Rabbi Cherki and the Noahide World Center, we are told, is a modest one: seven billion believers.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The looming demolition of the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar, which has been approved by Israel’s High Court of Justice, would mark the third time the village is forcibly displaced to make room for Jewish settlers.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Jewish Settlers Side With Bedouin in Their Fight Against Demolition&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Its residents, a proud Bedouin tribe named Jahalin, have opposed the transfer, as have many Palestinians who believe that the village’s symbolic and strategic location, east of Jerusalem, along with its longstanding resistance to Israel’s displacement policies, has made it emblematic of Palestinian steadfastness and struggle for statehood.</p> \n<p>Yet the story of Khan al-Ahmar is just the latest chapter in the tortured saga of Bedouin displacement. The village would not be the first to be razed by Israel, nor is Bedouin displacement confined to the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Today, half of Israel’s own Bedouin citizens live in so-called unrecognized villages, where they face the daily threat of forced displacement. One village, Al-Araqib, has been razed&nbsp;more than 100 times, as successive Israeli governments continue to view the indigenous Bedouin population as a dispensable obstacle in the way of development plans for Jewish settlements.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The irony is that the Israeli government’s current attitude toward the Bedouin marks a striking departure from the legacy of the first Zionists, many of whom believed that the Bedouin of Palestine were &quot;the lost tribes of Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>Early Jewish newcomers in Palestine shared a widespread fascination with the Arab Bedouin. Members of the First Aliyah (1882–1903), who came mostly from Eastern Europe and Yemen, drew on centuries of biblical depictions of the Holy Land as an exotic desert landscape awash with tents, palm trees, and herds of goats.</p> \n<p>Their literature is replete with nomadic motifs, ranging from invoking the common tribal descent of Arabs and Jews to cultivating a Jewish desire to &quot;go native&quot; after the fashion of the Arab Bedouin.</p> \n<p>The Bedouin, they believed, retained intact traces of ancient Jewish life, like its tribal ideals and nomadic character. Hailed as the modern descendants of the ancient Israelites, the Bedouin served not merely as agents of Jewish return to a lost biblical past, but also as an autochthonous model for the New Jew - as opposed to the urbanized Jew of the Old Yishuv - and hence as a symbol of national revival in Palestine.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Farm of Rechabites,&quot; published in Jerusalem in 1903, was the first modern Hebrew story to be printed in Palestine. Ephraim, its protagonist, is a Jewish newcomer roaming among the local Arab tribes in search of the lost Jewish tribes of the Bible.</p> \n<p>The narrator follows the protagonist’s discovery of a Jewish tribe near the Jordan River, whose members are recognized as the &quot;sons of the ancient Rachabites,&quot; a reference to a biblical clan. Thanks to centuries of assimilation into the native Arab Bedouin population, the Jewish tribe had managed to preserve its ancient heritage in its purest form.</p> \n<p>The story culminates in the heroic feat of a tribal leader striving to reunite Arabs and Jews around a shared tribal ancestry. The leader, a Jew gone Arab, welcomes the Jewish wanderer as his blood brother. A happy ending.</p> \n<p>The story’s author was none other than Hemda Ben-Yehuda, wife of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, the prominent Jewish lexicographer widely hailed as the reviver of modern Hebrew. The young couple, who migrated to Palestine from Belarus in 1892, are commemorated in Israeli historiography as the first Hebrew-speaking family in Palestine.</p> \n<p>Hemda’s story was the literary incarnation of Eliezer’s vision, which involved reviving the ancient Hebrew language by tracing its roots in the Arabic spoken by the native Bedouin tribes. To Hemda, the Bedouin were not an exotic race of Arabian wanderers, but &quot;hidden Jews&quot; in whose veins ran the blood of the ancient Hebrews. It is the Arab Bedouin, not the exilic Jew of Europe, who lodged in her imagination as the prototype of the modern Hebrew nation.</p> \n<p>If Ephraim’s search was fictional, those of the Zionist pioneers were anything but. Prominent Zionist leaders like Yitzhak Ben-Zvi frequently traveled among the Bedouin tribes of Palestine in search of the lost Jewish tribes of Israel.</p> \n<p>Like Ephraim’s, Ben-Zvi’s quest came to a happy end. His wife, Rachel Yanait Ben-Zvi, recalls in her memoir,&nbsp;Anu Olim&nbsp;(&quot;We Ascend&quot;), a burst of collective euphoria among Zionist newcomers as they came upon a Bedouin tribe who had &quot;descended from the ancient Jews.&quot; She quotes her husband saying, &quot;The Bedouin are men of nature. We shall let new blood into the veins of the Yishuv, Hebrew blood from the desert.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;In the Jordan Valley I Saw Ethnic Cleansing With My Bare Eyes&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>Ben-Zvi’s discovery was part of a dominant Jewish cultural tradition in the Bilu movement pioneered by Israel Belkind, which promoted the agricultural settlement of the land.</p> \n<p>In 1882, as a newcomer in Ottoman Palestine, Belkind fell under the spell of Bedouin life. He would wander for years among the Bedouin tribes on both sides of the Jordan River, learn their language and customs, and weave his ethnographic observations into a theory on the Jewish origins of the Bedouin of Palestine.</p> \n<p>In the Arab Bedouin, Belkind believed he saw the solution to the mystery of the ten lost tribes of Israel. Thrilled by the discovery, he would encourage his Jewish followers to move to the Galilee and realize their Zionist dream by marrying Bedouin women and assimilating into the Bedouin population.</p> \n<p>In the spring of 1903, Belkind’s followers moved with their flocks to Upper Galilee and founded Ha-Roeh (The Shepherd), a Hebrew Bedouin group that aspired to create a form of class fraternity with the Arab Bedouin. The Shepherds lived among the Bedouin tribes, adopting their cavalry customs and herding skills. By assimilating into Bedouin culture, these Hebrew shepherds meant not only to fashion themselves into a new breed of Jewish romantics, but also to craft a sense of belonging and strike roots in the land.</p> \n<p>To grasp the profoundly paradoxical cultural impact of the group on later Zionist leaders, one need not look beyond the cover of the Ariel Sharon biography &quot;Ha-Roeh&quot;, published in Hebrew in 2005. It features the architect of the &quot;Green Patrol&quot; - an anti-Bedouin campaign known among the Bedouin of the Negev as &quot;the black patrol&quot; - kissing a goat in his arms.</p> \n<p>The tradition persisted well into the era of British Mandatory Palestine (1920-1948), when the Bedouin became part and parcel of the cultural landscape in the Jewish Yishuv. Zionist writers of the period still praised the Bedouin’s ethos of bravery, communality, and loyalty to the tribe.</p> \n<p>In his memoirs, &quot;The Sons of Ishmael&quot;, Moshe Shamir reflected on his childhood in Palestine by recalling how &quot;the Arab Bedouin lived in Jewish consciousness as a symbol of deep rootedness.&quot; Moshe Smilansky’s literary hero, a Hebrew Bedouin named Hawadja Nazar, boasted pompously of the Arab Bedouin’s admiration &quot;for his heroism, for speaking Arabic fluently, for riding a galloping horse like one of them, and being dressed like them with&nbsp;abbaya,&nbsp;keffiyeh, and&nbsp;igal, and fully armed.&quot;</p> \n<p>Romek Amasi, the protagonist of a novel by Yaakov Rabinowitz, implored his fellow Jews to adopt Bedouin ways: &quot;We are a withered and feeble people with little blood in our veins. To redeem itself, our nation needs to infuse a tribal blood in its veins. We must have Jewish Bedouin.&quot;</p> \n<p>Assimilation into the Bedouin lifestyle also left its cultural mark on Zionist paramilitary groups in the Mandate. Legion Ha-’am (The People’s Legion) adopted military language and customs borrowed from the Bedouin. Its members would spend the prewar period herding and shepherding and roaming the Sinai Peninsula after the manner of the native Bedouin tribes. The Legion, with its strong tribal character and ideals, would inspire a succession of paramilitary underground groups that flourished in the Jewish Yishuv, notably Bar-Giora and the Palmach.</p> \n<p>In her memoirs, Palmach commander Netiva Ben-Yehuda summed up Zionist fascination with the Bedouin as follows: &quot;The more familiar one was with Bedouin custom, the more God-like one appeared to us.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Umm al-Hiran: A Cautionary Tale of an Israeli Government Emboldened by Trump&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>She also recalled how Palmach members cultivated a proud Bedouin identity in their language, customs, and warfare. Her fellow Palmachniks retained the custom of wearing the Bedouin&nbsp;keffiyeh, even as it had emerged as a Palestinian national icon, while practicing Bedouin-style horsemanship and fighting skills. In a tragic twist, they would draw on those same skills to displace most of the native Bedouin tribes in 1948.</p> \n<p>For nearly half a century, indigenous Bedouin tribes like the Jahalin were celebrated by Jewish newcomers as a model for Hebrew revival in Palestine. For early Zionist pioneers, assimilation into Bedouin culture was key to their rootedness, belonging, and renewed bond with the land.</p> \n<p>With the founding of Israel, the image of the Bedouin as the lost Jewish tribes has all but vanished from Hebrew culture and literature. The tragedy is that if Israel’s displacement policies towards the Bedouin continue unabated, it will be not only that image, but also the Bedouins' distinct identity itself, that might be on the verge of erasure. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Seraj Assi is the author of&nbsp;The History and Politics of the Bedouin: Reimaging Nomadism in Modern Palestine&nbsp;(Routledge Studies on the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 2018), from which this article has been adapted.

        "text":["<p>At the opening of the Knesset winter session nearly a year ago, when Benjamin Netanyahu called the opposition and the media “sourpusses” and accused them of hypocrisy, he touched on an important point. </p> \n<p>“When sourpusses talk, you hear conversations like, ‘Isn’t the situation here horrible and terrible? Isn’t everything falling apart? By the way, did you order tickets to London or Berlin?’ They’re sour, and they fly off, complain – and go shopping,” quipped Netanyahu to denigrate his opponents. He also commented on the statistic that irks opponents of the occupation like a scratch on their eyeglasses: Israel’s high ranking in the UN World Happiness Report. </p> \n<p>But it’s not a scratch, it’s the Green Line. Like Israeli democracy, Israeli happiness also cuts across the Green Line. Unlike the victim, who’s trapped by the reality of his political situation, the Israeli enjoys the privilege of moving freely in and out of the political situation (subject to the limits of military service). People who want to protest the injustice of the occupation protest, those who want to go on vacation go on vacation. The Palestinian, in contrast, can’t take a break from the political prison he’s submerged in. It’s the Green Line that has enabled this split for the Israelis. </p> \n<p>The fight that Netanyahu has waged against a Palestinian state for decades, his attempts to undermine the very possibility of dividing the land into two states and the avarice for land in the West Bank’s Area C fuel an aspiration to erase the Green Line. But Netanyahu and supporters of annexation don’t understand that without the Green Line – even if it’s imaginary, marking the eventual option of a separation into two states – it will no longer be possible to divide the Israeli consciousness. </p> \n<p>The political narrative that preserves the Green Line is the one of occupation, and the solution that comes with it is the two-state one, precisely the narrative that the Israeli right seeks to bury. </p> \n<p>Habayit Hayehudi chief Naftali Bennett often says, “We changed the discourse from two states to imposing sovereignty.” But he doesn’t understand that this change only means that the discourse criticizing Israel has been diverted from “Israeli occupation” to “Israeli apartheid.” Maybe a people can’t conquer its own land – as Bennett and the right like to argue – but it surely can impose an apartheid regime in its own territory. Israelis won’t be able to escape the Israeli apartheid in their consciousness. </p> \n<p>Only the occupation discourse manages to preserve the distinction between Israel and the occupied territories, between the reality in Israel and the reality in the territories. It’s no coincidence that the line also divides what is still somehow considered legitimate resistance – a boycott against settlement products – and what is illegitimate – a boycott of Israel as the BDS movement does it. </p> \n<p>But the right doesn’t get that the distinction between Israel and the territories has been its most effective tool to continue the occupation because it has let it preserve in its consciousness the two-state solution on the diplomatic horizon. </p> \n<p>Without Israelis’ self-image as democrats, the game of “being sour and flying off, complaining and going shopping” is over. Without it, members of the opposition would have no choice but to force political change, or – if they can – leave Israel, or at least save their children. </p> \n<p>Teenager Ahed Tamimi told The Guardian after her release from prison that she’s “not the victim of the occupation. The Jew or the settler child who carries a rifle at the age of 15, they are the victims of the occupation,” the brave girl explained. “For me, I am capable of distinguishing between right and wrong. But not him. His view is clouded. His heart is filled with hatred and scorn against the Palestinians. He is the victim, not me.” </p> \n<p>Golda Meir allegedly once said, “We will perhaps in time be able to forgive the Arabs for killing our sons, but it will be harder for us to forgive them for having forced us to kill their sons.” </p> \n<p>This quote has become prophetic. Tamimi’s statement casts a different light on that comment. “The experience of being arrested was really hard,” she said of her eight months in prison. But she added that this experience “added value to my life.” It’s interesting to consider which feeling of value Israelis around Tamimi’s age have.</p>",

And those times the situation wasn’t very different: Benjamin Netanyahu was prime minister, the occupation was decades long and there were sporadic exchanges of fire between the sides.</p> \n<p>Moreover, two of the DJs spearheading the struggle on the nightlife scene regarding Mideast politics – the Black Madonna and Anthony Naples – have been here, enjoyed themselves, been honored and promised to return, until they discovered there’s such a thing as the occupation.</p> \n<p>Americans and Brits cancel more</p> \n<p>So what has changed since 2015? First, there has been a change on the Gaza border, with civilians getting shot. These incidents have multiplied in the past three months and don’t exactly photograph well.</p> \n<p>Second, news reports about the nation-state law and the discrimination that comes with it have done their bit. Third, the arrests and detentions of left-wing activists entering Israel haven’t remained in a vacuum.</p> \n<p>Fourth, and most importantly, is Donald Trump’s presidency and his unconditional embrace of Netanyahu, including, of course, the controversial opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. As in the case of Natalie Portman's refusal to accept a prize from the state, the closeness between the Trump administration and the Netanyahu government – under the sponsorship of evangelical Christians – has made Israel a country non grata in the liberal community, of which Hollywood is one pole and nightlife the other.</p> \n<p>It’s no coincidence that the DJs canceling are either Americans or Brits on the left; that is, Democrats or Jeremy Corbyn supporters in Labour – people who see cooperation with Israel as collaboration with Trump and Britain’s Conservative government.</p> \n<p>Different from them is Honey Dijon, the black trans DJ from Chicago who in response to the protest against her appearance at the Meteor Festival tweeted: “All of you people criticizing me about playing in Israel, when you come to America and stand up for the murder of black trans women and the prison industrial complex of black men then we can debate. I play for people not governments.” Not many people tried to argue with her. Say what you will, contrarianism is always effective.</p> \n<p>The case of&nbsp;DJ Jackmaster</p> \n<p>Beyond the issue of values, at the image level, alleged collaboration can be a career killer, just as declaring a boycott is the last word in chic for your image nowadays. That’s exactly what has happened with Scotland’s DJ Jackmaster, who has gone viral with his eventual refusal to perform at Tel Aviv’s Block club. He posted a picture of the Palestinian flag with a caption saying you have to exploit a platform in order to stand up for those who need it. The flood of responses included talk about boycotting all Tel Aviv, not just the Block.</p> \n<p>Yaron Trax is the owner of the Block; his club is considered not only the largest and most influential venue in town but also an international brand. Trax didn’t remain silent; on his personal Facebook account he mentioned how a few weeks before Jackmaster’s post his agent was still trying to secure the gig for him at the Block.</p> \n<p>“Not my finest hour, but calling for a boycott of my club at a time when an artist is trying to play there felt to me like crossing a line,” Trax says. “Only after the fact, and especially when I saw how his post was attracting dozens of hurtful, belligerent and racist responses – and generating a violent discourse that I oppose – did I realize how significant it was.”</p> \n<p>Trax talks about the hatred that has welled up in support of Jackmaster’s Israel boycott – just between us, not the sharpest tool in the shed and someone who has recently been accused of sexual harassment. As Trax puts it, “The next day it was important to me to admonish myself, first off, and then all those who chose to respond the way they responded.”</p> \n<p>In a further well-reasoned post, Trax wrote, “I have always thought that people who take a risk and use the platform that is given to them to transmit a message they believe in, especially one that isn’t popular, deserve admiration and not intimidation or silencing.” Unsurprisingly, the reactions to this message were mostly positive.</p> \n<p>'We don’t endorse Netanyahu any more than Trump'</p> \n<p>Notwithstanding the boycotters who have acceded to the demands of Roger Waters and Brian Eno – the most prominent musicians linked to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement – there are plenty of superstar musicians like Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake and the Rolling Stones who have come to Israel as part of their concert tours, even though they suffered the same pressures. The performers most vocal about their decision to appear in Israel have been Radiohead and Nick Cave.</p> \n<p>At a press conference on the eve of his concert, Cave expressed his opinion on the demand to boycott Israel: “It suddenly became very important to make a stand, to me, against those people who are trying to shut down musicians, to bully musicians, to censor musicians and to silence musicians.”</p> \n<p>Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke took the message one step further and tweeted: “Playing in a country isn’t the same as endorsing its government. We’ve played in Israel for over 20 years through a succession of governments, some more liberal than others. As we have in America. We don’t endorse Netanyahu any more than Trump, but we still play in America.” As Yorke put it, music, art and academia are “about crossing borders, not building them.”</p> \n<p>There’s a lot of truth in Yorke’s declaration, but whether or not musicians like it, appearances in Israel tend to acquire a political dimension; any statement becomes a potential international incident. Thus, for example, after Radiohead’s statement, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan saluted the band, and after Cave’s press conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon tweeted “Bravo Nick Cave!”</p> \n<p>The trend continues when we step down a league from the A-listers, like Beyonc&eacute;, who doesn’t intend to perform in Israel despite her annual declaration that she’ll come “next year.” There’s the second level, the cream of international alternative rock and pop – refusals to appear in Israel by bands “of good conscience” like the Knife, Grizzly Bear, Arcade Fire and Deerhunter.</p> \n<p>The most prominent voice from this territory is that of former Sonic Youth guitarist and vocalist Thurston Moore. Yes, he appeared with his band in Tel Aviv 23 years ago, but since then he has become an avid supporter of BDS, so much so that he says it’s not okay to eat hummus because it’s a product of the occupation.</p> \n<p>'Apartheid state'</p> \n<p>At the next level of refusers are the major – and minor – hip-hop stars. In addition to Lil Yachty and Tyler, who canceled appearances, other heroes of the genre like Kendrick Lamar, Chance the Rapper and Vince Staples have refused from the outset to accept invitations to Israel. It’s quite possible that the connection between BDS and Black Lives Matter is influential. As early as 2016, Black Lives Matter published a statement supporting BDS and declaring Israel an “apartheid state.”</p> \n<p>Which brings us to electronic music and the cultural phenomenon that goes with it – the club culture. In numerical terms, club culture is smaller, but the information that flows from it on the ground or online flows much faster.</p> \n<p>Moreover, not only is club culture more sensitive to changes and far more alert to ideas and technological advances, its history is marked by struggles by oppressed groups. It can be said that African-Americans, Hispanics and gay people were the first to adopt the “night” way of life, back in the days of New York’s clubs and underground parties in the ‘70s. Accordingly, these groups have been the ones to nurture this lifestyle into today’s popular culture. Hence also the association with movements like BDS.</p> \n<p>Boiler Room Palestine</p> \n<p>Indeed, the current trend points to a step-up in the discourse; in the past year the top alternative culture magazines – of which the electronic music magazines play a key role – have published articles surveying musical and cultural happenings in Palestinian society.</p> \n<p>The online music magazine Resident Advisor has had two such stories, the first about a workshop for artists with the participation of the Block 9 production team, musicians Brian Eno and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Murphy (formerly of Moloko) and American DJ the Black Madonna. The workshop, which included tours, discussion groups and joint musical work, was held at the Walled Off Hotel in Ramallah, also known as Banksy’s hotel because of the street artist’s involvement in its planning in the shadow of the separation barrier.</p> \n<p>The second article surveyed the Palestinian electronic scene and its leading players – promoters, DJs and producers who are operating despite the restrictive military regime. In addition, the writer accompanied the production of Boiler Room Palestine in Ramallah in June. (The wider Boiler Room franchise has been the world’s most popular pop party for the past five years.)</p> \n<p>Another example includes the style magazine Dazed, which wrote about the cultural boycott movement immediately after the cancellation of Lorde’s concert, and just last month New York Magazine’s culture supplement Vulture set forth its philosophy on the boycott (also in the context of Lana Del Rey). It predicted that the awakening we’re seeing today is only in its infancy.</p> \n<p>This partial list isn’t a clear declaration about “taking a stance” – after all, progressive media outlets in culture laud Israeli artists (for example Red Axes, Moscoman and Guy Gerber) or local venues, like the Block club. But if you add to these the scores of Facebook battles or Twitter discussions (like the one Del Rey found herself in), you’ll get noise. And noise generates questions, which generate more noise and raise consciousness. And from there to change on the ground is a modest distance.</p> \n<p>'These are people who slept on my sofa'</p> \n<p>Refusals of invitations or cancellations of concerts in Israel by artists didn’t begin with BDS or the increasing volume of the past two years. After all, a visit to Israel all too often requires an intrusive security check. It’s hard to complain about a DJ who isn’t keen to have his underwear probed.</p> \n<p>Also, there’s a stratum of artists who’ve appeared in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem or Haifa and have decided to stop coming – unless there’s a Palestinian production. Two examples are the French band Acid Arab (Parisians Guido Minisky and Herv&eacute; Carvalho) and the American producer – and darling of the hipster community – Nicolas Jaar. Jaar appeared in Tel Aviv a bit under a decade ago, just before he became a star, while Acid Arab not only performed in Tel Aviv but was also involved in projects with Israeli musicians – so plenty of people called the duo hypocrites.</p> \n<p>“I have no problem with strong opinions, but in the case of Acid Arab it annoyed me at the personal level – these are people who slept on my sofa, recorded with local musicians, and the day they put up their post announcing they wouldn’t play in Tel Aviv, they also asked me to send them some music,” says Maor Anava, aka DJ Hectik.</p> \n<p>“I have no problem with people changing their minds on the go; it’s clear to me that a visit to the separation fence can do it, but what bothered me is that it’s entirely a PR and image move, apparently at the advice of their agent,” he adds.</p> \n<p>“We’ve reached a situation in which a boycott of Israel is the trendiest thing and situates you in the right place in the scene – as a supporter of the Palestinian freedom fighters against the terrible Zionist occupier, something that can get you to another three big festivals. If you performed in Tel Aviv, apparently they’d do without you.”</p> \n<p>Thus at the end of last year, Acid Arab and Nicolas Jaar appeared in Haifa and Ramallah at parties produced by Jazar Crew, the only electronic collective in Israel that isn’t afraid to mix in politics. So it surprised no one when Jazar received laudatory – and justified – coverage not only in Bar Peleg’s Haaretz piece but also in Resident Advisor.</p> \n<p>Is the party over?</p> \n<p>So are we seeing the onset of the electronic boycott of Tel Aviv, one of the world’s clubbing capitals? Well, the city is still a flourishing center of parties and club events every week. “As of today it hasn’t yet happened that we’ve directly encountered an attempt by the cultural boycott to influence artists who are slated to appear at the club,” Trax says.</p> \n<p>“But we’re definitely seeing a change in the surrounding behavior. Nasty responses that people are leaving for a DJ who announced an upcoming gig with us have led to fewer famous DJs announcing appearances at the Block – even those who always promote themselves.”</p> \n<p>He notes a slowdown in the past two years. “A number of DJs who used to appear with us – Moodymann, Kyle Hall, the Martinez Brothers – have announced they won’t be returning,” Trax says, referring to three American acts. “But there isn’t any set reason why. If the cultural boycott has an influence here I wouldn’t be surprised, because the Detroit junta is very political. And this also applies to UFO,” a successful British DJ and a high-profile voice in the European underground arena.</p> \n<p>Not all DJs who have chosen not to come to Israel have taken their stance amid the strengthening of the BDS movement. Some of the top people in the dance industry – including star Chilean-German DJ Ricardo Villalobos and British DJs and producers like Matthew Herbert and Andrew Weatherall – have for years been refusing to spin in Israel. They’ve made clear that this is their way of opposing Israel’s activities in the territories.</p> \n<p>Another great DJ, Tunisian-born Loco Dice who lives in Germany, is also considered a vocal opponent of Israel. But in December he played at the Block, and Trax doesn’t recall any signs that his guest was hostile to the country. This shows that a change of awareness works both ways.</p> \n<p>There’s a similar story: the decision by DJ Tama Sumo of the Berghain club in Berlin to play in Israel after a long boycott. She and her partner DJ Lakuti, a pillar of the industry, donated the proceeds of her Tel Aviv set to an organization for human rights in the territories.</p> \n<p>“As of now I don’t feel that the names who have decided to stop coming will change anything regarding the Block, because our lineup of VIPs isn’t based on them,” Trax says. “But if the more commercial cream of the clubs – DJs like Dixon, Ame and Damian Lazarus, or the big names in techno like Nina Kraviz, Ben Klock, Jeff Mills or Adam Beyer – change their minds, that will be a real blow to us, and not just us.”</p> \n<p>Amotz Tokatly, who’s responsible for bringing DJs to Tel Aviv’s Beit Maariv club, isn’t feeling much of a change. “The cancellations or refusals by DJs and artists based on a political platform didn’t begin just this year. I’ve been encountering this for many years now. There are even specific countries where we know the prevailing mood is political and tending toward the boycott movement. For example England. The rhetoric there is a priori much stronger,” Tokatly says.</p> \n<p>“But take Ben UFO, who has played in Tel Aviv in the past. When we got back to him about another spinning gig his agent said explicitly, ‘It simply isn’t worth it for him from a public relations perspective, and it could hurt him later on.’ DJs like him make their own calculations.”</p> \n<p>Tokatly doesn’t believe in a “Meteor effect” that will send the visiting DJ economy to the brink of an abyss. “I’m giving it a few weeks to calm down, and in the worst case we won’t be seeing here the level of minor league DJs who have canceled due to the circumstances,” he says.</p> \n<p>“In any case, they’re names who would have come here – if at all – once a year. Regarding artists who have a long-term and stable relationship with the local scene, we haven’t seen any change in approach yet.”</p> \n<p>Unlike Trax and Tokatly, Doron “Charly” Mastey of the techno duo TV.OUT and content director at Tel Aviv’s Alphabet Club says the recent goings-on haven’t affected him too much; his club is unusual in that doesn’t base itself on names from abroad.</p> \n<p>“I don’t remember any case of a refusal or cancellation because of political leanings,” he says. “But with everything that’s happening now regarding Meteor, and if that affects the scene down the road and the airlift to Tel Aviv stops, I’m not at all sure that’s a bad thing.”</p> \n<p>Mastey has in mind the gap between the size of the audience and the number of events, parties and festivals happening in Israel right now. “The audience is tired, and indifferent,” he says. “And if this kick in the pants – of cancellations – is what's going to dismantle the scene in its current format, then it will simply rebuild itself. I hope in a way that’s healthier for everyone.”</p> \n<p>In any case, if the rest of the world has realized that it's impossible to separate politics from anything, and definitely not from club culture, which&nbsp; started out as a political and social movement, then the best thing we can do is try to hold the discussion in an inclusive a way as possible. An Israeli DJ working in Berlin who requested anonymity thinks that these ideas should be taken one step further.</p> \n<p>“Nowadays, for artists who want to go to Israel, two proposals are on the table,” he says. “Support the boycott or support the occupation. These two things are depicted even if they aren’t accurate, and between the two options there are a thousand more levels.”</p> \n<p>He believes there is scope for taking action. “The local scene must know how to fill the vacuum and craft alternatives to the boycott’s demands,” he says. “For example, by showing artists other ways to take a stand, whether by cooperating with Palestinians or suggesting that they donate the proceeds of their Tel Aviv appearances to a human rights group.”</p> \n<p>The voices calling for a cultural boycott of Israel, whether in sports, concerts or the subfield of electronic music, aren’t going to disappear. If anything, they’re only going to grow louder.</p> \n<p>Moreover, if we take into account the complexity of the conflict, maybe we should seek to communicate these insights in a way that drops the imagery of absolutes like left-right, bad-good, Zionist-anti-Semitic. The club culture exists to connect extremes, not separate people. Our demand to continue a vibrant electronic scene is just as legitimate as that of the boycott supporters’ attempts to create awareness.</p> \n<p>Even if we don’t agree with the idea of the boycott, it’s still possible to accept the realization that there are people who think differently – who want to perform for the other side as much as they want to perform for us. This doesn’t make them an existential danger.</p> \n<p>Moreover, as the Israeli DJ working in Berlin says, the Israeli scene needs an arsenal of proposals for constructive activism; it must provide alternatives to the BDS call to boycott – and not automatically flex an insulted patriotic muscle. This might not be the easiest thing to do, but hey, this is Israel. It’s not going to be easy.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Our high-school Bible teacher once said proudly that, by begetting monotheistic faith, Judaism has, more than any other religion in history, enabled the human race to make progress. The argument struck me as peculiar. The students in the class were secular, nor was the Bible teacher religiously observant – he was secular and a socialist, a member of the left-wing Hashomer Hatzair movement. It followed that he didn’t believe in the existence of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob – at least not in the way the deity is described in the Bible.</p> \n<p>One student asked the teacher what it is that makes one mistaken belief – in the existence of a single God – preferable to another mistaken belief: in the existence of many gods. The teacher replied that it was self-evident that monotheism constitutes “tremendous progress,” as compared with the pagan religions, and that it was a vital stage in the development of reason and morality. He didn’t explain why.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;When God wasn't so great: What Yahweh’s first appearance tells about early Judaism</p> \n<p>The teacher’s approach wasn’t exceptional. The assumption that monotheism is more highly developed than polytheism is a widespread convention, which to many needs no proof. The term “idol worshipers” often evinces a supercilious or patronizing attitude, as if it refers to an organism that failed to develop. But why is this so? It’s frequently claimed that monotheism is more abstract, hence more rational. According to this approach, it is more logical to believe in one God, who sees but is not seen, than in many gods that possess passions and weaknesses, and in some cases assume the form of monkeys or elephants. Be that as it may, most of the monotheistic religions contain an element of private providence: We pray, and we hope that God will take pity on us and grant our supplications. This is just one of the forms in which the figure of the exclusive God assumes material form.</p> \n<p>An equally widespread claim is that monotheism is more moral, because it’s universal. According to this approach, Jews, Christians and Muslims all turn to God – one God who oversees the whole world, not separate gods for every nation or group. All human beings are equal before the one God. Belief in a universal God constitutes a necessary condition for universal morality and the development of the concept of the rights of man, who was created in the image of God.</p> \n<p>Widespread as this viewpoint is, some nevertheless doubt its validity. Indeed, there are critics who allege that monotheism is the source of many of the world’s ills. One of the fiercest critiques of monotheism in our time was put forward by the German scholar Jan Assmann in his books “Moses the Egyptian” (1998), “The Price of Monotheism” (2009) and “The Invention of Religion: Faith and Covenant in the Book of Exodus,” published this year in English. Assmann’s ideas have generated a furor in Germany and elsewhere, raising once more the question of the moral consequences of monotheism.</p> \n<p>Assmann is one of the world’s leading Egyptologists, and his books deal with complex aspects of ancient Egyptian religion and culture. His most influential postulate concerns monotheism’s association with fanaticism and violence. In Assmann’s view, before the birth of monotheism, every city or kingdom had its own gods, but there were no religions that repudiated other religions. When a Greek from Athens visited another city, he made a sacrifice to the local gods. Even Alexander the Great did not eradicate the rituals of the cities he took. After conquering Egypt, he made a sacrifice to the local god Amon, who was identified as the likeness of the Greek god Zeus. Although there were many wars in the ancient world, there were none over the question of religion, and there was no religious persecution. On the contrary, religions formed a bridge between peoples, cultures and languages. The gods were international and belonged to everyone.</p> \n<p>According to Assmann, only monotheism gave rise to the distinction between a “true religion” and a “false religion,” between worship of the true God and of false gods. Every monotheistic religion or religious group maintained that members of other faiths were heretics deserving of conversion, enslavement or annihilation. Hence, the emergence of the first monotheistic faith is bound up with persecution and with the invalidation of other religions. In practice, the founding of monotheism is accompanied by the destruction of temples and massacres of the adherents of the “false religions” – the seven peoples of Canaan, for example.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;How the Jews invented God, and made him great</p> \n<p>The publication of Assmann’s thesis stirred even sharper criticism of the biblical heritage of monotheism, notably in “In the Shadow of Mount Sinai,” a 2013 book by Peter Sloterdijk, one of the most influential German philosophers of our time. According to Sloterdijk, along with receiving the Ten Commandments, at Mount Sinai humanity was endowed with the ruinous idea of an exclusive covenant between God and one lone people. Religious fanaticism, he argues, broke out in the form of a violent spectacle shortly after the Ten Commandments were given, in the horrific massacre that Moses and his followers perpetrated against Israelites who worshiped the Golden Calf. Indeed, Sloterdijk argues that even if that slaughter never took place, and even if the Bible is a fictitious tale, the violent code was transmitted through Judaism to the other monotheistic faiths, Christianity and Islam. For this reason we are all now living “in the shadow of Mount Sinai,” and that shadow casts a pall on humanity’s future.</p> \n<p>Divine monogamy</p> \n<p>The arguments that disparage the zealousness inherent in a belief in one God are quite persuasive, and are bolstered by additional claims. For example, in recent years, it has been argued that monotheism is also responsible for modern man’s destructive approach to nature – given that the pagan religions do not posit a hierarchy among humans, animals, plants and the forces of nature around them.</p> \n<p>What is less clear, however, is whether the biblical religion is actually consistent with monotheism. Assmann himself maintained that monotheism and the violence entailed in rejecting “false religions” were in fact invented long before the period depicted in the Book of Exodus, by the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten. He fomented an unprecedented religious revolution in Egypt, in which many temples were razed. Accordingly, many scholars view Akhenaten, and not Moses, as the first monotheist.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, throughout most of the Scriptures, it is not actually stated that there are no gods other than the God of Israel. The Israelites are enjoined not to worship other gods, but the text does not express a firm position about the existence of such deities as the Canaanite Ashtoreth, the Philistine Dagon or the Moabite Chemosh. Some even maintain that what the Bible actually recounts is the war of the God of Israel against his enemies, the other gods, with the help of his people.</p> \n<p>Assmann, too, in his latest book, argues that a monotheism denying the existence of other gods appears only in the later Prophets. In contrast, the principal component of the religion of the ancient Israelites is an emotional connection to God, based on loyalty. Thus, the principal metaphor of belief in other gods is adultery, betrayal of the covenant with God. The central message of the Bible, then, is not monotheism, but monogamy. At least in its divine version.</p>",

        "text":["<p>By chance, the timing of my call was good.</p> \n<p>Indeed. I’ve just returned from a sabbatical in New York. I taught at Columbia and took part in a research group on inequality – specifically, in my case, carbon inequality. Actually, what most interests me is mapping carbon dioxide emissions for different strata of the population. Within the framework of my research, I focused on the wealthiest people, in the very highest percentile.</p> \n<p>What did you discover?</p> \n<p>The bit of information that I like most came from a woman who manages an agency in Monaco harbor. Her agency prepares the yachts that belong to world’s richest people, which anchor there ahead of their cruises – from maintenance of the engine to whatever capricious thing the owners may want.</p> \n<p>What did she tell you?</p> \n<p>One evening this woman gets a phone call from the personal secretary of an oligarch’s daughter. It turns out that the family had landed just a few minutes earlier, and when they got to the yacht the oligarch’s daughter discovered she’d forgotten her baby intercom at home in Moscow. No problem, the woman tells the secretary, I’ll send someone to buy a new intercom; in a quarter of an hour it’ll be with you on the yacht. No, the secretary replies, the lady doesn’t want a replacement, she wants the original from Moscow.</p> \n<p>The poor baby.</p> \n<p>So what do you think happened? The private plane that had just landed flew back to Moscow. Three-and-a-half hours each way. An emission of 49 tons of carbon dioxide just to bring the intercom.</p> \n<p>What are the implications of that story? Can you rate it according to some sort of scale?</p> \n<p>The average Israeli citizen is responsible for the emission of 11 tons a year. That includes everything. His flights. His home. His car. Everything.</p> \n<p>Is that considered high or low, relative to the rest of the world?</p> \n<p>It falls on the average-high side for an industrialized country. Higher than most countries in Europe, where public transportation and energy conservation are more developed. In short, in one night, the oligarch’s daughter had the impact that the average Israeli generates over five years. That’s actually the whole story in a nutshell.</p> \n<p>We started from the end. Now it’s almost superfluous to ask what climatic injustice is.</p> \n<p>Climatic injustice takes two forms. First there is the exposure side – namely, how vulnerable we are to the effects of climate change. Of course people who live in undeveloped and desert countries are far more vulnerable to temperature increases, water distress, rising food prices, etc., than affluent people living in developed countries. I deal with the second half of the equation: Who contributes most to climate change.</p> \n<p>The equation is clear from that perspective: Rich people contribute more, the poor less. Significantly.</p> \n<p>By rough estimate, about half the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere stem from the electricty production by power stations. Another one-quarter comes from transportation and the rest from industry. Since Third World countries are obviously less industrialized, they also cause less pollution. Moreover, their industrialization process got underway much later than in the countries in northern and western Europe and in North America, which have been industrialized for 200 years.</p> \n<p>And at the same time the stronger countries have relocated most of their production to the undeveloped countries. The contribution of China to the level of greenhouse gases around the globe, which is more than Europe and North America combined, doesn’t stem only from consumption by the Chinese themselves.</p> \n<p>China today produces the largest quantity of greenhouse gases. A considerable proportion of that is due to the fact that the whole [developed] world is exporting its industries to China. Most of the studies that deal with the subject draw a comparison between countries, but because I come from the fields of sociology and anthropology, my research deals with a comparison within countries. I actually want to show that the rich contribute a great deal more to the climate crisis, yet the likelihood they will survive it and not have to pay a price for their actions, is far greater. That’s true both within states and between states.</p> \n<p>Cancer from someone else’s cigarettes</p> \n<p>I recently happened across a good illustration of that principle: metaphorically, it’s like someone who stands next to a heavy smoker and gets lung cancer.</p> \n<p>I would add – he’s also the one who paid for the cigarettes. One of the Indian representatives at a climate conference a few years ago said that the “cake” of industrialization is being eaten in the Northern Hemisphere, but the stomachaches remain in the South.</p> \n<p>Perhaps you can elaborate.</p> \n<p>We’re all familiar with the term “carbon footprint.” The more we consume, the larger our carbon footprint. So that even if we said that in Israel the average is 11 tons a year, that’s actually the result of an averaging of the people belonging to the lower percentiles – who consume less, who don’t own a car and whose annual emission ranges between three and four tons – and the wealthy populations, who live in spacious homes and maintain fleets of vehicles and private planes, etc.</p> \n<p>A few years ago, we checked the disparity between the lowest and highest percentiles in Israel in three realms: automobile travel, electricity usage and food consumption. In regard to vehicles and electricity, the rich contribute 27 times as much as the poor to the greenhouse effect. In food it’s only twice as much, simply because there’s a limit to how much food one can consume.</p> \n<p>But that’s obvious, isn’t it? Carbon inequality is simply another derivative of socioeconomic inequality, disparity and polarization. That’s the system.</p> \n<p>The system also encourages those who can afford it to consume ever more without placing obstacles in their way. For example, Israel does not levy a carbon tax, which in the view of some is the only thing that might save us. Technologically, it’s possible to keep track of how much carbon dioxide each of us emits. To illustrate: Our car can be linked to a mechanism that monitors the amounts of fuel and frequency of use, and we can be asked to pay more if we deviate from the average. But that won’t happen, because it conflicts with the neoliberal rationale, whereby people are encouraged to consume as much as they can.</p> \n<p>Have you ever stopped to think why politicians don’t like to be identified with economizing? Why they prefer to have a dancer serve as the face of a campaign to save water [a reference to an Israel Water Authority commercial], even though it’s an excellent opportunity for a public figure to get personal exposure? In a neoliberal regime, where over-consumption is the ideal, no one gets elected because he introduced a regimen of austerity, rationing or taxation. Just the opposite.</p> \n<p>The pattern of usage of public resources also conforms to that approach.</p> \n<p>That’s privatization. When you transfer a natural resource to private hands, any prospect of restraint ends, because from the outset the interest of the private body – to make as much money as possible in as short a time as possible – conflicts with environmental thinking and a desire to conserve the resource. Neoliberal logic opts for money, and to hell with the resource.</p> \n<p>Did someone mention the Dead Sea?</p> \n<p>We could mention many other things. Among them the ability of the atmosphere to retain carbon dioxide. What is actually happening in terms of climate change? We are compressing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it can break down, so its only recourse is to store it – like the body stores fat.</p> \n<p>The point is that countries themselves lack the ability – and also, in fact, the desire – to change the situation. James Hansen, a former NASA climate scientist, maintains that the whole political system around the world is tainted by bribery and that the only way to effect change is through the courts.</p> \n<p>I think that the American legal system is more reliable in this respect than that in other countries. Hansen is indeed one of the pioneers in the field. His Senate testimony about global warming, in June 1988, was the trigger for the debate about the climate. Until then the subject wasn’t even on the table. But 30 years ago, Hansen both asserted that there is such a thing [as climate change] and also predicted many of the phenomena we’re seeing today. He started out as a climate scientist, and went through a process that I’ve seen among many such scientists in the past few years. They understand that, however brilliant and comprehensive and deep they are in their research, the real problem, ultimately, is political. And that, by the way, is what also encouraged me to deal with this subject.</p> \n<p>What is actually the connection between anthropology and sociology, on the one hand, and climate? We are simply being drawn into this discussion by the scientists themselves, because they understand that their knowledge in engineering, technology or physics isn’t enough. They need to know how to cope with such rigid and self-interested structures.</p> \n<p>‘Worrisome prognoses’</p> \n<p>That’s exactly Hansen’s argument: that only a judicial system can allow itself to be untainted. Because various states, in his formulation, are caught in the pincers of capital and vested interests. Does anyone believe that U.S. President Donald Trump, say, will tell Shell Oil that they need to earn less, for the sake of our children?</p> \n<p>Let’s look at it briefly from the point of view of the big energy corporations. It’s a very complex story for them. They invest trillions in acquiring franchises, in production, transportation, storage and in marketing types of energy, particularly petroleum, gas and coal, and we know that coal is harmful. If we take the revolution to them, we are effectively saying: Bury all your business plans. That’s a result that is absolutely untenable for them. So the smart American president who intends to spearhead change will have to find other ways – which do exist – such as taxation and various incentives, to help them make the transition. To take their vast profits and invest them in alternative energy.</p> \n<p>Fine, we’ll wait for a smart American president and we’ll see.</p> \n<p>Take George W. Bush, for example. He will always be remembered for the first five years of his presidency, during which he was a declared climate-change denier. Officials in the administration were instructed regularly to censor scientific reports published by NASA and others, in order to moderate the worrisome prognoses about global warming, and especially the effect of emissions whose source was the energy and automobile industries, among others. But in his last years in office, the messages that came from him were toned down. Some people attribute this to the insurance lobby, which at that time started to show signs of anxiety because of the anticipated damage, mainly from agriculture and the food industry, and because of the greater frequency and intensity of tropical storms. The situation was aggravated after Hurricane Katrina and the tremendous damage in New Orleans.</p> \n<p>So you say that what can actually tip the scales is a powerful interest in the other direction?</p> \n<p>That too. In Europe, for example, the thrust toward [addressing climate] change didn’t happen because of vested interests, but because of decency and because they listen to scientists. In China, too, this change is starting for completely different reasons – because the Chinese public, which is seeing with its own eyes the effect of air pollution, is pushing for change. I’m optimistic, and not necessarily because I know the exact route by which salvation will come in every place. It comes for different reasons in different countries, but it can come.</p> \n<p>Let’s return for a moment to the social gaps and to the way they were manifested in New Orleans after the disaster there in 2005. Wealthy people fled ahead of time, and the poor were left to wave at rescue teams from the rooftops.</p> \n<p>There are a number of countries that particularly excel in this matter of inequality. Israel is always high up in the charts, especially during the past two decades.</p> \n<p>But in the case of Israel, the state itself is strong. Let’s say that tomorrow 30 percent of its territory turns into an arid desert. The state could cover for that, and assist its citizenry; whereas the same development could cause the total collapse of, say, the Central African Republic.</p> \n<p>A nondeveloped country has no capacity to cope with natural disasters. That already raises more complex questions, concrete moral ones, about the scope of the solidarity and mutual surety that the human race owes itself, and about whether the stronger countries need to be guarantors of the weaker countries – or whether, as the right wing claimed long before Trump, not only are we not required to help the weak and the poor, but we absolutely must not help them, because that creates more and more of the weak.</p> \n<p>This relates to another phenomenon that’s connected to climate inequality: climate migrants. It’s estimated that there will be millions of these migrants in the coming decades. If we take as an example the Syrian refugee crisis, which is on a far lesser scale quantitatively, it’s likely that the strong countries will shut their gates.</p> \n<p>Of course. Not everyone is [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel.</p> \n<p>How do we know that we’ve reached the point at which a certain place becomes unfit for human habitation?</p> \n<p>The inhabitants themselves know. In southern Bangladesh, for example, tens of millions of people live in a region below sea level that is very vulnerable, obviously, to a rise in the water level. Groundwater salinization along the coast has already begun, but the farmers who live there obviously will know precisely when their wells have become unusable, when they no longer have water for irrigation. Similarly, we can look at the situation in Syria. The civil war in Syria began in 2011, but during the five years preceding that, beginning in 2006, Syria underwent the worst drought in its history.</p> \n<p>Yes, I know the hypothesis that draws a connection between the drought and the war.</p> \n<p>What’s happened in Syria is that, in the wake of the drought, farmers started to migrate to urban centers. Even before that, there was already tremendous domestic tension in the country between different communities, and in the wake of the migration, which forced different groups to live together, there were clashes and great unrest that effectively constituted the trigger for the civil war. The demographic balances and the balance of power changed, the government couldn’t cope, and a civil war began.</p> \n<p>That’s an especially interesting aspect of climate change, the way it exacerbates the war of existence. What happens in an undeveloped country where tremendous internal tension exists – such as, let’s say, in most of the countries in Africa – when the “pie” of resources, which is small from the start, becomes even smaller?</p> \n<p>What happens is, you get Darfurians in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Explain.</p> \n<p>We started hearing about the Horn of Africa only at the end of the 1990s. But if we look back earlier, the region underwent accelerated desertification in the 1980s, and the ability to sustain agriculture decreased dramatically. Because of climate change, naturally, production constantly fell. That by itself didn’t yet prompt the Darfurians to undertake their biblical journeys by foot to Tel Aviv. But the greater the distress became, the more ethnic identity played a role in subsistence and survival. What actually aggravated and heightened the internal tensions in Darfur was the generous aid that came from Europe.</p> \n<p>How?</p> \n<p>Because that aid arrived in the form of food dropped from planes. Of course, it’s a lot easier to seize by force a food shipment that’s been airlifted in, than it is to try to grow crops in parched fields. The friction between ethnic groups constantly increased, until civil war erupted and drove tens and hundreds of thousands to flee the country. Naturally, I don’t contend that there was some sort of clear, unidirectional trend here, that started with climate change and ended with Sudanese and Darfurians in Tel Aviv. There is a certain butterfly-effect element here. But there’s no doubt that these processes nourish each other: warming, desertification, distress, hunger, ethnic rifts, civil wars, waves of refugees.</p> \n<p>The refugees who arrived in Israel don’t term themselves climate migrants or environmental migrants, but rather political refugees, and that’s correct, but there’s no doubt that amid all this tumult there is also a significant and even decisive environmental element, in the wake of which they were compelled to leave their country. If we think in depth about climate change, we have to take into account all the catastrophes that are on the way. Whole populations that will be uprooted and become nomadic, possibly even becoming extinct.</p> \n<p>This is all very depressing.</p> \n<p>I know.</p> \n<p>How do you live with it?</p> \n<p>I am a generally optimistic and positive person, and I somehow manage to make the separation. In the first 20 years of my academic career, I dealt with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> \n<p>And then you came to the conclusion that that was not depressing enough?</p> \n<p>And then I switched to an even more depressing topic. I can’t really understand why I did it.</p> \n<p>Maybe you enjoy problems that no one else is really interested in solving.</p> \n<p>I think that we don’t need to think about a [single] solution. If we think about a solution [that succeeds or fails, one or the other], it will become binary: solution-no solution.</p> \n<p>There is a solution, but it runs contrary to every immediate interest.</p> \n<p>True, but even so, some countries are aiming for it. Britain and Germany, for example, are doing amazing things, even though the problem is vast and supposedly insoluble. They reduced the amount of their carbon dioxide emissions by dozens of percentage points compared to the 1990s. So apparently it is possible.</p> \n<p>It’s possible, but will it happen? The bottom line is that the quantity of emissions is only increasing.</p> \n<p>I can’t say that’s what will happen. The fact is that in certain countries things are happening. The more significant thing is the rate of improvement versus the inertia of destruction. There are two poles here that are behaving differently. Globally, the amount of carbon dioxide that continues to be compressed into the atmosphere is still increasing. On the other hand, in some countries it’s on a decline.</p> \n<p>Let me guess – in Scandinavia.</p> \n<p>Right. But that’s not to say that in other countries the situation is fixed, and can’t change. There’s already a group of 30 countries that are cutting down. That’s cause for great hope and it also gives rise to working models. By means of legislation, regulation, through what people know how to do – for the same reasons that the human species is so successful and is able at certain moments to join forces, cooperate, invent and renew. Our struggle is not over “all or nothing,” it’s about saving as much as possible. After all, the [entire] human race isn’t about to become extinct, but certain groups within it are going to suffer a great deal and perhaps also become extinct.</p> \n<p>The fate of some of the flat islands in the Indian Ocean, for example, is already sealed. Other places, undeveloped areas and desert regions, might experience a steep plunge in population size. This has happened before in human history. Mass starvation, epidemics, etc., which led to a dramatic reduction in the size of the population. So I prefer to define the question not in terms of whether there is a solution or not, but to what extent the solutions will wield influence and trickle down, in order to reverse the trend. There’s no doubt that overall, this is a very worrisome trend, especially with regard to weak populations.</p> \n<p>Yes. In one of your articles you write: One day we will look back and simply not believe.</p> \n<p>As the clich&eacute; goes, you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone. I think that if we were to live in some future world, where the temperature outside is unbearable for many months of the year, when the ability simply to walk around outside will be constantly diminishing, where we will use resources, including fuel and energy, in a way completely different from today, where everything will be controlled and measured and limited – when we look back on the wild way in which we are living today, to a world where most people are completely unaware of the significance of carbon to their way of life, we simply wouldn’t believe that we ever lived like that.</p> \n<p>After all, if we’d been told 70 years ago that the street corner where we’re sitting – Rothschild and Ahad Ha’am [in Tel Aviv] – would have cafes and be a busy thoroughfare, and not a drowsy road along which a camel convoy occasionally passes by, we wouldn’t have believed it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>About 20 years ago, we found ourselves enjoying the entire day on a quiet beach while vacationing in Rhodes. The sun beat down on us during the journey in the open jeep and continued to dance on the water for hours, burning the salty skin. In the early evening, well before sunset, the hunger of youth took over. We went into Lindos and entered the first tavern we encountered, on the roof of one of the homes. It was so hot that even the cats were rolling around in ice water.</p> \n<p>The host sat us down at a long table next to the roof edge and lay before us pails of ice water, in which we dipped our feet. A moment later, the table was filled with small plates containing salad with small, hard zucchini, dill and yoghurt, grilled eggplant, fried halloumi cheese spread over burnt sage, calamari filled with feta and fresh sumac, small fish fried with hot green pepper, a huge fish on the grill, and whole shrimp burnt on coals with a fresh sauce of grilled tomatoes and garlic, and so on and so on.</p> \n<p>A memorable feast, but you don’t have to go all the way to the Greek islands for great fish and meaty seafood. Outstanding ouzo can also be found in Israel.</p> \n<p>Expensive or popular, authentic or modern, these are Tel Aviv’s top fish restaurants.</p> \n<p>Shabtai Hayafe</p> \n<p>One of the city’s most enjoyable restaurants has mostly been flying under the radar for some years – and that’s a real shame. At the entrance of Old Jaffa, on the side between the flea market and the sea, you will find Shabtai Hayafe, a Greek-inspired fish and seafood restaurant that you easily almost suspect of being a tourist trap. And that’d be too bad.</p> \n<p>The wooden windows are painted blue, and blue-and-white checkered tablecloths are spread out on the tables. However, if you really want to feel like you’re in Greece you’re better focusing on the food. Among the wonderful appetizers are tzatziki, skordalia, a salad with white beans, onion and good Greek olives. There is also a beet dish, fresh vegetable salad, tahini, radish salad and many others.</p> \n<p>There is an authentic Greek salad with feta and oregano, goat cheese with olive oil, but the highlight is, of course, the beauty of the fish. Look out for the spicy chraime shrimp and blue crab. And, if it’s available, don’t pass up on the chocolate mousse and pistachio parfait. About 130 shekels ($36) per person.</p> \n<p>36 Hatsorfim Street, Jaffa. 03-6832250</p> \n<p>Shila</p> \n<p>One of the city’s best restaurants is full of atmosphere any time of the day. In the afternoon, it’s nice to enjoy a relatively relaxed business lunch alongside an amazing selection of wines. And in the evening, the lively bar is reminiscent of the streets of Madrid. Despite the joyous atmosphere, chef Sharon Cohen and his staff create meticulously prepared food, which is characterized by a refreshing, clean line, in which the raw materials are the center of the presentation.</p> \n<p>Among the hits are soba salad; shrimp soaked in hot water with cilantro, grilled onion and rice sheets; crystal shrimp carpaccio; red tuna salad with suman noodles and seaweed; red tuna carpaccio with wasabi and a campari lemongrass sorbet, half-a-lobster with spaghettini in fish stock, lemongrass; and calamari; and gnocchi in white butter sauce with crab meat, scallops and crystal shrimp. It is expensive and worth every shekel. Starts at 250 shekels per person in the evening.</p> \n<p>182 Ben Yehuda Street, Tel Aviv. 03-5221224</p> \n<p>Barbounia</p> \n<p>Although this belongs to that generation of restaurants that aren’t particularly new or old, Barbounia still feels as if it has been here forever. You get straightforward service as you enter, and your table will soon fill with little plates of salads, soft breads and a jug of soda water. The early stars include the grilled cauliflower, Waldorf salad, creamy potato salad, spicy carrot salad, eggplant salad in a particularly thick tahini, and a tomato salsa that’s rich in garlic. For the entr&eacute;es, we love a serving of a mixed seafood, mixed small fish when available and meaty shrimp in butter and garlic. They are simple classics.</p> \n<p>In the next-door dim and chilly bar, you can complement your drink – to the extent this is possible – with sashimi or carpaccio of fish, a serving of super crispy calamari heads and grouper head. For dessert, there is halva parfait and espresso parfait. About 150 shekels per diner.</p> \n<p>163 Ben Yehuda Street, Tel Aviv. 03-5240961</p> \n<p>Hashaked</p> \n<p>Maybe the oldest of the city’s fish restaurants, it began in the 1960s as a spot for workers from the nearby wholesale fruit and vegetable market to grab a bite. Two years ago it relocated to its new home across the street and is now more trendy, colorful and a more pleasant place to hang out. Even though the reins are slowly being handed over to the third generation of the family, they still zealously preserve a few old iron-clad principles.</p> \n<p>The first is for serving excellent salads, which stand out for their preference for the traditional Eastern European kitchen, and more than fair prices for the extensive wine list. Among the salads you won’t find elsewhere are small plates of chopped liver, egg salad, soused herring (matjes), dill pickles and a cooked beetroot salad. From the menu check out the fried sardines, soup with red fish balls, freekeh ceviche and a Caesar salad with shrimp – and no gourmet restaurant makes carpaccio from fresh fish like Haim at Hashaked. The price is about 150 shekels to 200 shekels per person.</p> \n<p>99 Hahashmonaim Street, Tel Aviv. 03-5610546</p> \n<p>Afloka</p> \n<p>Another Jaffa fish restaurant that flies under the radar but is always surprisingly good whenever you visit. The inside space is simple and, in truth, a bit drab, but the portions are generous, the prices still rather affordable and the service is first-rate. The appetizer salads that really stood out were the tomato salad, spicy green tahini, tomatoes in tahini and the matbukha. The main dishes will remind you of old-time fish places – and we mean that in a good way: Fried fish or on the grill, shellfish and other dishes you last saw in the 1980s, including shrimp in sesame and trout in cream with mushrooms.</p> \n<p>69 Kedem Street, Jaffa. 03-6833339</p> \n<p>206 Dagim</p> \n<p>A restaurant that has proven for over 20 years that you don’t need to cross the Yarkon River, into the city center, in order to eat good fish. The atmosphere is elegant, even if slightly old-fashioned, the restaurant is quiet and the service attentive. The menu tries to preserve a classic appearance, but it probably would not hurt to invest a bit more effort and try and get out of the rut. Appetizers include the salted root and granola salad, zucchini blossoms filled with shellfish, beet ravioli with scallops on the grill and crispy sage, alongside classics such as smoked trout salad, soused herring in oil and traditional smoked salmon. The elegant and overgenerous main courses are of the old and reliable style, including shellfish in crab sauce, blue crabs baked in the oven, clams marini&egrave;re and spinach fettuccini with shrimp, clams and bottarga. An excellent place for work meetings and your grandparents’ anniversary.</p> \n<p>54 Moshe Sneh Street, Tel Aviv. 03-6483030</p> \n<p>Derby Fish Bar</p> \n<p>Another restaurant that, despite its generic location, still manages to surprise. In a sleepy shopping center in Ramat Aviv, near a supermarket and bank, this fish restaurant lies hidden. People come here to work and not to waste time. You want a refined gourmet restaurant? Wrong address. You want to bring the whole family? Then this is definitely the place. The crowd is older and business-like, and the culinary narrative fits the bill. The choice of mezes is amazingly limited, but hits the spot with good fish roe, herring, labneh, matbukha, beets cooked in cumin, white cabbage salad, thick tahini and a fresh vegetable salad finely diced on the spot and filled with lemon, parsley and onion. Saltwater fish are served fried or grilled, while the shellfish includes scallops, clams, crabs and calamari, alongside rice and potatoes au gratin.</p> \n<p>43&nbsp;Brodetsky Street, Tel Aviv. 03-6410898</p> \n<p>Manta Ray</p> \n<p>A real on-the-beach experience that has managed to preserve the passion, refresh the menu and tray of mezes – and hang onto its well-trained and experienced staff. An excellent location right on the beach on the border between Tel Aviv and Jaffa makes it our home for lazy breakfasts on weekends and for early, pre-sunset dinners in the summer. In winter, sitting inside reminds you of a shipwreck in the middle of the sea – and that has a kind of charm.</p> \n<p>The tray of appetizers has such hits as mullet ceviche in sumac, a leafy green salad with baked salmon, grilled beets with fried goat’s cheese, tzatziki with eggplant fries, eggplant mousse with labneh and silan, spinach salad, bulgur, shrimp, mango and other options. The wine and cocktail menu pairs up quite nicely with the main dishes, such as chunks of fileted grouper on creamed purple sweet potatoes and slivers of shallot; a shellfish dish to be shared with sweet potatoes and pineapple on the grill with an Asian sauce; fried calamari with a Vietnamese cucumber salad; and a bowl of clams with small beets and grilled gruyere cheese. Not cheap, but you come here to be pampered and leave the rest of the world outside. About 200 shekels per person – and up.</p> \n<p>703 Kaufmann Street (behind Charles Clore Park), Tel Aviv. 03-5174773</p> \n<p>Fisherman’s Restaurant</p> \n<p>This restaurant has been around for a very long time and sits right on the waterline in Jaffa Port. It has an inside space, too, rather old-fashioned looking. But it’s worth sitting outside at sunset or opting for the business lunch, which is a great deal. For appetizers, we recommend the salmon carpaccio or the wonderful fresh anchovies, which they pickle here themselves alongside the thick, homemade taramasalata and fish soup. The menu is less predictable than other places and it’s worth checking out the shellfish pasta, a tray that includes a wealth of shellfish and small fish, as well as the crab in butter, garlic and wine. A great place to bring tourists or your provincial parents who want to experience that Jaffa vibe. Simple, authentic and very tasty, even though it’s not particularly polished or cheap. Prices begin at 150 shekels per person.</p> \n<p>Jaffa Port. 073-7569540</p> \n<p>Fortuna Del Mar</p> \n<p>Here’s another place you may not have heard of – or, even worse, have forgotten about when you want to sit by the sea in a laid-back space. The restaurant is right near the sea, with a view looking out over the masts of the crowded Tel Aviv marina. It is also a very appropriate place to bring foreign guests. The menu has an abundance of seafood appetizers, including crab falafel, and refreshing salads. Among the main courses, try the pasta with shellfish, cuttlefish risotto, shrimp, clams and calamari heads and scallops in saffron and cream. The wine prices are fair, and it’s worth remembering that they serve a wonderful breakfast here, along with a generous business lunch, starting at 98 shekels.</p> \n<p>14 Eliezer Peri Street, Tel Aviv Marina. 03-5236730</p> \n<p>Chlo&eacute;lys Kosher</p> \n<p>Chlo&eacute;lys did not die. It is still alive and kicking in its kosher form in the beachfront Hilton Hotel Tel Aviv. It may be in a low space and underground, without windows looking out to the sea, but it has an atmosphere packed with prestige. This kosher restaurant is almost sexy and can surprise even those who gluttonously eat everything. Among the appetizers are boquerones – fresh marinated anchovy fillets made here and served on a salad of bell peppers with beans, mustard oil and parsley; saltwater fish sashimi in a cold citrus and anise soup; and mullet kebabs on tabbouleh and cauliflower. The main courses include a wild fish fillet in a casserole with porcini foam and beets; biscaya sea bass with garlic, chili and dried mushrooms; and a sea bar for two with vegetable pesto. The desserts are wonderful, with the bitter chocolate fondant with Cointreau simply outstanding. Just bear in mind that this is currently one of Tel Aviv’s most expensive restaurants.</p> \n<p>Hilton Hotel Tel Aviv, 205 Hayarkon Street, Tel Aviv. 03-5202127</p> \n<p>Turkiz</p> \n<p>This restaurant has been around for a long time and even though in recent years its menu has offered absolutely everything, its location near the sea, patio suspended over the waves, means its kitchen still offers extremely well-executed sea dishes. Appetizers include bouillabaisse; red tuna carpaccio; grouper kebab on yoghurt and bulgur; red tuna roll with cilantro, nuts and Thai sauce (and a large range of light variations on the theme).</p> \n<p>The main courses feature baby grouper (fried or oven-baked); pan fish cutlets in a spicy Marrakesh chraime sauce; grouper shawarma with tahini and yoghurt; and grouper chunks in a spicy tomato stew. For the business lunch menu, it’s best to focus on the fish chraime and a wonderful dish of spicy black pasta with sea fish, roasted lamb pancetta with an abundance of cilantro. Breakfasts here are generous and decadent, and fish lovers will be happy to upgrade them with salmon gravlax or herring.</p> \n<p>6 Herzl Rosenblum Street, Sea and Sun Complex, Tel Aviv. 03-6996306</p>",

        "text":["<p>If it’s really the case that Donald Trump’s presidency is a necessary stage in solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it was surely only so that Israel Hayom’s diplomatic correspondent, Ariel Kahana, could write the following about the peace plan, which includes a Palestinian state: “[A]s far as substance goes we can rest assured that the plan drafted by Trump’s team — Jared Kushner, Jason Greenblatt, David Friedman, Mike Pence, John Bolton and Mike Pompeo — will be exceedingly comfortable from Israel’s perspective. Since Israel’s establishment, no U.S. president has surrounded himself with a circle so committed to the Jewish state, so loving and supportive of it. ... In the American political landscape, there simply isn’t anything farther to the right than this special group.”</p> \n<p>If there’s one thing Trump and his staff have succeeded in, it’s convincing Israelis that they are right-wing Jewish patriots, on the spectrum between the hawkish wing of Likud and Habayit Hayehudi. There’s a sense that to the Israeli right, Trump and his gang are more loyal to Israel than is the Israeli left.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Whatever his intentions, Trump’s endorsement of two-state solution changes reality | Analysis ■&nbsp;Netanyahu backs future Palestinian state, reigniting the leftist’s dilemma | Analysis</p> \n<p>Trump and his staff have succeeded in portraying themselves to Israel’s right as “one of them” — without the liberal nonsense about “the occupation” that captured the hearts of U.S. Democrats; without bothering their heads over evacuating settlements; without endangering “Jerusalem the eternal capital of Israel”; without touching the apple of their eye, “Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people,” promised to it by God; and with an approach that’s completely free of all the schmaltz about the Nakba, the victimhood of the Palestinians and the olive trees.</p> \n<p>The Palestinians can forget about “Jerusalem,” the right of return or symbolic recognition of their “catastrophe.” And they certainly won’t receive even a smidgen of land — totally demilitarized, of course — until they announce to the world that their claims to anything inside Israel, whether territorial or national, have ended.</p> \n<p>The two-state solution needed to be cleansed of its left-wing image. It needed to be appropriated by the right as the judicious, moderate, security-oriented solution — not according to the army’s old loser ethos of “shooting and crying,” but according to the ethos of special ops forces, of “Fauda,” the war on terror, “shooting and confirming the kill.” And for that, it was first necessary to reject it.</p> \n<p>And that’s what happened. In the first stage, Trump and his staff made it clear that “we aren’t leftists.” We aren’t automatically for a two-state solution. We lean toward the Israeli side; in other words, toward the right.</p> \n<p>What’s the most right-wing solution, one state? Then one state it is, let’s go, we can talk about that. We have no feelings of inferiority toward the Palestinians. We have no feelings of guilt. The weaker side isn’t necessarily right. And in any case, the Palestinians aren’t so weak. We’re sick of the entire world dancing to their narrative and financing it.</p> \n<p>The Victim’s Day festivities have ended. The party at the United Nations Human Rights Council is over. Funding for the organization for preserving Palestinian refugeeism is finished.</p> \n<p>The two-state solution had to be picked up off history’s floor after Israel’s radical left threw it there for moral reasons, because it merely perpetuates the injustices of the Nakba. The two-state solution had to travel all the way across the political spectrum, from the extreme left to the “sane” right.</p> \n<p>And this couldn’t happen until the left formulated a new political solution. It had to wait until the “Gideon Levys” abandoned it and embraced the idea of one state with equal rights for all instead. It had to wait until talk of separating into two states became tainted with racism and nationalism in the eyes of the far left, until it was seen by leftist extremists as a relic of the old, chauvinist, colonialist world.</p> \n<p>And what does the right want, if not to preserve yesterday’s values? Presenting the two-state solution as a conservative solution is its entry ticket into the heart of the Israeli right. What isn’t good enough for the left can suddenly be thought about quietly, without all the moral hullaballoo. Only thus could Israel Hayom have asserted decisively that “Israel must say yes” to Trump’s deal of the century.</p>",

Another storage site for ground-to-ground missiles is in the middle of a residential neighborhood, near civilian buildings and only 500 meters from the airport’s runway.</p> \n<p>Other similar sites exist in the heart of Beirut's civilian population and elsewhere in Lebanon.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israeli defense officials believe that manufacturing facilities for the precision missiles have not yet been built inside Lebanon, despite Hezbollah and Iran's wishes.</p> \n<p>The project to build precision-guided missiles is Hezbollah’s flagship program in preparation for another round of hostilities with Israel. Hezbollah is upgrading its missile forces using Iranian knowledge, training and funding. Tehran ships the necessary resources via Syria, and Israel has been attempting to attack these shipments.</p> \n<p>The attack last week by the Israeli Air Force on such a shipment is what led to the Syrian anti-aircraft forces shooting down the Russian spy plane, killing the 15 crew members aboard the plane. In his speech, Netanyahu threatened Hezbollah explicitly: “I have a message for Hezbollah today: Israel knows, Israel also knows what you’re doing. Israel knows where you’re doing it. And Israel will not let you get away with it.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu presented an aerial photograph of the airport in Beirut to prove his point about Hezbollah using innocent Lebanese citizens as human shields. “Israel will do whatever it must do to defend itself against Iran’s aggression. We will continue to act against you in Syria. We will act against you in Lebanon. We will act against you in Iraq. We will act against you whenever, and wherever. We must act to defend our state and to defend our people.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday that there would be no peace without a &quot;an independent Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and not some place in East Jerusalem as its capital, and with all of its holy sites.&quot; Read his full remarks below:</p> \n<p>Jerusalem is not for sale, and the Palestinian people’s rights are not up for bargaining in the name of God, the most merciful and beneficiant, excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espionaza, president of the UN General Assembly and your excellency Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the UN, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, peace be upon you.</p> \n<p>Peace be upon you, we will stay and we will maintain our faith in peace. We will maintain peace and we will achieve our indepdent state with peace because God is with us and our cause is just and our people have sacrificed a lot and because you lovers of peace and God is always against those who are plaguing us with injustice and God is enough.</p> \n<p>In these days, last year, i came before you- appealing for freedom, independence and justice for my oppressed people who are suffering under the yolk of the Israeli occupation for more than 51 years and today I return as this colonial occupation continues to suffocate us, undermining our serious unwavering efforts to build the instituitions of our cherished state which this August, the General Assembly recognized in 2011.</p> \n<p>This year, ladies and gentlemen, the Palestinian National Council, the parliament of the state of Palestine convened and renewed the legitimacy of our national institutions through the election of a new leadership for the Palestine Liberation Organization, the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.</p> \n<p>This parliament undertook important decisions whereby I have to review the agreements-- political, economic and security alike-- that have been reached with the Israeli government and to review the future of the Palestinian National Authority which unfortunately has been rendered without authority.</p> \n<p>The parliament also instructed me to suspend the Palestinian recognition of the State of Israel until Israel recognizes in its turn the State of Palestine on the fourth of June, 1967 borders. I was also instructed to approach international courts, including the International Criminal Court (the ICC) to investigate Israel’s breaches of treaties and the aggressions by the Israeli occupying forces and settlers against our people, on our land and our holy sites.</p> \n<p>And you might note, ladies and gentlemen, that the Israeli settlers and even the Israeli army on every single day-- they are committing acts of blasphemy against our holy sites, especially Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p> \n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, last July Israel adopted a racist law that &nbsp;crossed all the red lines and it was called the “Nation-State Law of the Jewish People.” This law denies the connection of the Palestinian people to their historic homeland and the dismisses their right to self-determination and history and hertiage as well as the UN resolutions relevant to the Palestine question and the agreements concluded with Israel.</p> \n<p>This law will inevitably lead to the creation of one racist state, an apartheid state, and thus nullifies the two-state solution. Israel practices discrimination but actually this law comes as the epicenter of this discrimination. This law discriminates against the Palestinian Arab citizens in Israel, granting the right to self-determination exclusively to Jews in Israel, thus legalizing discrimination against those Arab citizens who constitute 20% of the population of Israel.</p> \n<p>In addition to other non-Jews who have immigrated to Israel, thus they are stripped of the rights of citizenship. At least 5% of the current population of Israel are immigrants, they are non-Jews. They are Christians and Muslims who immigrated from the former USSR, they have also been stripped from the rights to citizenship.</p> \n<p>This law constitues a gross breach and real danger, both politically and legally and reminds us of the apartheid state that existed in South Africa. Thus, we reject this law and condemn it in the strongest terms. And we call on the international community and this assembly to condemn it and reject it as a racist, illegal law and null and void.</p> \n<p>The United Nations had condemned the apartheid South African state in several resolutions in the past, bearing in mind that thousands of Jews and Israeli citizens have rejected and protested against this law. 56 Knesset members out of 120 voted against it. Because they believe that it’s a racist law. That’s why I call upon the UN to follow the same line, to follow in the footsteps of a number of Israeli citizens who rejected this law altogether in letter and in spirit.</p> \n<p>This racist law, ladies and gentlemen, talks about what is called ‘the Land of Israel.’ Can you ask the Israeli government what exactly constitutes the land of Israel? What are the borders of the State of Israel? I challenge anyone to tell us what they are. Where are the borders of the State of Israel? Please bring me a map and just show where are the borders of Israel. This racist law consitutes another stigma on Israel and anyone who can censor it and condones such acts.</p> \n<p>This law is just like other Israeli laws that legislated theft, piracy and confiscation of the land, property and funds of the Palestinian people.</p> \n<p>We have always positively and fully engaged with the various initiatives of the international community that have aimed at achieving &nbsp;resolve the conflict between us and the Israelis, including the Arab Peace Initiative which was recognized by the Security Council in its resolution 1515 of 2013.</p> \n<p>We continued on this path with the administration of President Trump from the start of his tenure with the same positive engagement and we welcomed his launching of the initiative of peace and I have met with him numerous times.</p> \n<p>We awaited his peace initiative with utmost patience but we were shocked by his decisions and actions that completely contradict the rule and committment of his administration towards the peace process. So in November 2017 his administration issued a decision to close the PLO office in Washington, DC. He then announced his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and thus transferred his country’s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and he even boasts that he has removed the issues of Jerusalem refugees, settlements and security off the negotiation table.</p> \n<p>All such decisions threaten the Palestinian national cause and constitute an assault on international law and relevant UN resolutions. The US administration went even further in its assault by cutting assistance to the Palestinian National Authority, the UNRWA and Palestinian hospitals in occupied East Jerusalem. Then they’re speaking now about humanitarian aid. Even the humanitarian aid has been cut off.</p> \n<p>With all of these decisions this administration has reneged on all previous US committments and even undermined the two-state solution and revealed its false claims about the humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian people.</p> \n<p>It's really ironic that the American administration still talk about what they call the deal of the century, but what is left for this administration to give to the Palestinian people? Only humanitarian solutions, because when they remove off of the negotiation table Jerusalem, refugees and security- what is left?</p> \n<p>What is left as a political solution? The U.S. Congress continues to insist on considering the PLO, which is recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people by the overwhelming majority of countries of the world including Israel, as a terrorist organization.</p> \n<p>And by the way, the PLO is recognized by Israel; however, the U.S. Congress claims that the PLO is a terrorist organization at a time when the State of Palestine cooperates with the majority of countries of the world, including the U.S., to combat terrorism.</p> \n<p>Then why is this animosity against the Palestinian people who are suffering under the yolk of an occupation duly supported by the U.S.? I would like to tell them, our positions are firm and clear for all to see and we challenge you if we have committed a single mistake in our long journey-- however the Congress comes out of the blue to say that the PLO is a terrorist organization. How come?</p> \n<p>For years we have affirmed our readiness to the U.S. administration to establish a Palestinian-American committee that will examine the legal and political status of the PLO as a means of proving to them that the PLO is committed to achieving peace and combating terrorism as well as to also demonstrate that the Congress legislation regarding the PLO is arbitrary, unlawful and unjustified and deliberately ignores the offical agreement with the U.S. administration to combat terrorism; an agreement which we have also concluded with 83 other countries.</p> \n<p>We have protocols with 83 countries under the heading or the title of ‘Combating Terrorism’ including the U.S., however the Congress calls us terrorists.</p> \n<p>Despite of all of this and from this platform I renew my call to President Trump to walk back his decisions regarding Jerusalem, refugees and and settelements. Which contravene with international law and UN resolutions as well as the understandings that we have reached in order to salvage the prospects of peace and to achieve stability and security for future generations.</p> \n<p>By the way, this is an example of those understanding, this is a letter duly signed between the U.S. administration and Palestine regarding all these causes that are now just igonred. Ladies and gentlemen, consistent with our committment to peace and the two-state solution and the path of negotiations to achieve, a path we have never refused and i do challenge you to tell me about any single time where we refused to come to the negotiation table.</p> \n<p>To the contrary. We have been invited more than once by more than one country here and they told us, they invited us to sit with Netanyahu and in every single time I accepted and I do challenge you to tell me that I have refused once or if they have, on the other hand, accepted once.</p> \n<p>So we have never refused these negotiations with a view to rescuing the peace process and I came before the Security Council on the 20th of February this year and presented an initiative calling for the convening of an international peace conference based on the relevant UN resolutions and the internationally-endorsed terms of reference and parameters. Such a conference should involve broad international participation that includes regional and international stakeholders led by the parliament members of the Security Council and the Quartet.</p> \n<p>We shall circulate this initiative in its entirety to you and hope you will support it. Here I reiterate that we are not against negotiations, in the least, and we have never rejected negotiations on any single day and we will continue to extend our hands for peace. We only believe in peace. Peace is the only path. We don’t believe in terrorism and violence. And we spared no occasion to reiterate this belief. Then what?</p> \n<p>If you’re speaking about UN resolutions, okay, these UN resolutions had not… not a single UN resolution has been respected by Israel. Then you are speaking about negotiations and solutions? What kind of negotiations and solutions? Peace in our region cannot be realized without an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and with all the holy sites.</p> \n<p>Some people try to outsmart us and they say okay, your capital is in East Jerusalem. No, I’m sorry-- this is a manipulation of words. This means here or there or whichever region that are surrounding Jerusalem. No. Our capital is East Jerusalem and not in East Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>And please don’t try to outsmart us. Whether Abu-Dis or in East Jerusalem and then you can pick and choose an area here or there. No. East Jerusalem which has been occupied in 1967 is our capital. There’s no peace otherwise and there is no peace with a state of temporary borders. By the way, they invented this idea of state with temporary borders. Okay, we will give you a state but with unknown borders.</p> \n<p>You know what, this is exactly a state like Israel with unknown borders. And then let us talk. No. You want a state with very well-defined borders and rights and then we can co-exist with the Israelis, but otherwise no.</p> \n<p>Here you are 183 states. Plus another country that has recognized us which is Colombia. However, this will, I will continue and this will come in my speech. I thus call upon all the countries of the world that have not yet recognized the state of Palestine this long overdue recognition. I can no longer see a convincing reason for the continued delay of the recognition of Palestine by some countries.</p> \n<p>In this context, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that in 2019 the State of Palestine will chair the Group of 77 and China. By the way, ten minutes ago I met in another conference room his excellency President Sissi who announced that we have been freely elected by 144 countries to chair the Group of 77 and China.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, there are some countries saying that we recognize both countries, or maybe we recognize Israel but we don’t recognize Palestine. So what? If you claim that you recognize the two states and you recognize Israel but you don’t recognize Palestine then this is a conundrum. What’s your interest?</p> \n<p>It’s unacceptable and we tell these countries-- yes, you have to recognize Palestine. This doesn’t mean that we will not go for negotiations; on the contrary. This will bolster our international position and we will be able with your support to go to negotiations when you recognize the State of Palestine and this recognition should not be unilateral. You should not only recognize one state and not the other.</p> \n<p>No. You have to recognize both states. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you again that Israel has not implemented any one of the hundreds of General Assembly resolutions. There are 705 resolutions issued by the General Assembly since 1947 to date and Security Council resolutions since 1948 to date not a single resolution has been implemented by Israel and unfortunately I would like to be very frank and honest.</p> \n<p>Israel is supported by the US because the General Assembly and other countries-- when we ask them, they just agree, when we ask them, they gave us 139 votes and 42 were actually abstained. Those who opposed were only four countries. Until when Israel will act with impunity? Until when Israel will act and rebel as it likes supported by whomever it likes?</p> \n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we are resisting the Israeli occupation by way of legitimate means that have been decided by your international organization. We, the only means which we used is the peaceful, popular resistance. Is this illegal? On the other hand, the settlers are using arms against Palestinians?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>They barge cities and towns and villages with arms. I’m not here speaking about the IDF. I’m speaking about the Israeli settlers. But we will continue to refuse using and reject violence and we reject all kinds of arms and we will never accept using weapons and we call upon the world to pursue the efforts of nuclear disarmament and even traditional disarmament.</p> \n<p>Now we have a problem in Khan al-Ahmar. Israel is adamant on destroying this region and this region has been populated for more than 50 years but if it destroys this village it is thus destroying the unity of the West Bank. It will be divided into north and south. Do you agree to this? Do you condone this? Not to mention the aggressions against Al-Aqsa. Do you remember the aggressions, the assault against Al-Aqsa?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Now we are told that the Israeli supreme court will issue a decision to divide Al-Aqsa, spacially and time-wise. For sure this is totally unacceptable and I’m sure that those with chivalry, dignity and peace lovers will not accept this and Israel should bear the brunt. Such thuggery should come to an end. Because it makes no sense. Every single day a decision is passed by that court as if we don’t exist.</p> \n<p>We managed to get a resolution from the UN for international protection because every day we are attacked and we are incapable of protecting ourselves; okay, a resolution was passed but who will implement this resolution? And very honestly it’s insufficient for the General Assembly to pass a resolution that remains without implementation exactly like other resolutions.</p> \n<p>The General Assembly should also respect its resolutions but to pass a resolution and then we applaud the resolution and we cheer it and then what? Please guide us, tell us how can we implement such resolutions? This is your responsibility.</p> \n<p>In support to our people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip through legitimate institutions we refuse that this support &nbsp;be considered as a substitute for a solution. Because humanitarian aid, you know what, our cause has many humanitarian aspects but without a political solution- really we don’t need such humanitarian aid. Don’t fool us and tell us that you are helping us. Actually we are after the right to self-determination of our people.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Full stop. No single people on earth does not enjoy the rights to self-determination. We are 13 million Palestinians all over the world. Why are we denied the right to self-determination? By the way, this will not harm anybody. We need to establish our independent state which will live side by side with the Israeli state. Where is the mistake here? Where is the crime here?</p> \n<p>We continue to exert genuine, serious efforts to end the divison and to achieve reconciliation, despite the many obstacles to ahieving these aims we continue to uphold our responsibilities towards our people to date. We express our appreciation to our Arab brethern, in particular the Arab Republic of Egypt, for the efforts undertaken to end this division, hoping that they will be rendered successful.</p> \n<p>We made an agreement with an Egyptian sponsorship on the 12th of October and the agreement is so simple: The Palestinian government will carry out its responsbilities in Gaza and in the West Bank. Then we will build our state on the basis of unified law, unified authority, unified regime and only one single legitimate armed forces. We reject the idea of militias. However, this agreement has not been accepted and so far it has not been approved.</p> \n<p>Maybe in the coming few days we’ll witness the last round of talks and then maybe we will take another action. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to conclude as follows: The Palestinian people, 13 million human beings, unless we are not viewed as human beings by some. We are not redundant. Notwithstanding how big a population is, it’s not redundant. Why are we treated as redundant people that should be got rid of? This is totally unacceptable.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However we are patient and we are steadfast and we believe in peace. But we just need to be viewed as humans. We are not redundant. We have concluded agreements with the U.S. administration and the U.S. administration has reneged on all these agreements. However, we are committed and we will abide by our part of the agreement. However, if they reneged on these agreements we will not abide. Thereby, it takes two to tango so an agreement should be respected by both parties. I will respect it from A-Z. However, if the U.S. administration fails to respect the agreement we will not be able to hold our part thereof.</p> \n<p>The U.S. acts as a mediator. However, now we view the U.S. with new eyes. The U.S. cannot be a mediator single-handedly. We have the Quartet. Okay, they can join the Quartet. Any country can join the Quartet whether it’s in Europe, the U.S., the Americas, Africa, even the Arab countries. Anyone can join the Quartet to act as mediators between ourselves and the Israelis. But the U.S. alone? No, because they are too much biased to Israel.</p> \n<p>There are also agreements with Israel starting with the Oslo agreement and the Paris agreement and all these agreements have been abrogated by Israel and we call upon Israel to re-engage in these agreements. Otherwise, we will not hold our part of those agreements. We have also concluded agreements with Hamas.</p> \n<p>Our brothers in Egypt know that we held our side of the agreement but Hamas failed to fulfill its obligations according to the agreement. That’s why we will not bear any responsibility in this regard and I would like this to be totally crystal clear.</p> \n<p>We will not bear any responsibility if Hamas insists on refusing to abide by the agreement. In spite of all this and despite all this injustice from the world we will never resort to violence or terrorism. We will continue to combat violence and terrorism all over the globe. We will never accept any aggression against any country, whether this country recognizes us or doesn’t recognize us, loves us or dislikes us.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There’s a very important point: The U.S. administration said that the number of refugees is 40,000 only. I want to know the formula whereby you calculated this number. Just go to UNRWA, they definitely don’t want to go back to UNRWA-- they want to obliterate it altogether-- the UNRWA was established in 1949 to help refugees until their question is solved and to this date this cause has not been solved, until now, out of 13 million we have six million refugees. Not 40,000 as per the U.S. administration. Such facts just come out of the blue. What is the formula of calculation? They just calculated and decided to remove the UNRWA from the picture?</p> \n<p>Finally, I call upon our people to remain patient, steadfast and to continue to sacrifice until we achieve indepedence and self-determination and to establish an indepedent state with Jerusalem as its capital and not in Jerusalem. I pay tribute to all freedom-loving countries and peoples and our martyrs and I would like to tell all Palestinians: Israel considers them as criminals.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Why? In Israel there are thousands who are used to assaulting everybody and they’re considering? Why is the man who killed Rabin is a hero while our people are criminals? I pay tribute our hero martyrs and prisoners of war. I would like to tell you all that soon the dawn of freedom and independence will shine and occupation will go into the darkness of history and peace be upon you.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s Sukkot holiday week and if Israelis aren’t actually dwelling in their sukkahs, they are lazing on the beach, or even more probably, stuck in traffic in the hopes of lazing on the beach. If they are paying attention to the news, they are worrying about Moscow’s rage over Israel’s role in the downed Russian plane in Syria.</p> \n<p>What they are least likely to have paid attention to is what Startup Nation was up to over the holidays.</p> \n<p>Ostensibly, there was a lot of action. Last week, the medical tech company Mazor Robotics was sold to Medtronic of Ireland for $1.6 billion. On Tuesday, Tapingo, a platform for ordering meals on college campuses, was sold to Grubhub of the U.S. for $150 million and the Indian online retailer Flipkart acquired the analytics startup Upstream Commerce for a reported $50 million.</p> \n<p>On the surface, that all seems like good news. Israel is Startup Nation, and what we do is start up companies with cool technology and eventually makes millions selling them. It’s a win-win – the investors earn a profit, the people almost always get to keep their jobs, now as employees of a multinational. And the entrepreneurs start up another company and the cycle repeats itself.</p> \n<p>Which is all well and good, but first of all, that win-win is confined to Israel's technology industry and doesn't filter through to everyone else; and secondly, Israel's Startup Nation phenomenon itself has stopped growing.</p> \n<p>Still a kid at heart</p> \n<p>The fact is there’s a limit to how many startups even Israel can create. Entrepreneurs and good ideas don’t grow on trees.</p> \n<p>Already there aren’t enough engineers, and Israeli companies have to complete for their skills with the 300 or so multinational research and development centers operating in Israel.</p> \n<p>The result is that is that the growth in the number of Israeli startups has stalled over the last few years, according to figures from Startup Nation Central.</p> \n<p>In 2014, more than 1,000 startups were formed and 221 closed. Three years later, the numbers were 700 and 408, respectively.</p> \n<p>Israel's tech industry was supposed to overcome the problem of stagnating start numbers by becoming more “mature,” that is, companies would no longer sell themselves after being in business a few years. Instead of reaping immediate profits from an exit, they would do it the old fashioned way by making and selling products and services. In the process they would have to hire people to handle such things as finance, marketing, manufacturing and human resources.</p> \n<p>The three exits we’ve witnessed over the last few days evince none of that. They attest that Startup Nation is still an impatient child with its eye on the exit.</p> \n<p>Those who say the industry is growing up argue that showing the number of exits has been shrinking. It’s true – there were 132 exits in 2014, dropping to 127 last year and 58 in the first half of this year, according to Israel Venture Capital Research. But not all exits are the same.</p> \n<p>A startup that lists on the stock market plans to stay independent and become a real business, if it isn’t already. After all, since the dot.com boom fizzled 18 years ago, you can no longer sell investors on the flimflam that that you’re in a lengthy “growth stage” (that is, unless you’re Jeff Bezos) and profits will come later.</p> \n<p>But the number of Israeli startups that head for the stock market was tiny to begin with and is dropping. There were just eight initial public offerings in 2017, and there have been three in the first half of this year.</p> \n<p>The kind of exit that tells you startups and their backers are really exiting, in the sense of disposing the business, is merger and acquisition deals, that is, when the company is sold lock, stock and barrel to another company. Here, the IVC data show that M&amp;A activity has been remarkably stable in the last few years, with a dip in 2017 that looks like it is being reversed this year.</p> \n<p>None of this is surprising. The shareholders of a startup company are typically venture capital funds, sometimes big corporations, the firm’s entrepreneurs and employees, and private investors. Like any investor, they want to earn a return and in the case of a small, non-public company that means selling it either to another company or to other investors via the stock market. Between those two options, they still prefer the stock market by a long shot.</p> \n<p>Even for people who when they hear the word “Java” think of a cup of coffee or an Indonesian island, rather than of a computer-programming language, the fate of Startup Nation is critical. Israel is regarded as a much bigger economic, political and military power (No. 8, according to a U.S. News &amp; World report survey) than its tiny size would ordinarily merit, and the reason for that is our technology prowess.</p> \n<p>Innovative abilities are the reason why Israel has become an integral part of the global tech industry. It’s the reason why China and India pay us so much attention. Our cyber-warfare and intelligence capabilities command the respect of our allies and fear of our foes. It’s the only important industry where Israel is globally competitive and if we lose it or let it stagnate, we’re toast. But, alas, there’s the smell of something burning.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Every time a leader of the Israeli right seems to move toward peace by words or deeds, the “leftist’s dilemma” arises again: Do we believe him and support his policy, despite the damage he has caused domestically and, in the cases of Benjamin Netanyahu and Ariel Sharon, despite the alleged corruption and investigations?</p> \n<p>Underlying the dilemma is the recognition that it is easier for a right-wing prime minister to evacuate territories and settlements because the only resistance he must face is from the settler movement. Left-wing prime ministers face a much broader opposition, which includes Likud and its satellites as well as the ultra-Orthodox parties.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The two words Netanyahu is afraid to repeat out load&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Trump's endorsement of two-state solution changes reality | Analysis</p> \n<p>This dilemma will arise again with regard to Netanyahu if he continues the line he presented Wednesday at a press briefing in New York after meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, who expressed clear support for the two-state solution.</p> \n<p>There is no question that Netanyahu is the ultimate authority in Israel on issues of foreign affairs and security, and a decisive majority of the public would support any deal he could reach with the Palestinians. There is also no doubt that Netanyahu will not be able to oppose Trump’s peace plan the way he thwarted the initiatives of Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama.</p> \n<p>Until now, however, at the moments of truth, Netanyahu has always preferred his right-wing and religious constituency, and resisted any substantive peace process.</p> \n<p>If Netanyahu moves ahead toward an agreement, the leftist will ask himself: What is more important – the chances of resolving the conflict with the Palestinians, or at least mitigating it, or the coverage Netanyahu received on the Walla website before the 2015 elections? The realization of the two-state vision, or the champagne and cigars that the Netanyahus received from Arnon Milchan? Ending or limiting the occupation, or the chef’s meals at the Prime Minister’s Residence?</p> \n<p>The answer is self-evident, and was formulated by Prof. Yehezkel Dror about a year ago, at the height of the reports about the investigations involving Netanyahu and the Saturday night demonstrations against corruption in Petah Tikva: “I recommend that Netanyahu do something historic that will dwarf his personal sins. He should propose a regional peace plan that includes a Palestinian state and an Israeli embassy in Riyadh. … When a political breakthrough is declared, one mustn’t examine the motives too carefully.” [Haaretz Hebrew edition, August 8, 2017.]</p> \n<p>Netanyahu appeared the next day at a conference of Likud supporters at the Tel Aviv Fairgrounds that was aimed at rebuffing the investigations, and he responded to Dror’s proposal dismissively. “I will have to disappoint the Haaretz newspaper, which this morning published an article that explicitly made me an ‘etrog’ offer – just withdraw from Judea and Samaria and we’ll leave you alone. So here is my answer: No thanks,” he said.</p> \n<p>Has his position changed since then, because he understands that Trump is serious, or because in light of the leaks about suspicions that are coalescing into an indictment, he would prefer to face the bad stuff with broad political and public support behind him? Will he relinquish the partnership with Habayit Hayehudi and leave Naftali Bennett and his colleagues to whine about “a capitulation as deep as the investigation,” in return for a broad government to be formed after the next elections to advance the Trump plan, similar to the government he founded with Ehud Barak, Dan Meridor, Moshe Ya’alon and Benny Begin as a response to Obama in 2009?</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s remarks Wednesday leave his options open, as every leader prefers. He walked back toward his 2009 Bar-Ilan speech, but did not go all the way there. He is still stuck at the Aluf Sadeh interchange, and was careful not to explicitly say the words “Palestinian state,” which might dissolve the coalition with Bennett prematurely. He will try to soften the wink to the left with promises to the right, like “We will prevent the entry of millions of refugees into the Palestinian state,” “The settlements will not be uprooted,” and so on. Labor Chairman Avi Gabbay, who vowed not to sit in a Netanyahu government after the elections, could still put off eating his hat by saying “the circumstances have changed.”</p> \n<p>Moreover, Netanyahu’s proposed arrangement – a dwarf Palestinian entity that Israel controls from above, below and both sides – is very far from the Palestinians’ expectations, and even from the peace proposals of Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert that the Palestinians rejected in the past.</p> \n<p>But he comes to the table with Trump behind him holding a large club that threatens the Palestinians: If you continue to be stubborn, you’ll have reason yet to miss the embassy’s move to Jerusalem and the budget cuts to UNRWA, because the next steps in crushing the Palestinian national movement will hurt even more.</p> \n<p>Then, once again, the Israeli leftist will face a dilemma – whether to support the Trump-Netanyahu plan, with all its limitations, or to back the Palestinian resistance in the name of historic justice and the assessment that an unbalanced agreement will eventually collapse into a new wave of violence. This dilemma will be much more difficult than the one over Cases 1000, 2000 and 4000.</p>",

But it actually has a U.K. connection through the members of British Habonim who helped found it in 1949. In honor of Israel’s 70th anniversary, the kibbutz decided to install a new plaque recognizing this connection and some of the British Jews whose contributions helped build some of its communal facilities. A kibbutz representative reached out to Esther and David Miller, the current and immediate past presidents of Hitachdut Olei Britannia (HOB), the Israel Association of British Immigrants. They in turn invited British Ambassador to Israel David Quarrey, who presided over the ceremony on Tuesday. “He spoke about the strength of economic ties and the contribution of British olim,” the embassy’s Dana Bernstein told Haaretz. David Miller, a London native, said the day was topped off with some British games that grandparents said they hadn’t “seen in 40 years.”</p> \n<p>PERFECT HARMONY: The Jerusalem Barbershop Ensemble, which has been providing four-part a capella harmony since 1983, will be performing at the AACI’s Dr. Max &amp; Gianna Glassman Family Center on Tuesday.

The ensemble also consists of Dani Barkai, who grew up in Toronto; Howard Clapsaddle, formerly from Buffalo, New York; Ian Cohen, who hails from Britain; Roger Friedland, who was born and raised in Florida; native Texan R. Martin Rogovein; and Boaz Feinberg, the only native Israeli.

        "text":["<p>Paul Manafort is an international political consultant and lobbyist who managed the election campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016. At the end of last week he signed a plea bargain in which he is expected to serve as a key witness in the affair of the suspicions of Russian involvement in that election in Trump’s favor.</p> \n<p>So how is all that now connected to Israel?</p> \n<p>In the indictment in which he confessed as part of the plea bargain with U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, there is also mention of Manafort’s lobbying activity for former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, who was the pro-Russian candidate in the country’s 2012 election. According to the document, Manafort worked at the time to smear the image of Yanukovych’s rival Yulia Tymoshenko, in order to undermine the support for her by the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama.</p> \n<p>In order to achieve that, according to the indictment, Manafort allegedly “privately” coordinated with a senior Israeli official the publication of a declaration that would link Tymoshenko to anti-Semitic elements in Ukraine. He allegedly acted to publish this material in the American press. The goal was to cause a senior official in the Obama administration who supported Tymoshenko at the time to look like a supporter of anti-Semitism. According to current assessments in the U.S. media, including The Washington Post, the senior administration official was then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p> \n<p>By so doing, Manafort believed that the Jewish community in the United States would reject Tymoshenko, who had the support of Western liberals, and press for an end to support for her by Obama and Clinton.</p> \n<p>So who is the senior Israeli official and why is that important?</p> \n<p>The document did not reveal the identity of the “senior Israeli official” who allegedly coordinated with Manafort the publication of the declaration that was designed to intervene in U.S.-Ukraine relations.</p> \n<p>An examination of the notices of condemnation against Tymoshenko by official sources in Israel at the time indicated that on October 27, 2012, while Manafort was working for Yanukovych’s election campaign, Israel’s Foreign Ministry, which was headed at the time by Avigdor Lieberman, published a special report in Russian specifically condemning the agreement to form a government between Tymoshenko’s party and the Svoboda (Freedom) party, whose senior officials were known for their anti-Semitic statements.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Mum's the word in Ukraine on Manafort scandal and the Israeli link ■ Israel's defense chief calls for probe into identity of top official embroiled in Manafort case ■ Which top official was a foreign agent in Manafort affair? Israeli politicians call for immediate probe &lt;&lt;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That same condemnation of this agreement was cited at the time in Lieberman’s name in The New York Times and the far-right Breitbart News website, which did point specifically to Hillary Clinton as the guilty party.</p> \n<p>Lieberman strongly denies any connection to Manafort and says that he never met or spoke to him, and that “the condemnation published by the Foreign Ministry at the time was correctly worded, and at the right time, against an anti-Semitic party that disseminated its demonic philosophy on dozens of occasions.” His party colleague, former MK Alex Miller, supports this version and told Haaretz that it was clear that the agreement was problematic and that Israel should condemn it. On Sunday night Lieberman even asked Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked to contact U.S. authorities as soon as possible to get them to reveal the name of the senior Israeli official and to remove the cloud.</p> \n<p>The office of Special Counsel Mueller told Haaretz that American law prevents them from publicizing any information about sources mentioned in a case in which they aren’t suspects. At the same time, an official request from Israeli authorities to receive the information for an internal investigation may be handled differently.</p> \n<p>Labor Party chairman Avi Gabbay and former Meretz chairwoman Zehava Galon turned to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the attorney general’s office, the Shin Bet security service and the Foreign Ministry, asking them to initiate an urgent investigation of the issue. “An examination of the part of the indictment that deals with the State of Israel leads to a conclusion that is likely to shake the foundations, to the effect that in the Civil Service there was (or perhaps still is) a mole (foreign agent) who is serving foreign interests,” warned Gabbay.</p> \n<p>So did Tymoshenko really support anti-Semites?</p> \n<p>Among professionals and the political leadership in Israel there was a broad consensus at the time that the Ukrainian Svoboda party, which amassed power in the 2012 election campaign, really was a party whose senior officials expressed themselves in a racist and anti-Semitic manner, and the growing support for it was dangerous for the Jewish community in the country, and in general. But the specific condemnation by the Foreign Ministry in the Russian language did not target the Svoboda party in general but rather the understandings between it and Tymoshenko’s party prior to the election – as described in Manafort’s indictment.</p> \n<p>Then-Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said on Monday morning in an interview with Ayala Hasson on Radio 103 that he was not familiar with the statement at the time, but learned about it only recently, adding that the affair should be investigated. He said, “When I look at how that message was released, let’s say it’s a very abnormal thing … the statement is precisely what Manafort requested.” Ayalon added: “Tarnishing Tymoshenko wasn’t in Manafort’s interest, Manafort is a mercenary. It was [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s interest.” He continued, “If someone truly wants to convince the public it wasn’t him, come and show the bureau’s work that preceded that statement.”</p> \n<p>Sources in the Foreign Ministry who were familiar with the subject at the time told Haaretz that the statement in Russian originated in the office of then-Minister Lieberman. The ministry said in response, &quot;The Foreign Ministry issues press statements as needed on manifestations of anti-Semitism.&quot; The ministry refused to respond to a question regarding what kind of staff work is done before issuing a statement in Russian and on whose authority the statement had been issued.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And maybe Manafort’s interest was by chance identical to Israel’s? Maybe? And maybe Manafort was just bragging for no reason and the Israeli didn’t even know about the interests behind the scenes?</p> \n<p>It’s certainly possible that Manafort used the information about the statement that was being planned in Israel in any case, and faithfully represented the position of the foreign service, in order to accumulate credit from his employers. It’s also possible that he pressed for the publication of an existing position that was already in the pipeline.</p> \n<p>But it’s also possible that, as claimed in the U.S. indictment, there was a “senior Israeli official” who acted on his behalf on the issue, directly or as an intermediary, and perhaps even without knowing who was behind the step and why, and in effect by doing so was also in the service of Putin.</p> \n<p>A comprehensive examination of the publication of the statement, along with an official request to receive the information from the U.S. authorities, could make that clear.</p>",

        "text":["<p>At the premiere screening of the film “The Oslo Diaries” at the Jerusalem Film Festival about six weeks ago, the atmosphere in the auditorium told the whole story. A substantial representation of the Israeli left, headed by key figures such as Zehava Galon, Tamar Zandberg and Yossi Beilin, filled the hall. They came wearing radiant faces, a festive sense of jubilation and with what seemed like total willingness to go back in time and repress if only for a moment the decadence without. The smiles were broad, the clothes were elaborate. They seemed prepared to enjoy themselves one more time amid those forgotten glorious moments, those faraway times when the Israeli left not only offered hope, but took initiative, demonstrated leadership and political daring and made astonishing achievements, a time when it was not even embarrassed to talk about that forgotten concept, “peace.”</p> \n<p>And yet, the documentary film produced by Mor Loushy and Daniel Sivan did not let the decadent holiday mood that filled the Jerusalem Cinematheque go to their heads. It quickly wiped off smiles and shattered hearts.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“The Oslo Diaries” turned an exhaustive, two-year diplomatic mission into a capsule of distilled emotions that erupted across the screen and washed over the viewers combinations of hope and despair, euphoria and melancholy, the joy of success and the burning sensation of failure. Viewers were drawn into a wrenching emotional journey that ventured between these distant poles with sharp frenetic movements. When the lights went up in the auditorium, one could easily discern that the lighthearted wedding ambiance had faded without a trace. In its place were tears of pain, the dejection of lost opportunity and an especially searing sensation of yearning for those distant and forgotten days when the Israeli left was still relevant and had something to offer.</p> \n<p>“The Oslo Diaries” premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, won the Jerusalem Film Festival award for best screenplay, and has been purchased for broadcast by the American HBO network. Last Thursday, which marked the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Principles (aka the Oslo I Accord) on the White House lawn and the historic handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, the film was screened at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque and was broadcast on American television. Israel’s Yes Docu channel broadcast that day the documentary’s expanded, three-episode version of the documentary.</p> \n<p>Both the series and the film are based on personal diaries written by several of the Israelis and Palestinians who spent many months around that table, sweating blood until they succeeded in formulating agreements that nearly, but only nearly, released the two peoples from the nightmare of a conflict that has refused to loosen its grip over this land.</p> \n<p>Excerpts of these diaries – written by Ron Pundak, Uri Savir, Ahmed Karih (Abu Alaa), Yossi Beilin, Shimon Peres and Hanan Ashrawi – are voiced by narrators throughout the series, providing a glimpse not only behind the curtains of the talks, but also into the perceptions and inner thoughts of those who dared to sit down around that table with persons who until only moments earlier were considered their worst, cruelest enemies. The archival materials and interviews illustrate what was simultaneously happening out in the field – in Israel and in the territories – and was seeping into the negotiating room bubble, where fears and prejudices continued to melt away.</p> \n<p>The Oslo Accords has not gone down in the history pages as a stunning success, but Loushy and Sivan stubbornly insist that they consider “The Oslo Diaries” an optimistic film. “We have screened this film in several countries, and everywhere we showed it they told us, ‘I am looking at the Israelis and Palestinians in the film, and there isn’t a single one that I wouldn’t want to have coffee with,’” explains Sivan. “So, if these are the scariest people around, if these are the bloodthirsty Palestinian murderers and the cruel Israeli storm troopers, then evidently there are still people on the other side with whom you can talk. As far as I’m concerned, that is a very optimistic statement.”</p> \n<p>“When we came to Ramallah to conduct interviews for the film, our knees were shaking, but we found ourselves sitting in front of people who wanted to talk,” adds Loushy. “The current sense of despair is obvious. The situation on both sides is terrible, and it is uncertain where any hope may be found. Nevertheless, there are people on both sides interested in reaching a solution. The entire Palestinian leadership was interviewed. They wanted to talk, they wanted to say, ‘You have a partner.’ At a time when there are no Palestinians in the Israeli media, when the other side is invisible, this series shows that it is nevertheless possible, that there is a partner, and that there is therefore room for hope.”</p> \n<p>Blown opportunities</p> \n<p>Loushy and Sivan are known primarily for their Ophir Prize-winning film “Censored Voices,” which exposed three years ago sections that had been censored from the best seller “The Seventh Day” that came out following the Six-Day War. Loushy directed that film, Sivan took part in writing production and editing, and although the creative collaboration between them has persisted into several other films, “The Oslo Diaries” is the first time they are sharing the directing credit. The couple has two children. They were interviewed via Skype because they were at work on a new project in the United States. They apologize that they cannot reveal the subject of said project.</p> \n<p>They decided to bring the story of the Oslo Accords to the screen after observing that so many films about wars were being made, but not a single film was trying to ascertain why there was, in fact, no peace here.</p> \n<p>“It is a na&iuml;ve question, of course, but in our opinion, there are two factors contributing to this,” notes Sivan. “One is that it has something terribly not photogenic about it, because there are no explosions or blood spurting across the screen in negotiations. And the second thing is that there is something frustrating about it, because there are no good guys and bad guys, no losers and victors, no catharsis. All you hear frpm both sides are mainly sighs of despair.”</p> \n<p>They addressed the photogenic challenge partly by means of dramatic reenactments of the talks held in the Norwegian snow and through use of fascinating archive materials. As for the lack of blood spurting on the screen, the Israeli reality, which hemorrhaged during those years amounts of blood that could sustain 1,000 movies, compensated for it. As for the paucity of identifiable good guys and bad guys, they dealt with that by means of the hysteria of despair, fear and self-destructiveness found around the negotiating table. On every occasion, someone or something was found to pull the rug out from under the talks, thwarting hopes for peace, and bringing the Middle East back into the regular abnormal situation from which it has been unsuccessful at extricating itself for so many years.</p> \n<p>“The Oslo Diaries” highlights the exceedingly rare hope that emerged at the time, offering an escape route from this lunacy, as well as the tragedy of how it was trampled by an endless series of acts of violence: suicide terror attacks, closures clamped on the territories, the massacre committed by Baruch Goldstein at the Tomb of the Patriarchs, the kidnapping of Nachshon Wachsman, a leader who fanned flames in Zion Square (without knowing the extent to which he would yet succeed in cultivating this talent for crowd incitement) and the assassination of a prime minister, of course. Each of the sides contributed at the time from its finest talents to crush the hope of Oslo.</p> \n<p>“I came initially to this film from the radical left, from a stance according to which Israel never wanted peace,” confesses Sivan. “I came to it with an aggressive approach, one of ‘now we will expose the atrocities and show how the Israelis did their manipulations and how the Palestinians caved in’. But over the course of our work, my opinions changed. It was an authentic attempt to make peace. For instance Rabin did not need the Oslo Accords; his situation in the polls was perfectly fine. It was not an attempt to save his career as was the case with Ariel Sharon’s disengagement. And there were people like Beilin, Savir and (Yoel) Zinger who really believed that this is the way. And after this shift of perspective, I realized that this is not a story of two generals who fooled their peoples, but a tragedy about two politicians with a lot of courage, and about two peoples who did not want this peace.”</p> \n<p>Loushy comments, as well, that she arrived “with a readiness to pulverize this agreement.” She notes: “The film really shows how Rabin did not really go the whole distance, how there were botched opportunities, and the fact that Israel pulled out of such a small area in Oslo II. I, too, was surprised to discover that there was a real willingness to resolve the conflict, to end the occupation. Rabin’s speech in the Knesset before Oslo II, for example, in which he said that we are occupying 2.5 million Palestinians, is something that would not go down today. So, it’s true, there were plenty of holes in the agreement and it could have been better, but when all is said and done there were two leaders here who wanted to go for peace. For me, that was the main discovery, and ironically, it also holds out hope.”</p> \n<p>The series “The Oslo Diaries” explains, among other things, how the secret talks came to be, and how their participants masked what was going on. For instance, Savir, the then-director general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told everyone he was going to the Cannes Film Festival, but as soon as he got to his hotel room, he hung a “Do Not Disturb” sign on the door and took off for Oslo. She relates how the Palestinians surprised the Israelis with the proposal that Israel evacuate Gaza first, and how Rabin forfeited a historic opportunity to sign his name to a permanent agreement, skipping through all of the intermediate stages. And she makes it clear that following the Rabin assassination, a document was placed before Shimon Peres in which both of the sides had already agreed on all of the issues of the permanent settlement, but that he refused to sign it, explaining that he lacked the mandate to take such a far-reaching move. Although most of the revelations have already been published, their packaging together and the Rashomon construct that makes it possible to assess the events from several points of view – that are not only Israeli – are what make this series so fascinating.</p> \n<p>We are still bleeding</p> \n<p>What tears at one’s heart in particular while watching the documentary is the realization that even if trust had been built around the negotiating table, agreements had been reached and brave bonds of friendship had been woven, these successes failed to seep into the street. There, the two peoples were unable to shake themselves of the fears and prejudices, which eventually toppled the agreements that had been reached with so much sweat and tears, and through a rare convergence of circumstances that it is difficult to know when, if at all, they will reoccur.</p> \n<p>“One of the depressing insights we had in the course of the work was that the Israelis and Palestinians are both very strong peoples, the sort that will not be broken in time of war even if they sustain serious setbacks. But in an era of peace, after only two or three terror attacks, they will get up and say, ‘That’s it, we’ve gone as far as can with this, let’s go back to shelling,’” comments Sivan. “And that is sad, because you can see it happening on both sides. On the Palestinian side, it is another humiliation at a checkpoint and another curfew, and then they throw up their hands. And on the Israeli side a terror attack and another terror attack, and suddenly all of the people who can keep it up for years in Lebanon are saying that the home front is not strong enough to handle the stress.”</p> \n<p>The inability to pass the hope and trust from the negotiating room to the people may be compared, in his opinion, to a Greek tragedy. “Rabin and Arafat hated one another until the last day. Beilin said that only after Rabin was assassinated did the relationship between them become really close,” Sivan says, smiling. “So, they would not be friends, but they did take a blind leap of faith of ‘I am relying on you to act on behalf of my interests,’ and in this way they started to trust one another. The fatal error was that Rabin did not come and say, this is my friend Arafat, and Arafat did not say, I am a friend of the Zionists. Each of them withdrew into his own place. Arafat said we will return to Jerusalem no matter what, and Rabin said that it is impossible to trust these Arabs. Neither of them got up and shouted, ‘This is our partner.’”</p> \n<p>Loushy adds: “There was a failure to understand that in order for the talks to succeed, each one had to sell to his people the understanding that if things are good for my neighbor, then things will be good for you, too. It didn’t happen, and it is tragic. There were people there who wanted to go past peace and powerful bonds were woven between them – Uri Savir and Abu Alaa, for example, are still good friends – but we are still bleeding here, so this is no doubt a tragedy. No one says Oslo succeeded, and time does not play in our favor. Precisely because of this, it is important to go back and see how it could be done better. We need a leader who will say in a strong, clear voice that this is the solution.”</p> \n<p>This film is an important outcry for them. “This is a very painful shout of the here and now,” says Sivan. “When we started working on the series three years ago, people told us, ‘Bibi is going to make peace, he is cooking up something at the highest echelons, release the series quickly before it becomes irrelevant.’ That didn’t happen, of course. So, I can only wish that in another few years the series will be irrelevant, that it be forgotten and expunged from the Israeli canon,” says Sivan.</p> \n<p>Loushy agrees: “The despair at the current situation is our outcry. An outcry that says ‘Enough, that’s as far as it goes.’ It is illogical that archives about Bibi 25 years ago show him standing on the stage and speaking, and you look around and understand that nothing has changed.”</p> \n<p>Not an internal discourse</p> \n<p>Now, in Los Angeles, they are surrounded by people who are troubled by the possibility that Donald Trump is crushing their dream of a better life. “I say to them, ‘At least you folks have a chance. We, on the other hand, live in a place where only ten percent are saying that we are interested in two states,’” says Sivan. “My optimism is at a low, but specifically for that reason it was important for us to raise an outcry. Our struggle now is to rise up and demand a solution, to fight so that this will happen.”</p> \n<p>He takes advantage of the opportunity to take a jab at the venue on which this interview is being published. “I don’t want to be the Haaretz newspaper that in the past few years has tended toward an internal conversation that addresses itself to one quarter of one percent of the people, an attempt to say let’s analyze why the left is not left enough, let’s slaughter Rabin because he was not a man of the left. I think the left has to assess itself, but since we are living in a state in which the discourse is not between Gideon Levy and Tamar Gozansky, but is taking place much more so between Elor Azaria and people who ascend the Temple Mount looking for the Third Temple there – it is a conversation that may be interesting, but it is not relevant.”</p> \n<p>Sivan says that the most important conversation that should happen now is a call for optimism. “We need to say out loud that there was hope here once, and that it can be restored,” he says. “To make it clear that Israel will not be an occupying state for eternity, because at some point in time the Palestinians will rise up, there will be another war, there will be an economic boycott, or the Israelis will stand up and say, ‘We are fed up.’ At some point it will end, and the question is only when – will it only happen in 50 years or in another 100 years, and how many people will die until that happens?”</p> \n<p>He stresses the goal should be to bring that day closer, “instead of self-flagellating and wondering where we screwed up in Oslo.” He adds: “On the contrary. We should say Oslo was an outstanding route, not because it was a stage-by-stage agreement and not because we agreed to divide Jerusalem, but because it was a joint declaration by two sides who agreed to concede the idea of a whole, indivisible country. This is the first time since Begin that we divided up the land and said, friends, we will not live on the entire Land of Israel but rather on part of it. And that was an immense accomplishment. The same holds true for the realization that the Palestinians have a national identity and a flag that they are permitted to wave. That is what Oslo achieved, that is what must be extolled, and that is the path we should continue to walk down.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is feeling overall pleased as the new Jewish calendar year kicks off. He has total control over the political system, the criminal investigations against him have disappeared into the drawers of the attorney general’s office, the police chief who annoyed him is on the way out, and most important, the policy he has been preaching for 25 years is enjoying an unprecedented heyday thanks to United States President Donald Trump’s complete support.</p> \n<p>The announcements coming out of the White House in past weeks sound just like Netanyahu’s speeches at the UN General Assembly, on Capitol Hill and at the Likud Central Committee. The decisions to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, withdraw from the nuclear accord and renew sanctions on Iran, cut aid to UNRWA and reduce recognition of Palestinian refugees, close the PLO office in Washington and warn the International Criminal Court not to mess with Israel all seem to be taken straight out of Netanyahu’s speeches.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;All sticks, no carrot: Six times Trump targeted the Palestinians&nbsp;■&nbsp;Palestinians rage at Trump's closure of U.S. mission, but some in Ramallah see an opportunity | Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;Will Israel ever recover its standing in a post-Trump America? | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And as if all that weren’t enough, Israel also enjoys full American backing for its airstrikes in Syria and for using sniper fire to halt the protesters at the Gaza border.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is not giving holiday interviews to media outlets in Israel and it has been years since Haaretz interviewed him. I last met him about two years ago and yet I tried to imagine what an interview with the prime minister would be like about his situation and that of the country on the eve of Yom Kippur</p> \n<p>Mr. Prime Minister, it seems there’s not much left for you to ask from Trump.</p> \n<p>“I again want to thank President Trump, a true friend of the Jewish people, for giving Israel a diplomatic Iron Dome. Trump understands that Zionism is a profoundly just movement and that the Palestinian national movement is an organization of lies and murder. With his support for Israel, he is restoring the West to its golden days, when the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate document promised all of Palestine as a national home for the Jewish people; and he is rolling back the fabricated invention of a Palestinian people, which was created by anti-Semitic bureaucrats in the British Foreign Office and copied by Western governments since then. Trump has been bold enough to tear the mask off the face of the Palestinians and their supporters, and after the revolutions of the Arab Spring, the Syrian civil war and the flood of refugees that is threatening to drown Europe in a Muslim deluge, other Western leaders and governments will follow his example.”</p> \n<p>You’re not worried that things will change? Sooner or later, Trump will be out of office, and meanwhile Israel is losing its supporters in the Democratic Party, which might retake control of Congress in the fall.</p> \n<p>“Trump is giving us a unique opportunity to defeat the PLO and to shatter the hostile ideology of the Mufti, Yasser Arafat and Abu Mazen [Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas]. If we resolutely stand up for ourselves, irreversible facts will be set that will serve Israel’s interests. Even if the Democrats return to the White House in the future, they won’t close the embassy in Jerusalem and they won’t re-inflate the number of Palestinian refugees.</p> \n<p>“When Abu Mazen exits the stage, it’s unlikely that a new leader will arise who will be as widely accepted by the world. He has no heir apparent, no elections are on the horizon in the Palestinian Authority, we won’t release the terrorist Marwan Barghouti from prison and I expect that the PLO will gradually wither away and disappear, despite the inevitable attempts by European countries to keep it alive. As long as Trump is in power, time is in our favor and it’s important to make the most of it.”</p> \n<p>You don’t make many statements about the Palestinian issue. You prefer to talk about the struggle with Iran, or to be photographed with pilots and soldiers, without referring to their daily mission in the territories.</p> \n<p>“The public sees me at the nuclear reactor and at pilot graduation ceremonies, or meeting with Trump, Putin and dozens of other world leaders, and asks itself: When our pilots are flying out on another mission in Syria, do I want Netanyahu there with the general staff and on the phone with the White House, or do I want Yair Lapid, Avi Gabbay, Tzipi Livni or Gideon Sa’ar? The answer is clear: Since I returned to power, the surveys consistently show that the public prefers me as prime minister over anyone else.”</p> \n<p>It’s all predetermined</p> \n<p>Still, the conflict with the Palestinians affects Israel’s present and future more than anything else. Do you really think that the status quo of a blockade of Gaza and creeping annexation of the West Bank, including settlement expansion and security cooperation with the PA, can go on forever?</p> \n<p>“My critics say that I’m only consumed with political survival in order to receive gifts from billionaires and to please my wife Sara. I suggest that everyone read ‘A Place Among the Nations,’ the book I wrote 25 years ago. If you do, you’ll see that my positions haven’t changed one inch. Already then I described the Israeli left as the heir of the anti-Zionist Jewish movements that denied the Jewish people’s right to its country, and explained how this position seeped into the core of Israeli public opinion and allowed the PLO to erect a terror base in the heart of our land with the help of the Oslo Accords. I am glad that today the vast majority of the public, including leaders of the opposition, understand that I was right, that there is no partner and can be no partner, because the Palestinians will never accept Israel’s just right to exist in any borders. I exposed this a decade ago in the Bar-Ilan speech, when I called for Palestinian recognition of the nation-state of the Jewish people, and again in the past months when we passed the nation-state law in the Knesset, which exposed the left’s ingrained opposition to Zionism’s very existence.”</p> \n<p>Aren’t you concerned by the rift in Israeli society surrounding the nation-state law?</p> \n<p>“There is no question that the internal consensus in Jewish society in Israel is the most crucial source of our strength versus the Palestinians and their supporters. Whenever Israel has made concessions to the Palestinians, we stood on the brink of civil war. We saw this with the Rabin assassination and on the eve of the Gaza disengagement. Today the internal rift and civil war are found on the Palestinian side, not on our side. Which is why I am adamantly opposed to any internal Palestinian reconciliation. Better for them to quarrel and for us to remain united. I’m not fazed by the reactions to the nation-state law. The position expressed by the law is accepted by a decisive majority of the Jewish public in Israel. Even the Zionist Union and Yesh Atid that voted against the law didn’t really try to protest or it to muster public opinion against it. The Arabs and their supporters in the far left were left alone with their PLO flags. The center supports the essence of the nation-state law and will be fine with it once it ceases to view it as a tool with which to fight me.”</p> \n<p>It’s easy to portray Gabbay and Lapid as lacking in diplomatic and security experience, as men who cannot be viewed by the public as potential prime ministers. But what about Ehud Barak, your most scathing critic? His experience is indisputable, he’s been warning that you are dragging Israel toward the catastrophe of a binational state, and he did trounce you in the 1999 election.</p> \n<p>“I know Barak very well, his abilities and weaknesses, from the days when he was my commander in the army and defense minister in my government. He was always good at phrasing things, but let’s get to the heart of things. First of all, without a political party or power, Barak is only helping me, because his Tweets and interviews reveal the shallowness and emptiness of the current left-wing leadership. Essentially, Barak is very critical and angry, but he doesn’t offer any other way that differs from my policies. The media is also frequently critical of me and my wife Sara, but totally supports my policy: against annexation and withdrawal, for the fight against the hypocrisy and anti-Semitism in Europe, in favor of cultivating a strong military and aggressive and proportionate use of force.”</p> \n<p>‘Zero funerals’ policy</p> \n<p>A few weeks ago, you presented the cabinet with the “2030 Defense Outlook.” Is that a hint of when you wish to retire?</p> \n<p>“So soon? I suggest that you all be patient. I can sum up my security outlook with the heading ‘zero funerals.’ I experienced bereavement in my family when my brother Yoni fell at Entebbe. A few years before that, when I was in the army, Haim Ben-Yonah from Kibbutz Yehiam, who enlisted with me, was killed in action at the Suez Canal. At his funeral I met his mother Shlomit, a Holocaust survivor, and through her I understood the deep meaning of Jewish fate. It was one of the formative experiences of my life. I want us to have as few bereaved parents like Shlomit and my parents Benzion and Tzila as possible. Which is why we must strengthen the air force, our cyber capabilities, our missile defense systems and the security fences at the borders, and have fewer ground operations. Israel can achieve its security objectives and safeguard its soldiers.”</p> \n<p>You’re fond of saying “I was right” and “I was the first one to see,” but often the perception is that you’re hesitant when it comes to making decisions, that you get nervous in crisis situations and end up getting dragged after your coalition partners, especially Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked.</p> \n<p>“Ahad Ha’am spoke about two leadership types, the priest and the prophet. He described the prophet as one who is wholly and utterly dedicated to an idea, and the priest who tends to bow to necessity and strike a deal with reality. You in the media love the ‘doers’ who tout magic solutions to every problem, demonstrate mastery of the little details and cultivate a court of followers and personal loyalty. Think about Shimon Peres, Arik Sharon or Ehud Olmert. You have a harder time with ideological prime ministers like Menachem Begin and me. We think long-term, we don’t rush into decisions, we get up when knocked down and wait for long-term processes to take shape. They are loyal to doing and we are loyal to the path, and that’s why they crisscross from one party to another and meander in their positions, while I’ve stayed in place and waited for the public to come to understand the disasters caused by the Oslo Accords and the Gaza disengagement. I don’t have a court of faithful adherents. I don’t care if the defense minister is Ya’alon or Lieberman – the question is what is right at that moment. Bennett and Shaked? They carry out my policy and give voice to my positions and enable me to look moderate and responsible in relation to the defense and court systems.”</p> \n<p>President Trump likes to complain about the “deep state,” about senior officials from the Pentagon, the intelligence community and the State Department he says are out to undermine him. We’ve read about senior administration officials trying to thwart the president’s policy. Do we have a “deep state” in Israel?</p> \n<p>“I understand Trump well. In my first term, I had to contend with an oppositional leadership in the army and the intelligence community, which supported the Oslo Accords and worked to foil my policies. When I came back to power in 2009, I encountered a similar situation when the chief of staff and the heads of the Mossad and the Shin Bet then opposed a strike on the nuclear sites in Iran and collaborated with the Obama administration to halt the planned offensive, which I led together with Ehud Barak. They leaked nonsense about whiskey and cigars against us. That type of situation is completely gone now. The Mossad chief acts at my behest, and the chief of staff and head of the Shin Bet act in coordination with me. Everyone saw what happened to the police chief whom I promoted from the anonymity of the Shin Bet but who didn’t heed my authority. The leakers can go on Ilana Dayan’s show and talk all the poppycock they want. The public ignores them.”</p> \n<p>Trump likes you, the polls predict a landslide victory for you in the next election and the security leadership accepts your authority. But you are also a suspect in three corruption cases, your former close aides have agreed to serve as state witnesses against you, and while the law enforcement system is grinding ahead slowly, it appears convinced of your guilt. Do you fear an indictment? Why don’t you explain to the public what happened, instead of writing unconvincing Facebook posts saying that “Case 4000 has completely collapsed”?</p> \n<p>“I will meet your challenge. A majority of the Israeli public wants me in power because during my tenure terror attacks have declined, the economy is growing, the happiness index is high and the airport is packed with travelers. Before the last election, I was afraid of losing and wanted my press coverage to be less negative and hostile. Therefore I tried to reach a deal with Noni Mozes. When the contacts with him went nowhere, I saw that Shaul Elovitch, the owner of the competing site, was more open. Now people are saying that I harmed the public interest. Nonsense. Aluf, you explain to me the broadband reform. Hard for you to do, right? But everyone can explain why Netanyahu should remain in power. It’s good for the country, and that was all I ever worked for.”</p> \n<p>Thank you.</p> \n<p>“Thank you, and I wish you and all Haaretz readers and the entire House of Israel a Gmar Chatima Tova.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>An earthquake is quietly rocking the Jewish world.</p> \n<p>In the 18th century, Jews began playing a decisive role in the promotion of universalism, because universalism promised them redemption from their political subjection. Through universalism, Jews could, in principle, be free and equal to those who had dominated them. This is why, in the centuries that followed, Jews participated in disproportionate numbers in communist and socialist causes. This is also why Jews were model citizens of countries, such as France or the United States, with universalist constitutions.</p> \n<p>The history of Jews as promoters of Enlightenment and universalist values, however, is drawing to a close. We are the stunned witnesses of new alliances between Israel, Orthodox factions of Judaism throughout the world, and the new global populism in which ethnocentrism and even racism hold an undeniable place.</p> \n<p>When Prime Minister Netanyahu chose to align himself politically with Donald Trump before and after the U.S. presidential election of 2016, some people could still give him the benefit of doubt. Admittedly, Trump was surrounded by people like Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, who reeked of racism and anti-Semitism, but no one was sure of the direction the new presidency would take. Even if Trump refused to condemn the anti-Semitic elements of his electoral base or the Ku Klux Klan, which had enthusiastically backed him, and even if it took him a long time to dissociate himself from David Duke – we were not yet certain of the presence of anti-Semitism in Trump’s discourse and strategies (especially since his daughter Ivanka was a convert to Judaism).</p> \n<p>But the events in Charlottesville in August 2017 no longer allowed for doubt. The neo-Nazi demonstrators committed violent acts against peaceful counter-protesters, killing one woman by plowing through a crowd with a car (an act reminiscent in its technique of terrorist attacks in Europe). Trump reacted to the events by condemning both the neo-Nazis and white supremacists and their opponents. The world was shocked by his conflation of the two groups, but Jerusalem did not object. Once again, the indulgent (or cynical) observer could have interpreted this silence as the reluctant obeisance of a vassal toward his overlord (of all the countries in the world, Israel receives the most military aid from the United States). One was entitled to think that Israel had no choice but to collaborate, despite the American leader’s outward signs of anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>This interpretation, however, is no longer tenable. Before and since Charlottesville, Netanyahu has courted other leaders who are either unbothered by anti-Semitism or straightforwardly sympathetic to it, and upon whom Israel is not economically dependent. His concessions go as far as participating in a partial form of Holocaust denial.</p> \n<p>Take the case of Hungary. Under the government of Viktor Orban, the country shows troubling signs of legitimizing anti-Semitism. In 2015, for example, the Hungarian government announced its intention to erect a statue to commemorate Balint Homan, a Holocaust-era minister who played a decisive role in the murder or deportation of nearly 600,000 Hungarian Jews. Far from being an isolated incident, just a few months later, in 2016, another statue was erected in tribute to Gyorgy Don&aacute;th, one of the architects of anti-Jewish legislation during World War II. It was thus unsurprising to hear Orban employing anti-Semitic tropes during his reelection campaign in 2017, especially against Georges Soros, the Jewish, Hungarian-American billionaire-philanthropist who supports liberal causes, including that of open borders and immigration. Reanimating the anti-Semitic clich&eacute; about the power of Jews, Orban accused Soros of harboring intentions to undermine Hungary.</p> \n<p>Whom did Netanyahu choose to support? Not the anxious Hungarian Jewish community that protested bitterly against the anti-Semitic rhetoric of Orban’s government; nor did he choose to support the liberal Jew Soros, who defends humanitarian causes. Instead, the prime minister created new fault lines, preferring political allies to members of the tribe. He backed Orban, the same person who resurrects the memory of dark anti-Semites. When the Israeli ambassador in Budapest protested the erection of the infamous statue, he was publicly contradicted by none other than Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>To my knowledge, the Israeli government has never officially protested Orban’s anti-Semitic inclinations and affinities. In fact, when the Israeli ambassador in Budapest did try to do so, he was quieted down by Jerusalem. Not long before the Hungarian election, Netanyahu went to the trouble of visiting Hungary, thus giving a “kosher certificate” to Orban and exonerating him of the opprobrium attached to anti-Semitism and to an endorsement of figures active in the Shoah. When Netanyahu visited Budapest, he was given a glacial reception by the Federation of the Jewish Communities, while Orban gave him a warm welcome. To further reinforce their touching friendship, Netanyahu invited Orban to pay a reciprocal visit to Israel this past July, receiving him in a way usually reserved for the most devoted national allies.</p> \n<p>The relationship with Poland is just as puzzling. As a reminder, Poland is governed by the nationalist Law and Justice party, which has an uncompromising policy against refugees and appears to want to eliminate the independence of the courts by means of a series of reforms that would allow the government to control the judiciary branch. In 2016 the Law and Justice-led government eliminated the official body whose mission was to deal with problems of racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance, arguing that the organization had become “useless.”</p> \n<p>Encouraged by this and other governmental declarations and policies, signs of nationalism multiplied within Polish society. In February 2018, president Andrzej Duda declared that he would sign a law making it illegal to accuse the Polish nation of having collaborated with the Nazis. Accusing Poland of collusion in the Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities would be from now prosecutable. Israel initially protested the proposed legislation, but then in June, Benjamin Netanyahu and the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, signed an agreement exonerating Poland of any and all crimes against the Jews during the time of the German occupation. Israel also acceded to Poland’s move to outlaw the expression “Polish concentration camp.” Moreover, Netanyahu even signed a statement stipulating that anti-Semitism is identical to anti-Polonism, and that only a handful of sad Polish individuals were responsible for persecuting Jews – not the nation as a whole.</p> \n<p>In July, that declaration was roundly condemned by Yad Vashem, as well as by a group of 21 Israeli historians, members of the Academy of Sciences and Humanities. But the stupefying result remained unchanged, with Netanyahu, the head of the Israeli government, giving his support to what amounts to a version of Holocaust denial. Netanyahu the history buff could not have been unaware that, in the words of Polish commentator Sawomir Sierakowski, “two-thirds of the 250,000 Jews who escaped during the Nazis’ ‘liquidation’ of Jewish ghettos in 1942 had been killed by 1945, most of them by Poles or with Polish participation.”</p> \n<p>If Israel still had a moral standing on one topic (sadly probably the only remaining one), it is with regard to the Shoah, but Netanyahu undermined it by making the history and memory of the Holocaust a politically negotiable and tradable commodity. And if that’s not enough, earlier this month, Israel hosted Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte, a man who has proudly compared himself to Hitler.</p> \n<p>This is a decisive turning point for Zionism, which places Netanyahu in an avant-garde of sorts, bringing the Revisionist Zionism he claims to represent to the final stage of its historical logic.</p> \n<p>As a political doctrine and practice, traditional social-democratic Zionism had sought to find and maintain an equilibrium between three poles: Jewish communities in the Diaspora, Israel’s security interests, and international political alliances with the world’s strong democracies (cooperation with rogue states was for the most part unofficial). The memory of the Holocaust was the moral and ideological glue supporting and holding together this tripartite structure: Diaspora Jewry, Israel and enlightened nations were all determined that “never again” would such a crime take place against Jews or anyone else.</p> \n<p>Yet for the first time in its history, Israel is putting the sensibility and interests of Jewish communities on the back burner. Israel and its government have even shown a willingness to desacralize the memory of the Shoah and make deals with open or hidden anti-Semites. This is a fascinating phenomenon, one that begs the question: Why is that the case?</p> \n<p>Netanyahu here promotes a new vision of Zionism that demands a new international strategy, in response. Netanyahu has a deep political affinity to Trump, Orban and Morawiecki, and above all with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (During this summer’s Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki, the leaders declared their mutual admiration, which is now on display for all to see.) Netanyahu has lost interest in the mostly liberal American Jewish community not only because by predilection he prefers to cultivate a few rich people rather than groups and communities (except at election time), but also because he has a genuine and authentic contempt for liberalism (the American Jewish community is predominantly liberal).</p> \n<p>His alliance with the dark leaders evoked above is not (or not only) an opportunistic one but rather one of affinity. Netanyahu is much closer to these leaders than he is to Ze’ev Jabotinsky (who once proposed that every prime minister who is a Jew should have a deputy who is an Arab, and vice versa).</p> \n<p>All of these leaders share a nativist vision, which is to say that they strongly oppose the ethnic, religious or racial dilution of their country by immigrants or universalist rights. Israel has in fact long pioneered the model to which these nations aspire: predicating citizenship on ethnic and religious affiliation (the Law of Return), making impossible domestic marriages between Jews and people of different religions, opposing immigration by non-Jews and ethnic inter-mixing, even as it seeks to preserve the mantle of democracy (mostly because the name comes with many privileges): Israel has claimed for decades that it is both democratic and Jewish.</p> \n<p>For their part, Ann Coulter, a far-right American pundit, and Richard Spencer, president of the National Policy Institute, a supremacist think tank, often cite Israel as a model state of ethnic purity to which they aspire (in fact Israel is far from “ethnic purity” since Arabs, both Christian and Muslim, make up 20 percent of its population). The nation-state law (privileging Jewish citizens over non-Jewish ones) recently enacted in Israel is a more explicit and radical version of the ethnic model of democracy to which the country has long subscribed.</p> \n<p>Like the American, Hungarian and Polish alt-right, Israel wants to restore national pride unstained by “self-hating” critics. Like the Poles, for two decades now, Israel has been waging a war over the official narrative of the nation, trying to expunge school textbooks of inconvenient facts (such as the fact that Arabs were actively chased out of Israel in 1948). In order to quash criticism, Israel’s Culture Ministry now predicates funding to creative institutions on loyalty to the state. As in Hungary, the Israeli government persecutes NGOs like Breaking the Silence, a group whose only sin has been to give soldiers a forum for reporting their army experiences and to oppose Israeli settlers’ violence against Palestinians or the expropriation of land, in violation of international law. Purging critics from public life (as expressed in barring the entry into the country of BDS supporters, denying funding to theater companies or films critical of Israel, etc.) is an expression of direct state power.</p> \n<p>When it comes to refugees, Israel, like Hungary and Poland, refuses to comply with international law. For almost a decade now, Israel has not respected international conventions on the rights of refugees even though it is a signatory of said conventions: The state has detained refugees in camps, and imprisoned and deported them. Like Poland, Israel is trying to do away with the independence of its judiciary. Israel feels comfortable with the anti-democratic extreme right of European states in the same way that one feels comfortable with a family member who belches and gossips, losing any sense of self-control or table manners.</p> \n<p>More generally, these countries today share a deep common political core: fear of foreigners at the borders (it must be specified, however, that Israelis’ fears are less imaginary than those of Hungarians or Polish); references to the nation’s pride untainted by a dubious past, casting critics as traitors to the nation; and outlawing human rights organizations and contesting global norms based on moral principles. The Netanyahu-Trump-Putin triumvirate has a definite shared vision and strategy: to create a political bloc that would undermine the current liberal international order and its key players.</p> \n<p>In a recent article about Trump for Project Syndicate, legal scholar Mark S. Weiner suggested that Trump’s political vision and practice follow (albeit, unknowingly) the precepts of Carl Schmitt, the German legal scholar who joined the Nazi Party in 1933.</p> \n<p>“In place of normativity and universalism, Schmitt offers a theory of political identity based on a principle that Trump doubtless appreciates deeply from his pre-political career: land,” wrote Weiner. “For Schmitt, a political community forms when a group of people recognizes that they share some distinctive cultural trait that they believe is worth defending with their lives. This cultural basis of sovereignty is ultimately rooted in the distinctive geography… that a people inhabit. At stake here are opposing positions about the relation between national identity and law. According to Schmitt, the community’s nomos [the Greek word for “law”] or sense of itself that grows from its geography, is the philosophical precondition for its law. For liberals, by contrast, the nation is defined first and foremost by its legal commitments.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu and his ilk subscribe to this Schmittian vision of the political, making legal commitments subordinate to geography and race. Land and race are the covert and overt motives of Netanyahu’s politics. He and his coalition have, for example, waged a politics of slow annexation in the West Bank, either in the hope of expelling or subjugating the 2.5 million Palestinians living there, or of controlling them.</p> \n<p>They have also radicalized the country’s Jewishness with the highly controversial nation-state law. Playing footsie with anti-Semitic leaders may seem to contradict the nation-state law, but it is motivated by the same statist and Schmittian logic whereby the state no longer views itself as committed to representing all of its citizens, but rather aims to expand territory; increase its power by designating enemies; define who belongs and who doesn’t; narrow the definition of citizenship; harden the boundaries of the body collective; and undermine the international liberal order. The line connecting Orban to the nationality law is the sheer and raw expansion of state power.</p> \n<p>Courting Orban or Morawiecki means having allies in the European Council and Commission, which would help Israel block unwanted votes, weaken Palestinian international strategies and create a political bloc that could impose a new international order. Netanyahu and his buddies have a strategy and are trying to reshape the international order to meet their own domestic goals. They are counting on the ultimate victory of reactionary forces to have a free hand to do what they please inside the state.</p> \n<p>But what is most startling is the fact that in order to promote his illiberal policies, Netanyahu is willing to snub and dismiss the greatest part of the Jewish people, its most accepted rabbis and intellectuals, and the vast number of Jews who have supported, through money or political action, the State of Israel. This suggests a clear and undeniable shift from a politics based on the people to a politics based on the land.</p> \n<p>For the majority of Jews outside Israel, human rights and the struggle against anti-Semitism are core values. Netanyahu’s enthusiastic support for authoritarian, anti-Semitic leaders is an expression of a profound shift in the state’s identity as a representative of the Jewish people to a state that aims to advance its own expansion through seizure of land, violation of international law, exclusion and discrimination. This is not fascism per se, but certainly one of its most distinctive features.</p> \n<p>This state of affairs is worrisome but it is also likely to have two interesting and even positive developments. The first is that in the same way that Israel has freed itself from its “Jewish complex” – abandoning its role as leader and center of the Jewish people as a whole – many or most Jews will now likely free themselves from their Israel complex, finally understanding that Israel’s values and their own are deeply at odds. World Jewish Congress head Ron Lauder’s August 13, 2018, op-ed in The New York Times, which was close to disowning Israel, is a powerful testimony to this. Lauder was very clear: Israel’s loss of moral status means it won’t be able to demand the unconditional loyalty of world Jewry. What was in the past experienced by many Jews as an inner conflict is now slowly being resolved: Many or most members of Jewish communities will give preference to their commitment to the constitutions of their countries – that is to universalist human rights.</p> \n<p>Israel has already stopped being the center of gravity of the Jewish world, and as such, it will be able to count only on the support of a handful of billionaires and the ultra-Orthodox. This means that for the foreseeable future, Israel’s leverage in American politics will be considerably weakened.</p> \n<p>Trumpism is a passing phase in American politics. Latinos and left-wing Democrats will become increasingly involved in the country’s politics, and as they do, these politicians will find it increasingly difficult to justify continued American support of Israeli policies that are abhorrent to liberal democracies. Unlike in the past, however, Jews will no longer pressure them to look the other way.</p> \n<p>The second interesting development concerns Europe. The European Union no longer knows what its mission was. But the Netanyahus, Trumps, Orbans and Morawieckis will help Europe reinvent its vocation: The social-democrat bloc of the EU will be entrusted with the mission of opposing state-sanctioned anti-Semitism and all forms of racism, and above all defending Europe’s liberal values that we, Jews and non-Jews, Zionists and anti-Zionists, have all fought so hard for. Israel, alas, is no longer among those fighting that fight.</p> \n<p>A shorter version of this article has originally appeared in Le Monde.</p>",

        "text":["<p>You don’t have to know how to swim in order to reach an island in Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee). A bathing suit is not required either. A few dozen meters from the beach at Kibbutz Ma’agan an island was revealed as the waters receded due to a shortage of rainfall. The lake surface is now at 214.24 meters below sea level. If you’re willing to wade in thigh-deep you can reach the island without swimming.</p> \n<p>You can reach the island by going to the kibbutz’s beach, which used to be covered in water. You head south from the improvised shelters that have sprouted near the water’s edge, walking along the tall vegetation. After a few dozen meters, walking in some boggy mud and then on some stones, you reach the isolated and pristine island. The scenery is different than the usual Israeli view of empty soda cans, scattered plastic bottles and used cutlery. The island is still clear of all that, with only thick vegetation to be found, with a meter-wide strip of beach around the island.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israelis Asked to Cut Down Shower Time in Bid to Combat Five-year Drought ■&nbsp;With Ongoing Drought, Israel Water Authority to Bring Water From Lower Galilee to Lake Kinneret</p> \n<p>On the island, a roaming dog waslks around and an inhabitant can be seen not far behind - a person with long blond hair, a beard and mustache on a mud-covered face, used as protection against the sun. He doesn’t reveal his name or age: “I don’t believe in chronological age” he says, agreeing only to saying that he’s a drifter. Last week he slept there twice, happy not to encounter other visitors that would disturb his peace. He points to a buoy at the island’s edge, noting that it was still floating last time he visited the island.</p> \n<p>Ely Kedem, a kibbutz veteran, notes that kibbutz members used to go to the lake shore and enter the water directly. “We’d go to the beach and enter the water, which immediately reached your shoulders,” he reminisces nostalgically. He says that the wide fluctuations in water levels began over the last 30 years. “Suddenly the lake would recede. No one knew there was an island and suddenly we saw it. Part of the time it was a peninsula.”</p> \n<p>According to Dr. Doron Merkel, the head of the Kinneret Department at the Water Authority and an adjunct professor at the Geography Department at Haifa University, the island, composed of hard rock, was formed thousands of years ago. “The Kinneret, which formed 20,000 years ago, was rounder. It then grew southwards, taking on the shape of a violin,” explains Merkel. “The rock in the southern part is soft and erodes quickly but at the island there is a harder spot that erodes slower, thus being preserved.”</p> \n<p>Water Authority spokesman Uri Shor estimates that by the end of the summer reaching the island won’t be entirely water-free, with the water between the shore and the island reaching a depth of 20 centimeters. “By the end of the summer all the water sources, including creeks, springs, aquifers and the lake itself will be at their worst condition in years,” says Shor. “Some sources are breaking records for lowest flow levels. The surface of the Kinneret is far below the lowest red line and until the rainy season starts it’s expected to drop further, possibly reaching the black line that was set.”</p> \n<p>Shor warns that the situation is dimmer than it was in 2001. At that time water was pumped out of the lake into the national water system, but that has almost completely stopped. “The levels are low despite the almost complete cessation of pumping water out. If we were taking water out, the level would drop below the black line and the lake would be finished.”</p> \n<p>Despite the gloomy picture and the accelerated rate of growth of the island Merkel looks at the half-full part of the picture – the water quality which, despite dropping levels, remains at reasonable standards. “Salinity is high, and has risen over the last years due to a shortage of an influx of fresh water, but a diversion of a salt-water spring near Tiberias, which began last year, is yielding good results, with a slower rise in salinity. Moreover, we haven’t seen a significant rise in blue algae, the main threat to the water’s salinity, and this is encouraging. We prevent any influx of sewage and introduce one million tilapia fry every year, which maintains the water quality at reasonable levels despite the low levels of fresh water inflow.”</p> \n<p>“We know for sure that water levels haven’t dropped below what they were in the past,” summarizes Merkel. “The lowest ever level was measured in 2001, reaching 214.87 meters below sea level. That year the island was joined to the shore and became a peninsula one could reach without getting wet at all. The forecast is for a rainier winter this year and even if the flow in feeder streams is low there is more flexibility in managing the water and in pumping water into the national carrier system.” He hopes this is the last year the island is exposed. “It’s time to bid it farewell.”</p>",

And get them to support Democrats in 2018.&nbsp;We need to turn the House and Senate as a check on Donald Trump and his runaway presidency...&nbsp;I’m stretching far beyond what I usually do. By the election, I think I’ll have spent between $18 and $20 million.”&nbsp;  Klarman on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez:&nbsp;“In a lot of ways I’m actually excited about somebody like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez coming along because it’s a way of younger people and people of color and people who are different finding their voice and being part of the process.&quot;&nbsp;  Among the Democratic candidates Klarman has given money to:&nbsp;Reps. Joe Kennedy (MA), Conor Lamb (PA), Beto O’Rourke (TX) and Kirsten Gillibrand (NY).  Klarman on 2020:&nbsp;&quot;What if it came down to a choice between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders? While a President Sanders would be “appalling,” he says Mr. Sanders is “not unhinged” and so he would pull the lever for him.&quot;  Why it matters:&nbsp;&quot;There are many people who are similarly situated to Seth Klarman — wealthy, hawkish, socially liberal, fiscally conservative types who felt politically homeless long before Mr. Trump came onto the scene.&quot;  Klarman's creds:&nbsp;&quot;Paul Singer, one of the most influential hedge fund managers in the country, told me that if he was going to invest in any fund other than the one he himself manages, “the only one would be Seth’s.” Used copies of a book about&nbsp;investing&nbsp;that Mr. Klarman wrote in 1991 go for more than&nbsp;$650 on Amazon.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  FLASHBACK — October 2017: Billionaire Republicans Privately Diss Trump:&nbsp;&quot;Frequent GOP donor Seth Klarman, CEO of $30 billion Baupost Group hedge fund, had already warned his investors about Trump’s protectionist policies and the deficits his tax plan would produce... “The president is a threat to democracy. He has attacked journalists and he’s threatening to take away NBC’s license,” Klarman said...&nbsp;People don’t focus on this but Nazi Germany had a constitution before Hitler came to power and at the end of the war they had the exact same constitution. It lasted all the way through, but democracy didn’t.”&nbsp;[NYMag]  Les Wexner renounces Republican Party affiliation after Obama stops in Columbus —by Suzanne Goldsmith:&nbsp;“I just decided I’m no longer a Republican,” said L Brands CEO Leslie H. Wexner, speaking during a panel discussion about civility at Miranova’s Ivory Room billed as a “Columbus Partnership and YPO Leadership Summit.” “I’m an independent,” he said. “I won’t support this nonsense in the Republican Party. I’ve been a Republican since college, joined the Young Republican Club at Ohio State.&quot; ...&nbsp;Wexner recalled [Trump's comments following the Charlottesville protests], which he said caused him to lose sleep. “I have to do something because the leader of our country is behaving poorly,” Wexner recalled thinking.&quot; [Dispatch]  Shalom Lipner tweets:&nbsp;&quot;The subtext here is that both Wexner and Klarman have stellar records of support for transformative Israeli and Jewish communal initiatives. That they would break with the GOP over Trump speaks volumes about how they perceive his impact on both Israel and the Jewish community.&quot;&nbsp;  RJC's Matt&nbsp;Brooks tells us...&nbsp;&quot;There is no question that folks have very strong feelings both pro and con for this administration (as many did under Obama as well). Very few are neutral on the Trump Administration. As such it’s not surprising that some&nbsp;GOP donors have decided not to give. However we are also seeing many new donors and people significantly increasing their support to the GOP because of the strong pro-Israel actions of this President including moving the Embassy, ending the Iran deal and cutting off funding for UNRWA and the PA.&nbsp;The RJC is on track to have one of its strongest revenue years ever.&quot;&nbsp;  INBOX —&nbsp;Jewish People Policy Institute’s 2018 report:&nbsp;Midterm elections results could deepen crisis in Israel's relations with the Democratic Party and undermine bipartisan support for Israel in Congress.&nbsp;  &quot;The report also relates to a deepening frustration in the Trump administration with the lack of appreciation American Jews have shown for the steps taken by the president to improve Israel's political and security reality. A Senior official in the administration emphasized to JPPI, &quot;We can take justified criticism, but if Obama had transferred the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, the American Jewish community would have been united in applauding him!&quot;&nbsp;  Chemi Shalev writes...&nbsp;&quot;Israel's Irreconcilable Differences With U.S. Jews and the Democratic Party May Soon Lead to Final Divorce:&nbsp;Israel will ultimately and inevitably pay a steep price for its foolhardy neglect of the liberal world. The first accounting may come as early as&nbsp;November 6, if the U.S. Congress falls into the hands of a reinvigorated Democratic Party, depleted of its pro-Israeli stalwarts, increasingly beholden to its liberal, left-wing flank, eager to flex its muscles and to start exacting its revenge.&quot; [Haaretz]&nbsp;  2020 WATCH —&nbsp;Bloomberg May Run for President as a Democrat. His Views on Policing and #MeToo Could Be a Problem — by&nbsp;Alexander Burns&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sydney Ember:&nbsp;&quot;After a gun control-themed event in a Seattle community center Friday, [Michael] Bloomberg... said in an interview that he now firmly believes only a major-party nominee can win the White House. If he were to run, Mr. Bloomberg said it would be as a Democrat, and he left open the door to changing his party registration in the coming months. “It’s impossible to conceive that I could run as a Republican — things like choice, so many of the issues, I’m just way away from where the Republican Party is today,” Mr. Bloomberg said... Mr. Bloomberg said he had no specific timeline for deciding on a presidential run: “I’m working on this Nov. 6 election, and after that I’ll take a look at it.” [NYTimes]&nbsp;  CAMP DAVID AT 40 —&nbsp;Today marks the 40th anniversary of the Camp David Accords, a framework signed by then Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, after 13 days of talks at Camp David.&nbsp;The accords, later cemented by a peace treaty in 1979, led to peace between Israel and Egypt for four decades.&nbsp;  INTERVIEW —&nbsp;Stuart &quot;Stu&quot; Eizenstat, who was among Jimmy Carter’s closest aides, shared a behind-the-scenes account of the Camp David talks — which he describes&nbsp;in his recently published book titled&nbsp;“President Carter: The White House Years&quot;&nbsp; — in a phone interview with Jewish Insider's Jacob Kornbluh.&nbsp;  &quot;Camp David was 13 agonizing days and nights,&quot; according to Eizenstat. &quot;Carter&nbsp;drafted 20 separate peace agreements. He negotiated separately with Begin and Sadat because they were like two scorpions in a bottle. They could not be in the same room and they weren't, except at the very first day of Camp David and the last when the deal was done. He worked with the delegations, the staff people, which was very unusual for a president to negotiate with somebody other than the head of states. Then he added two personal touches.&nbsp;The first was on the first Sunday of the 13 days.&nbsp;He took Sadat and Begin in his presidential limo to the Gettysburg battlefield to dramatize the fact that five wars between Egypt and Israel were enough. It led to two very emotional scenes, which I describe&nbsp;in my book. One is that Sadat, who was a general, started talking about [George] Pickett's charge and how that was a turning point in the whole war. Begin, who was of course not a general, but who was a great historian, then broke out extemporaneously and recited Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;The second shows how Carter studied intelligence reports about Sadat and Begin. So the last Sunday, the 13th day, we were close, but not quite there with an agreement. Prime Minister Begin said to the Carter, 'Mr. President, I cannot, will not make any more compromises. I ask you to get a car to take me back to Washington. I've got an El Al plane already waiting for me at Andrews Air Force Base. I'm leaving. My bags are packed.'&nbsp;Carter, realizing this failure after 13 days would totally undercut Sadat's historic trip to Jerusalem,&nbsp;took a desperate personal touch.&nbsp;That is knowing the Begin had a great love for his eight grandchildren. He got the names of each of the eight and&nbsp;personally inscribed their names on photographs of Carter, Begin, and Sadat at Camp David.&nbsp;He walked over to Begin's cabin and hand delivered it, and saw Begin's lips quiver and his eyes tear as he read each of their names&nbsp;signed by the president. He said, 'Mr. President, I'll make one last try.' Almost 40 years later, that treaty is the center of Israeli security.&quot;&nbsp;  HEARD THIS MORNING —&nbsp;Frede Kempe, President of the Atlantic Council, to MSNBC's Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski:&nbsp;The Camp David peace accords &quot;was almost upset by a little girl at Camp David named Mika Brzezinski. I was reading the memoirs of her father (Zbigniew Brzezinski) over the weekend, and apparently, you were in a golf cart with Amy Carter, and you almost ran down the Israeli Prime Minister, and it was only the security guard of Amy Carter that avoided an international crisis at that point.&quot; Picture of Mika in the golf&nbsp;cart at Camp David [Pic]  Kempe on what sets apart the Camp David Accords from the Israeli-Palestinian peace process:&nbsp;&quot;I think three things set that apart, and they don't exist right now. The first is you have Menachem Begin on the Israeli side, Anwar Sadat on the Egyptian side, and they were both strong leaders who wanted to get something done. In Benjamin Netanyahu [on the Israeli side] and Mahmoud Abbas, on the Palestinian side, you don't have that. You had President Carter, who was willing to get deeply involved with details and come up with creative solutions during those 13 days in Camp David and elsewhere when things got blocked. And then the third thing, Menachem Begin was willing to give up territory. He was willing to give up the Sinai. He didn't see any Biblical connection, any historical connection. So he wanted to hold on to West Bank, and the way to do that was giving up Sinai.&quot;&nbsp;  Israeli-American Fatally Stabbed in the West Bank — by&nbsp;Felicia Schwartz:&nbsp;&quot;The man, Ari Fuld, was a right-wing pro-Israel activist who had a following on social media. He was killed at a shopping mall near the Gush Etzion junction that has been the site of similar incidents in recent years. The junction and mall are frequented by both Israelis and Palestinians... “Ari Fuld was a passionate defender of Israel and an American patriot,” U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said on Twitter. “He represented the best of both countries and will be deeply missed.” [WSJ]  TRUMP'S BIG STICK&nbsp;―&nbsp;The Trump administration's most recent move to end funding of&nbsp;peace-building programs&nbsp;for Palestinians and Israelis drew a rare public rebuke&nbsp;from&nbsp;diplomats, Middle East experts, and Jewish groups alike. On Friday, USAID notified Congress that it would not issue&nbsp;the last $10 million payment of the $26 million that had already been budgeted&nbsp;in FY2017 for the Conflict Management and Mitigation Program. On Sunday, the Palestinian Authority's representative to DC, Husam Zomlot, said the U.S.&nbsp;has revoked his and family's visas&nbsp;and closed the PLO's bank accounts in Washington, DC.  —&nbsp;&quot;The closure of the PLO offices in Washington was shocking,&quot; a Palestinian official told Israel Hayom. &quot;We didn't think Trump would go so far as to shut down the official Palestinian&nbsp;mission in the U.S.&quot;&nbsp;  VIEW FROM RAMALLAH —&nbsp;US has no plan for Middle East peace, says senior Palestinian:&nbsp;“I don’t think they will ever introduce a plan,” [Saeb] Erekat said in Jericho. “The whole world is rejecting their ideas. They are already implementing their plan by changing the terms of reference.” [TheGuardian]&nbsp;&nbsp;  — In an interview with Ben Caspit, Erekat hinted Abbas will return the Palestinian Authority keys back to Israel in an upcoming speech at the end of the month. Erekat also recounted the conversations he had with Trump and Jared Kushner in 2017, blaming Israel and the Administration for&nbsp;the&nbsp;impasse&nbsp;in the Middle East&nbsp;peace process.&nbsp;  Aaron David Miller tweets:&nbsp;&quot;Over a 20 year period under Rs and Ds, we did some really dumb things on Arab-Israeli peacemaking. But nothing -- I mean nothing - comes close to the policies being pursued by the Trump Administration which are cruel, confused, and counterproductive for all sides.&quot;&nbsp;  Jackson Diehl:&nbsp;&quot;Apparently Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, real estate developers turned would-be Middle East peace brokers, believe squeezing the Palestinians will induce them to be more reasonable, like wayward subcontractors. Longtime veterans of Mideast diplomacy will tell you the opposite result is far more likely — but then, the pros are excluded from this initiative.&quot; [WashPost]  INSIDE THE ADMIN — Fraying Ties With Trump Put Jim Mattis’s Fate in Doubt — by Helene Cooper:&nbsp;“Mr. Mattis has begun questioning the efficacy of Mr. Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal — a move that, again, was made against his advice. Mr. Mattis has told aides that he has yet to see any difference in Iran’s behavior since Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement between world powers and Tehran. Mr. Mattis famously was pushed out of his job as head of United States Central Command in 2013 because he was viewed as too much of a hawk on Iran policy during the Obama administration. But now, in the Trump administration, Mr. Mattis makes his arguments on Iran from the left of Mr. Bolton, Ms. Ricardel and the president himself.” [NYTimes]&nbsp;  Peter Beinart writes...&nbsp;&quot;America Needs an Entirely New Foreign Policy for the Trump Age:&nbsp;On North Korea, Russia, and&nbsp;nato, Democrats in Congress sound a lot like the Never Trump hawks who once called them appeasers. But the more Washington Democrats echo GOP or ex-GOP hawks, the more they distance themselves from their party’s own base...&quot; [TheAtlantic]&nbsp;  MIDTERMS — DCCC makes Perry Gershon race a top-tier contest — by David Schwartz:&nbsp;“The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on Friday moved Democrat Perry Gershon's bid to unseat Rep. Lee Zeldin to its top tier of targeted races. DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj&aacute;n cited Gershon's fundraising, campaign infrastructure and &quot;deep ties to the community he aims to serve&quot; in a statement announcing the move to the &quot;Red-to-Blue Program,&quot; which includes 82 seats… &quot;I'm happy to see the national party has come to understand the momentum we have and recognize it,&quot; Gershon said Friday.” [Newsday]&nbsp;  PROFILE ― America’s anger paradox: Voters want the anger to stop but can’t stop being angry — by&nbsp;Greg Jaffe:&nbsp;&quot;[Elissa]&nbsp;Slotkin’s race (for Michigan's 8th Congressional District), which nonpartisan groups rate as a&nbsp;toss-up, is a view into perhaps the biggest paradox of the Trump era. Voters say they are tired of the anger and polarization emanating from Washington. They say they crave compromise. Yet these same voters view the rival party with disdain and frequently punish politicians for reaching across partisan lines. They want the anger to stop but can’t stop being angry...&nbsp;She knows that her&nbsp;ability to navigate this contradiction will determine whether she wins this November in a district that President Trump carried by seven percentage points. To prevail, Slotkin needs to peel off some Trump voters. These days that means she must do more than just convince them she’s the better candidate.&quot; [WashPost]&nbsp;  MUELLER WATCH — 'Senior Israel official' mentioned in Paul Manafort court document by Special Counsel Robert Mueller:&nbsp;&quot;Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort sought to turn what he termed &quot;Obama jews&quot; against former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko as part of his lobbying work for former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, according to a Friday indictment prosecutors filed in federal court...&nbsp;Prosecutors say he collaborated with an Israeli official to spread the story that Tymoshenko was allied with anti-Semitic causes to make the administration believe &quot;the Jewish community will take this out on Obama on election day if he does nothing.&quot; [BusinessInsider; NYT]  —&nbsp;“Manafort is cooperating, so I’m sure Mueller knows the name,” [Alan] Dershowitz said… “You don’t put a person’s name in an indictment unless they did something wrong,” he explained. “It was perfectly reasonable for an Israeli to be willing to hear information about potential anti-Semitism,” Dershowitz added... “The senior Israeli official probably didn’t know that Manafort was engaged in unregistered lobbying activities.” [Haaretz]&nbsp;  —&nbsp;&quot;The indictment does not elaborate on the identity of the Israeli official. However, in October 2012, [Avigdor] Lieberman, who was then serving as the foreign minister, published a statement that was identical in nature to the statement contained in the indictment.&nbsp;Lieberman denied having any connection with the issue and maintains that he never spoke to Manafort or met with him.&quot; [Ynet]  On Sunday, Lieberman called on Israel's Justice Ministry to open a probe into the identity of the top official embroiled in the case of Paul Manafort.&quot; [Haaretz]  Possible connection?&nbsp;The late Arthur Finkelstein, who had a longtime relationship with Manafort, also served as a political strategist to Lieberman, who ran in 2013 on a joint list with Netanyahu's Likud. Finkelstein also advised&nbsp;Netanyahu in 1996 and 1999. Finklestein later worked with Hungarian&nbsp;Prime Minister Viktor Orban after being recommended by Netanyahu.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>** Good Monday Morning!

She met her husband, Ben Smith, now the editor in chief of&nbsp;BuzzFeed&nbsp;News, at a conference in Riga that he was covering and she was attending.

Mr. Felder’s continued power in the State Senate may not last, if the Democrats manage to flip a Republican-held seat in the midterm elections... But in Brooklyn, his constituents did not seem to care what the governor, or anyone else for that matter, had to say about their local leader. As Josh Mehlman, chairman of the&nbsp;Flatbush Jewish Community Coalition&nbsp;said, “The community is solidly behind Simcha Felder.” [NYTimes]&nbsp;  Eight Decades of Ethnic Dilemmas: Iconic sociologist Nathan Glazer on the problems of group identity, affirmative action and Donald Trump — by&nbsp;Jason Willick:&nbsp;&quot;Mr. Glazer is a critic of President Trump, but a temperate one...&nbsp;He believes anti-Semitism in the U.S. has been all but eliminated in his lifetime, and adds: “I don’t see it connected to Trump—if his daughter marries a Jew and converts, if his grandchildren are being raised as Jews and no one cares.” As for open racists and anti-Semites who describe themselves as “alt-right”: “I don’t think anybody in the alt-right these days is going to get elected.”  &quot;Mr. Glazer thinks today’s campus activists are characterized by a “discomfort at discussion that looks seriously” at important social issues—just as the Berkeley revolts, in their later stages, ended up seeking to silence opposing ideas. Yet he thinks today’s student protesters are likely to be less successful than their 1960s predecessors in pushing society leftward. Perhaps instead they will put off sympathizers and thereby help produce more centrists like Mr. Glazer.&quot; [WSJ]&nbsp;  Baptist pastor starts nonprofit to restore post-Holocaust cemeteries — by&nbsp;Vanessa Gera and Dmitry Vlasov:&nbsp;&quot;For years now, [Steven] Reece, an ordained Southern Baptist minister from Texas, has been cleaning Jewish cemeteries and erecting memorial plaques at mass grave sites in Poland, and recently Ukraine...The 63-year-old American says cleaning up old cemeteries is his way, as a Christian, of honoring Holocaust victims while supporting the surviving Jewish communities here...&nbsp;Poland’s Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich said that initially, some were puzzled by Reece. “Steven is so unique, we’re not used to people like that,” he said. “But as soon as I met him I realized that he was the real thing,” Schudrich added.&quot;&nbsp;[AP]  PHOTO —&nbsp;New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman&nbsp;posted a picture of him praying at the Western Wall on Instagram&nbsp;with a note marking the High Holy Days:&nbsp;“It’s a very special time of year for both Pats nation and Jewish people all over the world with both Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. I’m usually in such an active mode around this time but this year I’m being more reflective and grateful.

His home was not far from that of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. “Even as a young child I was aware of his presence,” Dr. Mischel once&nbsp;told&nbsp;the British Psychological Society, “and I suspect at some level I became quite interested in what makes people tick.” Dr. Mischel’s family enjoyed a comfortable life until the rise of Nazism. His father, a businessman who had suffered from polio, was made to limp through the streets without his cane. Dr. Mischel recalled being humiliated by members of the Hitler Youth who tread on his new shoes. The experience, he&nbsp;told&nbsp;the Guardian, planted in him a desire to understand “the enabling conditions that allow people to go from being victims to being victors.” [WashPost]  DESSERT — Federal Bureau of Prisons Preps for Yom Kippur in Wake of Hurricane Florence:&nbsp;“Some Jewish federal prisoners wanna keep things kosher for Yom Kippur ... and the Federal Bureau of Prisons is accommodating, especially for facilities affected by Hurricane Florence… Jewish prisoners in all facilities around the country will have access to kosher food, but the $21,799 is specifically earmarked for prisons in the path of Florence.” [TMZ]&nbsp;  This chef’s looking to his roots to put a new twist on soul food — by Samantha Max:&nbsp;“Michael Twitty doesn’t cook the same macaroni and cheese his mom taught him to make.

        "text":["<p>&gt;&gt; Updates:&nbsp;Putin absolves Israel, but crisis with Moscow could reach all the way to Iran&nbsp;■&nbsp;Friend or foe? A deadly Syrian-Russian screwup</p> \n<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Israel was not responsible for the downing of a Russian military aircraft during a strike on Syria&nbsp;Monday night. &quot;It looks like a chain of tragic circumstances, because the Israeli plane didn't shoot down our jet,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>Putin's comments were a shift in tone after Russia accused Israel earlier of a &quot;hostile provocation&quot; in striking the Syrian port city of Latakia, which led to the downing of&nbsp;a Russian military plane with 15 servicemen on board.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When asked about comparisons to Turkey's downing of a Russian aircraft in 2015, Putin said: &quot;This is a different situation. The Turkish fighter jet knowingly downed our plane.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Russian president noted that the Defense Ministry's statement, vowing a retaliatory response, was &quot;fully coordinated&quot; with him. &quot;The retaliatory measures will be directed above all to boosting the security of military men and installations in Syria,&quot; he said. &quot;These will be measures everyone will see.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on the phone with Putin and expressed his condolences, but added that the responsibility for the downing of the Russian plane rests with Syria. He also reiterated that Israel is determined to prevent Iran from gaining a military foothold in Syria and thwart Tehran's attempts to aid Hezbollah with lethal weapons against Israel.</p> \n<p>In the call with Putin, Netanyahu stressed the importance of continuing the security coordination with Russia, which he said has saved many lives on both sides over the past three years. He offered to send Russia all necessary details in order to investigate the incident, including dispatching the Israel Air Force chief to Moscow.</p> \n<p>Shortly later, the Kremlin said Putin told Netanyahu that agreements reached between Russia and Israel regarding the prevention of dangerous incidents &quot;were not observed.&quot; The statement added that Putin asked Netanyahu to avoid such situations in the future.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Kremlin's statement came after Russia's Foreign Ministry said Moscow told Israel it will take all necessary measures to protect its military personnel in Syria.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also responded to the downing of the aircraft, expressing sorrow for the deaths of Russian aircrew members. Pompeo said that the incident “reminds us of the need to find permanent, peaceful and political resolutions to the many overlapping conflicts in the region.” He added that the incident brings to light “the danger of tragic miscalculations in Syria’s crowded theater of operations.”  Pompeo did not mention Israel in his statement, but he did say that the downing of the aircraft “underlines the urgent need to resolve the Syrian conflict and to end Iran’s provocative transit of dangerous weapon systems through Syria, which are a threat to the region.”</p> \n<p>'Irresponsible actions'</p> \n<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Russia's Defense Ministry accused Israeli military planes of creating a &quot;dangerous&quot; situation in Latakia, near where the aircraft was downed by Syrian air defense systems, as it claimed Israel warned Moscow about the planned operation one minute beforehand, adding that it was not enough time to get the the plane to safety.</p> \n<p>The Defense Ministry said 15 Russian military service people died because of Israel's &quot;irresponsible actions,&quot; adding that it reserves the right to take appropriate measures after Israel's hostile actions.</p> \n<p>According to the ministry, the Israeli F-16 jets carrying out the airstrikes used the Russian plane as a cover to allow them to approach their targets on the ground without being hit by Syrian anti-aircraft fire.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Hiding behind the Russian aircraft, the Israeli pilots put it in the line of fire of Syrian anti-aircraft systems. As a result the Il-20 ... was shot down by the (Syrian) S-200 missile system,&quot; Konashenkov said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said the Israeli pilots &quot;could not have failed to see the Russian aircraft, as it was coming in to land from a height of 5 km (three miles). Nevertheless, they deliberately carried out this provocation,&quot; Konashenkov said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israeli army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis said in a statement that Israel &quot;expresses sorrow for the death of the aircrew members of the Russian plane that was downed tonight due to Syrian anti-aircraft fire,&quot;&nbsp; adding that Israel holds the Assad regime fully responsible for the incident.</p> \n<p>&quot;Israel also holds Iran and the Hezbollah terror organization&quot; for the event, said the statement. &quot;Overnight, Israel Defense Forces fighter jets targeted a facility from which systems to manufacture accurate and lethal weapons were about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Manelis said Israel and Russia have a deconfliction system that has proven itself effective many times in recent years, and that &quot;this system was in use tonight as well.&quot;</p> \n<p>An initial inquiry by IDF top brass and the prime minister's bureau, Manelis said, showed that extensive and inaccurate anti-aircraft fire by Syrian forces downed the Il-20.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;When the Syrian Army launched the missiles that hit the Russian plane, IAF jets were already within Israeli airspace,&quot; said the statement, adding the Ilyushin was not present in the area of the operation during the Israeli airstrike.</p> \n<p>It also said Syrian anti-aircraft batteries fired indiscriminately, &quot;and from what we understand, did not bother to ensure that no Russian planes were in the air.&quot;</p> \n<p>The statement concluded by saying Israel will share all the relevant information with the Russian government as to confirm the facts of the inquiry. An Israeli political official later echoed these comments as well, adding that Putin and Netanyahu are expected to speak soon.</p> \n<p>Israeli Ambassador to Russia Gary Koren was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry following the incident, according to Russian media, though the Israeli Foreign Ministry declined to comment.</p> \n<p>Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu informed his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, that&nbsp;Moscow holds Israel wholly to blame for the shooting down of a Russian military plane near Syria.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Kremlin was extremely concerned by the incident and Putin expressed his condolences for those who were killed, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Russian Defense Ministry said a recovery operation in the Mediterranean Sea is underway and that it has already located the wreckage in the sea and has retrieved some bodies and some fragments of the plane.</p> \n<p>A U.S. official earlier said Washington believed the aircraft, which is an Il-20 turbo-prop plane used for electronic reconnaissance, was inadvertently shot down by anti-aircraft artillery operated by Moscow's ally, the Syrian government.</p> \n<p>Around the time the plane disappeared, the Syrian coastal city of Latakia, near a Russian airbase to which the Il-20 was returning, came under attack from &quot;enemy missiles&quot; and missile defence batteries responded, Syrian state media reported.</p> \n<p>The defense ministry in Moscow said the aircraft was returning to the Russian-run Hmeymim airbase in Latakia province when, at about 11 P.M. Moscow time (20:00 GMT), it disappeared from radar screens.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The plane was over the Mediterranean Sea about 35 km (20 miles) from the Syrian coastline, Russia's TASS news agency quoted the ministry as saying in a statement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;The trace of the Il-20 on flight control radars disappeared during an attack by four Israeli F-16 jets on Syrian facilities in Latakia province,&quot; the statement was quoted as saying.</p> \n<p>&quot;At the same time Russian air control radar systems detected rocket launches from the French frigate Auvergne which was located in that region.&quot;</p> \n<p>The fate of the 14 people on board the missing plane is unknown, and a rescue operation has been organized out of the Hmeymim base, the ministry said.</p> \n<p>The Israeli military had no reaction, saying it does not comment on &quot;foreign reports.&quot; French military spokesman Colonel Patrik Steiger told Reuters. &quot;We deny any involvement.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A series of unusual airstrikes on Syria were attributed to Israel on Monday night. The official SANA news agency reported that ten people were injured in the attack, eight of whom were shortly discharged after being admitted to a nearby hospital.</p> \n<p>According to Syrian media, missiles were fired toward military targets close to three large cities in the north of Syria: Lattakia, Homs and Hama.</p> \n<p>In recent weeks there has been a significant uptick in the amount of reports attributing attacks to Israel. Previous attacks, according to foreign media, mostly targeted the area of the Damascus International Airport.</p>",

        "text":["<p>From the pulpit to the dinner table, sin and repentance is the stuff of annual Yom Kippur rituals, discussions and moments of introspection. But across the Jewish world, conversations grappling with transgressive sexual misconduct and its consequences haven’t been seasonal. They were a year-long phenomenon throughout 5778 – the year of #MeToo.</p> \n<p>The issue has been so dominant that as the High Holy Days approached, a group of rabbis and scholars were inspired to come up with an addendum to the traditional Yom Kippur prayer, adapting the existing confessions with lines like:</p> \n<p>“For the sin we committed through inappropriate use of power.</p> \n<p>For the sin we committed by inappropriate sexual advances.</p> \n<p>For the sin we committed by putting people in power without oversight.</p> \n<p>For the sin we committed by not taking seriously the complaints of a colleague.</p> \n<p>For the sin we committed by not believing victims when they spoke up.</p> \n<p>For the sin we committed by not being aware of our own power or privilege when making an advance...”</p> \n<p>The explosion in awareness of systemic sexual aggression, harassment and abuse of power began last year with the shocking revelations about movie producer Harvey Weinstein, a story that broke just days after Yom Kippur had ended. The articles in The New York Times and The New Yorker – detailing the number, extent and level of institutional enabling of Weinstein’s attacks on women’s bodies, minds and careers over decades, and how he aggressively worked to stop them from speaking out – opened the floodgates to self-examination in communities across the United States and, eventually, the world.</p> \n<p>Neither the Jewish community – from its synagogues and schools to numerous nonprofits – nor the State of Israel were immune. Seeing victims of sexual misconduct come forward with stories involving powerful men, and watching major figures exit public life as a result, was simultaneously inspiring and disorienting.</p> \n<p>“Pursuing justice and pursuing it justly is one of Judaism’s core obligations,” said Keren R. McGinity, speaking at a recent interfaith forum on #MeToo in sacred spaces. “Yet how, exactly, is one meant to pursue justice when one’s abuser is raised up high on a communal pedestal?” she asked.</p> \n<p>She continued: “‘Jews are a family, we are responsible for each other. We should not speak ill of each other.’ These ideas kept a kind of muzzle on me and the mere idea of speaking out paralyzed me with fear and questions.”</p> \n<p>Ultimately, she did speak out against the man she claims behaved “unethically and so un-Jewishly” – the prominent American-Jewish sociologist Steven M. Cohen. Subsequently, other women came forward with similar stories. McGinity said in her speech she was pleasantly surprised by “the abundance of gratitude [from] women and men from every sector of the global Jewish community,” and the extent to which academics and Jewish organizations stood behind her.</p> \n<p>She also drew support from #GamAni (Hebrew for #MeToo), a movement that emerged almost immediately following the Weinstein revelations and grew throughout the year. Its “campfire” has been the #GamAni Facebook page that, a year on, has over 1,000 members, after inviting participants to “share personal experiences of the interaction of gender and culture at Jewish communal organizations.”</p> \n<p>The Facebook page also acted as a clearinghouse of sorts for discussions on sexism, gender hierarchy and inequality in Jewish organizations.</p> \n<p>Support and encouragement</p> \n<p>Over the past year, #GamAni has been reckoning not only with new cases in the headlines, but also the legacy of earlier offenders like “Peeping Tom” Rabbi Barry Freundel and the late Shlomo Carlebach. It has also offered support and encouragement for women wrestling with the dilemma of whether to go public with their stories of men who, in many cases, were respected spiritual leaders (such as Carlebach) or highly regarded scholars.</p> \n<p>The group has discussed extensively the problematic dynamic in Jewish nonprofits of older, wealthy, generous male donors and younger female staff members who are afraid to speak out against these figures who are often the financial pillars of their organizations.</p> \n<p>From the early weeks of October 2017, after the Weinstein story inspired other women to come forward with their stories, the conversation entered the Jewish realm.</p> \n<p>Toward the end of October, The New Republic’s former literary editor Leon Wieseltier, considered one of America’s leading Jewish intellectuals, was accused of sexual harassment by multiple women. A new magazine he had been working on was swiftly scrapped after its backers pulled out following the accusations.</p> \n<p>Then in December, United Synagogue Youth – the youth group of the Conservative movement – cut ties with its former longtime director Jules Gutin, after former youth group members accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior. The allegations included multiple instances of Gutin inviting USY participants to sleep in his bed and, in at least one instance, a charge of touching one of the young men.</p> \n<p>In January, there was outrage when the prestigious 92nd Street Y in Manhattan invited writer and one-time Haaretz columnist Ari Shavit to speak at a commemoration event for Israel’s 70th anniversary. Shavit had withdrawn from public appearances following allegations of harassment by a Jewish journalist the previous year. After the 92Y announcement, two additional women came forward with new allegations of sexual misconduct.</p> \n<p>In July, the claims by McGinity and other women against Steven M. Cohen – and Cohen’s immediate admission that he had engaged in “inappropriate behavior” – further rocked the community.</p> \n<p>Cohen had enjoyed a long and illustrious career, including prestigious appointments at Hebrew University and Hebrew Union College. He had conducted studies for many Jewish organizations and served as a consultant on the Pew Research Center’s 2013 survey of American Jews.</p> \n<p>The following month saw revelations of how respected Rabbi Haskel Lookstein failed to take action in multiple instances of alleged sexual misconduct – including abuse of students – by educators affiliated with Ramaz, the Upper East Side school he ran for 50 years. That story broke following an investigation by The Forward which charged that Stanley Rosenfeld had been a serial predator in the 1970s. He had taught for years at a number of Jewish day schools, including Ramaz, and worked at multiple summer camps.</p> \n<p>Finally, in September, as 5778 turned to 5779, two new accusations dominated the headlines. The New York Jewish Week revealed that megadonor and Birthright co-founder Michael Steinhardt had reportedly been barred from taking solo meetings with female staffers at Hillel International due to inappropriate behavior. And David Keyes, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was revealed to have a damning history of allegations of aggressive sexual behavior that were kept quiet when he was appointed by Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer.</p> \n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Israel was no stranger to #MeToo. After all, a former Israeli president, Moshe Katsav, had already been convicted and imprisoned for rape in 2010, and sexual harassment scandals had brought down major political figures like Yitzhak Mordechai and Haim Ramon. #MeToo has had an impact in worlds beyond politics, though, including in the media and high-tech.</p> \n<p>Elephant in the room</p> \n<p>But no matter how disruptive, discussing sexual harassment in the Jewish world and Israel has been the easy part of the equation.</p> \n<p>The more uncomfortable issue has been the outsized number of Jewish men involved in #MeToo, beginning with Weinstein, and addressing that fact without giving aid and comfort to anti-Semites.</p> \n<p>In addition to Weinstein and Wieseltier, the list of Jewish men implicated in #MeToo over the past 12 months includes former Democratic senator Al Franken; ousted CBS chief Les Moonves; actors Dustin Hoffman, Jeffrey Tambor and Jeremy Piven; directors Woody Allen, James Toback and Brett Ratner; playwright Israel Horowitz; journalists Mark Halperin and Michael Oreskes; conductor James Levine; and radio show hosts Leonard Lopate and Jonathan Schwartz.</p> \n<p>While there has been no shortage of non-Jewish transgressors as well – including the late Roger Ailes, Mario Batali, Charlie Rose, Bill O’Reilly, Garrison Keillor, Kevin Spacey and Matt Lauer – the number and prominence of Jews was impossible to ignore.</p> \n<p>But speaking out about this also came at a price. Mark Oppenheimer made the first attempt, writing in Tablet last October about what he called the “specifically Jewy perviness of Harvey Weinstein” – in an article that also pointed out that “nearly every one” of his victims were non-Jewish women, “all the better to feed Weinstein’s revenge-tinged fantasy of having risen above his outer-borough, bridge-and-tunnel Semitic origins.”</p> \n<p>Following an outcry, Oppenheimer, Tablet’s editor-at-large, published an apology the following day, calling his initial post “hasty and ill-considered.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, in a post called “Are Jewish Men Pigs?,” Rabbi Daniel Brenner noted that when Jewish comedian Larry David pointed out on “Saturday Night Live” that “many of the predators are Jews,” the Anti-Defamation League castigated him for being “offensive” and “insensitive.”</p> \n<p>Brenner argued that there are legitimate questions to be asked about what #MeToo means when it comes to Jewish-American men and sex, noting that dominating women is sometimes theorized as a way to “push back against the pasty, book-ish, brainy, feminine persona” of the Jewish male, and that “sexual dominance” may be used “as a way to address their emotional pain.” He also called for better education of young Jewish men.</p> \n<p>Feminist scholar Elana Sztokman, who authored a book about Orthodox-Jewish men and is now pursuing a research project on sexual harassment and abuse in the Jewish world, said the topic was worth addressing in the quest to put a stop to such behavior. “We have not yet really examined the question about how we teach boys and men what it means to ‘Be a Man,’” she says. “I’m not suggesting that all Jewish men are potential abusers. ... That said, I definitely think that there is room for us, as a community, to ask the question, ‘How are we educating men to be men?’ Because, as much as I hate to give fodder to anti-Semites, I do actually think that there may be something here about Jewish masculinities.”</p> \n<p>In the hand-wringing over Jewish masculinity, it is worth noting that – while far more rare – Jewish women have not been immune from such scandal. Recent examples included allegations against academic Avital Ronell and the ongoing sexual abuse case involving former Melbourne school principal Malka Leifer.</p> \n<p>In both Israel and the United States, the Orthodox community – and especially the ultra-Orthodox community – has lagged behind when it comes to #MeToo.</p> \n<p>Gratitude and relief</p> \n<p>“The Orthodox world always takes a long time to catch up to what’s going on in the secular world,” says Malky Wigder, a former member of New York’s Satmar (ultra-Orthodox) community, who has posted on social media about her experiences with sexual harassment and assault. “Things aren’t going to change overnight. But I think that process has started,” she adds.</p> \n<p>Over the past year Wigder has started posting on Facebook about her experiences, calling out some of her abusers by name – men whom she says took advantage of her vulnerability as a divorced woman fighting for custody of her children.</p> \n<p>Privately, she has received messages from women still in her former community, where “there is a lot of gratitude and relief coming from past victims. Some of them said they had been waiting for years for somebody to ‘out’ these people,” says Wigder.</p> \n<p>She still feels frustrated, though, that “it hasn’t really accomplished anything,” with many of the alleged offenders continuing to act as doctors and counselors for women. “I did this because I wanted to warn people. It came as a shock to me that everyone already knew. They just weren’t doing anything about it.”</p> \n<p>Wigder says that Orthodox women victims, who live in a world where they are educated to submit to men and blame themselves for male transgression, experience deep shame, guilt and fear when they are assaulted.</p> \n<p>“They are certain there is something wrong with them, [that] they invited it even if they were drugged and pinned down,” she says.</p> \n<p>In many cases, Wigder continues, she thinks “the women don’t even have the language to begin to talk about it.” Furthermore, the male-dominated organizations do their best to sweep any allegations that do emerge under the carpet, castigating those who complain for besmirching the image of the institution in which the alleged abuse took place.</p> \n<p>By contrast, inspired by #MeToo, the non-Orthodox Jewish world has been a hive of activity, with both the establishment of new groups and greater efforts to more closely monitor and act against sexual misconduct within existing organizations.</p> \n<p>In a major new initiative, B’kavod was launched in August by the Good People Fund and the Jewish Women’s Foundation of New York, with the aim of merging “Jewish values with Jewish organizational behavior.” It hopes to create “safe and respectful workspaces,” in order to “uproot this tension between the sacred spirit of the individual and the holy mission of the institution.”</p> \n<p>The effort involves professional training for Jewish organizations, the establishment of hotlines for anonymous reporting, help and advice, and support for anyone wishing to go public.</p> \n<p>The Conservative movement, meanwhile, created a confidential in-house hotline and dedicated email address for reporting sexual assault or harassment. And the (Reconstructionist) Center for Jewish Ethics initiated a “crowdsourced responsa” to create “a growing, shifting archive of sources from across the internet that we see as responding to Jewish ethical questions in the era of #MeToo.”</p> \n<p>The Jewish Women’s Archive is capturing the moment for posterity through a special repository for #MeToo stories.</p> \n<p>The archive aims to document Jewish women’s stories of harassment and assault – and the responses to them – in order to “illustrate the systems and structures that shape women’s experiences, as well as women’s collective power to make change.”</p> \n<p>The Foundation for Jewish Camp created the Shmira Initiative (“Shmira” is Hebrew for “guard duty”), in order to “change camp culture on all levels, implementing a shift in staff programming, training, policy and enforcement around issues of gender, sex and power,” and promoting “the social and individual responsibility every community member has to ensure a safe environment” in Jewish summer camps.</p> \n<p>Miriam Isserow, an administrator of the #GamAni Facebook group and a former advocacy coordinator at Israel Women’s Network, says that while it has been “heartbreaking that there are so many Jewish men” caught up in #MeToo scandals, she is encouraged to see how much action is being taken to fight it.</p> \n<p>“After having worked in Israel on these issues for many years [as a fundraiser in both women’s and Jewish organizations], it is really heartening to see the community come together, and how it is responding,” she says. “Transparency is good, taking action is good and, clearly, in our community there are a lot of people willing to take action.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Who killed off the Neanderthals? We usually suspect ourselves, but while Homo sapiens has had a hand in the extinction of countless species, a study published on Monday appears to exonerate our distant ancestors in this prehistoric whodunit.&nbsp;Neanderthal populations were already dwindling by the time of their extinction some 40,000 years ago but what killed off our close evolutionary cousins seems to have been climate change.</p> \n<p>The researchers reconstructed the climate of prehistoric central Europe by analyzing stalagmites from two caves in Romania. They discovered that the region went through two periods of extremely cold temperatures, even by Ice Age standards, around the time when Neanderthal populations dwindle and then disappear from the fossil record in what used to be the heartland of their territory.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Neanderthals could make fire, new study suggests ■ Bones found in Israel rewrite theory of Neanderthal extinction ■ How many human species did our ancestors have sex with? &lt;&lt;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By correlating their geological results with archaeological findings, the team concluded that these periods likely delivered a deadly one-two punch to Neanderthals, with humans being guilty, at most, of moving into the lands formerly inhabited by the extinct hominins.</p> \n<p>“It seems we are off the hook for that one,” jokes Michael Staubwasser, a professor of isotope geochemistry at the University of Cologne, in Germany, and the lead author of the paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p> \n<p>Neanderthals and Homo sapiens split off from their last common ancestor around 500,000 to 700,000 years ago. Homo sapiens went on to evolve in Africa. Neanderthals developed in Eurasia and the Levant, inhabiting an area that stretched from Europe to Siberia and the Middle East.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Scholars have been debating for over a century how much of a part we played in their demise.</p> \n<p>With their stocky constitution and a brain that was larger than Homo sapiens’, Neanderthals seem to have been well adapted to the conditions of Ice Age Europe, though their domain was south of the ice sheet, which led to suspicions about our ancestors.</p> \n<p>Some of the evidence is damning. Neanderthals did go extinct shortly after anatomically modern humans migrated massively from Africa into the Middle East and later Europe, starting some 65,000 years ago.</p> \n<p>What happened when the two groups came in contact? Archaeologists have found evidence of sapiens-on-Neanderthal violence&nbsp;and even cannibalism.&nbsp;Another theory, which doesn't negate the &nbsp;possibility of violence, is that we interbred with Neanderthals until our larger numbers meant they were genetically obliterated as a separate group. There is strong evidence for that too, given that the genome of all non-African populations today contains around 2 percent of Neanderthal DNA – as well as genetic material from other hominins.</p> \n<p>In addition, or alternatively, we may have simply outcompeted them thanks to our supposedly superior social skills or cultural development, other researchers have suggested.</p> \n<p>The weather report, in stone</p> \n<p>But some scientists don't think modern humans were the primary cause of Neanderthal extinction. This view was strengthened when, in 2014, the most recent Neanderthal bones found so far were re-dated and found to be around 40,000 years old, rather than 30,000 as previously thought.</p> \n<p>Since modern humans began to arrive in Europe around 45,000 years ago, this left a relatively small window, evolutionarily speaking, of a few millennia for sapiens to single-handedly exterminate or push out the Neanderthals from a vast territory. Other factors must have been at work.</p> \n<p>The idea that climate change may be to blame is not new, but so far lacked firm scientific evidence to back it up, note the scientists in the newly-published PNAS paper.</p> \n<p>The stalagmites they analyzed – one from a cave near the Danube valley and a second in the Carpathian Mountains in the north of Romania – contain a record of the weather conditions that occurred during the millennia over which they slowly formed, says Bogdan Onac, a paleoclimatologist from the University of South Florida and a member of Staubwasser’s team.</p> \n<p>When calcium carbonate precipitates to create stalactites and stalagmites, the rock formations retain the oxygen isotopes from the rain that fell on the surface above the cave, as well as the carbon isotopes the water collected from the soil as it slowly flowed underground, Onac explains. The oxygen signatures can give us information about temperature changes, and even whether the rain came from the Atlantic Ocean or the Mediterranean; while the carbon tells us if the soil was rich and filled with critters, bacteria and plants – or arid and barren, he says.</p> \n<p>The researchers found that Central and Eastern Europe underwent two major periods of very cold and dry conditions, from 44,300 to 43,300 years ago, and then again from 40,800 to 40,200.</p> \n<p>Climatologists had already studied these extremely cold periods, also called stadials, in ice cores dug up in Greenland, but they didn’t know how much they affected Europe. It is now clear that the changes throughout the continent were extreme, Staubwasser says.</p> \n<p>For example, based on his team’s results and other paleoclimate studies from the area, he estimates that the average temperature in the entire Danube region dropped from an already bracing 4 degrees to sub-zero levels, creating permafrost or near-permafrost conditions on the ground throughout the year.</p> \n<p>“What’s important is not just the temperature,” Staubwasser tells Haaretz. “Because of the cold, it also gets very dry, and this changes the entire ecosystem of Europe: you go from an open woodland to a cold steppe.”</p> \n<p>Europe, the frozen wasteland</p> \n<p>The transformation of Europe into a frozen, arid wasteland would have depleted the herds of large game that prehistoric hunter-gatherers lived off, quickly causing entire areas to be depopulated. This can be seen in most Neanderthal sites in Eastern and Central Europe, where archaeologists have turned up “sterile” layers – almost devoid of bones, tools and other signs of habitation – that date to the two stadial periods, the PNAS paper notes.</p> \n<p>After the end of the first stadial, Homo sapiens sites begin to show up in the archaeological record in Europe. Also a few Neanderthal sites were repopulated, suggesting that while depleted in numbers, our hardy cousins had survived the first climatic onslaught. They would not survive the second.</p> \n<p>“The picture that is emerging is that between the two cold periods you might have had Neanderthal and humans living together, not in the same sites but in the same region, close enough to meet and interbreed,” says Staubwasser. In fact, the DNA analysis of one of the oldest Homo sapiens skeletons in Europe, also found in Romania and dated to around 40,000 years ago, has shown that this individual’s ancestors had interbred with Neanderthals between four to six generations earlier,&nbsp;meaning there still had to be Neanderthals around to have sex with.</p> \n<p>But by the end of the second stadial, the only people left in Europe were Homo sapiens. Even if a few Neanderthals did survive the second cold spell, they would have been quickly absorbed into the much larger sapiens groups, Staubwasser notes.</p> \n<p>“We didn’t actively replace them,” he hypothesizes. “They retreated, and we followed.”</p> \n<p>How could the newcomer sapiens emerge relatively unscathed from Europe’s double deep freeze, while the Neanderthals, who after all were the region’s original inhabitants, ultimately succumbed?</p> \n<p>In the race for survival, Homo sapiens may have had an edge thanks to a more varied diet, which included a larger share of plants and fish than that of the Neanderthals, who relied more heavily (although not exclusively) on the large mammals that would have been most affected by the change in climate, Staubwasser postulates.</p> \n<p>This theory is supported by multiple past studies of tooth wear, bone isotopes and fossilized feces of the two hominin groups. One 2016 a study by Tel Aviv University archaeologists suggested that Neanderthals had evolved their large chests and pelvises precisely so they could better metabolize the high amounts of protein they were getting from their diet.&nbsp;&nbsp;As often happens in evolution, the high level of specialization that made the Neanderthals into lean, mean meat-eating machines may have contributed to their doom when conditions changed and there were fewer animals around to hunt.</p> \n<p>Still, we should not think too much of our adaptation skills, as anatomically modern humans were not immune from the effects of the deadliest times of the last Ice Age. In the roughly six millennia after the Neanderthals went extinct, there were at least two more extreme cold spells, the PNAS paper notes. After each stadial, the continent’s human population was replaced by a new one, likely immigrating from the south-east, with a completely different genetic makeup, the study concludes.</p> \n<p>“The pattern of genetic turnovers in Europe continued,” Staubwasser says. “Whenever one of these cold intervals occurred, it seems to have triggered a full cycle of depopulation and repopulation by different people with a different culture.”</p> \n<p>Not all researchers believe the PNAS study closes the case on the Neanderthals’ disappearance.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;I agree that weather plays a major role in human demography, but I doubt it brought about the extinction of the Neanderthals,” says Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University. &quot;The Neanderthals experienced lots of cold episodes prior to 45,000 years ago, why would they affect their demography only at the very end?&quot;</p> \n<p>Hershkovitz questioned whether the results of the stalagmite analysis could be applicable to the entire continent, noting that “there is great variability among European sites in regard to climatic records: some testify to severe cold while others suggest a comfortable climate.”&nbsp;So, at least for some, it seems that the jury is still out on this ancient mystery.</p>",

(Kraft has given him a Super Bowl ring.) But Kraft, too, is a politician, of sorts, who seems to do his best to please as many audiences as he can; in part through having mastered the art of saying quite different things for public and private consumption. His friendship with Trump provides a case in point.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;Kraft loves being a presidential buddy but is also aware that many of his plutocrat friends don’t approve. So Kraft is quick to mention to his friends — privately — that he disagrees with Trump on many issues and with many of the incendiary things the president has done and said. But he would rather have the presidential ear and try to be a positive influence.&quot; [NYTimesMag]  -- Leibovich writes that NFL&nbsp;powwows &quot;are like ESPN reporter&nbsp;Adam Schefter’s bar mitzvah.”  INSIDE&nbsp;THE WHITE HOUSE —&nbsp;Trump Rejects White House “Intervention” and Goes It Alone — by Gabriel Sherman:&nbsp;&quot;Two sources briefed on the matter told me that senior officials talked about inviting&nbsp;Rudy Giuliani&nbsp;and a group of Trump’s New York real-estate friends including&nbsp;Tom Barrack,&nbsp;Richard LeFrak,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Howard Lorber&nbsp;to the White House to stage an “intervention” last week. “It was supposed to be a war council,” one source explained.

Most notably, when MBS gave the impression last year that Riyadh endorsed the Trump administration’s still nebulous Middle East peace plan, including U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the king made a public correction... “The king is obsessed with the idea of how history will judge him. Will he be the king who sold Aramco, who sold Palestine?” a&nbsp;source said.&quot; [Reuters]  --&nbsp;Michael Koplow: &quot;This story illustrates why MBS cannot just upend longstanding Saudi policy on the Palestinians, Jerusalem, and the peace process either.

        "text":["<p>I’m a proud Jew with a deep love for Israel. I’ve got a lifelong r&eacute;sum&eacute; of engaged Jewish activism to prove it. But in today’s Israel, that may not be enough to let me in the country.</p> \n<p>My support for Israel and Jewish causes began at an early age. I was born and raised in an AIPAC-loving, liberal American Jewish Zionist family. At 19, I was arrested at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., while protesting for the Soviet Union to free its Jewish citizens. After college, I was the second woman to be elected head of the World Union of Jewish Students. I sat on the board of the World Jewish Congress and attended Jewish Agency meetings. I advocated for Ethiopian Jews to be returned to Israel. I walked with East German Jewish students through the Brandenburg Gate to meet their West German Jewish counterparts as the Berlin Wall was literally being torn down. I led a delegation of South African Jewish Students to a formal meeting with the African National Congress in Johannesburg after it was unbanned.</p> \n<p>Later, I made aliyah. I took Israeli citizenship. I learned fluent Hebrew. I was adopted by wonderful people who became my family. I made Israel my home. I lived through wars and terror attacks and intifadas, just like other Israelis.</p> \n<p>Now back in the U.S., I keep a kosher home. My children attend Jewish day school. We attend synagogue regularly. We celebrate Shabbat every week.</p> \n<p>And yet, I’m not sure what would happen if I were to visit Israel today.</p> \n<p>Actually, I think I do know: I’m pretty sure I would fail the government’s new rapidly evolving – or devolving – litmus test. I’m afraid that I, too, would receive a special “welcome” into the country from the Shin Bet security service and would, at minimum, be interrogated at the border.</p> \n<p>You see, while I love and feel connected to Israel, I disagree with many of the Israeli government’s political stances. I am an international human rights attorney. I believe that Israel must end the occupation, reject the growing theocracy undermining democracy, and embrace all of its citizens in a welcoming pluralistic society. I do not support the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, although I understand why some people do.</p> \n<p>This, too, is my r&eacute;sum&eacute;: I spent several years working for the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, working for women’s rights, equality for Arab citizens of Israel, LGBT adoption rights, freedom of expression and human rights education. For 13 years I co-directed a fellowship program with the New Israel Fund that enabled Jewish and Palestinian Israeli lawyers to study human rights law at American University’s law school, helping to shape a large cadre of lawyers who advocate for a more just Israeli society. I serve on the board of directors of B’Tselem USA.</p> \n<p>I celebrate Israel’s achievements, but I am also vocal in condemning unjust actions by the Israeli government and calling for social change. I do so from a place of deep concern, shame, fear and love. I also do so because it is not only my right to criticize the government, it is my responsibility to do so as a citizen and as a member of the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>But now, as commentators (like Peter Beinart) or activists (like Simone Zimmerman) or philanthropists (like Meyer Koplow), all far more well-known than myself, are detained at the border, I feel compelled to speak out for those of us who are not as famous and who may also be subject to questioning; those of us whose loving critiques are now viewed by the government as some kind of enemy propaganda.</p> \n<p>There are many people like me – with similar r&eacute;sum&eacute;s – who have spent years working to support and build the State of Israel. We believe deeply in democracy and the power of dissent. We are engaged in Jewish organizations in the Diaspora, in human rights movements and social justice organizations both in Israel and abroad, and now we are fearful about what would happen if we were to come to visit.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Beinart’s interrogation was “an administrative error.” But what about the others – those we know about and those we don’t?</p> \n<p>What about Netanyahu’s Trump-like personal attacks on liberal activists like New Israel Fund’s Israel director Mickey Gitzin? Was that an “error,” too?</p> \n<p>Was the supremacy and exclusion legislated through the Nation-State Law an “error”? How about excluding gay men from surrogacy? Or the pre-dawn interrogation of a Conservative rabbi by the police because he conducted weddings not sanctioned by the rabbinate?</p> \n<p>Nobody seems to be calling any of these an “error.” Mostly because they are not.</p> \n<p>The politics of fear are a powerful motivator, and they serve to manipulate people on many levels. These actions have been taken to send a clear message to liberal activists and Diaspora Jews – people like me: Shape up or don’t come. These new policies – while not exactly new for Palestinian Israelis or non-Jewish visitors or residents – are clearly aimed at quashing dissent, at home and abroad. Even if you’re an Israeli citizen, or Jewish, or rich, or famous, if you disagree with the current government’s policies, you no longer have the government’s protection. And you are no longer welcome.</p> \n<p>This cannot stand.</p> \n<p>As these increasingly autocratic policies continue to take hold, Israel will, in fact, be alienating her staunchest supporters – not only allied governments, but maybe even more importantly, people like me. And that will create a crisis not only for Israel, but for the entire Jewish people.</p> \n<p>Due to my views, I suppose I must be on an Israeli government list somewhere (or I will be now).</p> \n<p>I am grateful I brought my children to Israel last summer to visit our family and friends. I hadn’t realized then that only a year later, that instead of the Kotel, my next visit might take place within the four walls of an interrogation room.</p> \n<p>Hadar Harris is an international human rights attorney who focuses on civil and political rights issues, freedom of expression and gender equality.

They circulated a memo that...&nbsp;claimed that the “communications infrastructure” that the Obama White House used to “sell Obamacare and the Iran Deal to the public” had been moved to the private sector, now that the former aides were out of government. It called the network the Echo Chamber and accused its members of mounting a co&ouml;rdinated effort “to undermine President Trump’s foreign policy” through organized attacks in the pres...&quot;  &quot;Some of the same conspiracy theories expressed in the memo appear in internal documents from an Israeli private-intelligence firm [Black Cube] that mounted a covert effort to collect damaging information about aides to President Obama who had advocated for the Iran deal.&quot;&nbsp;  From the memo:&nbsp;&quot;Many of the figures in this network were focused on selling Obama's Iran Deal, so there is something of a Middle East/Iran slant to the network's membership. Likely Leadership:&nbsp;Responsible for higher-level strategy and higher-level fundraising. Probably also responsible for senior-level political outreach with major Democrat donors (e.g., Tom Nides and Alan Solow) and members of Congress.&nbsp;Ben Rhodes. Likely the brain behind this operation... Jake Sullivan. Former NSA to VP Biden.&quot;  &quot;In a statement, Rhodes described the memo as “a bizarre effort to validate ‘deep state’ conspiracy theories” and said that, “given Trump’s many efforts to intimidate and malign his critics, it’s worth asking how his White House and outside enablers acted on this strange memo.”&nbsp;[NewYorker]  Reactions&nbsp;--&nbsp;Mike Doren replied to Adam Entous: &quot;This article fails to mention the long series of leaks of intel by serving &amp; former Obama officials to friendly reporters re Trump associates (Flynn, Prince, Sessions, Page)—including leaks to you, Adam. But “the Echo Chamber” is a rightwing conspiracy theory. What a joke!&quot;&nbsp;  -- Former Obama White House official&nbsp;Colin Kahl: &quot;The fact that a memo like this even exists is a scandal. The NSC's role to staff the President &amp; coordinate the interagency on foreign policy—it is NOT the job of the NSC to map and target domestic political opponents or collude with outside allies to do so.&quot; [Twitter]  NEW LOOK — More Ops, More Secrets, More Money: Mossad's Supercharged Transformation — by&nbsp;Chaim Levinson:&nbsp;&quot;The Mossad under [Yossi] Cohen is a large body that uses a variety of means and is active in many countries. For his part, Prime Minister Netanyahu gives Cohen a free hand to do whatever he wishes. The organization’s budget has constantly grown during Cohen’s tenure; it seems that no request goes unfulfilled...&nbsp;Today, even Cohen’s few critics in the defense establishment point out that the agency’s operative capabilities have been upgraded.&quot;  &quot;Overall, he enjoys sharing hints and winks relating to successful operations with journalists, principally from foreign media outlets. About three weeks ago, after the assassination of the Syrian rocket engineer Aziz Asber, which was attributed to Israel, a “senior official from a Middle Eastern intelligence agency” told The New York Times that the Mossad was responsible for the killing. One can only conjecture about the identity of the senior figure who is so well-informed about the operation.&quot; [Haaretz]&nbsp;  DEEP DIVE —&nbsp;For Female Candidates, Harassment and Threats Come Every Day — by Maggie Astor: &quot;It has been two years since Erin Schrode, now 27, lost her Democratic primary and moved on. But the abuse — a toxic sludge of online trolling steeped in misogyny and anti-Semitism that also included photoshopped images of her face stretched into a Nazi lampshade and references to “preheating the ovens” — never stopped...&nbsp;Last year, sexist and anti-Semitic abuse helped drive Kim Weaver, an Iowa Democrat, out of her race against Representative Steve King.&quot; [NYTimes]  ROAD TO THE&nbsp;MIDTERMS — Interview with Tom Malinowski, a Democratic&nbsp;challenger&nbsp;in&nbsp;New Jersey's 7th Congressional District, running against&nbsp;Republican Congressman Leonard Lance — by&nbsp;Jacob Kornbluh:&nbsp;Malinowski&nbsp;served as&nbsp;Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor&nbsp;in President Barack&nbsp;Obama's 2nd term (2014-2017). He also served as a foreign&nbsp;policy speechwriter&nbsp;for President&nbsp;Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State&nbsp;Madeleine Albright.&nbsp;  While Lance&nbsp;has generally had an easy time getting re-elected for the seat he's held since 2009, this district is one of 25 GOP-held House districts that&nbsp;Hillary Clinton&nbsp;won in the&nbsp;2016 presidential election, and&nbsp;is now ranked as a 'toss-up&quot; by the Cook&nbsp;Political Report.&nbsp;  &quot;I am myself an immigrant from Poland. My family was not Jewish, but experienced life under the Nazi occupation,&quot; Malinowski said in an in-depth interview with Jewish Insider. &quot;My grandmother and great-grandmother sheltered Jewish friends and neighbors during the war, and I grew up with those stories. That's where my commitment to defending human rights comes from. That's where my belief in the importance of protecting Israel comes from.&quot;&nbsp;  Malinowski stated that&nbsp;support for Israel cannot be turned into&nbsp;a partisan issue for short-term political gain. &quot;The argument that it is the Republican Party that is aligning with Israel in the United States can only fuel the movement on the Left to question and challenge the U.S.-Israeli partnership,&quot; he explained. &quot;The more partisan this issue becomes, the more polarized Americans will become on support for Israel.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Malinowski on the Jerusalem Embassy:&nbsp;&quot;I was fine with the decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem. When I worked for President Clinton, we used to travel to meet the Israeli government in Jerusalem, because that is the capital and we recognized it in practice. I have no problem with recognizing it formally. I did have a very big problem with inviting, to give the open benediction at the ceremony, a pastor who believes that Jews are going to hell. I think that experience should give all of us some pause as to what's really going on here.&quot;  On the Iran deal:&nbsp;&quot;I think the deal was not perfect&nbsp;because it did not address some of the most problematic aspects of Iranian behavior, but the deal did set Iran's nuclear program back by many years, and we did have an offer from the Europeans earlier this year to work with the United States to get much tougher on Iran. The Trump administration inexplicably rejected that deal, and the result is that instead of the United States working with Europe to counter Iran, Europe is now working with Iran to counter the United States. I think that's bad for our security.&nbsp;I think it's particularly bad for Israel. The United States is too isolated to effectively counter Iran or protect Israel alone.&quot; Read the full interview here [JewishInsider]&nbsp;&nbsp;  SCENE LAST NIGHT --&nbsp;Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer headlined&nbsp;a fundraiser hosted by NORPAC in support of Senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) in Englewood, New Jersey. The event was co-hosted by NORPAC President&nbsp;Ben Chouake, and&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Blumenthal.&nbsp;  DRIVING THE CONVO --&nbsp;Another controversy is brewing over the heart and soul of the Democratic Party, a battle&nbsp;that has&nbsp;heightened&nbsp;since the stunning&nbsp;primary upset by Alxenadria Ocasio-Cortez. This time in New York City's Borough of Brooklyn.&nbsp;Julia Salazar, who like Ocasio-Cortez is a member&nbsp;the Democratic Socialists of America, is challenging&nbsp;incumbent State Senator Martin Malav&eacute; Dilan in the September 13 primary for&nbsp;New York’s 18th State Senate District. She is backed by The Jewish Vote, affiliated with&nbsp;Jews for Racial and Economic Justice.&nbsp;  --&nbsp;Like her DSA colleagues, Congressional&nbsp;candidates Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib, Salazar supports the BDS movement and is against&nbsp;a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&nbsp;  BACKGROUND:&nbsp;Salazar&nbsp;comes &quot;from a unique Jewish background,&quot; according to the Forward. She was born in Colombia, and her father was Jewish, descended from the community expelled from medieval Spain. When her family immigrated to the United States, they had little contact with the American Jewish community, struggling to establish themselves financially. At first, while in college,&nbsp;Salazar identified herself as a right-wing pro-Israel Christian.  In&nbsp;2012, she&nbsp;attended AIPAC’s annual Policy Conference in Washington and later traveled to Israel for the first time on a CUFI-sponsored trip. Just a few months later, as she began to develop&nbsp;her Jewish identity at Columbia Univesity, Salazar helped charter Columbia’s J Street U&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;and expressed&nbsp;criticism of Israel in articles for the&nbsp;Columbia Spectator and Mondoweiss. She also&nbsp;protested Israel's action in Gaza&nbsp;with IfNotNow.  From Tablet's Armin Rosen:&nbsp;&quot;According to messages from Salazar obtained by Tablet, during her period of pro-Israel activism she told students at Columbia that her mother’s family was from Israel. At one point in the fall of 2012, just a year before keeping a kosher apartment, she described herself as a fervently Christian descendant of Israelis...&nbsp;Based on her activism with CUFI and other available evidence, she appears to have had a Christian upbringing. A 2009 funeral notice for her father... indicates that the service was held at the Prince of Peace Catholic Church in Ormond Beach, Florida. When reached by phone, Alex Salazar, the candidate’s older brother... said that one of their father’s brothers was a Jesuit priest... “There was nobody in our immediate family who was Jewish … my father was not Jewish, we were not raised Jewish,” he said.&quot; [Tablet]  Bari Weiss tweets:&nbsp;&quot;The candidate is running on her identity as a Colombian immigrant and Jew of color. But it seems she is neither of those things.&quot;&nbsp;  Salazar responded last night:&nbsp;&quot;To every reporter who’s ever asked, to every person, I have always said that I was not raised religious, that I didn’t have a bat mitzvah, that *I am* Jewish, but never would claim that my big brother is...&nbsp;The author of this piece anonymously called my older brother, pretended to be someone else (my brother said he thought it was a prank call), and asked him invasive questions about his life and about our dead dad.&quot;&nbsp;  Salazar Goes from $70,000 to $200 in Unitemized Donations —&nbsp;by RJ Sonbeek:&nbsp;&quot;Under pressure from her opponent’s campaign... Salazar&nbsp;decided to disclose the $70,000 in unitemized donations from the past two filing periods... Now, there is less than $200 left in unitemized donations... The largest individual donations came from&nbsp;Paul Egerman, the treasure of Democracy Alliance and his wife Joanne, who each donated $1,000 on separate occasions.&quot; [KingsCountyPolitics]&nbsp;  2020 WATCH --&nbsp;Jason Kander,&nbsp;who passed on a 2020 presidential run to run for mayor of Kansas City, tells Gabe Fleisher, the young author of the Wake Up To Politics newsletter, that he has no interest to run for president in the future.  Kander added:&nbsp;If Democrats “don’t get 2018 right, then we’re gonna feel really silly for having focused on 2020 beforehand. It’s gonna make it a lot harder for Democrats to win in 2020 as well if we don’t do well in 2018... Remember that the ‘blue wave’ is not a weather event.

Bolton said they also discussed Syria and Iran... Bolton said that he rejected, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had in earlier discussions, a Russian proposal to geographically “constrict” Iranian forces to a certain part of Syria — away from Israel’s border — in exchange for U.S. suspension of sanctions it plans to impose on Iranian oil exports in November. Bolton said he explained that the administration’s intention was “to put maximum pressure on the [Iranian] regime and to tighten up the sanctions so that they would be at a minimum equal to the sanctions in effect” before the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.&quot; [WashPost; Al-Monitor]  -- In an interview with The Associated Press,&nbsp;Bolton said he had expressed the U.S. “priority of getting all Iranian forces out of Syria,” and that he and Patrushev had discussed “a number of ideas” about how to do that, without specifying. “We’re not going to solve Syria here,” he said.&nbsp;  Bolton announces plan to defund the UN's Human Rights Council:&nbsp;“We are going to defund the Human Rights Council,” Bolton said, while warning that other U.N. agencies could also be up for cuts in U.S. funding...” [AP]&nbsp; Israel hails US for halting Human Rights Council funding [ToI]  UN official: Palestinian refugee issue can’t be wished away:&nbsp;&quot;The head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees suggested that the United States slashed his budget early this year to punish the Palestinians for their criticism of the American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital...&nbsp;“One cannot simply wish 5 million people away,” [Pierre] Kraehenbuehl, commissioner of the U.N.

And if to be honest, you know, it's a very boring issue... For Israelis, it's like - it's happening every day outside your window or outside your neighborhood. So why would you&nbsp;like to go and see a TV show about that? It's terrible. You hear it in the news all day...&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;But, of course, as Israelis, you don't know much about the Palestinian society... I would say that 90 percent of the Israelis didn't meet Palestinians in their life —&nbsp;and vice versa, by the way. I mean, 90 percent of the Palestinians do not know who the Israelis are or what the Israeli society is like...&nbsp;So it is one of the biggest challenges to show the&nbsp;Israeli public the other side, the enemy side —&nbsp;showing him as not a demon, not demonizing him as many of the media outlets are trying to do —&nbsp;but the opposite and making the audience still like the show, which is totally crazy.&quot; [FreshAir]&nbsp;  How the Nazis Got to New York: Immigration Fraud —&nbsp;by&nbsp;Ali Winston:&nbsp;&quot;On June 27, 1949, [Jakiw] Palij walked into the American consular office in Schweinfurt, Germany, and applied for a visa under the Displaced Persons Act, which was meant for people left homeless by the war, said Peter Black, the former chief historian for a Department of Justice unit devoted to deporting former Nazis.

        "text":["<p>Not Erdogan and not Jeremy Corbyn. Not even the leaders of Hamas or Iran. Just browse through Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s social media posts, and you’ll soon discover the identity of the true enemy of the State of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>His name is Mickey Gitzin, and he’s the national director of the New Israel Fund, an international organization dedicated to promoting liberal democracy in the Jewish state. The way Netanyahu has gone after him, you’d think he was the devil incarnate.</p> \n<p>The funny thing is that Gitzin always saw himself as the poster boy for Zionism. The child of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, he was a Jewish Agency shaliach (envoy) in the United States who before that served as an officer in Israeli military intelligence. Today, he sits on the city council of Tel Aviv in addition to his position at the NIF.</p> \n<p>“If I’m considered a radical today, that means something very fundamental has changed in this country,” says the 37-year-old in an interview with Haaretz. “And why was I attacked by Netanyahu?&nbsp; Because I believe Jews and Arabs should work in partnership. That’s something radical? I mean, where are we living?”</p> \n<p>The prime minister’s obsession with the NIF has become almost a joke among his critics. When something doesn’t go his way, it is this organization that routinely becomes the scapegoat for his failings. When Netanyahu’s plan to deport African asylum-seekers to Rwanda fell through, it was the NIF he blamed. When the leaders of the minority Druze community refused to fall in line with the controversial nation-state law, it was the NIF he blamed. And the list goes on.</p> \n<p>But never before has it been this personal. A little over a week ago, Netanyahu shared a post on his official Facebook page that named Gitzin and attacked him for having urged Israeli Jews to attend the recent Arab-led protest against the nation-state law. The original post had been published by Im Tirtzu, a far-right organization known for its ugly campaigns against left-wing activists.</p> \n<p>The post Netanyahu shared featured a photo of Palestinian flags raised at the Tel Aviv protest juxtaposed with a tweet by Gitzin that had been posted several days before the event. “’Only this way will we win,’ tweets Mickey Gitzin, director of the NIF,” it said mockingly. The post ended with the following dig: “The [New Israel] Fund laid bare.”</p> \n<p>In picking a fight with a private citizen, Netanyahu’s opponents charged, he had crossed a line and was engaging in an act of incitement. Among those to call out the prime minister was his longtime political rival, former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who rushed to Gitzin’s defense.</p> \n<p>“He goes after an IDF reserve officer, a man named Mickey Gitzin,” Barak wrote on social media. “The prime minister targets him and explicitly incites against him when this person’s only sin is that he leads a fund that contributes millions each year to Israeli society, including to the work of the ministries of his government. This is absurd.”</p> \n<p>Teen rebellion</p> \n<p>Although his name is being bandied about on social media by two prime ministers – one serving and one retired – Gitzin comes from humble beginnings. He grew up in Azor, a working-class town outside Tel Aviv, the son of immigrants from Ukraine and Moldova who had moved to Israel in the 1970s.&nbsp; His mother works as a liaison to the Russian-speaking community for the National Insurance Institute, and his father, until his recent retirement, was employed as a medical equipment engineer at a hospital in Tel Aviv. Both his parents, Gitzin says, are on the political right, though they don’t necessarily vote for Netanyahu’s Likud.</p> \n<p>Growing up, he recounts, he embraced their political views. “During the 1992 election, when it was Yitzhak Rabin against Yitzhak Shamir, I was handing out stickers for Shamir, and I took it really hard when Rabin won,” he recalls.</p> \n<p>His political change of heart began as part of a normal teen rebellion. “My parents were right wing and had thick Russian accents, and I wanted to be different from them,” he says. &nbsp;While serving in the research division of military intelligence, he says, he gained a new perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that pushed him further to the left.&nbsp; “I started to understand then that the situation was far more complicated than I had grown up to believe,” he recalls.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;The years he spent working as an envoy for the Jewish Agency in South Bend, Indiana, were also critical in shaping his worldview. It was there, in the heart of the American Midwest, that Gitzin was first exposed to other types of Jews and other streams of Judaism. “Where I grew up, you were Orthodox or nothing,” he says. “Suddenly I understood that you could go to synagogue and be a liberal at the same time, that women were allowed to pray from the bimah, and that there was this whole wonderful thing called tikkun olam (repairing the world) I had never heard of before.”</p> \n<p>The experience left such an impression on him that when he returned to Israel, Gitzin became the founding director of Be Free Israel (also known as Yisrael Chofshit), a non-profit dedicated to promoting religious freedom and religious pluralism in Israel. The organization’s main focus during his stint in office was breaking the monopoly of the Orthodox rabbinical authorities on marriage.&nbsp; As a representative of the left-wing Meretz party on the Tel Aviv municipal council, Gitzin has also helped promote events in the city that celebrate Jewish pluralism.</p> \n<p>That doesn’t mean he always sees eye-to-eye with progressive Jewish leaders. In his opinion, Diaspora Jews are wasting a bit too much time and energy fighting about prayer rights at the Western Wall, at the expense of more burning issues.</p> \n<p>“Look, I respect anyone willing to fight for their beliefs,” he says, “but is the Western Wall the most important symbol in the world for me? No, it’s not. In fact, I don’t really connect to it. For me, there are far more critical issues that need to be addressed, like the freedom to marry in Israel, like the rabbis who spew racism day in and day out, not to mention the constant rabbinical attacks on the LGBT community. These issues, to me, are more important.”</p> \n<p>The growing prominence of IfNotNow, a group of anti-occupation activists based in North America, is proof to him that a new generation of young Diaspora Jews is starting to think bigger. “Their relationship with Israel goes far beyond the issue of prayer,” he notes.</p> \n<p>Like most children of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Gitzin, who is openly gay, did not grow up in an Orthodox home. But his partner did, and so they keep kosher.&nbsp; “It’s so that his parents can eat at our place when they come visit,” he explains. “And when they’re here, Shabbat is Shabbat.”</p> \n<p>Problem solvers</p> \n<p>The stated mission of the New Israel Fund, headquartered in New York, is “to advance liberal democracy, including freedom of speech and minority rights, and to fight inequality, injustice and extremism that diminish Israel.” Since its founding in 1979, it has provided more than $300 million in grants to more than 900 organizations. Aside from grant-making, the NIF also engages in advocacy and empowerment work. Its Israel office, which Gitzin runs, employs a staff of 85.</p> \n<p>The main reason the NIF draws so much antagonism in right-wing circles is that it funds organizations committed to ending the occupation and promoting Palestinians rights. But those are not the only causes it supports. “There is no group in Israeli society that doesn’t walk through our door – and that includes the ultra-Orthodox and even settlers,” reveals Gitzin. “There is this notion that we know how to solve problems, so everyone comes to us.&nbsp; But honestly, what other options do ultra-Orthodox women have if they want to figure out a way to solve the problem of sexual abuse in their community?”</p> \n<p>As hard as it may be to fathom these days, the NIF also collaborates with Israeli government offices on various issues. “When they’re doing something we believe in, like investing in the Arab community or promoting affordable public housing, we are happy to work with them,” says Gitzin. “The fact that the government can’t deal with criticism from us on other issues – well, that’s just not normal, and it shows a complete lack of understanding of the role of civil society organizations. Sometimes we work with the government, and sometimes we work against it. It all depends on the issue.”</p> \n<p>Through his constant attacks on the NIF, Netanyahu has scored at least one key victory, according to Gitzin: He has succeeded in creating the impression that the organization is much bigger and far more powerful than it actually is. “Our whole operation is $30 million a year,” he says. “As a city councilman, I can tell you that’s not even the size of a division in the municipality of Tel Aviv. But Netanyahu would rather exploit the fact that most Israelis don’t know otherwise to create a demon that doesn’t exist.”</p> \n<p>As part of their ongoing campaign against the NIF, Netanyahu supporters often enlist George Soros, the Hungarian Jewish philanthropist whose name is anathema in right-wing circles. “The Soros-funded New Israel Fund” – they like to call it. Except, as Gitzin notes, Soros has only ever funded one NIF project, and that was quite a few years back.</p> \n<p>“We’d be thrilled if he gave us money,” he says.</p> \n<p>Where are we living?</p> \n<p>Netanyahu was never a big fan of the NIF, but Gitzin senses something fundamental has changed in his attack strategy. “In the past, he would let organizations like Im Tirtzu do his dirty work of marking enemies,” he observes. “Now he does it himself.”</p> \n<p>Does Gitzin himself feel unsafe these days? He admits that he does, noting that his partner and colleagues have been urging him to hire a bodyguard. “To me, that’s crazy,” he says. “I mean, where are we living?”</p> \n<p>He tends to see what’s happening in Israel in the context of worldwide trends, often comparing Netanyahu to Viktor Orban, the right-wing leader of Hungary. “Netanyahu, like Orban, needs an enemy at home so that he can rally the base,” says Gitzin. “And we have come to serve that purpose.”</p> \n<p>But there’s also an upside to all this attention from the prime minister. “Donations from Israelis have reached record levels in the past few months,” boasts Gitzin. “Granted, these are small amounts, but they’re coming in from lots and lots of people – senior citizens and students, for example, many who apologize that they can’t afford to give us more than 36 shekels.”</p> \n<p>Asked where he stands politically, he describes himself as “classic Zionist left.”</p> \n<p>“I believe Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people but is obliged to treat all its citizens equally,” he elaborates. &nbsp;“I also believe in a two-state solution and in religious pluralism.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu was quick to seize on the Palestinian flags photographed during the recent Arab-Jewish protest for political gain, claiming they were “the best proof” of the need for the new nation-state law. In retrospect, does Gitzin have any regrets about encouraging Jewish-Israelis to attend?</p> \n<p>“As I see it, what happened that night was a miracle of sorts,” he responds. “You had Arabs, who had been told they were second-class citizens, choosing a democratic way to struggle for their rights and asking Jews to join them. That is unprecedented. To say that I felt comfortable with those flags? No, I didn’t. I have one flag – and that’s the Israeli flag. But you also have to realize that every Palestinian flag raised there was the outcome of 10 years of incitement against this population. So I’m aware that we paid a price in the short term, but in the long term, the partnership that was forged there is 10 times more important.”</p> \n<p>Unlike many Israelis on the left, Gitzin is not feeling disillusioned at all these days. “Of course I’m hopeful,” he says. “We know that the world works in swings. We saw years of liberalism, and now there’s a backlash. It’ll swing back, though. Trust me.”</p> \n<p>Ironically, it is to the Israeli right that he looks for inspiration. “When they went through hard times,” he recounts, “whether it was during the Oslo accords or the Gaza disengagement, they had a choice of giving up or doubling down. They chose to double down.&nbsp; We face the same choice right now, and I feel very strongly about doubling down and fighting.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Jews may be called the People of the Book, among other things, but Israelis today would rather be known as the People of Startup Nation, taking pride in their knack for innovating, thinking outside the box and then selling it too. Multinationals famously prowl Israel for startups and talent, snapping whole (small) companies that they turn into their R&amp;D hubs – sometimes just to shut the pests down before they get in their way. But with all due respect to the Jewish nation, its economic miracles&nbsp;and its technological prowess, how much impact can a country with just 8 million people, not all of whom launched disruptive companies, have in the real world? Does the Israeli startup scene really count outside the hallowed halls of Motorola and Microsoft? Haaretz business editor David Rosenberg talks with Haaretz senior editor Ruth Schuster and tells it like it is.</p> \n<p>Q: China has 1.1 billion people and aspires to upgrade its manufacturing to high-tech. India has 1.3 billion upwardly mobile people, and they have tons of startups. Israel has 0.008 billion people (i.e., 8 million) and a commensurately small number of startups. Does the Israeli startup scene even count on the global map?</p> \n<p>A: Yes, it does. China and India are aspiring to technology leadership, but getting there isn’t easy. It requires a certain kind of human capital that combines innovative ability and entrepreneurship that most of the world hasn’t been able achieve.</p> \n<p>Israel and the United States are really the only two countries that have achieved technological leadership.</p> \n<p>Part of the question stems from the fact that &quot;technological leadership&quot; is hard to measure – it’s not a function of how much a country spends on research and development, or how many engineering graduates it produces every year, or whether a government has programs to encourage startups.&nbsp; So it’s hard for governments, even for China’s with its Vision 2025 campaign, to engineer the development of a high-tech economy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In China’s favor, it has a strong entrepreneurial culture. Against China, it is governed by a repressive regime that tries to encourage people to be thinking outside the box – while obeying the government unquestionably. But it’s hard to compartmentalize freedom and creativity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Q: We take pride in being innovative – Epilady depilators and disk-on-key mobile memories aside, what have we invented that others truly really didn't?</p> \n<p>A: Israel has had a few others, like early development of drones, internet firewalls, internet chat, drip irrigation … but it is true nothing that has changed the world has come out of Israel.</p> \n<p>Everyone in high-tech talks about “disruptive” technology and how they are working on something that will do it. But the fact is most technological innovation is incremental, although the increments are coming these days at a breakneck pace.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Where Israel has been a success – and this is tied up in the startup culture we have – is that innovation is an industry in its own right. Thousands of startups (a number most countries can only dream of) do nothing but innovate. They’re too small and young to make or market much but they are good at coming up with something new. Typically, alas, they then sell themselves to a big multinational that then becomes associated with it, such as Waze with Google.</p> \n<p>Q: Say a wannabe entrepreneur has a clever idea (or so his mother thinks) - how can he check that hundreds of startups in India and China aren't already working in that very area?</p> \n<p>A: They are. That is always the case, and there are probably scores of other ones in Silicon Valley as well.</p> \n<p>However, Israel’s record to date on being the first (if not always the one who ultimately enjoys the fruits) is extraordinarily good.</p> \n<p>The proof is in the figures – the number and amount of money the world’s biggest tech companies have invested in Israel, either putting money into startups or buying them. That trend is, if anything is growing, because old-line industries like automobiles and finance are contending with huge technology challenges and recognize that the only way they can succeed is by turning to startups.&nbsp; You can see that with so many global automakers investing and forming partnerships with Israeli startups in self-driving cars.</p> \n<p>Q: In this uncertain, increasingly divisive world, would a startup in Israel have any advantage?</p> \n<p>A: I don’t think racism is an issue, but there is a growing acknowledgement especially in the U.S. that China is gunning for America’s standing as the world technology leader. Personally, I’m skeptical China will be able to pull it off – it can use its big market, low cost base and manufacturing capacity to become a tech manufacturing power, similar to Taiwan or Japan, but I’m doubtful it can create the innovative culture that animates Israel and Silicon Valley.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, that’s easy for me to say as a bystander. If I were a policymaker in Washington and fretting over the Chinese threat, which has military as well as economic implications, I would err on the side of caution.</p> \n<p>The U.S.-China tech war could work to Israel’s advantage. The Chinese are increasingly being locked out of Silicon Valley, which they had been tapping for innovation and patents, and could turn to Israel as an alternative.</p> \n<p>However, there is a very strong risk that America will act to block any such partnership – and then Israel will be stuck in a hard place between its closest ally and an up-and-coming world power it doesn’t want to alienate.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Q: How can Israelis be persuaded to stop chintzing and have original marketing material be written from scratch in each language, rather than translating their marketing material - which was probably terrible to begin with - from Hebrew?</p> \n<p>Israelis have never been good at marketing in general. I think on one level it contributes to our startup culture: people prefer to be direct and honest about what they think, even when it’s not called for. That can make for a good brainstorming session at a startup, but it runs against the spirit of marketing, which is about creating an image and a brand. On the other hand, the nature of marketing has changed in the internet era. Analytics have become very important and Israelis are very good at it.</p> \n<p>Q: How many startups in Israel succeed?</p> \n<p>A: The rate is quite low – about four in 100 and a lot of the ones that survive aren’t huge successes, according to one study covering the years 1999 to 2014.</p> \n<p>That’s the nature of the startup business everywhere in the world. In Israel’s case, the rate is probably better now, if for no other reason than having more experienced entrepreneurs and smart capital than we did 10 or 20 years ago.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What’s more worrying is that the number of new startups fell last year. That could be a blip in the screen or a sign that the industry has reached a plateau. I think the latter – Israel has, for now at least, exhausted its startup resources in terms of entrepreneurs and engineers. That can only change if more Israelis are recruited into the industry.</p> \n<p>Q: Are there joint Israeli-Arab startups and how do they do?</p> \n<p>A: Israeli-Arabs are hugely underrepresented in Israel’s Startup Nation. Part of this is situational: a lot of startups come out of the army in which Arabs don’t serve, and Israel’s &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; is in the Tel Aviv area while most Israeli Arabs live in the north.</p> \n<p>That is slowly changing, partly because the tech industry is desperately short of skilled people and Arabs are a big untapped source of human capital, and partly because more Arabs are going on to university.</p> \n<p>The real challenge – which applies even more the ultra-Orthodox Jews, another big untapped source of labor – is how easily that can adopt the culture of innovation. So much of it is tied up into the Israeli (Jewish) experience that arose from the Zionist movement’s values (the sabra mentality) and the army.</p> \n<p>Q: What is the craziest startup invention in Israel?</p> \n<p>The one that immediately comes to mind is the app Yo, which in its initial incarnation did nothing but send people a text or audio message saying “Yo.” Strangely enough millions of people downloaded it and the startup behind it raised at least $1.2 million in venture capital. It ultimately fell victim to hackers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Q: How can the ultra-Orthodox be brought on board? Should the secular change behavior in order to appease them?</p> \n<p>A: Integrating the ultra-Orthodox into the workforce is one of the biggest challenges facing the Israeli economy, because the Haredi population is growing too big for its “society of learners” model to go on much longer. Haredim, and mainly men, have to join the labor market and pay taxes rather than be the recipients of government aid.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It’s an unusual problem because Israel can’t absorb more people into the labor force (if anything, these days there is a labor shortage), but policymakers are contending with a community where work on an ideological level is considered inferior to study for adult males and the normal in the incentives for encouraging employment, like the prospect of middle class comforts, isn’t very effective.</p> \n<p>Economic pressures are driving more Haredi men into jobs, but the current government’s backtracking on the issue has brought the phenomenon to a halt. In any case, the economy (and Haredim themselves) will only enjoy the full impact of employment is they work at jobs that create a lot of value-added, i.e., where productivity levels are high.&nbsp; That requires far higher levels of secular education that the typical Haredi male gets because their schools are focused on religious studies. Israel not only has to exert more economic pressure to coax more Haredim into the workforce but stand firm on the issue of education and on drafting Haredi men because the army is an important way to obtain training and entry into the non-Haredi world.</p>",

After all, forcible eviction of Bedouin and other Palestinian shepherd communities from villages and residential sites, where they resided before the occupation, or the sweeping construction bans imposed on them, are the other side of the settlement policy.</p> \n<p>Over the past 20 years, and after setting up Al Jabel, planning and legal procedures taken by the Bedouins’ lawyers prevented the demolition of simple housing structures, also by means of temporary court orders, and held up the expulsion of some 20 other communities in the region to permanent housing sites.</p> \n<p>The forceful American objection in the past to Israel’s expansion plans in the area between Maale Adumim and Jerusalem (area E1) certainly helped to put off the expulsions. But all the High Court panels that heard the Bedouin’s petitions refused to address the fundamental, arguments in principle raised for years by the veteran lawyer Shlomo Lecker and others. The lawyers maintained that these communities have lived there long before the settlements were built, that the population is protected according to international law and that the authorities are practicing blatant discrimination by approving planning and construction for Jews, citizens of the occupying state, while preventing planning and construction from the original population.</p> \n<p>The justices ignored these facts. So they approved, for example, in 2009, to demolish the cave village Khirbet Tana, east of Beit Furik village, which was created decades before the State of Israel was established. The court accepted the argument that the village’s lands were declared a closed military area, destined for training, and authorized new demolitions after the residents had rebuilt their homes on their land.</p> \n<p>Now there is no longer any danger that the American administration knows, or cares, why its predecessors objected to annexing area E1. The justices were given a way out of their last ruling by the present team of Jahalin lawyers, headed by Tawfiq Jabarin, even without having to resort to the equality principle.</p> \n<p>One leeway was a fundamental flaw in the process by which the civil administration rejected the Jahalin’s detailed master plan. Justice Hanan Melcer mentioned it. The justices could also have used the fact that the prosecution and civil administration tried to conceal from them that one of the permanent site options they were offering the Bedouin was too close to a large sewage treatment site, a proximity that is forbidden.</p> \n<p>The justices could have also wondered why so far no use had been made of the private land of Anata village, which had been expropriated for “military needs” in the mid-70s and is where the Jahalin tribe lives. The justices could have paid attention to the argument that the community hadn’t deliberately settled near a main road, but that the authorities had widened the main road until it bordered on the communities’ homes.</p> \n<p>To what extent Shaked’s threat worked here, or whether it was the High Court’s tradition of not intervening in the settlement policy that affected the ruling is anyone’s guess.</p> \n<p>The justices’ ruling on Wednesday ended a chapter in the state’s war of attrition against the Bedouin. The state has consistently narrowed their grazing areas since the 70s, blocked their access to water sources and insistently refused to let them build and connect to water and electricity infrastructures according to their natural growth and changing needs. The civil administration’s inspectors raided their communities systematically and frequently demolished structures. Now a new chapter has begun in the war of attrition, because the Khan al-Ahmar community is determined not to live beside a garbage dump or near sewage ponds.</p> \n<p>In their ruling to authorize the village’s demolition the justices have given the state a green light to embark on a campaign of mass destruction and deportation of some 20 other Bedouin communities in the same area.</p> \n<p>The Regavim NGO, the Kfar Adumim and Maale Adumim settlements and the Foreign Affairs and Defense sub-committee for West Bank settlement, headed by MK Moti Yogev, can certainly celebrate. This was the goal of their intense efforts in the past decade - to turn the Bedouin communities in the area into “invaders” that sabotage the settlements’ expansion.</p> \n<p>The community that built a school from tires had become the flagship of the struggle against banishing Palestinians from area C. This is precisely why the right wing and civil administration’s planning and supervising institutions concentrated their efforts against it, and succeeded.</p>",

        "text":["<p>GOLAN HEIGHTS – As the conflict in neighboring Syria nears its conclusion, a new war is about to erupt in the Golan Heights. But this skirmish will involve ballot boxes, not ballistics.</p> \n<p>A farmer, a banker and a civil servant with a penchant for carpentry are among the candidates running in unprecedented local elections in Druze villages in the Golan. For the 24,000 residents of Majdal Shams, Ein Kinya (aka Ein Qiniyye), Masadeh and Buqata, October will be the first opportunity since Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 to vote on their local representatives, including mayors.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>While some welcome the elections and others condemn them, many Golan Druze seem to remain somewhere in-between, torn between the practical appeal of life in Israel and the emotional draw of Syria, where many of their relatives are either fighting for or suffering under the regime of President Bashar Assad (and sometimes both).</p> \n<p>Amid a complex web of identity, familial and religious politics, the elections are becoming a confusing referendum on all of it.</p> \n<p>“People here felt, even if not consciously, that someday, somehow, sometime, there would be a peace agreement between Israel and Syria and we would be back to Syria and we’d be back to being Syrian citizens,” explains Wael Tarabieh from Al-Marsad, an Arab human rights nonprofit in the Golan.</p> \n<p>“I think that 2011 [and the start of the Syrian civil war] stopped this utopia in the minds of people,” says Tarabieh. “For everybody, it’s clear that it would take maybe decades to have a normal state in Syria.”</p> \n<p>Those are decades that a still modest but growing number of Druze in the Golan are no longer willing to wait. While only 12 percent of the region’s former Syrian population currently holds Israeli citizenship, the Israeli Population and Immigration Authority says there’s been an uptick in the annual number of applications since 2015. An average of some 130 people from the Druze villages in the Golan applied for Israeli citizenship from 2015 to 2017, compared to about 22 over the three previous years. (Unlike the larger Druze community in the Galilee, which has Israeli citizenship and largely serves in the army, the Golan community is much less integrated into Israeli society.)</p> \n<p>But there’s still friction between people who apply for Israeli citizenship and those who vehemently oppose doing so. That divide is now thrown into sharp relief by the October 30 elections – in which permanent residents are only allowed to vote, not run for mayor (Israeli citizenship is a prerequisite for the latter).</p> \n<p>A price to pay</p> \n<p>Samira Rada-Amran is one of a few mayoral hopefuls in Ein Kinya, a hamlet of about 2,300 people and the smallest of the Druze villages in the Golan. She applied for Israeli citizenship as an adult, after divorcing her first husband, an Israeli Druze citizen from the Galilee.</p> \n<p>“I got tired of this ‘undefined’ thing,” says Rada-Amran, 47, referring to the term used on the Israeli ID cards of permanent Golan Druze residents to describe their status. “I want to be defined.”</p> \n<p>Her two sons from her first marriage served in the Israel Defense Forces, even though Rada-Amran’s own father remains loyal to the Syrian army, which he once fought for.</p> \n<p>Rada-Amran, a career banker, says she understands her father’s views but doesn’t share them, and that she chose to take Israeli citizenship because “it’s much easier living in a country when you belong.”</p> \n<p>But in the small Druze communities of the Golan – which are the kinds of places where you get stuck behind two cars stopped in the middle of the road so the drivers can catch up – there’s a price to pay for wanting to belong to Israel.</p> \n<p>“We don’t talk to them and they don’t talk to us,” says Sheikh Ghassan Safadi about the candidates daring to run in the elections, saying this goes for people who say they also plan to vote.</p> \n<p>Safadi is a religious leader who requested to be identified as a resident of Majdal Shams in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. He said that because of the Israeli occupation, the religious leadership completely rejects the upcoming elections.</p> \n<p>“People don’t want this election to happen because they’re afraid,” says Rada-Amran. “They don’t want to look like traitors in the eyes of the Syrian regime” or local religious elders. She adds that even her best friend told her there was no way she would be able to vote this fall because of the high social costs of doing so.</p> \n<p>In this unusual race, identity politics is completely overshadowing what would likely be a bigger challenge for the candidate in any other election. Rada-Amran is the first Druze woman to ever run for mayor in Israel, but she says that with the fundamental nature of the elections still in question, local talk about her candidacy hasn’t even gotten to the “gender thing” yet.</p> \n<p>Druze first, then Israeli</p> \n<p>Monjd Abu Saleh, 45, is a mayoral candidate in Majdal Shams – with a population of 11,250, the biggest Druze village in the Golan. Over coffee and cigarettes at a caf&eacute; in Farid Mall, surrounded by tables of men playing chess and generating clouds of smoke, Abu Saleh declines to say when he applied for Israeli citizenship, but explains why he has always felt Israeli.</p> \n<p>“I feel like a Druze; after that, I’m Israeli,” he says, speaking in a mix of Hebrew, English and Arabic. “I was born here [in 1973]. I don’t know anything about Syria.”</p> \n<p>Abu Saleh is a dairy and livestock farmer who has lived in the Golan Heights his entire life – and it shows. The lean candidate is a highly social man who is repeatedly interrupted to exchange greetings with acquaintances while spending about two hours with Haaretz.</p> \n<p>He also emphasizes several times how he was the first person to announce his mayoral candidacy, a move he says is indicative of his personality.</p> \n<p>Even though Abu Saleh has never traveled abroad, he understands the global significance of the Golan Heights – a region still internationally recognized as occupied territory. To this day, the UN Disengagement Observer Force for Israeli and Syrian forces is the longest-running UN peacekeeping mission.</p> \n<p>But Abu Saleh would prefer that the rest of the world would accept, like he has, that the Golan Heights is a part of Israel for good – something Israel enshrined in law by annexing the region in 1981.</p> \n<p>Asked whether he would like the United States to officially recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel, as Israel has been pushing for, Abu Saleh responds without hesitation. “Oh, sure. Not like, ‘I want that to happen.’ [But] to feel safe” – safe from the bloodshed in Syria.</p> \n<p>Up until recently, Syrian Druze had largely managed to stay out of the country’s seven-year civil war. But in late July, Druze in and around Sweida, southwestern Syria, suffered one of the worst atrocities to hit the community since the war broke out. On July 25, Islamic State militants killed more than 260 people in coordinated attacks in the city and surrounding countryside, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p> \n<p>It is less than 100 kilometers (60 miles) as the crow flies from Majdal Shams to Sweida. Many Druze in the Golan Heights have family in Sweida and experienced the attack virtually through Facebook posts and WhatsApp messages from relatives. So while the community remains split on Israeli control of the Golan, the Assad regime and the coming elections, distance from the chaos and devastation in Syria seems to be the one thing everyone can currently agree on.</p> \n<p>Even Al-Marsad’s Tarabieh admits that the Golan Druze “benefit from the occupation right now.” When it comes to the elections, though, he adds, “People are totally confused.”</p> \n<p>The true leaders</p> \n<p>Al-Marsad opposes the elections, describing them as unlawful – according to the UN Security Council’s rejection of Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights – and undemocratic, due to the tiny number of local residents who are actually eligible to run for mayor.</p> \n<p>However, a High Court of Justice ruling on the same day as the Sweida massacre denied a petition to postpone the elections based on similar arguments. In its ruling, the court essentially said that local Druze who wanted to run for mayor had received plenty of time to apply for Israeli citizenship since the elections were first announced in July 2017. The court also noted that between 2009 and May 2018, Israel approved more than 90 percent of citizenship applications from Druze living in the Golan Heights.</p> \n<p>Haaretz previously reported that these inaugural elections were called in response to a High Court petition by a group of Druze lawyers from the Golan Heights. But Al-Marsad says the elections are “a ploy to accelerate the ‘Israelification’ of the Golan” and that many Golan Druze agree with its position that Israel is exploiting the conflict in Syria.</p> \n<p>“I think Israel is trying to take advantage of the war in Syria, which is a very inhumane thing to do – taking advantage of other people’s misery just to apply your plans,” says Wesam Sharaf, a 24-year-old lawyer and occasional Haaretz contributor who grew up in Ein Kinya.</p> \n<p>“Israel is using this as a chance to make a survey to check if anything has changed in the Golan Heights” regarding residents’ opinions, he says. Sharaf also says he considers sheikhs the true leaders of Druze communities, not the mayor or regional councils that have been summarily appointed by the Israeli government since 1967.</p> \n<p>There’s dissent on that issue, like with every other facet of the elections.</p> \n<p>“The sheikh here is not the boss,” says Tarek Al Safadi, 40, another mayoral candidate in Majdal Shams, where the religious leadership tends to have less influence than in the smaller neighboring villages. (The Safadis are one of the biggest clans in the Golan Heights; the candidate is not closely related to the sheikh interviewed by Haaretz.) He stresses that religious elders still command respect from the younger generation, but not necessarily political allegiance. “They still think if they say OK for the election, it seems like they say OK for the occupation, or for Israelis being here in the Golan – and they don’t want to do it,” says Safadi.</p> \n<p>Religious leaders haven’t publicly called for a boycott in Majdal Shams yet, even though Safadi (the sheikh) says the religious leadership in the region “reject this so-called election.” And all three of the candidates currently in the running hope they can stay out of the fray.</p> \n<p>The formerly state-appointed mayor of Majdal Shams, Dolan Abu Saleh, 40, describes the religious leaders’ position as “not participating but not intervening.” Abu Saleh himself isn’t happy about the elections, after having already served as mayor for almost 10 years and despite being the frontrunner for his old job. He says elections should have been called eventually, but not for another couple of years. “These elections were forced on us” and “the people are not ready for it,” he says.</p> \n<p>Back over coffee with Monjd Abu Saleh (again, the two Abu Salehs are not closely related), when the question of a religious boycott is raised, he calls over to ask a taqiyah-wearing elder sitting at the next table. The man responds with an emphatic “La, la, la” (no in Arabic). With that clarification made, Abu Saleh insists it is time for democracy to come to the Golan Heights.</p> \n<p>“The [appointed] government here, they decide for us what to do and what not to do. I can’t live with that anymore,” he says.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The effort to leverage Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s greatest achievement – America’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and relocation of its embassy to the city – is proving to be an ongoing flop. Only two small countries have so far imitated the United States by moving their embassies to Jerusalem, Guatemala and Paraguay, mainly in order to flatter U.S. President Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>And now that it has a new government, even tiny Paraguay has recanted and is moving its embassy back to Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>On the day the U.S. Embassy moved to Jerusalem, Dr. Miriam Adelson wrote the following in Israel Hayom, the free daily she publishes: “For too long, the Palestinians stymied peace with Israel by insisting on the lie that Jerusalem was theirs. The pragmatists among them understood that this was a non-starter – that Israelis would never give up on the city promised to them in the Bible, millennia before the advent of Islam ... By removing any question about U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, President Trump has freed up these pragmatists to think anew and craft a workable accommodation with their Israeli neighbors.”</p> \n<p>But if we’re already talking about pragmatism, then reality, and global public opinion as well, refuse to remove Jerusalem from the negotiating table, just as they refuse to negate the millions of Palestinians planted between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, no matter how wealthy and powerful the Adelsons are or how many Knesset seats Netanyahu is winning in the polls.</p> \n<p>Even Trump, who Adelson’s article called “the standard-bearer of moral clarity and courage,” hasn’t changed Jerusalem’s status in any substantive way, and in his speech announcing the embassy move, he was careful to retain the distinction between the city’s western and eastern parts. Netanyahu’s entire dream of relocating embassies to Jerusalem – a dream he has deemed a diplomatic goal of the utmost importance – rests on the sign Ivanka Trump unveiled in May, when the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem was inaugurated.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: Can Netanyahu and Trump Downgrade the Palestinian Issue for Good? |&nbsp;Analysis</p> \n<p>It’s not wise to dismiss the importance of a broad international agreement and put all your eggs in President Trump’s wobbly basket. In May, for instance, in a fit of temper, Trump abandoned the nuclear deal with Iran that was signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama. But efforts by members of the European Union, as well as other countries like Russia and China, have so far kept the agreement alive, and their determined stance will likely preserve it for the future as well, if the Iranians pull the covers over their heads and wait patiently for Trump’s departure. Because that’s what happens when you’re part of a broad front – if one player, however key, quits or is downed, the team can still keep playing.</p> \n<p>Relocating embassies to Jerusalem violates a worldwide consensus, and what’s happening now proves that Trump’s exhibitionist move didn’t change that. The fact is that despite various discussions and flirtations, in the end, countries are voting with their feet.</p> \n<p>For many years, there has been quiet international recognition of the fact that western Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, despite the ongoing conflict over the city between the two peoples. But this exists alongside a tacit assumption that ultimately, there will be no choice but to divide the city along the lines dictated by its demographic geography and reach a compromise over its holy sites under international auspices.</p> \n<p>A process of relocating embassies without achieving an agreement with the Palestinians is a plastic prosthesis, alien and foreign, which the Middle Eastern body will simply reject. An unnecessary insistence on this will not only fail to persuade the world of the necessity of its assimilation, but is likely to create a new golem that will turn against Israel the day after Trump leaves office, when the world, in reaction, may demand that it pay a diplomatic price that wasn’t asked of it in the past. Are a few buildings adorned with flags worth that price?</p>",

        "text":["<p>On a cold, damp November morning in the village of Warboys in Cambridgeshire, England, 10-year-old Jane Throckmorton, the daughter of the local squire, became ill and accused an elderly woman, Alice Samuel, of placing a curse on her. The year was 1589 and the European hunt for witches was at its height. When five of her sisters and a dozen of the family’s maidservants began to show the same symptoms and repeated the same accusations – and after a female friend of the family came for a visit and died – Samuel, who was 76, was incarcerated together with her husband and daughter. At the end of what literary scholar George Kittredge called “the most momentous witch-trial that had ever occurred in England,” Samuel and her family were all executed by hanging.</p> \n<p>A postmortem, carried out by the jailer and his wife, furnished incontestable proof. They found on Samuel’s body “a little lump of flesh, in manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an inch.” The two hesitated about whether to disclose this, “because it was adjoining so secret a place which was not decent to be seen.” Finally, “not willing to conceal so strange a matter, and decently covering that privy place a little above which it grew, they made open show thereof unto diverse that stood by.” Indeed, the Catholic inquisitor Heinrich Kramer, had already ordered that the witch’s body be searched for the “devil’s teat” from which Lucifer himself suckles.</p> \n<p>Let’s hope that old Mother Samuel at least derived some pleasure from her “devil’s teat” during her life – the description doesn’t leave much room for doubt about the identity of that “little lump of flesh.” The few who were capable of identifying it correctly at the time were far from that tranquil English village, in the ivory towers of Italy’s universities.</p> \n<p>In 1559, Matteo Realdo Colombo, an anatomy professor in Padua, termed the clitoris the “seat of pleasure of the woman,” similar to the penis in men, and added, with some bravado, “Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.” His successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tubes), was not impressed by Colombo’s poetics and claimed that he himself was responsible for the monumental discovery of the tiny organ: “If others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from me or my students.”</p> \n<p>The question of which man would be the first to plant a flag in the clitoris caused a furor in the medical world of the Renaissance, so much so that the leading anatomist of the time, a Belgian named Andreas Vesalius, felt obliged to address the subject. He declared mockingly, “It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women.” He concluded, “I have never once seen in any woman a penis... or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus.”</p> \n<p>Though Vesalius was highly regarded in his field, and had even taken issue with the sacred texts of Galen and of his teacher and mentor Aristotle on a variety of points – he too possessed the phallocentric approach of the Greeks and the Romans, who viewed the vagina as the opposite and parallel of the penis in the feminine reproductive system. This concept leaves no place for the clitoris, as it has no equivalent in the male body – the perfect human model from which all things derive.</p> \n<p>For his part, Aristotle was familiar with the female ejaculation response and was also the first to profess that blondes have more fun, asserting, “There is a discharge from the uterus which occurs… in those who are fair-skinned and of a feminine type generally, but not in those who are dark and of masculine appearance.”</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, he apparently didn’t have a clue about what causes women to emit the fluid, or about much else in that realm. As to why his first wife, Pythias, who, according to the pioneering feminist and obstetrician Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead, was a nature researcher in her own right, didn’t give him the word on this critical point, history doesn’t say.</p> \n<p>The clitoris had to wait for a different woman to shed light on it. In 1671, Jane Sharp, a British midwife, published a popular manual in which she described how the spongy texture of the clitoris stretches “when the spirits come into it,” as though it were a small penis, and how it “makes women lustful and take delight in copulation, and would it not for this they would have no desire nor delight.”</p> \n<p>Although Sharp was captive to the prejudice that had existed since the Greeks, holding that orgasm, male and female alike, was essential for conception, and warned that without “delight” women would never conceive – she was ahead of her time in other areas. She realized the crucial role the clitoris plays in the sex act, objected to the assumption that women could reach orgasm from penetration alone, and mentioning “the stirring of the clitoris [in which] lies the chief pleasure of love’s delight in copulation; and indeed were not the pleasure transcendently ravishing us, a man or women would hardly ever die for love.”</p> \n<p>As an authority on Eros and Thanatos, Sigmund Freud disputed the views of Jane Sharp and of scientists who followed her, such as Georg Ludwig Kobelt, who had maintained in 1844 that the vagina is only a smooth canal that embraces the penis in copulation, and “we can grant the vagina no part in the creation of the specific pleasurable sex feelings in the female body.”</p> \n<p>‘Virile character’</p> \n<p>In 1905, Freud set about to systematize information on the subject. A man, he wrote, has “only one… sexual organ, whereas a woman has two: the vagina – the female organ proper – and the clitoris, which is analogous to the male organ… [A woman’s] sexual life is regularly divided into two phases, of which the first has a masculine character, while only the second is specifically feminine. Thus in female development, there is a process of transition from the one phase to the other, to which there is nothing analogous in males.</p> \n<p>“A further complication arises from the fact that the clitoris, with its virile character, continues to function in later female sexual life in a manner which is very variable and which is certainly not yet satisfactorily understood. We do not, of course, know the biological basis of these peculiarities in women; and still less are we able to assign them any teleological purpose.”</p> \n<p>According to Freud, the clitoral orgasm belongs to the immature, masculine stage and should be abandoned in order to reach the Holy Grail, or the Golden Fleece of women’s mature, true sexual climax: the vaginal orgasm. In other words, get your hands off your own penis and pay some attention to ours.</p> \n<p>Feminine sexuality continued to disturb Freud, and in his frustration he made a confession to the woman who was his patron and student and who got him out of Austria on the eve of the Nazis’ rise to power: Princess Marie Bonaparte. “The great question that has never been answered and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my 30 years of research into the feminine soul, is, ‘What does a woman want?’” Freud wondered. In Marie’s case, at least, the answer was simple. She wanted to come. Her husband had homosexual tendencies, and on their first night together, she wrote in her diary, he took her “in a short, brutal gesture, as if forcing [himself] ... and apologized, ‘I hate it as much as you do.’”</p> \n<p>Nothing helped. Because the problem of the princess – whose great grand-uncle was Napoleon – was that she adored sex. She had numerous lovers, from her husband’s chief assistant to the prime minister of France, but was unable to achieve the golden vaginal climax with any of them. Taking a scientific approach, she interviewed 243 women about their sex lives and made diverse measurements on them and on herself before reaching the conclusion, which she published pseudonymously in a medical journal, that only women whose clitoris was 2.5 centimeters or less from the vagina could reach orgasm from penetration. Hers was 3 centimeters from the coveted orifice, and therefore she decided to have it moved.</p> \n<p>In her book “Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex,” Mary Roach describes how a surgeon named Josef Halban, who had done the procedure only once before, and that on a cadaver, was placed in charge of that operation and focused on the section of the clitoris that is visible on the surface, without considering the organ’s deep structure. The procedure was a failure. “Some years later, Halban offered to redo the procedure,” Roach writes. It didn’t work that time, either.</p> \n<p>The first encounter between the princess and the father of psychoanalysis opened her eyes to the possibility that maybe it was all in her head and that she should just forget about her clitoris. When her family fled to Egypt in the wake of the Nazi invasion of France, she got the opportunity to interview women whom society did everything to persuade to forget about their clitoris. Female genital mutilation is an ancient rite, whose roots are usually traced to the Koran. But the mentions of it in the Koran suggest that the procedure predates Islam.</p> \n<p>The purpose of clitoral castration is to suppress the sexual drive in women, and it’s usually executed by the women of the family. The rite, which is still in practice, was documented by Herodotus and in the 16th century was cited by the French physician Jacques Dalechamps, who believed that the clitoris was “an unusual feature that occurred in almost all Egyptian women… it erects like a male penis and indeed they use it to play with other women, as their husbands would do... Thus the parts are cut.”</p> \n<p>Marie Bonaparte discovered that not even this horrific mutilation prevented Egyptian women from achieving pleasure in their sexual relations, and some of them achieved climax from penetration despite what they had undergone. But Egyptian society and other societies in Africa and in the Arab world were not unique in this respect. In the 19th century, John Harvey Kellogg, of breakfast cereal fame, recommended smearing the clitoris with acid in order to permanently prevent women from becoming over-excited. The English physician Isaac Baker Brown asserted in 1858 that masturbation by women causes “insanity, epilepsy, catalepsy and hysteria,” and he performed clitoridectomy on his female patients without bothering to tell them what exactly it was he was doing.</p> \n<p>Knowledge is power and knowledge of the flesh is dangerous power, and far more dangerous is knowledge of your own flesh, if you are a woman. In February 1918, some months before the end of World War I, a new front was opened against the clitoris. It was led by Noel Pemberton Billing, a pilot, inventor, publisher, British MP and extreme right-winger, who was haunted by conspiracy theories, anti-Semitism and fears of German spies. According to the fake news disseminated by his journal, Vigilante, Germany maintained and managed, through its Jewish agents, a profitable army of prostitutes, and a certain German prince had in his possession a “Black Book” containing the names of 47,000 men and women in Britain who were vulnerable to blackmail for a bizarre range of sins, from homosexuality to pedophilia. The book was said to provide details of the “unnatural defloration of children,” on top of which, “in lesbian ecstasy the most sacred secrets of the [British] state were threatened.”</p> \n<p>‘A dreadful influence’</p> \n<p>An article titled “The Cult of the Clitoris” in Billing’s journal referred to the actress and dancer Maud Allan, who was then appearing in a scandalous production of “Salome,” by the reviled Oscar Wilde, wearing mostly beads. The journal insinuated that she was a German spy and a lesbian who had been sent to seduce the wife of former prime minister H.H. Asquith. Half a year had passed since the execution of another dancer, Mata Hari, who was suspected of engaging in espionage for Germany, and the public, avid for victims, especially if they were beautiful women, pounced on the idea of the “power of the clitoris.”</p> \n<p>Allan sued for libel. Billing, who represented himself in the trial, explained that the use of the word “clitoris” had been bait. It was a term “that would only be understood by those whom it should be understood by,” he told the court. Another witness termed the clitoris an organ which, “when unduly excited or overdeveloped, possessed the most dreadful influence on any woman, that she would do the most extraordinary things.”</p> \n<p>On the witness stand, Maud Allan was asked if she was a medical practitioner, because “nobody but a medical man or people interested in that kind of thing, would understand the term” – as she had admitted to. But she could not acknowledge the truth about the source of her knowledge. As a young woman living in Berlin, she had illustrated an encyclopedia aimed at providing German women with information about everything in the world, from sewing and breeding roses to the exact location of the clitoris and what it does. But connections with Germany were the last thing Allan could admit to, besides which she needed to protect her biggest secret, which was the grain of truth in Billing’s malicious charges: Maud Allan was in fact a lesbian. Her forbidden knowledge tipped the scales in Billing’s favor. He was acquitted.</p> \n<p>In 1998, when Bill Clinton was tried in the U.S. Senate on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, in the wake of his attempt to redefine the meaning of sexual relations, an Australian urologist named Helen O’Connell revealed the truth and the whole truth: What we’d known until then as the clitoris, that “little lump of flesh,” was only the tip of the iceberg. The vast majority of the organ lies below the surface, it is characterized by a spongy, erect texture like its male counterpart, and it sends “arms” (as O’Connell described them in the Journals of Urology), to embrace the vaginal orifice. While the male sex organ is a kind of Swiss Army knife that fulfills several functions – reproduction, urination, pleasure – the sexual system of the female doesn’t put all its eggs in one basket.</p> \n<p>The clitoris is the only organ in the human body whose purpose is to generate pleasure, and it allows certain women to experience up to 200 consecutive orgasms, as Dr. Ronny Shtarkshall revealed in this newspaper (“Every orgasmic woman can be taught to experience more than one orgasm in a single sexual event, even three or four”) The organ that allows us women to undergo this wondrous phenomenon has 8,000 nerve endings, more than twice what the phallus has.</p> \n<p>So there you go, Dr. Freud – there’s no reason for penis envy.</p> \n<p>The fact that the function, importance and sheer existence of the clitoris has been cast in doubt time and again might show that the envy Freud was talking about is moving in the opposite direction. Even through all those years when its true nature wasn’t fully grasped, the clitoris stirred fear in the hearts of men. It was denounced as being satanic; as the gateway to crime and perversion; as a button that, once pressed, eliminates a woman’s healthy logic; as an infantile penis that needs to be nullified; and even as an organ that should be removed physically or otherwise – as Dr. Charles Mayo Goss did in 1947, when he erased the clitoris from the 25th edition of “Gray’s Anatomy.”</p> \n<p>In contrast to the phallus, which is depicted as either erect or flaccid in works of art across history, the clitoris was neglected and excluded from the artistic conversation. It wasn’t given a place of honor even by female artists who sought to penetrate the lips of the genitalia, like Niki de Saint Phalle’s huge 1966 plaster-and-paint sculpture “HON,” which the artist described variously as a whale, a cathedral, Mama, Noah’s Ark and the biggest prostitute in the world, and which visitors entered through a space between the sculpture’s legs; or Judy Chicago and her stylized vagina-like dishes in her feminist installation “The Dinner Party,” created in the 1970s.</p> \n<p>Contemporary female artists, however, are starting to pay more attention. Among them are Sophia Wallace, who in 2012 created a huge gilded, climbable model of a clitoris, saying that she loves to see men standing in line to scramble up it. Or French sociologist Odile Fillod, who about a year ago created a 3-D life-size model of the organ, which anyone can download and reproduce with the nearest 3-D printer.</p> \n<p>Still, the clitoris remains hidden in the shadows. Few scholars and artists deal with it, few books are devoted to it, and not even many names are given to it, in contrast to the thousands of slang and other words that have been spilled on its homologous organ, the penis.</p> \n<p>Are we now witnessing the spring of womanhood’s flower? Has the time of the oyster in the shell to shine arrived? Websites such as OMGYes, which are devoted to creating a better understanding of the female orgasm and the organ responsible for it, are trying to change the picture. And moves are afoot to revise textbooks and sex-ed instructors to get them to stop referring to the clitoris, if at all, as a “little lump of flesh.” Such efforts may help the titanic phallus not only not to crash on the rocks, but above all to pass the control of pleasure – the way it’s defined, understood and represented – over to women. It’s in our hands, you know.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Gazans in their 50s still remember, with a smile and a bit of disgust, the glass of milk and the spoonful of fish oil they had to drink at UNRWA schools every morning. As adults, they’re able to appreciate the supportive framework the UN Works and Relief Agency for Palestinian refugees gave them, and which that daily dose reflected.</p> \n<p>A resident of the Gaza Strip’s Al-Shati refugee camp, who studied math at Birzeit University in the West Bank in the 1980s, said half the students in his class were from Gaza, and most were refugees. “It’s thanks to the omega-3 in the oil they got from UNRWA,” he joked.</p> \n<p>The children of Gaza’s old-time residents, who aren’t refugees, envied the refugee children because UNRWA schools were considered better than government ones and even provided free notebooks and writing implements including crayons. But the difference also apparently stems from the refugees’ aspirational mantra. After the immediate trauma of losing their land and property, they educated their children in that mantra’s spirit: Study, because now education is your land.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;UNRWA Under Attack: Trump Tries to Destroy a Palestinian Achievement to Force a Deal&nbsp;■ Analysis:&nbsp;Defunding UNRWA Is an Example of Trump’s ‘Peace’ Plan&nbsp;■ Background: White House Doubles Down on Palestinian Refugees Issue, Says UNRWA Mandate Must Change</p> \n<p>Good early education (compared to their surroundings, as one graduate of the UNRWA system stressed) was the basic service UNRWA gave and still gives Palestinian refugees, alongside health care. Most UNRWA employees, some 30,000 people in several different countries, work in these two departments. When residents of refugee camps have more employment opportunities, they have less need of services like food packages. And when UNRWA has to invest in emergency services, this weakens its essential education and health services.</p> \n<p>Even though the United States stopped its financial support for UNRWA, the new school year opened on schedule last week in the agency’s 711 elementary schools located in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza. Every day, 526,000 Palestinian students leave there homes in these diverse lands’ almost 60 refugee camps and attend schools with uniform characteristics – doors and windowsills painted turquoise, the UN flag, a few trees in the schoolyard with whitewashed trunks, photographs of the tent camps of 1949 on the walls.</p> \n<p>These uniform characteristics have been maintained for almost seven decades. Millions of Palestinian children became acquainted with the UN flag before that of their host country, or even that of Palestine, and before they encountered the Star of David that they learned to hate so deeply as a symbol of daily military violence. They saw the characteristic turquoise whenever they went to the refugee camp’s clinic or ate lunch in the dining hall reserved for children of unemployed parents.</p> \n<p>The spontaneous architectural process that these camps underwent is also similar – from rows of tents with taps and toilets at the outskirts; less organized rows of a few rooms around an interior courtyard, which stole a few centimeters from the alleys and made them even narrower; the multistory buildings that arose in the 1990s to house grown-up children. The savings of family members who found jobs made this possible (in Gaza, the West Bank and pre-civil war Syria much more than in Lebanon).</p> \n<p>Beyond the clan</p> \n<p>The refugee camps initially maintained geographic divisions among the original villages from which residents were expelled, and even subdivisions among extended families. But with time, and marriages between people from different villages, these divisions blurred.</p> \n<p>In a society that to this day retains both ties of loyalty and material ties to the extended family, the refugee camps created more modern communities because they expanded the bounds of foundational social loyalties beyond the ties of blood – that is, the family and the clan – to a large group of people who were living through the same difficult experience and had to make do with living spaces several times smaller than what they or their parents had before. The social and national consciousness of a shared fate that goes beyond the shared fate of family members and village members was bolstered there, beyond any doubt.</p> \n<p>This happened even before the Palestinian political organizations became established. Until the Palestinian Authority was created, these organizations weren’t just a vehicle for resistance to Israel and the occupation, but also a kind of super-clans that created their own internal loyalties and developed networks of mutual aid and protection.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian dialect was also preserved in the camps, and people from different villages or regions even preserved their own unique accents. Over time, the Palestinian accent in every host country has absorbed some of the country’s unique variety of Arabic, but it’s still easy to tell a Palestinian in these countries by his accent.</p> \n<p>Some refugee camps underwent a similar sociological process of absorbing poor people who weren’t refugees. That happened in the Yarmouk camp in Damascus, before the civil war destroyed it, in several camps in Lebanon and in the Shoafat camp in Jerusalem. But at the same time, anyone who could left the camps.</p> \n<p>Residents of the West Bank’s Deheisheh camp built an offshoot of their camp on the other side of the road, and today it’s a large, separate community called Doha (named for the capital of Qatar, which helped finance the purchase of the land from Beit Jala residents). The Shabura and Jabalya camps in Gaza also have offshoots that are slightly more spacious. But the ties to and affection for the camp – no less than for the village of origin – remain.</p> \n<p>The uniform framework UNRWA has provided for millions of Palestinian in the camps over the last 70 years has undoubtedly helped them retain these affinities. But had it not been for UNRWA, would they have assimilated completely into their different environments (especially outside Palestine) and forgotten that they are Palestinians, as anti-UNRWA propagandists hope or claim?</p> \n<p>There are hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in South America who aren’t refugees (they mostly emigrated voluntarily) and never lived in refugee camps. But they haven’t abandoned their Palestinian identity. It has even strengthened among the second and third generations, along with their political consciousness. And if they don’t speak Arabic, they’re trying to learn it now.</p> \n<p>Collapse of traditional political system</p> \n<p>Without UNRWA, would the Palestinian refugees not have maintained their emotional ties to their towns and villages of origin? Would they not have made this the basis of their political demand for a right of return?</p> \n<p>Anyone who thinks so is confusing the framework with the content. Even if the United States and Israel manage to destroy the framework, UNRWA, this political and material assault is merely strengthening the ties that bind Palestinians to one another. This is happening despite, and in parallel with, the collapse of the traditional political system of the past 60 years that united Palestinians wherever they lived, inside and outside the refugee camps.</p> \n<p>The parties that comprised the PLO are either nonexistent or weak, divided and strife-ridden. The PLO itself has lost its virtue of being an organization that nurtured Palestinian identity and culture and tried to create a system of social and economic solidarity. It has become a thin shell of gray, anonymous bureaucrats and is completely dependent on the Palestinian Authority.</p> \n<p>The PA, as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas admitted, fulfills its purpose of coordinating with Israel on security issues. It’s a provider of jobs pretending to be a political leadership. It’s also feuding with its rival, Hamas, and that group’s government in Gaza.</p> \n<p>Hamas is even weaker financially. And it maintains its image as a resistance movement mainly in the eyes of those who haven’t experienced the results of its military adventures and delusions on their own skin – that is, people who don’t live in Gaza but in the West Bank or the diaspora.</p> \n<p>In this situation, the framework that U.S. President Donald Trump and former Labor MK Einat Wilf want to destroy remains what it has been for 70 years – an economic and, to some extent, social stabilizer.</p> \n<p>UNRWA’s budget totals $1.2 billion. Its regular budget is $567 million, of which $450 million goes for education, and another $400 million is an emergency budget, of which 90 percent goes to Gaza. That enormous sum reflects the state of this tiny coastal enclave and the ruinous impact of Israel’s assaults and, even more, its restrictions on movement and trade that have left half the workforce unemployed. The rest of UNRWA’s budget is earmarked for various projects (for instance, in Lebanon’s Nahr al-Bared camp, or what remains of Gaza’s reconstruction).</p> \n<p>Eight months ago, when the United States first slashed its contribution by $300 million, UNRWA’s budget deficit was almost $500 million. With great effort, and with countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates contributing $50 million each for the first time, the deficit has shrunk to $270 million.</p> \n<p>UNRWA had to immediately cut its emergency services, of which one of the most important is the Cash for Work program that provides temporary jobs for unemployed Gazans. Other emergency projects were also suspended: psychological treatment for people traumatized by Israeli attacks; help for the Bedouin in Area C, the part of the West Bank under full Israeli control; help for farmers whose lands and income are imprisoned on the other side of the separation barrier; mobile clinics. What is still being funded is the distribution of food and sanitary products such as diapers to 1 million Gazans once every three months.</p> \n<p>Because of the cuts, UNRWA couldn’t renew the contracts of 160 temporary workers in Gaza. It also reduced the salaries of several hundred people employed on its emergency projects.</p> \n<p>The big question is what will happen to its 2019 budget, and whether UNRWA will have to cut or even close its education and health services.</p>",

Some also feel that&nbsp;Sweden's widely admired tax and welfare model has left them behind.</p> \n<p>Fears over globalisation's effect on industrial jobs, the pressure of an ageing population and a failure to integrate minorities have boosted right-wing and anti-establishment parties from Italy and Germany to Britain and the United States.</p> \n<p>Polls indicating one in five voters in&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;are likely to back a party with roots in the far-right, nationalist fringe on Sept. 9 show that even seemingly successful political systems are vulnerable.</p> \n<p>Several online surveys indicate the anti-immigration, anti-European Union&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;Democrats could become the largest party, overtaking the Social Democrats, who have dominated politics for the last 100 years.</p> \n<p>They are likely to do particularly well in Ljusnarsberg where they won a quarter of the vote in 2014, double their national score.</p> \n<p>&quot;I think people here want to see a change, they want society to be like it used to be,&quot; said Mats Larsson, the&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;Democrat's top politician in Ljusnarsberg.</p> \n<p>Most people in the county live in Kopparberg, where the 17th century church, with its blood-red, wooden facade and spires, hints at the region's rich past, built on copper and iron mines.</p> \n<p>Read more:&nbsp;Sweden’s 'Moderate' Far Right Has a Nazi Problem - Opinion | Caught Between Jihadists and neo-Nazis, Swedish Jews Fear for Their Future</p> \n<p>For many years, the area was a heartland of the ruling Social Democrats. Its swing to the right highlights election themes of asylum and a split between poor rural or suburban areas home to immigrants and wealthy places like Stockholm.</p> \n<p>Ljusnarsberg's mines have gone - the last closed in the mid-1970s. Unemployment at the end of last year was nearly 13 percent, almost double the national level. Many live on sickness benefits, masking the figures of those relying on welfare.</p> \n<p>As jobs have disappeared, so have people. The population has roughly halved in the last 50 years and many services have been centralized to Orebro, an hour's drive south of Kopparberg.</p> \n<p>&quot;The 1970s and 1980s were a fantastic time to grow up here in this county. Now everything is falling to pieces,&quot; said Leif Danielsson, 53, a businessman in Kopparberg, the county's only sizable town.</p> \n<p>&quot;Houses are rotting, some places are overgrown with weeds. If you have any education or contacts, you leave.&quot;</p> \n<p>While Kopparberg retained its health clinic, it has been unable to recruit permanent doctors, with temporary staff filling the gap.</p> \n<p>Decades of closures have left Kyrkbacks school in Kopparberg as the only school for 6-15 year-olds in the region. It has also had problems recruiting staff and was rated as one ofSweden's worst by the teachers' union, long before asylum numbers jumped.</p> \n<p>STRETCHED SERVICES</p> \n<p>When&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;took in 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 as hundreds of thousands fled war in&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;and Afghanistan, Ljusnarsberg was assigned around 1,200, the highest concentration compared with its population.</p> \n<p>Many of the new arrivals were unaccompanied minors, and the influx stretched services to the limit.</p> \n<p>Anne-Marie Hagglund, assistant headteacher of Kyrkbacks school, said families just showed up with their migration papers. &quot;They came back day after day until we could take in their children,&quot; she said.</p> \n<p>All but 260 of the refugees have now gone - mostly assigned to other areas by the Migration Agency - yet the unease remains.</p> \n<p>Sitting in a cafe on the town green in Kopparberg, personal assistant Ulrika, 44, said that since the arrival of so many asylum seekers, women are afraid to walk the streets at night.</p> \n<p>&quot;There are lots of robberies. I think a lot of it is to do with immigration,&quot; she said, declining to give her surname.</p> \n<p>Police say the number of reported crimes fell in 2017 compared to the previous year, though they admit that many crimes go unreported. After cutbacks, the nearest police station is in Lindesberg, 40 km away.</p> \n<p>&quot;Of course, we should help people,&quot; said Staffan Myrman, 53, who works at the Kopparberg brewery, one of the two major employers in the Ljusnarsberg region.</p> \n<p>&quot;But when 25-30 percent of the population are refugees, we need to be able to cope with that and we can't.&quot;</p> \n<p>Sweden&nbsp;took in more asylum seekers than any other European country per capita in 2015. But while worries over immigration explain some of the&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;Democrat's gains, unease about economic and social change also plays a role.</p> \n<p>&quot;It is a target to point your anger at,&quot; said Ljusnarsberg Liberal party politician Hendrik Bijloo. &quot;Of course there are racists voting for the&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;Democrats, but they are not even close to a majority.&quot;</p> \n<p>REFERENDUM ON WELFARE?</p> \n<p>It is not just rural areas like Ljusnarsberg where the&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;Democrats have thrived.</p> \n<p>A spate of gang killings and car-burnings have sharpened concerns that authorities are losing control in poorer city suburbs where immigrants make up the majority of the population.</p> \n<p>But welfare is also a big theme, despite that fact that&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;is one of Europe's richest countries, with strong growth and low unemployment.</p> \n<p>&quot;This election is a referendum on welfare or whether we have continued asylum immigration. I choose welfare,&quot;&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson said in a televised election debate.</p> \n<p>The centre-left government and main opposition Moderate Party both plan to spend an extra 20 billion Swedish crowns ($2.19 billion) over the next four years.</p> \n<p>Despite those plans, and already higher spending, many Swedes believe the welfare system is in crisis.</p> \n<p>Sweden&nbsp;scores highly in the quality of healthcare - for example more Swedes are alive 30 days after a heart attack than in other European countries, according to a 2015 study.</p> \n<p>But a growing and ageing population means waiting lists for operations have grown and half of health centres have to cover doctor shortages with temporary staff, according to a report by the Swedish Agency for Health and Care Services Analysis.</p> \n<p>Since 2000, 16 percent of maternity units have closed, a Swedish television report showed. Many women travel more than 100 km (62 miles) to give birth, while schools need to recruit around 77,000 teachers over the next five years.</p> \n<p>Inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, has grown faster in recent years in&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;than in any other industrialized nation, although the country remains among those where income is most evenly distributed.</p> \n<p>This partly explains why mainstream parties' shift to tougher immigration policies after the 2015 crisis has failed to win back disillusioned voters.</p> \n<p>Many locals in Ljusnarsberg are resentful about what they see as preferential treatment for immigrants.</p> \n<p>&quot;They get a better deal, all of them, at the dentist, with the doctor, they are first in the queue always,&quot; said 65-year-old pensioner Torbjorn Lundgren. &quot;That makes me angry.&quot;</p> \n<p>Asylum seekers get subsidised welfare, housing and 71 crowns ($7.79) a day for food and other essentials, including healthcare. Healthcare costs are capped at 400 crowns over a 12 month period. For Swedish citizens the cap is 1,100 crowns.</p> \n<p>&quot;It's not the immigrants fault, it's the politicians,&quot; said pensioner Torbjorn Lundgren, who backs the&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;Democrats.</p> \n<p>&quot;I'm going to vote for them, then we'll see if things change or not.&quot;&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>About a week ago, Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked launched a campaign to instill the values of their party, Habayit Hayehudi, and to reinforce their racist, messianic vision. With perfect coordination, Bennett tweeted, “We’ve changed the discourse from two states to applying sovereignty,” while Shaked chimed in, “Instead of a discourse of evacuation, the discourse today is of regulation.”</p> \n<p>The aim is twofold. First, to entrench the occupation; to use measured language to describe the inherent cruelty of the military control of the Palestinians, the theft of their land and the suppression of their aspiration for liberty. This is the main project of most of Israel’s governments in the past 51 years, and it was done, in the words of the late Israeli singer-songwriter Meir Ariel, “in dubious deceit, smacking of theft, under cover of darkness, with the rulers’ immunity.”</p> \n<p>Second, to prepare the ground for unilateral annexation of the territory without granting political rights to its residents. This type of regime has one name — apartheid — but “regularization” or “imposing sovereignty” sounds better.</p> \n<p>To build an apartheid regime, it is not enough to suppress the Palestinian people; one must also crush the resistance within Israel. Through their new use of language, Bennett and Shaked label opponents of their policy as unpatriotic: Who could oppose the imposition of sovereignty? And why be against regulation? But sovereignty that is granted only to Jews, and not to Arabs, is not sovereignty but rather a regime of oppression. Shaked’s “regularization” is legally sanctioned theft from the weak, with the state inventing the false concept of “state land” in order to steal Palestinian land and assign ownership “legally” to settlers.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; With Israeli Education Minister Bennett, a new school year of indoctrination opens | Analysis&nbsp;■ Tzipi Livni: Decent Israelis must challenge Netanyahu's attempt to turn Israel towards autocracy | Opinion</p> \n<p>The manipulative use of language is meant to justify the sense of Jewish superiority so as to minimize resistance to the ongoing moral injustice of violating human rights. This is how a support infrastructure is prepared for a regime that ideologically distinguishes between people based on their religion and national origin and eliminates the possibility of discussing a common political vision and coexistence within a single social framework.</p> \n<p>The American journalist and social activist Masha Gessen, who was born in the Soviet Union, has written about the similarity between what the Soviet regime did to the Russian language and what the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has done to English and the global political language.</p> \n<p>In the Soviet Union, everyone took part in what were called “elections,” which she writes “were also known as the ‘free expression of citizen will.’” Voting was mandatory, and consisted of “receiving a pre-filled ballot ... and depositing it in the ballot box” — which was also “called the ‘free expression of citizen will,” Gessen writes. Thus, words like “election,” “free,” “citizen” and “will” were emptied of all meaning. When the Soviet regime collapsed, citizens were left without a language with which to debate their political will, since these words had become cynical jokes.</p> \n<p>Later, Vladimir Putin did new damage to the language, advancing concepts such as “dictatorship of the law” and “managed democracy.”</p> \n<p>So it is now in the United States, Gessen writes, as Trump has eviscerated of their meaning such words as “fake,” “news,” “media,” “truth” and “justice.”</p> \n<p>In light of the attempt by Bennett and Shaked to subjugate even the Hebrew language, we must insist on calling things by their names — occupation, apartheid and oppression are not “applying sovereignty,” “regularizationion” and “goodwill.” Good is not bad, and ignorance is not strength.</p> \n<p>Zehava Galon was the chairwoman of Meretz from 2012 to 2018 and served in the Knesset from 1999 to 2017.&nbsp;</p>",

Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here</p> \n<p>TODAY'S NEWSLETTER&nbsp;IN DEBUT: Starting at 7:26AM EDT.&nbsp;  NOW AVAILABLE — Tal Keinan of Clarity Capital is out with a&nbsp;new book titled&nbsp;God Is in the Crowd:&nbsp;Twenty-First-Century Judaism: From the publisher — &quot;Tal&nbsp;Keinan was born to a secular Jewish family in Florida. His interest in Judaism was ignited by a Christian minister at his New England prep school and led him down the unlikely path to enlistment in the Israel Air Force. Using his own dramatic experiences as a backdrop, and applying lessons from his life as a business leader and social activist, Keinan takes the reader on a riveting adventure, weaving between past, present, and future, and fusing narrative with theory to demonstrate Judaism’s value to humanity and chart its path into the future.&quot;  We asked Tal to share with JI readers what he's&nbsp;proposing:&nbsp;  Keinan tells us:&nbsp;Crowd Wisdom. A crowd will only be wise if (a) its members are all answering the same question (b) they are independent in their inputs (c) they are of diverse backgrounds and (d) there is some consistent and objective aggregation mechanism for their inputs. These conditions existed in the diaspora of the past 2,000 years&nbsp;and the idea is to now create a virtual diaspora that consists of...  1.&nbsp;A technology platform that poses the question, solicits independent and diverse input, and aggregates the inputs.&nbsp; 2. And educational endowment that enlarges the crowd of participants, and inspires a critical mass of its members to become “experts” in the issues of Jewish governance. 3. A legislative mechanism to translate the crowd’s opinion into action.  JI: You write about giving every Jew a vote, who would they be voting for and why?  Keinan: They would be voting for the president of Israel. That function would be something like the current Chairman of the Jewish Agency, but with legislative teeth. His or her mandate would be exclusively over matters that make Israel the nation state of the Jewish people. These include eligibility for full citizenship in Israel under the law of return, custody of Jewish holy sites, Israel’s relationship with non-Israeli Jewish communities. The office would have no jurisdiction over matters unrelated to Israel’s status as a nation state of the Jews, for example healthcare, defense, education, etc.  JI:&nbsp;Are you confident you’ll be able to obtain buy-in from the Israeli government and from a wide&nbsp;spectrum of the Jewish community to become more organized/centralized?  Keinan: I am confident I will not! At least not at first. Many of the book’s ideas upset current power structures. My hope is that&nbsp;by laying out the diagnosis clearly, enough of us will realize that the stakes are high and they justify radical thinking. This crowd will have to find its voice organically. It will not be led from the top. My hope is that the book offers a focal point around which this urgent conversation can begin.</p> \n<p>You can read an excerpt of Tal's book here&nbsp;[NationalPost]</p> \n<p>TALK OF THE PARTY&nbsp;CIRCUIT&nbsp;— by Amanda Gordon: &quot;At the Metropolitan Opera House, a new production of “Samson and Delilah&quot; opened the season, with dancers cavorting and climbing up and down a giant gold temple. All for a story revolving around a Biblical man well-endowed with hair follicles but lacking great judgment in women.&nbsp;As for the couples on the scene, I couldn’t find a man who lets his wife cut his hair, but Bruce Kovner, chairman of CAM Capital, said he lets his wife arrange his haircuts.&nbsp;  Some guests could only talk about their hair in the past. “I had a Jewish Afro in my 20s,&quot; said Peter Gelb, the Met Opera’s general manager...&nbsp;Running Harvard University since July hasn’t yet caused any major hair loss for Larry Bacow, who was about a mile away at the 2018 Blavatnik National Awards for Young Scientists. Heck, his hair might even be growing faster after the announcement last week that Harvard raised $9.6 billion in its most recent campaign. But he wasn’t the only one with a fine mane at the Museum of Natural History event...&nbsp;Those who don’t have to wear baseball caps in the sun include Stanford President&nbsp;Marc Tessier-Lavigne, Carlyle Group's David Rubenstein, and Alan Dershowitz...&quot; [Bloomberg]  HAPPENING TODAY —&nbsp;Michael Bloomberg will host world&nbsp;leaders at the Plaza Hotel in NYC for the Bloomberg Global Business Forum.

Jordanian King Abdullah told Jewish leaders&nbsp;on Friday that he has “no idea” what is included in the Trump peace plan...&nbsp;White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether Trump has confidence in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after the NY Times reported&nbsp;that Rosenstein had discussed secretly recording the president and invoking the 25th Amendment...&nbsp;Rosenstein is set&nbsp;to meet&nbsp;with Trump on Thursday...&nbsp;Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and OCC head Joseph Otting want to overhaul the Community Reinvestment Act, in part based on their experiences running OneWest Bank...&nbsp;  AT THE UN: In his UN speech, President Trump condemned Iran’s regime as a “corrupt dictatorship,” and&nbsp;called on &quot;all nations&quot; to isolate Iran. Trump&nbsp;singled out India, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Poland as worthy partners...&nbsp;On Mideast peace,&nbsp;Trump said&nbsp;the United States was no longer “held hostage to old dogmas, discredited ideologies, and so-called experts who have been proven wrong, over the years, time and time again”... Macron swiped at Trump stating that trampling on Palestinians won't resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict... and&nbsp;Trump is unlikely to forgive UN for laughing&nbsp;at him during his speech...&nbsp;  Trump on a meeting with Iran:&nbsp;&quot;I think that, at some point, they’re going want to negotiate.&nbsp;I have said no,&nbsp;so far.&nbsp;It was me that said&nbsp;no, not them...&nbsp;And I think that at some point we will have meaningful discussions and probably do a deal.&nbsp;I don’t see how it works for them otherwise, because otherwise, they’re going to be in the worst economic trouble of any country anywhere in the world.&quot;&nbsp;  Trump tweets:&nbsp;&quot;Despite requests, I have no plans to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Maybe someday in the future. I am sure he is an absolutely lovely man!&quot;&nbsp;  DRIVING THE DAY —&nbsp;President Trump&nbsp;is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the United Nations Headquarters.&nbsp;At the start of their meeting, President Trump mentioned the Jerusalem Embassy move and reiterated his support for Israel's right to defend itself. For the first time since taking office, Trump endorsed the two state solution. &quot;I like [the] two state solution,&quot; Trump said.&nbsp;&quot;You may have a different feeling. I don't think so,&quot; Trump told Netanyahu, &quot;but I think [the] two state solution works best.&quot;  Trump also repeated that Israel will have to &quot;pay something&quot; in exchange for moving the embassy to Jerusalem:&nbsp;&quot;I took probably the biggest chip off the table, and so obviously we have to make a fair deal. Deals have to be good for both parties, otherwise you don't have a deal,&quot; Trump stated. &quot;So something will have to be done. But that's a very big chip (Jerusalem). Israel got the first chip, and it's a pretty big one —&nbsp;there's no question about that.&quot;  -- Quick reactions from experts:&nbsp;Aaron David Miller tells us... &quot;Since he never mentioned it before, this is an indication that this will be in the peace plan, when it's presented. What he did today was make a pretty clear statement, in principle.&quot;  --&nbsp;Elliott Abrams emails us... &quot;First, endorsing the two-state solution is nothing new and will be in the peace plan. As to chips, that arises in the context of significant PLO concessions. I’m not holding my breath.&quot;  -- Former U.S. Amb.&nbsp;Dan Shapiro: &quot;Trump has often said, correctly, that bringing about Israeli-Palestinian peace requires acknowledging certain truths, like that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. It's good to see that he finally got around to acknowledging another one: that the two-state solution is the best (actually only) way to end the conflict. I don't understand why it took so long. The acknowledgement is welcome, but the delay in getting here lengthened the already long odds of success if and when Trump's peace plan is presented.&quot;  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will hold a meeting today&nbsp;with senior officials representing 40 countries and international organizations to discuss ways to block or influence the&nbsp;U.S. Middle East peace plan. It will take place at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, under the theme: &quot;Salvaging the Two-State Solution, Defending the International Rules-Based System.&quot; [Axios]  Israel's Opposition Leader Tzipi Livni met with Abbas last night&nbsp;in New York. In a statement, Livni said she urged Abbas to resume talks with the United States &quot;on the basis of the principle of the two nation-states.&quot;&nbsp;[Pic]  The World Jewish Congress will join UNESCO&nbsp;for a special discussion on the power of education in preventing racism and discrimination, with a particular focus on anti-Semitism&nbsp;at the UN headquarters. Speakers include&nbsp;UNESCO Director General Audrey Azoulay, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, WJC President Ron&nbsp;Lauder, and Professor Deborah Lipstadt, among others.  ON THE HILL —&nbsp;Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL)&nbsp;and Senators Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) sent a letter to President&nbsp;Trump urging him to publicly press Iran to return Robert Levinson.&nbsp;  Former Ambassador Dan Shapiro writes... &quot;How to make Russia back off in the Middle East:&nbsp;A solidarity visit to Israel by a senior US defense official is in order. The United States should encourage a chorus of other countries to join in condemning Iranian military adventures in Syria. This week’s UN Security Council session that Trump will chair presents an excellent opportunity.&quot; [NYPost]&nbsp;  HEARD YESTERDAY&nbsp;— Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the United Against a Nuclear Iran (UANI) annual summit in New York City:&nbsp;&quot;This [Iranian] regime – this regime led by Rouhani and Zarif – provides over $100 million each year to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The most hypocritical part about this is that the Ayatollah claims he cares about Palestinians. But from 2008 to 2017, Iran gave a total of $20,000 to the UN’s relief agency for Palestinian refugees. Meanwhile, the United States gave nearly $3 billion over the same period, 150,000 [times] more money to support the Palestinians than the terror regime in Iran.&quot; [Video]  National Security Advisor John Bolton:&nbsp;&quot;I might imagine [Iran] would take me seriously when I assure them today: If you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat, and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay... The United States is not naive. We will not be duped, cheated or intimidated. The days of impunity for Tehran and its enablers are over.&quot; [Video]&nbsp;&nbsp;John Bolton Warns of ‘Terrible Consequences’ for Those Doing Business with Iran [NYTimes]  Saudi Foreign Minister&nbsp;Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir, UAE&nbsp;ambassador to the U.S. Yousef al-Otaiba and State Department Director of Policy Planning Brian Hook discussed the Iranian threat in a panel discussion. Israeli Mossad Director Yossi Cohen's remarks at a later panel were off-the-record. [Newsweek]  IN THE SPOTLIGHT:&nbsp;For Nikki Haley, a lower profile as Trump heads back to the U.N. — by Anne Gearan and John Hudson:&nbsp;“A pair of incidents in which Haley announced policies or plans that were quickly changed also raised questions about her footing in the administration as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton took over from more passive and ideologically moderate aides… At the same time, Haley’s influence at the United Nations has been blunted by Trump policy decisions that many other nations opposed, including recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, cutting aid to Palestinians and announcing a U.S. withdrawal from the U.N. Human Rights Council.”  “Haley's unapologetic defense of Israel cemented her support among a pro-Israel donor class that could prove useful if she pursues higher political office. “She scored points with the people she wanted to score points with, especially the AIPAC crowd,” [a] former official said… Though Haley could walk away from the Trump administration at any time claiming experience with some of the weightiest foreign policy issues of the day, she appears less prone to an early exit than others, said a senior administration official… “I do get the rumors of who’s on the up and who’s on the down, and Nikki’s name just hasn’t come up lately,” the official said.” [WashPost]&nbsp;  HEARD THIS MORNING — Haley on Fox &amp; Friends: &quot;I have not thought once about running for president. You know, these things when people talk about 2020. I would never run against the President. I would campaign for the President. I mean, without questions, he's done such a great job. And so, I am good about not thinking about the future.&quot;  DONOR CIRCUIT — Kushner's mission improbable: Winning over wealthy Trump skeptics — by Alex Isenstadt:&nbsp;“The 37-year-old Trump senior adviser has attended at least four donor gatherings since August, and those close to [Jared Kushner] say he may soon appear at more. He has been in regular contact with Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson… The two spoke last week...&nbsp;Dan Senor, a former George W. Bush administration official and confidante of Singer and House Speaker Paul Ryan, has helped Kushner navigate some of his outreach.”  &quot;After Labor Day, Kushner attended a dinner&nbsp;at New York City’s Pierre Hotel that drew an elite crowd of donors, think tank leaders, and foreign policy elders from both parties… With Paul Singer at one side of a long table and Democratic mega-donor Haim Saban at the other, Kushner… engaged in a free-flowing conversation about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process...&nbsp;In an interview, Saban said he and Kushner speak&nbsp;several times a month… “He clearly has the president's ear. He clearly, when it comes to the U.S.-Israel relationship, is familiar with the issues and has access at the highest level,” said Saban, who added that he remains a Democrat.” [Politico]&nbsp;  Sheldon Adelson Sees a Lot to Like in Trump’s Washington — by&nbsp;Jeremy Peters:&nbsp;&quot;Mr. Adelson in particular enjoys a direct line to the president. In private in-person meetings and phone conversations, which occur between the two men about once a month, he has used his access to push the president to move the United States embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and, more recently,&nbsp;cut aid to the Palestinians...&nbsp;Republican control of the House and the Senate is so vital to maintaining these policies, the Adelsons believe, that they have given $55 million in the last few months to groups dedicated to making sure it stays that way. That makes them... the biggest spenders on federal elections in all of American politics.&quot;  -- Ari Fleischer talks matzo&nbsp;during Sukkot (15/15):&nbsp;“I think there are a lot of leaders in the establishment Jewish community for whom Donald Trump is not the kind of guy they’d want to break matzo with, but they sure like his policies and what he’s doing.” [NYTimes]  Aaron David Miller writes...&nbsp;&quot;Jared Kushner’s Jewishness Won’t Doom His Peace Plan. This Will:&nbsp;The problem with Trump’s Middle East team is not that it’s made up of “a bunch of Orthodox Jews” as Haim Saban put it... Trump’s team, helmed by Kushner, Greenblatt and David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer, are pursuing an approach that hews far more closely to a Netanyahu narrative...&nbsp;right now, it seems as though the Trump Administration, both in their approach toward Israel and their pressure campaign against the Palestinians, are doing a lot of lawyering for the Israelis — instead of for a deal that both can accept.&quot; [Forward]  MIDTERMS&nbsp;—&nbsp;Why Cory (Not-Running-for-Anything) Booker Is Stumping Nonstop in New Jersey&nbsp;—&nbsp;by&nbsp;Nick Corasaniti:&nbsp;&quot;With his home state suddenly a key battleground in the midterms — with four of the five Republican-held seats considered vulnerable and an unexpectedly tough battle to salvage the Democratic seat of his friend and mentor Senator Robert Menendez — Mr. Booker was blitzing more familiar terrain on a late September weekend, as the not-running-for-anything-right-now senator continued his relentless presence on the campaign trail...&nbsp;Mr. Booker’s growing national presence brought the obvious question: “Is there any chance that you would run for president?” said Ruthanne Swartz, 73, as she pushed her cart through a parking lot after Mr. Booker’s rally with [Tom] Malinowski. The senator paused, turned to the woman and smiled. “I’m honored, but I’m focused on the midterms first,” he said.&quot; [NYTimes]</p> \n<p>** Good Wednesday Morning!

        "text":["<p>The chairman of Efrat – The Committee for the Rescue of Israel’s Babies, who introduces himself in his yekke accent as “Dr. Eliyahu Yosef Schussheim, a millionaire from Jerusalem,” is a graying man who wears a yarmulke and speaks in a didactic staccato. He was given a chance to present his views on a feature called “Docotayim” on the Kan Broadcasting Corporation website, and his bottom line is that even if a pregnant 14-year-old old girl “continues her pregnancy, I can guarantee that she won’t regret it.” It is terminating the pregnancy, Schussheim declares knowledgeably and expertly, that will leave her with emotional scars.</p> \n<p>“It’s inconceivable that because of money we will end life,” he says, angrily, and his organization will provide financial support. He terms the phenomenon of abortions in Israel “an epidemic.” Like swine flu, the plague or AIDS. An epidemic. Abortion is a fatal disease that murders fetuses. What is a fetus, from this perspective? It’s a very tiny baby. What is a very tiny baby? A person. His worldview, therefore, implies that whoever performs an abortion is a murderer. Whoever allows a woman to abort is spreading a deadly disease, a plague that kills babies.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>According to the doctor’s statistics, “It’s estimated that there are 60,000 abortions performed in Israel a year.” And he asks, “How is it possible that after we went through the Holocaust and came to Israel, there are 60,000 fetuses whose lives are terminated?” During the Holocaust six million Jews were systematically slaughtered. But the Jewish people, as a people, survived the Holocaust. They established the State of Israel, and today there are 6.5 million Jews here. On this background, Schussheim wonders: How is it possible that after Hitler systematically murdered six million Jews, in Israel the lives of 60,000 fetuses are terminated?</p> \n<p>What does terminating life mean? It means to murder. To deliberately murder, with premeditation. A helpless creature, a fetus, a very, very tiny baby, a miniature person. After Hitler systematically murdered six million Jews, here in Israel they are killing 60,000 little Jews a year. That’s what Schussheim is saying. There is no other way to understand his remarks. There is no other way to understand the relevance of the first clause, which relates to the Holocaust, to the final clause, which relates to abortions. According to Schussheim, abortion is the continuation of the Holocaust by other means. Hitler wanted to destroy the Jewish people. Abortions are destroying part of the Jewish people. After all, as Schussheim says at the beginning of the item, a Jewish child that’s born will himself give birth to children, who in turn will also bear children, and so on.</p> \n<p>Using the Holocaust as a reason to prevent a Jewish woman or teenager in Israel from having an abortion is beyond demagoguery or cheap, despicable emotional blackmail, which implies that a 14-year-old girl who has an abortion is collaborating with Hitler. This is the essential anti-liberal argument, which posits that a person is meant to serve the needs of the collective (just like an ant in its nest), and is not an individual with his own worth.</p>",

But he didn’t delete at least five offensive tweets made since August that, among other things, refer to Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a “senile fool” who “can’t die soon enough.” He also denounces fired White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman as a “rat bitch” and says that Great Society programs “only” served to “enslave” African Americans.</p> \n<p>He also left up disparaging tweets about Obama, including one from Sept. 7 where he refers to the former president as the “lowest life form of any politician.”</p> \n<p>The DeSantis campaign has sought to distance itself from Alembik, but has not returned several donations he made, records show. Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for U.S. Senate, donated Alembik’s donations to charity after the ‘N-word’ Tweet surfaced.</p> \n<p>“We’ve said it before, we’ll say it again: we adamantly denounce this sort of disgusting rhetoric,” campaign spokesman Stephen Lawson said.</p> \n<p>Democrat Andrew Gillum, who is running against DeSantis, said DeSantis should clarify his associations with people like Alembik.</p> \n<p>“It is up to Congressman DeSantis to explain to Floridians why he has chosen to associate himself with right wing extremist groups and divisive individuals who want to pit us against one another,” said a spokesperson for Gillum.</p> \n<p>DeSantis, who recently resigned from Congress to focus on the governor’s race, immediately came under fire after winning his primary for saying voters should not “monkey this up” by supporting Gillum, who is black.</p> \n<p>The Forward&nbsp;previously reported&nbsp;that the PAC supporting the GOP candidate, Friends of Ron DeSantis, returned two donations in June to Alembik worth $11,000. The PAC still had $2,000 in funds from his company, SMA Communications,&nbsp;according to campaign filings.</p> \n<p>SMA had also listed the campaign as a client on their website, but Lawson denied they were still using them.</p> \n<p>“He is in no way a vendor for us. He’s never done any work for us. Period,”&nbsp;Lawson told reporters Thursday.&nbsp;Elections records did not show any expenditures made by the campaign to the SMA.</p> \n<p>Neither DeSantis nor the PAC returned calls for comment.</p> \n<p>Alembik did not return a request for comment, but he told Politico that he asked the PAC money be returned after his accountant informed him they had been made from the wrong bank account.</p> \n<p>Alembik first made national news after he&nbsp;held a pro-Israel fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago&nbsp;while other groups cancelled their events following Trump’s remarks that there were “very fine people” among the white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville where anti-racist demonstrator Heather Heyer was killed.</p> \n<p>His event was held in February after American Friends of Magen David Adom, which supports Israeli paramedics, cancelled an even there.</p> \n<p>Alembik again made waves after&nbsp;he sued a Hong Kong-based businessman&nbsp;who refused to pony up for two six-foot-tall portraits of the president and First Lady Melania Trump he bought at a fundraising auction at the event.</p> \n<p>The Florida donor has also faced a backlash within the state’s Jewish community. The Florida chapter of the Zionist Organization of America&nbsp;deleted his board member bio from their website&nbsp;and told the Forward they have “severed all ties” with Alembik.</p> \n<p>“We are disgusted over the reports we read of his tweet,” Executive Director Sharona Whisler said. “We categorically denounce that racism.”</p> \n<p>The high-profile Sunshine State race has major implication for the midterms with a tight Senate race on tap and Democrats hoping to flip several GOP House seats.</p> \n<p>It could potentially have an impact way beyond that since the governor will have sway in on redistricting after the 2020 census. Despite being a perennial swing state, Florida’s current congressional districts were gerrymandered to favor Republicans who control the state assembly and senate.</p> \n<p>Major Jewish donors have been predictably split on the key race.</p> \n<p>George Soros&nbsp;donated $1.2 million&nbsp;to a PAC supporting the Democrat. Right-wing megadonors Sheldon and Miriam Adelson&nbsp;both chipped in $250,000&nbsp;to the Republican PAC.</p> \n<p>The GOP nominee has spoken about his support for Israel and attended the embassy move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>But DeSantis was criticized for&nbsp;speaking at the David Horowitz Freedom Caucus in Palm Beach in November 2017.&nbsp;Other speakers included former Trump aide and&nbsp;member of Hungarian far-right group, Sebastian Gorka,, Steve Bannon and Milo Yiannopoulos.</p> \n<p>Gillum faced his own criticisms over supposedly supporting the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.</p> \n<p>“I do not support BDS,” Gillum said in a statement, the Sun Sentinel&nbsp;reported on Sept. 18.&nbsp;“A two-state solution is the only solution that truly pushes us towards peace.”</p> \n<p>For more stories, go to&nbsp;www.forward.com.

        "text":["<p>Residents of the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar in the West Bank received evacuation orders on Sunday, informing them they must leave voluntarily within a week, by October 1.</p> \n<p>The Civil Administration in the West Bank, which distributed the orders, said they were handed out according to the instructions of the High Court of Justice to grant the residents a reasonable period of time to allow them to leave on their own.</p> \n<p>In early September, the High Court of Justice denied a petition filed by the residents of Khan al-Ahmar and gave the state the green light to evacuate the entire village. The community was built on state-owned land and its houses were constructed without permits.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis: Khan al-Ahmar Ruling Gives Green Light for Mass Expulsion of Bedouin Villages ■ Opinion:&nbsp;The Khan al-Ahmar Demolition Will Be Ugly</p> \n<p>Despite the orders being distributed, residents said they do not intend to leave voluntarily, partly because of pressure from the Palestinian Authority&nbsp;to stay put. Some of the residents who are expected to be evacuated said they intend on returning to the site afterwards.</p> \n<p>The Civil Administration said that distributing the orders does not mean the evacuation will be carried out on October 1, and an evacuation date has yet to be set. Security forces paved access roads to the community a few months ago to allow heavy equipment to reach the site, and also placed metal gates around the village that can be closed during the evacuation to prevent vehicles from entering the area.</p> \n<p>Khan al-Ahmar, which is located near Route 1, is home to several dozen families from the Jahalin tribe. The tribe originated in the Negev and was expelled to the West Bank in the 1950s. Aerial photographs and testimony by villagers show that the residents wandered within the Jerusalem-Jericho region before gradually establishing permanent residence in Khan al-Ahmar, apparently in or around the 1970s.</p> \n<p>Since the 1970s, residents have built and lived in tin shacks and fixed tents of the type that require heavy machinery to demolish. The village never received any planning permission, even though members of the Jahalin tribe have been living in the area since before the Six-Day War. While the lands on which the village was constructed are defined as state lands today, the area was expropriated from Palestinian residents of Anata. The Civil Administration issued demolition orders against the illegal structures, orders which the High Court of Justice upheld this month after a prolonged legal battle.</p> \n<p>Although the High Court ruled that no proof of ownership was established between the residents and the village lands, the state could retroactively legalize construction in the village as it has done for Jewish outposts in the area, that were also built without permits.</p> \n<p>Khan al-Ahmar has become a symbol of Bedouin settlement in the region. There are a number of other similar villages of members of the same tribe nearby. One of the reasons the community has become an international symbol is the Tire School, a more durable structure, established with European support. The school houses a number of classrooms and is used by children from Khan al-Ahmar and other nearby communities.</p> \n<p>The plan to demolish the village has aroused international protest, including from the European Union, which has asked Israel to rescind the decision to evacuate the village. The European Union’s foreign policy representative, Federica Mogherini, has said that the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar would endanger the prospect of a two-state solution and carry severe humanitarian implications, as well as violating Israel’s commitments under international law. In July, five large EU countries - Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain - filed a joint diplomatic protest asking to freeze the demolitions. Ireland has condemned the plan as well.</p> \n<p>The secretary general of the PLO Executive Committee, Saeb Erekat, said the Palestinian leadership had turned to the International Criminal Court in The Hague and asked to open proceedings against Israel because of the intentions to evacuate the community. The Palestinian foreign ministry also attacked the decision and called for international intervention.</p> \n<p>After the evacuation, the government is expected to house the residents in the Jahalin West site near Al-Eizariya, a Palestinian village not far from the current site, but whose residents are in a feud with the Khan al-Ahmar population. Previously, the state offered to resettle the village residents at another site located between the sewage treatment plant in the vicinity of Mitzpeh Yeriho and the Abu Dis garbage dump. It is not clear if this offer is still on the table.</p>",

He went to Brtain, where he joined a special commando unit operating under the British Special Operations Executive.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Roenneberg, serving behind enemy lines in his native Norway during the German occupation in 1943, blew up a plant producing heavy water, or D2O, a hydrogen-rich substance that was key to the later development of&nbsp;atomic bombs.</p> \n<p>Picked by Britain’s war-time Special Operations Executive to lead the raid when he was only 23 years old, Roenneberg was the youngest member of Operation Gunnerside, which penetrated and destroyed key parts of the heavily guarded Norsk Hydro plant.</p> \n<p>The subject of books and documentaries as well as movies and a TV drama series,&nbsp;notably “The Heroes of Telemark,” a blockbuster from 1965 starring Kirk Dougles.&nbsp;The attack took place without a single shot fired.</p> \n<p>To Roenneberg’s team, however, the stakes could not have been higher. An earlier raid failed to even reach the site, with dozens of attackers captured and killed, and Gunnerside members later described their own assault as a near-suicide mission.</p> \n<p>They didn’t have a plan, Roenneberg later told the New York Times: they winged it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Parachuting onto a snow-covered mountain plateau, the small group teamed up with a handful of other commando soldiers before skiing to their destination, penetrating the plant on foot and blowing up the heavy water production line.</p> \n<p>Describing a pivotal moment, Roenneberg later said he made a last-minute decision to cut the length of his fuse from several minutes to seconds, ensuring the explosion would take place but making it more difficult to escape.</p> \n<p>While a manhunt ensued, the group fled hundreds of kilometers across the mountains, with Roenneberg skiing to neighboring Sweden, a neutral country in the war, two weeks later.</p> \n<p>At the time, he hadn’t even realized the plant was part of the Nazi nuclear program, Roenneberg said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While historians doubt that Adolf Hitler’s&nbsp;Germany&nbsp;would have been able to produce a nuclear weapon in time to stave off defeat, they also recognize that the risks were much harder to quantify in 1943.</p> \n<p>After Gunnerside, Roenneberg participated in other missions. He became a radio reporter following the 1945 liberation, but rarely spoke of his wartime achievements. Later in life he gave speeches and lectures well into his nineties, warning against the destructive force of totalitarianism.</p> \n<p>Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg on Sunday praised Roenneberg for his work both during and after the war.</p> \n<p>“He is one of our great heroes,” she told news agency NTB.</p>",

        "text":["<p>November 6th&nbsp;is report card day for the U.S. government. The results of the hotly contested midterm elections will speak volumes to the Trump administration's prospects moving forward. Many millions of dollars are pouring into the coffers of both major parties for precisely that reason – to either promote or obstruct the president's agenda for the remainder of his term.</p> \n<p>Republicans and&nbsp;Democrats assert equally that their faithful were fired-up by Brett Kavanaugh's bitter confirmation process for the Supreme Court, but indications are that Donald Trump's GOP will take a hit. The party controlling the White House traditionally&nbsp;loses&nbsp;seats in the midterm ballot and, indeed, polls are forecasting a Democratic&nbsp;takeover of Congress; Republicans are expected to retain their&nbsp;hold on the Senate.</p> \n<p>Among those watching closely to assess the fallout will be Israeli policy-makers. Prominent friends of the Jewish state are heavily invested in the campaign – on&nbsp;both sides of the aisle – and relations between Israel and its chief benefactor and ally stand to be impacted by the outcome.</p> \n<p>This is the time to consider how Trump has fared in Israel's backyard over the past two years and, on the cusp of a transformed reality in Washington, how things could now change.</p> \n<p>Back in 2016, expounding on his foreign policy views after securing the Republican nomination for president, Trump&nbsp;declared&nbsp;that the U.S. &quot;need[s] unpredictability.&quot; It's since become a defining feature of his tenure.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;One Day, Palestinians Will Thank Trump for His Years of Hostility</p> \n<p>On Twitter, he's trashed foundational treaties of American diplomacy, such as&nbsp;NATO&nbsp; and&nbsp;NAFTA. In September, he&nbsp;confided&nbsp;to thousands at a political rally that he and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un &quot;fell in love.&quot; Trump has reveled in playing the&nbsp;enfant terrible&nbsp;who breaks all the china,&nbsp;pun&nbsp;intended.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>His pursuit of &quot;better deals&quot; for America has antagonized many of its friends, but it has not been bereft of success. Along the way, Benjamin Netanyahu's government has also been an ostensible beneficiary of the Trump approach. (It's no coincidence that 69% of Israelis - the second highest proportion in the world - expressed&nbsp;confidence recently that Trump would &quot;do the right thing regarding world affairs.&quot;)</p> \n<p>After eight years – minus ten weeks – of incessant sparring between Netanyahu and Barack Obama at the helm of the U.S.-Israel relationship, those tensions have largely subsided, and the two executive branches are marching in relative lockstep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On Iran, Netanyahu's signature issue, Trump's May 2018&nbsp;withdrawal&nbsp;from the JCPOA nuclear deal was much to the chagrin of its other participants – but still generated their&nbsp;begrudging&nbsp;conformity with a&nbsp;tighter&nbsp;sanctions regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bucking conventional wisdom, Trump also blazed a trail with a series of decisions favoring Israel's positions in its conflict with the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>A presidential&nbsp;proclamation&nbsp;recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and mandated the relocation of the U.S. embassy to the city. The State Department announced a&nbsp;cessation&nbsp;of funding for UNRWA, the agency providing aid for the Palestinians and reviled by the Israeli government for&nbsp;perpetuating&nbsp;their refugee status.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For good measure, Trump also&nbsp;pulled the U.S. out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, where Israel is the&nbsp;punching bag of choice.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the administration's penchant for pyrotechnics – deployed mostly against lower hanging fruit – has been coupled with a reluctance to engage deeply with &quot;messier&quot; strategic questions. Here, the negative consequences for Israel are more acute.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump's Mayhem Allows Putin's Russia to Take Over the Middle East, One Country at a Time</p> \n<p>Trump's deference to Vladimir Putin has, among other things,&nbsp;conceded&nbsp;the&nbsp;run of the Syrian theater to Moscow and its nefarious proxies, including Iran and Hizbollah. An ascendant Russia in the regional driver's seat has&nbsp;complicated&nbsp;Israel's operational calculus immensely.</p> \n<p>Trump has shown himself to be fond of grand symbolic gestures and ceremonious flashes of his official pen, but he has yet to&nbsp;visit&nbsp;his own troops stationed in Iraq, Syria or Afghanistan.</p> \n<p>If, on balance, Trump has been sympathetic to Israeli concerns – his evident&nbsp;tolerance&nbsp;for white supremacists, notwithstanding – the greatest danger for Israel is the tentativeness of these gains. Who can be certain that Trump, who regularly&nbsp;chastises his country's closest partners, will not flip the table over on Israel's head too? Even the best partnerships can be&nbsp;fragile.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Mideast 'Friends' Beware: Trump Just Proved How Easily He’ll Sell Out America’s Allies</p> \n<p>The architecture of Israel's Middle East posture is shifting at this very moment. A potential&nbsp;thaw in Trump's relations with Turkey's President Erdogan could put unfriendly Ankara back in America's good graces. Meanwhile, fallout from the death&nbsp;of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi interrogators is all but guaranteed to drive a wedge between Washington and Riyadh – perhaps turning hopeful Israeli-Saudi&nbsp;cooperation into a liability.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This volatility is Israel's Achilles' heel.</p> \n<p>Frequent&nbsp;turnover among the ranks of senior administration officials has not only encumbered coordination with Israel (and others), but also seen the departure of treasured allies such as departing U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. This turnstile will be working overtime during midterm season, and the newcomers may be even less capable of restraining Trump’s darker impulses.</p> \n<p>Further ahead, approaching the 2020 vote and beyond, Israel will surely remain a political football in an increasingly polarized America. Pushing back against a recent New York Times story&nbsp;alleging&nbsp;that their party's attachment to Israel has become tenuous, Democratic lawmakers&nbsp;reaffirmed&nbsp;their historic support for Israel. But their resentment toward the Trump White House – and, by extension, its Middle East policy – is no less powerful.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has taken out a big mortgage in embracing Trump. Detractors of the current administration, including a preponderance of American Jews, may not be inclined to forget and forgive the fact that Israel has been one of this president’s loudest cheerleaders.</p> \n<p>The challenge for Israel will be to safeguard the benefits of this high-stakes gamble as Trump's rivals are poised to curb his power and angling, down the road, to replace him in office.</p> \n<p>Shalom Lipner is a nonresident senior fellow of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution.

        "text":["<p>All eyes were on Turkey on Tuesday morning, in anticipation of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s promise to reveal the &quot;naked truth” of the murder of Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. Most suspected that he would present evidence incriminating Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Crown Prince. One Turkish official stated, in a deliberate curtain-raiser: &quot;Nothing will remain secret.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the end, Erdogan didn’t reveal anything new, and didn’t even cover vast swathes of the details being drip-fed to the international media through anonymous Turkish official sources. We will need to wait longer to see if a key element of those stories – that Turkey possesses secret tapes, audio and perhaps even video, of the gruesome murder is confirmed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'Bring me the head of the dog': How top MBS aide ran Khashoggi's killing via Skype&nbsp;■&nbsp;Like a mafia boss, Erdogan plans to milk the Khashoggi investigation for all it’s worth</p> \n<p>It has been over three weeks since Khashoggi walked into the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul and disappeared into thin air. During the first few days following his entering the embassy, those close to him must have been hoping that his fate might be that of so many dissidents worldwide, who are illegally “rendered” by their governments only to appear at show trials back in their home countries.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, less than a week after his disappearance, Turkish newspapers ignited a media frenzy with news that a search was being conducted for his body. It seemed Turkish intelligence knew something that we did not: Khashoggi had been ruthlessly killed at the hands of the Crown Prince and the Saudi Government right there in the consulate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since then, Khashoggi’s murder, for a lack of better words, has taken on a life of its own, transpiring into media sensation.</p> \n<p>There is not one place in the world where people are not talking about his death; the U.S. media follows the case like a&nbsp;Netflix television series with all of its gory details, plot tricks and subterfuges: a body cut to pieces with a bone saw smuggled in by a 15-man Saudi hit team, a killing allegedly recorded on the&nbsp;Apple watch of the victim, (unlikely on technical grounds), a double who dressed up in the dead man’s clothes, who exited the back door of the consulate and was caught on numerous surveillance cameras throughout the city.</p> \n<p>President Trump seemed less impressed by the quality of the dramatic narrative: he declared Tuesday that: &quot;They had a very bad original concept. It was carried out poorly and the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.&quot;</p> \n<p>Khashoggi-related stories and tidbits have filled Americans’ media feeds non-stop for two full weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite all the coverage, the media has missed a golden opportunity to draw greater conclusions from the story.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With so much attention given to the murder of a dissident journalist, one might think that Khashoggi’s murder would have sparked a passionate and informed discussion on the extent of state targeted killings and other human rights violations journalists face every day.</p> \n<p>Instead, the international press has played up endless unconfirmed reports by the Turkish government - regularly leaked by government officials&nbsp;&nbsp;via its obedient press - and replays these second-hand scoops rather than leading their own investigative journalism.</p> \n<p>The latest was the claim that Khashoggi’s body had been found in a freshly dug grave in the grounds of the Saudi consul general’s home, a scoop based on “unclear” and “unconfirmed” sourcing with no back-up evidence&nbsp;and then denied by the Istanbul police (as channeled by state-run media).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Suddenly a country that has the highest number of jailed journalists and has a record of kidnapping its own dissidents from abroad, has become a symbol and source of justice, with eminent papers as the New York Times and CNN quoting conspiracy-ridden government mouthpieces such as Yeni Safak, Sabah, and its English version, Daily Sabah.</p> \n<p>And if this was not enough, - with no remaining free press in Turkey – those sources can’t even pretend to offer counter narratives, just the one sole voice of Erdogan’s government.</p> \n<p>By doing this, the international media provided a stage and unwarranted legitimacy to Turkish media outlets that frequently spread lies and hate towards Turkey’s own journalists and political dissidents.</p> \n<p>Analysts have correctly stated that Turkey is using the incident as a way to delve a major blow to their Sunni rivals, Saudi Arabia, and, certainly, one cannot blame Erdogan and his circles for doing their utmost to control the information and for using the leaks to their own benefit.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, all the leaked stories in the world can’t hide the fact that it can’t have been by chance that the Saudis chose Istanbul as the scene for Khashoggi’s grisly murder. The Saudis must have (correctly) estimated the Turkish security apparatus was not good enough to stop them. Or even (wrongly assessed) that the crime of targeting a regime critic wouldn’t raise too much of an outcry among Turkish authorities.</p> \n<p>For now, we are all caught up in stories of bone saws and blood, and have forgotten that the greater loser in this case, after Khashoggi himself, is journalism and its search for the truth.</p> \n<p>Ironically, and painfully, it seems that it is journalists who have buried that truth in the grave dug for Khashoggi by the Saudis - undermining their jobs as journalists in a breathless hunt for more grisly, sensational details spoon fed by unnamed sources in hock to the Turkish government.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Just as the West has already exhausted its interest in attacks on free expression in Turkey (among other places in the world), the more &quot;conventional&quot; stories of journalists jailed, disappeared and killed will continue to be treated as mundane - and unremarked. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>By not placing the Khashoggi murder in the context of an attack on journalists in general and highlighting Turkey's repressive media climate in particular, it seems a safe prediction that we will have more Khashoggis whose fates won’t be tracked so closely because their far quieter deaths will be filed under &quot;old news.&quot;</p> \n<p>Louis Fishman is an assistant professor at Brooklyn College who has lived in Turkey and writes about Turkish and Israeli-Palestinian affairs.

        "text":["<p>It was a Saturday afternoon and ancient bones and pottery were sent flying again as amateur motorcyclists raced over the dirt paths crisscrossing Tel Shimron, a hill in northern Israel. Little did these weekend racers know (or perhaps care) that they were riding over the stratified remains of towns and villages that had been built atop one another for more than 4,000 years, from before the time of the biblical conquest by Joshua up until the early years of the modern state of Israel.</p> \n<p>“We had to do some quick salvage work over there, where they are spinning their wheels, because the bikes were turning up bones and materials from the Bronze Age,” says Daniel Master, an archaeologist from Wheaton College, near Chicago, Illinois.</p> \n<p>To limit the damage, archaeologists covered and reburied the most vulnerable parts of the site. A natural reserve, Tel Shimron is surrounded by a fence which regularly gets torn down by bikers and other trespassers, Master explained during a visit to the site last week.</p> \n<p>Shimron is one of the last major biblical sites yet to be properly explored by archaeologists. Now the tel, a mound formed by subsequent levels of human habitation, has become the focus of a major expedition. The archaeologists have already turned up the remains of a large Canaanite city from the Middle Bronze Age; a prosperous Hellenistic town with international connections; and a Jewish village from the Roman era.</p> \n<p>Researchers hope the site will help answer key questions about the historicity of the Bible, including, possibly, whether the Israelite conquest narrated in the Book of Joshua actually happened.</p> \n<p>How could a large site clearly dating back thousands of years, and possibly crucial to the biblical narrative of the Israelites, be ignored for so long? &nbsp;</p> \n<p>One reason for the scientific snub may be that the site was more or less continuously inhabited up to the 1950s, when it housed a transit camp for newly-arrived immigrants to Israel, explains Master. Also, a dig that spans so many periods requires a large team with experts in multiple fields committed to working on the site for decades - and lot of money, he says.</p> \n<p>That last part has been taken care of by a sponsorship from the Museum of the Bible, the Washington D.C. museum established by the Green family, Evangelical billionaire owners of the Hobby Lobby crafts chain. Since opening last year, the museum has been criticized by some scholars for allegedly pushing a religious reading of the Bible rather than one based in science and archaeology,&nbsp; and lately because its collection apparently included forged antiquities.</p> \n<p>Asked whether such sponsors might attempt to influence the direction or the conclusions of the Tel Shimron dig, Master said the archaeologists made sure their agreements with the museum grant them full academic independence. “Until now it has worked very well, I don’t have any fear that anybody will put pressure on us to pursue a less scientific approach,” says Mario Martin, an archaeologist at Tel Aviv University who co-directs the dig with Master. “That’s just not an option. If there were such pressure one day, I would probably get up and go away.”</p> \n<p>Although small surveys have been conducted in the past, including one in 1982, archaeologists of the joint project by Wheaton College and Tel Aviv University only began digging at Shimron in earnest in 2017 and plan to return for a second season in the summer of 2019.</p> \n<p>Joshua was here. Or not</p> \n<p>To understand the wealth of discoveries that may be awaiting archaeologists, just consider that Tel Shimron, sprawling over 16-18 hectares, is about three times larger than Megiddo, which is just 15 kilometers to the south.</p> \n<p>Megiddo is the site of epic battles described in the Bible, and is the spot Christian tradition identifies as Armageddon. In keeping with its importance to biblical narratives, Megiddo has been intensively investigated, since the early 20th century. Archaeologists have found spectacular palaces and gates from the Bronze Age and Iron Age, and have argued ever since whether some of these remains constitute proof of the existence of the biblical kingdom of David and Solomon.</p> \n<p>Shimron too appears in the Bible, as one of the main allies of the King of Hazor in opposing the Israelite invasion of Canaan (Joshua 11:1); and when the Hebrews vanquish their enemies, the town becomes part of the territory of the tribe of Zebulon (Joshua 19:15).The archaeologists are looking for signs of destruction datable to the 13th century B.C.E., when Joshua is supposed to have lived.</p> \n<p>Exactly such a layer has been found in the Canaanite city of Hazor (also known as Hatzor), in the upper Galilee: some archaeologists have hailed it as evidence of conquest by Israelite tribes. But other researchers consider it merely the result of internal strife.</p> \n<p>Whether or not signs of destruction appear at Shimron is unlikely to settle that debate, but archaeologists would still like to figure out how this particular town ended up in the biblical text, Master says.</p> \n<p>Most scholars agree that the Book of Joshua is part of what has been dubbed the Deuteronomistic history, a chronicle compiled in the late Iron Age, probably starting around the 7th century B.C.E. In other words, it was apparently written half a millennium after the supposed events narrated in Joshua.</p> \n<p>“The fact that Iron Age biblical scribes picked cities like Hazor and Shimron to be part of the story suggests they must have known there were large Bronze Age cities there,” Master says.</p> \n<p>Ground zero in the Galilee</p> \n<p>One possible explanation for this knowledge lies in the fact that even today, atop Tel Shimron is the ruin of a large public building from the Middle Bronze Age. Its walls can still be seen peeking through just under the surface.</p> \n<p>This suggests that nothing was built atop the site after the building was destroyed, an unusual choice, since in most ancient cities the highest point in town, the acropolis, was the most prestigious and defensible area.</p> \n<p>A similar situation occurs at Hazor, where the destroyed Bronze Age palace was not built over for centuries and was kept as “a kind of Ground Zero monument,” notes Martin. “So this is something that can definitely influence later writers, even if they are writing 400 or 500 years later.”</p> \n<p>Why people in the Iron Age Levant chose to preserve remains from previous, ancient settlements, we may never know, but what seems certain is that the glory days of Shimron predate the biblical period by hundreds of years.</p> \n<p>While there are signs of habitation going back as far at the Neolithic, the site likely reached its peak extension as a Canaanite city in the 17th century B.C.E., when large earthen ramparts were raised around it, and it would have had a population of around 4,000 people, Master says.</p> \n<p>The town would have been a major agricultural settlement but possibly also an important trading and administrative post. It was smack on the main route through the Jezreel Valley that connected the Mediterranean to the Jordan Valley and from there on to distant lands including Syria and Mesopotamia.</p> \n<p>Shimron's cosmopolitan nature is attested by recent finds such as Egyptian scarabs and a fine cylindrical seal, probably from Syria, the archaeologists say. It is also why the town is mentioned in multiple Egyptian documents from the second millennium B.C.E.</p> \n<p>When and how this prosperous Bronze Age settlement came to an end, and whether the Israelites had anything to do with it, is still unclear.</p> \n<p>“We don’t know exactly when the Israelites are here, so another interesting question will be to see if their presence can be distinguished and how the different influences of the surrounding people, the Israelites, the Phoenicians, the Assyrians played off each other,” Master says.</p> \n<p>Saved by Josephus?</p> \n<p>After the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel in the 8th century B.C.E. at the hands of the Assyrians, Shimron appears to have been mostly abandoned, until the Persian and Hellenistic periods.</p> \n<p>In the 3rd and 2nd century B.C.E. a new settlement arose that had a clearly international bent, featuring refined pottery and faience imported from places as far as Rhodes and Egypt.</p> \n<p>The two directors of the project are veteran archaeologists: Master worked for 25 years at the Philistine city of Ashkelon while Martin dug for the last two decades at Megiddo.</p> \n<p>They say they were attracted to the site because they wanted to compare a coastal town like Ashkelon to an inland settlement such as Shimron.</p> \n<p>Over the centuries, the town seemed to see-saw between Mediterranean influences and the predominance of local cultures. Around the 1st century C.E., the Hellenistic settlement was replaced by a typical Galilean Jewish village: archaeologists have found remains of a mikveh - a ritual bath - and stone vessels, which were preferred by Roman-era Jews for matters of ritual purity.</p> \n<p>During this phase, the village was called Simonias, and played a key role in Jewish history. It is mentioned in the Talmud and the Mishna, and it also appears in the autobiography of Josephus Flavius, the Jewish general and historian charged with defending the Galilee during the Great Revolt of 66-70 C.E.</p> \n<p>It was at Simonias, Josephus tells us, that he won a victory against the Romans, temporarily halting their advance in the region. Josephus would eventually switch over to the Romans after being captured, but perhaps it is a testament to his early military prowess that the Jewish village at Simonias appears to have endured well into the 4th century.</p> \n<p>After that, the history of Tel Shimron stretches on into the Byzantine and Islamic eras, the Crusades and then the Mameluk and Ottoman empires. “For however long I dig here, there will still be more to find,” says Master. “It will take generations to uncover it all.”&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>On Baron Hirsch Street in Moises Ville, a small town 600 kilometers north of Buenos Aires, a robust man of 72 is standing amid stacks of old and new bicycle parts. He greets us as we approach, before setting off to look for a tire valve.</p> \n<p>But Alberto Lind turns out to be not only a bike repairman. He’s also the last maker of gravestones remaining in this once-promising Jewish settlement on the Argentine Pampas. The idea, according to its patron, Baron Moritz von Hirsch, was to establish “a kind of autonomous Jewish state.” The Jewish colonies that dotted Argentina were once considered the model of a free life for the Jewish people, where they could be close to the soil and safe from pogroms.</p> \n<p>In the peak years of Moises Ville, the 1940s, the town boasted about 5,000 Jews, constituting more than 90 percent of the population of what was dubbed the “Jerusalem of Argentina.” “Shall we choose Palestine or Argentina?” Theodor Herzl reflected in 1896, upon publishing his seminal work, “The Jewish State.” It wasn’t until a year later that he arrived at a decision.</p> \n<p>When he was 20, Lind – who notes with pride that in Hebrew he’s Avraham and in Yiddish, Avrum – was the local policeman. When a truck speeding past his house hit and killed his best friend’s son, he used his calligraphic skills to fashion a fine headstone. Impressed by his work, the community made him the official tombstone maker for the next 50 years. Lind says with satisfaction that stones engraved by him adorn cemeteries as far away as Buenos Aires and that some have even been sent to mark graves in Israel.</p> \n<p>Today, fewer than 140 Jews live in Moises Ville, out of a total population of about 2,500. Press clippings about the town constitute a statistical record of the ongoing decline of its Jewish population. A report from 1965 cites 2,000; another, from 1975, mentions 1,200. In 2002, Haaretz reported that fewer than 300 Jews lived there. Today, although the Jewish community is quite elderly, Lind’s headstone work is slack. At one time he engraved 60 markers a year, now it’s down to five. It’s that falloff that led him to take up bicycle repair.</p> \n<p>“Once there was a community,” he says sadly, though with his ever-present smile. “There was a Jewish bank and there were Jewish schools. It’s all gone.”</p> \n<p>I know what he means: I felt during my visit to Moises Ville as if I’d come to a big party a few hours after the revelry ended, with the only people still in the hall having been somehow abandoned, along with decorations that are still waiting to be taken down. The people I met were extraordinarily sociable. The interviewees didn’t want to let me go – they all wanted to go on and on talking about the town. As though all that’s left to the handful of remaining Jews is the history and the splendid memories.</p> \n<p>The only Mizrahi</p> \n<p>The settlers in pre-1948 Palestine viewed the Jewish colonies in Argentina as competition, were angry that money was being diverted into the South American venture, and prayed – sometimes silently, sometimes not so silently – for its demise. But the other side didn’t see things quite the same way. The Argentine settlers admired their counterparts in the Land of Israel, while they generally viewed their own endeavor as a transition stage necessary to flee from Eastern Europe.</p> \n<p>Following Britain’s publication of the Balfour Declaration, in 1917, the Jews living in the Argentinean settlements begged for land in Palestine from the institutions of the Jewish community there, so that they could join them. But in contrast to the Jews of Europe, they saw their requests denied, even though they already possessed agricultural know-how. Everyone I met in Moises Ville spoke proudly about the number of times they had visited Israel and rattled off the names of the places in the Jewish state where their children live. In this sense, the decline of the Jewish community of Moises Ville can be viewed as the success of the Zionist education its residents received.</p> \n<p>The beginnings were auspicious, as a tour of the town reveals. Even though the first settlers, who arrived in October 1889, barely had anything to eat, they established a fine theater, which is still in operation (the resident amateur group’s current production is about toilets), impressive business cooperatives and two libraries.</p> \n<p>Unlike their peers in present-day Israel, the Jewish people venerated culture. “A library and a cemetery are the institutions that are capable of encompassing everyone – Zionist and anarchist,” wrote Hersh David Nomberg, who visited Moises Ville nearly a century ago. Nomberg was especially taken by the library. He noted that, in each of the far-flung places he visited in Argentina, the library was always the first place he was shown.</p> \n<p>Most of the people I met were affable pensioners. Their children had for the most part moved to Israel or to big cities in Argentina. The number of Jews under the age of 20 in Moises Ville can be counted on the fingers of two hands. One of the centers of local Jewish life is a museum of Jewish settlement, established in 1989, the centenary of what was the original Jewish colony in Latin America. The museum’s devoted director is Ilana (Hilda) Zamori, 45, whose father fled to Moises Ville as a child from Germany in 1938. During the state’s early years, he tried out life in Israel, and even fought in the 1967 Six-Day War, before finally returning to Moises Ville. Though her mother is not Jewish, Zamori tells me, her maternal grandfather spoke perfect Yiddish – the language of the colony – which he picked up by ear.</p> \n<p>“In the early years, there were no intermarriages,” she says, “and when they started, people didn’t like it. Over the years they got used to it. My father’s family accepted my mother kindly.”</p> \n<p>The museum’s founder, Chava (Eva) Gelbert, maintains that Moises Ville’s heritage remains intact.</p> \n<p>“The place has changed, but something remains of it,” she says. “Every home knows how to make knishes. Visitors from Israel asked the high-school girls who showed them around whether they were Jews. They explained that even though they are not Jewish, they identify with the town’s history.”</p> \n<p>After my visit to the theater, I was taken to see the sukkah that was being erected in the back of the empty “Yahadut” (Judaism) School. We met Hector, a non-Jewish employee of the Jewish Agency, who was smilingly decorating the sukkah with branches from palm-like trees that grow behind the theater. I asked him if he knew what the meaning of the holiday booth was. “People come to drink coffee and tea in this house,” he replied. Indeed, Zamouri said that, come Friday, the Kabbalat Shabbat service would take place here.</p> \n<p>A placard at the school’s entrance celebrating Israel’s achievements is replete with logos of companies such as Waze and Mobileye, which have enjoyed successful corporate exits. There’s also a photograph of Israel’s late Nobel laureate for literature S.Y. Agnon and photos of made-in-U.S.A. Israeli warplanes.</p> \n<p>Lydia Mrejen, a 63-year-old teacher, comes over and immediately declares, “I am the only Mizrahi in Moises Ville” – referring to a Jew of Middle Eastern descent. Fortunately, the Mrejen family never experienced ethnic discrimination. “We were the only Sephardim, but we didn’t feel the difference.”</p> \n<p>Mrejen was born in Meknes, Morocco, where her father received agricultural training with a view to settling in Israel. But reports of wars with the Arabs deterred the family. Her father heard about the Jewish colony in Argentina, which sounded less dangerous, and gambled on the New World. However, he’d been trained to raise crops, whereas the business in Argentina was beef. His integration into the community was further hampered because he didn’t speak Yiddish.</p> \n<p>According to Mrehen, going to Argentina was a mistake: Making aliyah to Israel would have been the smarter move – at least there was no danger of going hungry there. She notes that when her father had to choose which of four synagogues to join, he opted for the one belonging to the Lithuanian (non-Hasidic) stream .</p> \n<p>Mayflower gauchos</p> \n<p>The notion of sending Russian Jews to establish settlements in distant Argentina may sound odd today, but at the end of the 19th century, some people thought it was a good idea, at least on paper. The Russian empire was rife with anti-Semitic laws and pogroms, while Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world, in terms of natural and financial resources, and having just completed the Conquest of the Desert campaign to displace the country’s indigenous peoples – an enterprise viewed in some quarters today as genocidal – it was receptive to European settlement in its vast expanses. On August 14, 1889, the cargo ship Wesser, sort of a gaucho version of the Mayflower, cast anchor in Buenos Aires, with 836 Jews aboard. According to one source, the authorities initially feared that an attempt was being made to smuggle in Jewish women to work in prostitution, a popular import at the time.</p> \n<p>Once on shore, the immigrants discovered that the local real estate magnate had reneged on the land-sale deal he’d promised, and that they were stuck in the big city. Eventually they purchased an alternative property, in Santa Fe province, from an attorney named Pedro Palacios, who regaled them with tales of land, houses, food and tools – but who also cheated them. In 1956, an elderly Felipe Shilman, one of the surviving immigrants who had sailed on the Wesser, told a newspaper that when the group finally arrived at the specified train station, nothing awaited them.</p> \n<p>“It was very bad, we had no houses. All the families lived together in a silo at the train station,” Shilman said. “Nearly 60 children died and were buried in empty boxes. Passengers on trains that went by threw pieces of biscuits to the hungry children.”</p> \n<p>Fortunately for the group, a few weeks later, Wilhelm Loewenthal, a prominent physician, happened to pass through the train station. Seeing children dressed in rags and speaking Yiddish, he went to the country’s minister of foreign affairs to complain. In the wake of his appeal, the magnate Palacios finally coughed up the promised housing, food and agricultural training. The children and adults from the 50 surviving families walked the few kilometers from the station to the site designated for Moises Ville, led by their leader, the charismatic Rabbi Aharon Halevi Goldman.</p> \n<p>The colony was established not long after Sukkot in October 1889. The townspeople insist that Goldman named the settlement Moises Ville because he saw a resemblance between the ordeals of the immigrants and those of Moses and the Israelites in the desert. More likely, it was an act of flattery aimed at the financier, Baron Hirsch, whose Hebrew name was Moshe (Moses). Although it took years for Moises Ville to blossom, it served as the baron’s inspiration for the establishment of additional settlements throughout the continent, to accommodate Jewish asylum seekers.</p> \n<p>Hirsch chose the Argentinian option because he didn’t believe in doing business with the decaying Ottoman Empire, after having been burned by it in a railway lines project. Mainly, though, this was also a competition between the rich. Baron Edmond James de Rothschild invested in the Palestine Jewish community. Baron Hirsch, who was also known as someone who gambled on horses, put his money on Argentina. Hirsch died six years after he started to invest in Moises Ville. It wasn’t long before demonstrations began against officials of the Jewish Colonization Association, whom Hirsch had sent to manage the colony. Besides being tough, the officials were French and secular, whereas the settlers were Russian and pious.</p> \n<p>“They do not have a Jewish heart that would feel for the trouble of their brethren,” one of the settlers wrote about the JCA officials in a series of letters of complaint that are today in the collection of the National Library in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>But time did its work. Even though settlers were robbed and murdered by gauchos – anarchistic cowboys whose roaming the government was trying to stop – all in all, the economic situation in Moises Ville stabilized. The locust infestation was solved by the cultivation of alfalfa, fodder that grew quickly anew after it was harvested.</p> \n<p>The second generation of colonists became involved in the cattle business and were known as “Jewish gauchos,” in the wake of a book of short stories titled “Jewish Gauchos of the Pampas,” by Alberto Gerchunoff, published in 1910. “This is a land where everyone works and where the Christian will not hate us, because there the sky is different,” the protagonist of one of the stories promised. In fact, Gerchunoff’s father, a rabbi, had been murdered in Moises Ville by a drunken gaucho. In another story, a daughter’s rabbi falls in love with a gaucho against her parents’ advice and runs off with him on the evening of the seder. The collection is considered a classic of Jewish Latin American literature.</p> \n<p>In 1919, in the wake of the massive immigration of World War I refugees, the events of the “tragic week” occurred – Latin America’s first pogrom. The perpetrators saw the cosmopolitan Jews, many of whom were indeed socialists, as “carriers of the communist virus,” and feared that they were about to establish a Soviet state in Argentina and Uruguay.</p> \n<p>The rise of the Nazis generated a significant additional wave of immigration from Germany, but as little land was available and the possibilities for higher education in Moises Ville were limited, the young people left for the big cities. Israel’s establishment and the opening of its gates to new immigrants came as a turning point. Some of the many Jews who left founded Kibbutz Miflasim, near the Gaza border, in 1949.</p> \n<p>Arik Sharon and Che Guevara</p> \n<p>Marta Singer, whom I found in a fitness class for seniors, took charge of my visit and became my official guide and interpreter, accompanied by her dog, Sweetie. “There are no more young people in any of the small cities,” Singer says, explaining the collapse of Moises Ville’s Jewish community. “There is no place here for lawyers, for example. And in any case, this is a hard time for Argentina. Today, after three months on the job, the governor of the Central Bank resigned again, because of the rise in inflation. Once the peso and the shekel were equal in value: 3 pesos and 3 shekels to the dollar. Look how the shekel has remained strong, but the peso is already 40 to the dollar.”</p> \n<p>Singer tells me by the by that a Moises Ville inhabitant, Luis Enrique Ulmansky, who was born in the nearby Jewish town of Las Palmeras, was kidnapped and murdered by the junta in 1977, suspected by the military regime of subversive activity. “They grabbed everyone who helped the poor – university students, people whose address they found somewhere,” she says.</p> \n<p>Ulmansky, a psychology student, was active in the National University of Rosario’s socialist cell, like many in Argentina, though this didn’t prevent him from working for a few months in the Jewish bank of Moises Ville, which is situated across from the museum. Although it has merged with a big bank, it still retains a Star of David on its fa&ccedil;ade.</p> \n<p>Ulmansky was 25 years old and recently married when, on January 20, 1977, when he and his wife, Gladys Beatriz Hiriburu, a medical student, were abducted from a bar in the city of Rosario along with five others. They were taken to a secret detention camp – one of 340 such facilities in the country– situated in the city’s police intelligence headquarters, and were tortured by the interrogators. One of them managed to slip out of a window and survive.</p> \n<p>At 2:30 A.M. on January 23, they were murdered and buried in an unmarked grave. Ulmansky’s body was identified, but the bodies of two of the group’s members disappeared without a trace. The press published the government’s cover story, in which it claimed that they were killed in a chase while transporting explosives.</p> \n<p>Of the 30,000 people who were abducted and murdered between 1974 and 1983, during Argentina’s “Dirty War,” between 1,500 and 3,000 were Jews, although Jews constituted only 1 percent of the country’s population at the time.</p> \n<p>“In the early 1970s, a group of Jewish students from several universities in Argentina organized with the aim of fulfilling a dream to live in a kibbutz through self-realization,” Daniel Kupervaser, a contemporary of Ulmansky, wrote to me. “About 35 haverim [comrades] arrived at Givat Oz in 1973 and 1974. Unfortunately, the dream was premature and was shattered. Many of the group remained in the country and succeeded privately. Luis was close to us in Argentina, but he was young, and didn’t join the group. Still, the Yom Kippur War brought him to Israel for a short time as a volunteer in our kibbutz. After that we lost touch, and then we heard about his bitter fate.”</p> \n<p>I can see that Marta Singer is saddened when I tell her that Israel sold Uzis and parkas to the soldiers of the military dictatorship even as the rest of the world imposed a boycott on Argentina. “How do you know that?” she asks, and I think that I haven’t made a 20-hour flight in order to grieve these nice people, so I change the subject.</p> \n<p>Moises Ville is currently a candidate for recognition by Unesco as a World Heritage Site. According to Singer, the title “is in the bag.” She relates that Alfredo Conti, a conservation architect from UNESCO, visited with her at the theater and in the synagogue, and exclaimed “Wow!” a few times. Museum director Elana Zamouri, who is more restrained, says, “There’s a chance of our making the list. We in the museum are working on documents and pictures. It will give the place momentum; we hope that it will bring tourists, and maybe generate work for the young. There’s no work, so they leave.”</p> \n<p>I asked to meet with one of the surviving Jewish gauchos and was taken to Arminio Seiferheld, who’s 73. He greeted us in a well-kept yard, an elegant bowtie around his neck. He was disappointed that I couldn’t conduct a conversation with him in Yiddish or German. An Argentine flag hangs in the entrance to his house, which is filled with objects relating to Israel, such as a poster depicting Mount Tabor. His parents fled from the Nazis after Kristallnacht, in 1938, and made for Argentina. Seiferheld grew up in a nearby Jewish settlement, a tiny one made up of Jews from Germany.</p> \n<p>He’s very proud of his past as a rancher. From behind the sofa he pulls out laminated posters with pictures of cows and huge bulls, which he categorizes according to their origin, speaking about them very lovingly. “I miss the horses,” he says. He shows us photographs of his father, Bernardo, “who was a gaucho and a cantor.” He and his wife have four children, all of them teachers. Two of them have already immigrated to Israel, and another daughter will soon follow.</p> \n<p>“I want to stay here, but my wife wants to leave for Israel,” he says, clearly torn. “Life here isn’t what it was, but it’s still calm here.” Seiferheld is active in the Moises Ville community and was mayor in the 1980s. He’s now studying the German-Jewish immigration to the small settlements in the district; so far he’s found 400 names of settlers. “Only five are still living here, or are still living,” he says.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The strategy of the right in contending with the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin can be summed up in the response of Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked to the excellent, pointed speech by MK Shelly Yacimovich (Zionist Union): “Yacimovich’s incitement against the right wing stirs up dispute and animosity, exploiting Rabin’s commemoration in the worst way.”</p> \n<p>Here you have it all: A straw man in the form of “you accuse the entire right wing” and the cynical accusation of incitement and exploiting the murder for political gains. A classic example of a scripted message.</p> \n<p>No one accuses the entire right wing of the murder. This claim by the right is a deception, moving from defense to offense on the road to rewriting history. It wasn’t the right that murdered Rabin, but the assassin came from its ranks, as did a religious edict sanctioning extrajudicial killing. The right wing was on the balcony listening to the cries in the street; it saw the empty coffin and the noose, and beheld it was good.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Let all Israelis honor Yitzhak Rabin | Opinion ■ Netanyahu’s current politics reopen 23-year-old wound of Rabin’s assassination | Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;The national inciter | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Twenty-three years have passed and nothing has changed. In 1995 Netanyahu cried out that “Rabin is the national inciter.” Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev explains that she “doesn’t think there was incitement from the right,” perhaps because incitement has become second nature to her, like breathing. She then goes on to label human rights group B’Tselem “Trojan horses.” Eskimos have fewer words for snow than the right has for treason.</p> \n<p>The national-religious Arutz Sheva (Channel 7), which wondered this week whether “Rabin was a traitor,” panicked when the IDF held an exhibition about the incitement that preceded the murder: “One cannot avoid the impression that the curators of this exhibition are trying to portray the right wing as a camp that led to serious incitement, supposedly, against Yitzhak Rabin, of blessed memory.”</p> \n<p>Supposedly. At least they left in the traditional “of blessed memory.” A person with a clean conscience does not whitewash the past. And Netanyahu’s conscience is as clean as Lady Macbeth’s, walking in her sleep and rubbing her hands: “Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.”</p> \n<p>The anger is not about the past, it’s about the present. One could argue that Netanyahu did not realize what demons he had released. He cannot be absolved now, after building the basis of his rule on these demons. From his perspective, Rabin’s murder was perfect in its timing and profitable. The methods that brought him to power then sustain him in power now.</p> \n<p>Particularly ridiculous are the warnings about blood that will yet be shed. Blood is being shed all the time, it’s only less conspicuous. Orna Peretz was attacked in Kiryat Shmona on the week in which she bored the prime minister, and he held his silence. Taayush activists were beaten by settlers and Knesset members on the right applauded. Right-wing activists throw bottles of urine on bereaved parents and an insulting tweet by Naftali Bennett relating to the incident is followed by claims that it was written by some “student.”</p> \n<p>This is what Rabin’s granddaughter tried to tell Netanyahu at the memorial ceremony for Rabin; so did his grandson Yonatan Ben-Artzi, MK Shelly Yacimovich and opposition chief MK Tzipi Livni. Netanyahu, as is his wont, preferred to put on a hurt face.</p> \n<p>What’s the point of being angry at Netanyahu when the “moderate majority” cooperates with the right wing’s strategy of marking enemies? This is the meaning of the cowardly decision to refrain from including Meretz peace activists at the ceremony, people who stood with Rabin, inviting instead those who stood on that balcony in Zion Square?</p> \n<p>This is a decision that blurs the fact that Rabin was not murdered in romantic squabble but for his signing of the Oslo Accords, and it absolves those who enabled such an act.</p> \n<p>It behooves the non-profit civil society organization Darkenu and Labor Party chairman Avi Gabbay to remember the words of journalist Arye Caspi, written two weeks before the assassination: “There were people among us who tried unsuccessfully to remain liberals while evading the leftist tag. They discovered, as did Jews when confronted with anti-Semitism, that you are not free to define yourself as you wish. Anti-Semites did not let even Jews who had erased their ties with Judaism forget where they had come from.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Until a few years ago, backpackers and low-budget tourists had few options for lodging in Jerusalem. Most of the city’s hotels were large and far from the city center, or they were expensive boutique hotels. Recently, though, an increasing number of hostels and three-star hotels have opened in Israel’s capital. The reason? The municipality has begun to encourage the renovation of abandoned buildings, the Tourism Ministry is offering a package of incentives, and entrepreneurs have at last noticed the growing need.</p> \n<p>“The agent who showed me the site told me that everyone who saw it was immediately turned off,” says the 27-year-old entrepreneur Adir Amsalem. He and his friend Michael Pearlstein recently established the Cinema Hostel in the building that once housed the Orion movie theater, which ceased operation a quarter of a century ago.</p> \n<p>“Everyone who visits the hostel and is interested in entrepreneurship dreams of this; when you manage a hostel it’s like you’re always on vacation,” Amsalem adds. The hostel, currently in a trial run, is due to open officially in December.</p> \n<p>The idea of converting historic buildings in Jerusalem into hotels is not new. A plan to that effect was drawn up in the 1990s, even before the Tourism Ministry came on board, by the architect Dan Picker and the architect and historian David Kroyanker. “Hotels that are located in buildings that possess architectural beauty and a historic past constitute a source of great interest for investors and hotel management companies. These hotels have distinctive marketing advantages and attract tourists,” the plan stated. “There are many buildings of architectural value in downtown Jerusalem that are located in central and expensive places and whose potential purpose and use far exceed their current usage.”</p> \n<p>The plan singled out seven potential sites for conversion into hotels. However, owing to the high cost of renovation, only two of the venues have been redeveloped: the historic Palace Hotel, which is now the luxurious Waldorf Astoria, and the 19th-century Templer movement school in the city’s German Colony, which has become the Orient Hotel.</p> \n<p>In 2016, the Tourism Ministry increased grants for low-cost hotels in areas of national priority to 33 percent of the construction costs (28 percent after execution and another 5 percent when the hotel shows incoming tourism). In 2015, the ministry paid out grants for 219 rooms, but two years later 1,028 rooms benefited from the program.</p> \n<p>A hotel campus</p> \n<p>The French corporation AccorHotels operates two hotels of the Ibis network in Jerusalem. The first, Ibis Jerusalem City Center, with 124 rooms, is located on a side street just off Jaffa Road, the city’s main thoroughfare. A number of historic buildings are adjacent to the hotel, which is compressed into a small lot of 700 square meters and blends seamlessly into the old urban fabric.</p> \n<p>According to the hotel’s designer, the architect Yaron Kuperstock, the work on the hotel went on for 20 years, on and off. “We had to prepare a specific CBA [City Building Plan, to enable construction] and later another one in order to raise it to eight stories instead of the original six,” he says. The tangled planning bureaucracy in Jerusalem results from the absence of an official master plan for the city. Two other historic buildings next to the hotel are also slated to become hotels, as part of the Isrotel chain. “We’ll have a hotel campus here,” Kuperstock says.</p> \n<p>The simple design of the hotel’s exterior is fashioned from two types of Jerusalem stone. A passage through the hotel, with glass doors and walls, enables access from one street to another. “Architecturally, the transition between the streets is very real, even if it’s not officially a public passage,” Kuperstock notes. The design of the hotel’s interior, also quite simple in character, is in line with the color palette of world Ibis. The colors are black, white and red, and the furniture recalls the lightness of Ikea. Public spaces offer comfortable corners for work or a cup of coffee. Most of the tourists who lodge in the hotel, notes the manager, Aharon Bernstein, come alone, not as part of groups. “They want to visit the center of the city, they are hardly in the hotel,” he says. “Even when we’re at full occupancy we don’t feel it.”</p> \n<p>Rife with history</p> \n<p>Not far from there, on the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall, another Ibis hotel, also designed by Kuperstock, is under construction. Slated to have 104 rooms, it is situated above a three-story corner building from the 1920s. The level of the stores – which have been vacated during the construction – remains unchanged. The ground floor also has an entrance to the hotel through a historic opening that leads to a small lobby. The next two floors have hotel rooms, and above them an orange-blue-green stripe marks the boundary of the historic structure. Above it, five new stories have been built, and a colorful recessed two-story cube on top contains a dining room, balcony and suites. The cube is covered with colored aluminum slats in shades that match the separation strip.</p> \n<p>The hotel is situated in a building rife with history. In his book “The Jerusalem Triangle” (Hebrew), Kroyanker notes, “This is the handsomest of the buildings along both sides of Ben Yehuda Street. It bears an eclectic-oriental/neo-Renaissance design, with stylized balconies and arched shop entrances supported by stone columns.” For years, until it closed in 1988, a legendary store that sold tobacco and foreign newspapers, run by Gavriel and Hilda Levinson, operated at the site, Koryanker adds. On the first floor was the Savoy Restaurant, which appears in a list of recommended leisure sites on a 1946 British tourist map.</p> \n<p>Selling an experience</p> \n<p>The Cinema Hostel is just a few minutes away from the new hotel. The entrance is consistent with the proportions of the original entrance to the movie theater. The bays that held posters advertising the films that were playing will soon hold practical information. The visitor encounters initial testimony about the history of the site in the lobby, where a massive steel beam, which supported the roof of the movie theater, looms next to a colorful sofa. Outside, a cube with the letter M recalls that this was once the site of a McDonald’s, the first in Jerusalem, which even offered cheeseburgers. Malkie Khutoretsky, the hotel’s smiling marketing director – a new immigrant from Australia – relates that tourists still look for the fast-food place or ask about movie times, because of the design of the facade.</p> \n<p>The building’s history is set forth on the Facebook page Al Hamakom [About the Place]. The movie theater was established in 1938, as a Jewish-Arab business of Daoud Dajani, the Dabah family and Ezra Mizrahi. The unusual fa&ccedil;ade of the Orion was designed by the architects Dan and Raphael Ben Dor, in the style of Radio City Music Hall in New York. The impressive glass exterior is still there. In 1943, the business partnership dissolved and the Mizrahi family became the sole owners. Later, in a pattern repeated across the country, the large 1,400-seat hall was split into small auditoriums and the theater lost its luster. In the late 1980s, during the “Shabbat wars,” the theater enjoyed something of a resurgence when it joined the wave of Saturday screenings under the guise of lectures for a members’ club.</p> \n<p>The hostel has 170 beds, in rooms of 5 to 12 beds each, though there are also private rooms. The average cost per night is 100 shekels (about $27) in the shared rooms and four times as much in the private rooms. The entrepreneurs are planning an expansion to 300 beds in the future. Because they made few significant changes to the volume of the building, other than to add windows, the licensing process went quickly, taking less than a year. The hotel seeks to attract a young crowd, but not only them. “We offer guests a minimal room and a common space packed with attractions. We’re selling an experience,” the hotel’s co-owner, Adir Amsalem, asserts.</p> \n<p>A rainbow of sofas beckon on the balcony above the entrance floor. Continuing inside, the central space contains a large number of places to sit and wide steps with colorful chairs, each one in a different style, and metal lamps hanging from the ceiling. There’s also another level for gaming and lounging, and above is a gallery in what was the movie theater’s projection room. Movies will be screened in the building’s reincarnation, too. Like many hostels in Israel and elsewhere, the public spaces will also be available to the general public, though the guests will get special rates.</p> \n<p>According to the hostel’s designer, the architect Liat Argaman, the inspiration for much of the furniture, such as chairs bearing photographs of Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe, was generated by a desire “to preserve the spirit of the period.” The plan is to install a few of the movie theater’s original seats in the lobby, she says, and to transform the large projection reel into a table. Pictures hanging on the walls evoke such films as “Back to the Future,” “Titanic” and “Trainspotting.”</p> \n<p>Private and shared rooms</p> \n<p>Not far from there, on the third floor of the British Mandate-period central post office, the Post Hostel has been operating since 2015. Renovation of the private rooms was recently completed: they are now compact galleries in which a couple with two children can lodge for $100 a night. The shared rooms contain eight to 12 beds each, separated by curtains and with storage space and a safe below the beds. Price per night: $25 to $30.</p> \n<p>The large, inviting communal space was designed by Michael Azulay. In its center is a semicircular sofa, set off with ropes, and surrounded by seating of different kinds. There’s also a performance stage, a bar adorned with illustrated ceramic tiles, a billiard table and a balcony. Drawings on the colored walls are resonant with history – from the carrier pigeon to email.</p> \n<p>According to the hostel’s manager, Alex Taliansky, they offer services over and above lodgings. “There are performances here twice a week,” he notes. “We offer beer and hummus workshops and also yoga classes. We have inexpensive, or free tours of the Old City, Mea She’arim [a Haredi neighborhood] and other places in the city.”</p> \n<p>Venice syndrome?</p> \n<p>The blossoming of medium-level hotels in Jerusalem is basically a positive development. It attracts non-affluent tourists, renews historic buildings and is a shot of adrenaline for the city center. But there are also negative implications. The head of the Lev Ha’ir municipal directorate, Ofir Lang, observes that the center of the city will not be a success without a proper combination of tourism, business and residences. “In the long run, we see ongoing harm to the residents because of the priority being given to hotel rooms,” he cautions. “We saw that when we fought to have the Experimental School remain at its site in the center of the city – they wanted to turn it into a hotel. If the city center becomes solely tourism-oriented, there will be no residents to safeguard it.”</p> \n<p>Lang is apprehensive that Jerusalem will become another Barcelona or Venice, where the historic center is devoid of inhabitants. “That could be a problem in a city like Jerusalem, which suffers from a sensitive security situation, because it’s the residents who are here in the difficult times,” he says. “They are the ones who safeguard the city’s security, keep the local business going and fight for what’s needed.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“Israel will be open to Jewish immigration and to the ingathering of the exiles.” This quote, from the Declaration of Independence, apparently isn’t relevant to the Jews of Ethiopia; since the 1980s their aliyah has been the subject of political-rabbinic horse trading.</p> \n<p>Last month’s cabinet resolution to bring 1,000 of the Ethiopian Jews still waiting in Addis Ababa and Gondar undermines a 2015 cabinet resolution calling for bringing to Israel all the remaining Ethiopian Jews — 8,000 people. Why has Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu neglected his promises and is bringing only 1,000? Why leave 7,000 behind? The new resolution shows demonstrates just how difficult it is for Israel to absorb black Jews.</p> \n<p>The Jews in Ethiopia have been waiting for many years. They are on Interior Ministry lists and their families live in Israel. But the latest resolution says only parents whose children are already in Israel can immigrate, and only with their single children. Parents who have been waiting to immigrate for years will have to leave behind their married children and grandchildren. Who will they choose? The children in Israel or those in Ethiopia?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion | Netanyahu has a promise to keep</p> \n<p>A tweet by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reading:&nbsp;&quot;I have decided to allow 1,000 Ethiopian Jews who already have family in Israel to immigrate.&quot; September 17, 2018.</p> \n<p>Why? “Because.” There’s no logic to it; that’s what was decided and that’s that. During other waves of aliyah from Ethiopia the situation was similar; the door was never truly open to us. We lost some 4,000 Jews in the camps in Sudan as a result of the long wait after the arduous journey from Ethiopia. On the synagogue wall in the community of those waiting in Addis Ababa is a curtain embroidered with the names of hundreds of Jews who died before reaching Israel. Some 3,000 died there waiting. They fill the Jewish cemeteries in Addis and Gondar.</p> \n<p>I have recently heard people who, out of ignorance or baseless hatred, claim to be “concerned for Israel.” In other words, black people are an existential danger to the state. Another claim by those opposed to aliyah from Ethiopia is “they aren’t Jews” — this too, of course, out of concern for the state. Others say, “This immigration will never end.” Has anyone ever said this about immigrants from France or the United States?</p> \n<p>Until 2013, only those who had Jewish maternal lineage were brought from Ethiopia. In the Jewish communities there were still thousands of people of Jewish descent only on the father’s side, who left their villages and returned to Judaism years ago, but Israel did not approve their immigration. In 2015 the government decided to redress this injustice and to bring those who remained. These people did not suddenly appear; some have been on waiting lists since 1999, and nearly all of their families already live in Israel.</p> \n<p>Those who really want to study the issue can board a plane and land in Ethiopia within four hours. In Gondar and Addis, they will meet amazing Jewish communities. Communities that sent Sintayehu Shaparou, to this year’s International Bible Quiz, where he won second place.</p> \n<p>Read the op-ed by Reuven Wabashat, the chief rabbi of Israel’s Ethiopian community, written in October 2017, after a visit. “All are waiting to make aliyah from Addis Ababa and Gondar, and they are members of communities where Jewish life is conducted properly, with synagogues, mikvehs, Shabbat and holiday observance, and classes in Judaism and Hebrew,” he wrote. “They left their villages many years ago (10 to 25 years). ... There is a need to expedite to the degree possible the aliyah of those waiting to immigrate in Gondar and Addis Ababa.”</p> \n<p>Rabbi Yosef Hadane, his predecessor in the post, called for them to be brought immediately. This was also demanded by dozens of kessim, Ethiopian Jewish spiritual leaders.</p> \n<p>Instead of implementing its resolution of three years ago, the cabinet is busy setting up committees, drafting legal discrimination documents, giving briefings to journalists and inciting against Ethiopian Jews in Israel and in Ethiopia. Instead of acting to eliminate discrimination, they give it bureaucratic approval, by restricting the pace of aliyah and adding more suffering to those families torn between Israel and Ethiopia.</p> \n<p>Kassahun Shiferaw is a social activist and a field coordinator for the Task Force for the Aliyah of Ethiopian Jewry.</p>",

Two: use the weight and strength of the opponent to your advantage rather than combating them directly.</p> \n<p>In a deft move, Putin closed a $5.4 billion arms deal with India, selling the Russian S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defense systems at the beginning of October.</p> \n<p>India, bordered by Pakistan's&nbsp;20 fighter squadrons, and China's&nbsp;1,700 fighter planes, must &quot;match the force level of our adversaries,&quot; the head of India's Air Force has declared.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With this huge deal, Russia has emerged as the winner with the &quot;largest contract&quot; in the history of India-Russia defense ties.</p> \n<p>It’s also the &quot;speediest&quot; arrangement to be signed between the two countries unencumbered by &quot;any protracted negotiations.&quot;</p> \n<p>It's news that Donald Trump would wish is fake. But it isn’t, and he knows it.</p> \n<p>Russia, now, commands a competitive edge over its arch weapons industry rivals - the United States and Israel - and is currently India’s biggest arms supplier.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Modi's Missile Dilemma: Why India Keeps Spiking, and Reviving, a Massive Israeli Arms Deal</p> \n<p>Russia managed to do this despite the U.S.' attempts to persuade other nations not to buy Russian weapons by threatening to invoke Section 231 of Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) of September 2017.</p> \n<p>CAATSA, a U.S. domestic law, empowers the American administration to impose sanctions on countries that engage in &quot;a significant transaction&quot; with Russia’s defense or intelligence sectors.</p> \n<p>Citing these sanctions, the United States had tried to dissuade India from buying the S-400 Triumf air missile system from Russia. Months before the deal, Tina Kaidanow, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs,&nbsp;said:&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We’ve discussed CAATSA with the government of India just as we have discussed it with a number of others who might be potentially contemplating purchase of large defence systems from the Russians. We want to work with all of our partners to help them identify and avoid engaging in any potentially sanctionable activity.&quot;</p> \n<p>Brushing aside the threat of sanctions, India has repeatedly made it clear to the U.S. that it would go ahead with the S-400 Triumf missile deal with Russia.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Pakistan and Israel: Separated at Birth?</p> \n<p>Several Indian delegations, led by the Foreign Secretary, made a case for waiving the sanctions, arguing that the CAATSA is an American domestic legislation with no bearing on India’s decision making. The delegations have also suggested that the CAATSA sanctions would create an unnecessary standoff between the U.S. and India, critical military allies in the Indo-Pacific.</p> \n<p>The U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have acknowledged this concern and strongly advocated the waiver of sanctions on India. But it came with a caveat - that the U.S. &quot;can’t guarantee a waiver will be used for future purchases.&quot;</p> \n<p>As the State Department clarified: &quot;There are no blanket waivers that will be issued for any one country, and any waiver that we might contemplate for significant transaction with Russia would be assessed on a case-by-case basis and would require, among other things, countries to significantly reduce their reliance on Russian arms.&quot;</p> \n<p>On October 5, 2018, India stood its ground and went ahead with the purchase of five S-400 missile systems from Russia. It’s a key defense decision that has been coyly underplayed - finding only a brief mention in the India-Russia joint statement, issued after their 19th annual summit between the two countries in New Delhi.</p> \n<p>India is not the only country to buy the S-400 surface-to-air missile weapons systems. In the recent past, other nations have ignored the threat of CAATSA sanctions, and engaged in &quot;significant&quot; transactions with Russia - China purchased Sukoi S35 fighter jets and S-400 surface-to-air weapons systems; soon after, Turkey followed suit and bought four S-400 systems from Russia at the cost of $2.5 billion.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump's Mayhem Allows Putin's Russia to Take Over the Middle East, One Country at a Time</p> \n<p>The United States, keen to throw its weight and show its strength, imposed sanctions on a Chinese entity - the Equipment Development Department or EDD - and its director, Li Shangfu, for purchasing Russian weapons systems.</p> \n<p>With this move, the U.S., very successfully, managed to &quot;outrage&quot; China. Reacting to Washington's move, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said:</p> \n<p>&quot;China is strongly outraged by this unreasonable action of the U.S. and lodged stern representations. What the U.S. has done gravely violated the basis norms governing the international relations and harmed the state-to-state and military-to-military relations between the two sides.&quot;</p> \n<p>But far from moving away from Russia, China has stepped up its military ties with Moscow.</p> \n<p>The U.S. displayed its strength by slapping sanctions on China; Russia used it to its advantage - in true judo style. The CAATSA, intended to wean countries off of Russian weapons, isn’t working. Putin’s deft moves render it a paper tiger.</p> \n<p>To counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, the U.S. needs India as much as India needs the U.S.</p> \n<p>In the 2+2 Ministerial dialogue between the U.S. and India, held in New Delhi in September 2018, &quot;defense cooperation&quot; has emerged as the most significant dimension of the strategic partnership and the &quot;key driver&quot; of the overall bilateral relationship between the two countries.</p> \n<p>As the State Department noted: &quot;The United States declared India a major defense partner in 2016, a status unique to India…We expect progress and further deepening the ties between our two militaries and creating a framework for greater information sharing and interoperability. We are also eager to expand defense trade.&quot;</p> \n<p>However, a few days after the Russia-India defense deal was signed, when asked if he would waive off the sanctions against India, a defensive Donald Trump grumbled: &quot;India’s going to find out, aren’t they?...Sooner than you think.&quot;</p> \n<p>Critics point out that it's a typical Trump strategy - create uncertainty to bully your allies and opponents, so that you can negotiate with them by putting pressure on them.</p> \n<p>In fact, over the past two years, Donald Trump’s unpredictability and the mercurial nature of the American administration have pushed India to assert its strategic autonomy. Trump and Bolton, with their bullying tactics, have thrust India closer to Russia. A brief look at the India-Russia Joint statement confirms this.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In that statement, India and Russia pushed for a &quot;multilateral world&quot; and noted that &quot;Military and military-technical cooperation between the two countries is an important pillar of their strategic partnership.&quot;</p> \n<p>They sought a &quot;full and effective implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA) on the Iranian nuclear program&quot; (in which the Trump White House has abrogated its participation), and reaffirmed &quot;equality, mutual respect and non-interference as universally acknowledged norms of international law.&quot;</p> \n<p>It’s a sharp pushback aimed at the U.S. administration, which is trying to influence India’s internal decision making by telling India not buy oil from Iran and weapons from Russia.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Why India Will Back Iran in a Nuclear Showdown With Trump and Netanyahu</p> \n<p>India and Russia have also reaffirmed the need to sign the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) treaty - one that the U.S. and Israel abstained from signing at the United Nations General Assembly - to &quot;avert a grave danger for international peace and security.&quot;</p> \n<p>Scholars and critics have applauded India’s decision to buy the S-400, lauding it for reiterating its &quot;strategic autonomy.&quot; But in the upcoming weeks, one crucial decision could turn the tables in the India-U.S. relationship. And, that decision needs to be taken by a man &quot;incapable of seeing past his own ego&quot; - Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>In trying to display America’s strength, will Trump impose CAATSA sanctions on India? If he does so, he may think that he can bully India into buying more American weapons and negotiate trade deals. But he would risk alienating an ally – and would push India closer to Russia.</p> \n<p>If Trump tries to show his strength, he will certainly lose to Putin’s diplomatic judo – and will in effect be constructing a winner's podium accompanied by a lucrative cash prize for a triumphant Russia.</p> \n<p>A fellow at the University of Oxford's Reuters Institute for the Study of&nbsp;Journalism and a graduate of the London School of Economics, Shrenik Rao is a digital entrepreneur and filmmaker.

Their policy is terrible. But they're good at sticking together and resisting,&quot; he declares, to the crowd's appreciative booing. &quot;That's all they can do.&quot;</p> \n<p>The word Jewish never appears in Trump's speech.

        "text":["<p>When Jews believed in multiple gods, there was no difficulty in explaining why bad things happen to good men. A vast array of spirits, demons, evil gods and things that go bump in the night could be blamed for their misfortune. But once God was elevated to supreme and then the only god, the problem became vexing: Was God unfair? With help from the Persians, Jews came up with an answer: Satan.</p> \n<p>First Temple Period (700-586 B.C.E.): Satan the lawyer</p> \n<p>In the early books of the Bible, which were written roughly in the First Temple period, there is no Prince of Darkness, just demons called se’irim. Some had names, such as Belial and Azazel, but none reigned supreme.</p> \n<p>We do find the word satan in these early biblical books, but they do not refer to a demon. Rather, &quot;satan&quot; is just a proper noun denoting an adversary in a martial or judicial setting. For example, a foreign king opposing the king of Israel was said to be a satan:</p> \n<p>&quot;And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite&quot; (1 Kings 11:14).</p> \n<p>Clearly, the Bible does not have the Prince of Darkness in mind here, but rather a man of flesh and bone.</p> \n<p>It is true that the Bible also refers to supernatural beings as being satans. For instance, in the story of Balaam in the Book of Numbers, God becomes angry and sends an &quot;angel of the Lord&quot; to stand &quot;in the way for an adversary against him [Balaam]&quot; (Numbers 22:22). In this case too, we are not talking about Satan with a capital S, rather just an unnamed messenger of God doing the Lord’s bidding, as an adversary.</p> \n<p>Early Second Temple Period (530-450 B.C.E.): Devil the Bob</p> \n<p>By the time the Book of Job was conceived, apparently in the early Second Temple period around 2,500 years ago, we can see a slight movement towards the development of Satan as an evil being. But he still isn't Satan with a capital S. The book itself is an essay on the problem of evil, probably written in response to the destruction of Judah and the Temple.</p> \n<p>Job, we are told, is “perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil,” yet he faces terrible calamities. Why?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Job’s troubles are attributed to the work of ha-satan, that is, &quot;the adversary,&quot; and not, as the English translations insist, Satan with capital S. The word satan in Job could not be a name: in the Hebrew original it is always preceded by &quot;ha,&quot; which is equivalent to the English word &quot;the&quot; (this would be equivalent to saying “the Bob”). Thus satan in Job is &quot;adversary,&quot; just as it was in the earlier books of the Bible.</p> \n<p>Yet the Book of Job does not refer to just any adversary but to &quot;the adversary.”</p> \n<p>&quot;Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the satan came also among them&quot; (Job 1:6).</p> \n<p>&quot;The adversary&quot; is a member of God’s heavenly council, who says he had just returned &quot;from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.&quot; God asks him what he thinks of Job, but being a kind of prosecutor, the satan says that Job is only being good because he is being rewarded for it. He convinces God to test Job's piety with a deluge of disasters.</p> \n<p>A similar image of ha-satan, the satan as heavenly prosecutor, can be found in the Book of Zechariah (3:1-10), which is also believed to date from the early Second Temple period. In it, where Joshua the high priest is put on trial and accused by &quot;the adversary.&quot; The Lord acting as judge rebukes him and sides with the &quot;Angel of the Lord&quot; who acts as the priest’s defense attorney.</p> \n<p>Late Second Temple Period (450 B.C.E.-70 C.E.): My name isn't Legion, it's Mastema</p> \n<p>The one and only time we find Satan used as a proper name in the Bible is in the Book of Chronicles. He appears in revisions of the books of Samuel and Kings, the Book of Chronicles, probably dating to the late 4th or early 3rd centuries B.C.E.</p> \n<p>When rewriting the story of King David calling a census in 2 Samuel 24:1, where it says &quot;“And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah,&quot; the Chronicler switches out the Lord for Satan:</p> \n<p>&quot;And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel&quot; (1 Chronicles 21:1).</p> \n<p>He is no longer ha-satan, the adversary, but Satan.</p> \n<p>This is roughly the point at which the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek, and the noun satan was translated into the Greek word di&aacute;bolos, which means “one who slanders, accuses.” The Greek word eventually made its way into English as &quot;devil&quot;.</p> \n<p>This is also roughly the same period that the Book of the Watchers and the Book of Enoch were written. While these books were not incorporated into the Hebrew Bible, they were popular at the time – over 2,000 years ago, and reflect the views of at least some Jews in the late Second Temple period, including those living in Qumran who painstakingly made many copies of these books.</p> \n<p>These deuterocanonical books contain a horde of evil demons and they have a leader, the chief evil spirit, but he is not called Satan. In the Book of the Watchers, he is called Mastema. That name is almost certainly etymologically related to the noun satan. </p> \n<p>But in the Book of Enoch, this figure is called Samyaza, which might mean &quot;(he) saw my name.&quot;</p> \n<p>In addition, Hebrew literature from this period also refers to demonic figures named Belial and Samael. All these names refer to the same basic idea, a chief demon, who opposes God and heads a group of fallen angels who spread evil throughout the world.</p> \n<p>Where did Jews of this period get the idea that there is a chief demon responsible for all that is evil?</p> \n<p>At one level, inventing a chief demon was a logical evolution of the conception of God that took shape in this period. If God is all-powerful and utterly good, how could bad things happen? He couldn’t be responsible, so some other being must be to blame, a kind of anti-God perhaps.</p> \n<p>But Jews apparently didn’t come up with this idea on their own. They seem to have picked it up from their Persian overloads, who ruled over the entire Middle East from 539 to 330 B.C.E. The Persian religion Zoroastrianism envisioned the universe as a battle ground between to opposing supreme gods Ahura Mazda, the &quot;wise lord,&quot; and Angra Mainyu, the destructive spirit.&quot;</p> \n<p>After the Temple (After 70 C.E.): Evil Superman</p> \n<p>In the year 70 C.E., Roman soldiers commanded by Vespasian destroyed Jerusalem and the Second Temple, to punish the Jews for (unsuccessfully) rebelling.</p> \n<p>The period after the destruction of the Temple&nbsp; was a critical one &nbsp;in the formation of both Christianity and rabbinic Judaism.</p> \n<p>The books of the Christian Bible abound with references to Satan, as he was imagined in Judaism in the late Second Temple period. For example the Gospel of Mark says of Jesus:</p> \n<p>&quot;And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him&quot; (1:13).</p> \n<p>Within Christianity, Satan evolved into the Antichrist, God’s antithesis, who is behind all that is evil. He is the master of Hell, as everyone knows from popular culture.</p> \n<p>Not so in rabbinic Judaism, at least not at first. Rabbinic literature of the Tannaic period (70-250 C.E.), namely the Mishnah and the Tosefta, hardly ever refers to Satan. It seems as if the rabbis rejected the full-blown image of the devil as he appears in the Book of the Watchers and the Book of Enoch, books they did not admit into the canon.</p> \n<p>But this retreat in the Evil One's status was temporary. Come the Amoraic period (250-450 C.E.) Satan reemerged in Jewish literature - the Talmud, and more prominently in the Midrashic literature, where he is blamed for pretty much every nastiness that took place in the Bible, from David sinning with the married Bathsheba to the Binding of Isaac (i.e., for sacrifice).</p> \n<p>In the Jewish literature of the rabbis, Satan is portrayed as a singular being who lures men into sin, and as prosecutor in the divine tribunal, trying to convince God to mete out harsh penalties. He is said to been a powerful angel, able to fly and assume the shape of men, women and animals.</p> \n<p>This devil was often called Ashmedai or Asmodeus, a name deriving from a Zoroastrian evil demon, or Samael, a demonic entity also mentioned in the gnostic literature found in Nag Hammadi (a collection of early Christian and gnostic texts discovered near the Egyptian town of the same name in 1945.) In the Talmud he is conflated with the Angel of Death and the Evil Inclination.</p> \n<p>Still, despite Satan appearing quite frequently in the Talmud and Midrashic literature, mainstream medieval rabbis did not dwell on him, or discuss methods of combating his malevolence. This would become the domain of Kabbalistic literature, especially the Zohar, written in 13th century Spain.</p> \n<p>The Zohar expands on the character of Satan, which it calls Samael. It provides him with a wife, the evil spirit Lilith, and a set of demons which do his bidding.</p> \n<p>Obviously, this worldview required different methods of fighting Satan, Lilith and their minions. This was achieved chiefly by reciting spells and sporting amulets.</p> \n<p>The view of Satan and his demons as actual beings was criticized by more rationalist streams of Judaism and most prominently by Maimonides, the sage who lived in the 12th century. Over time, as Judaism advanced to the modern period, this rationalist view prevailed and Satan and his minions were interpreted, at least in mainstream Judaism, in more metaphoric ways: they emblemize the evil inclinations which man carries within him, and cause him to stray from the path set for him by God.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A report compiled by the National Insurance Institute and submitted to the Knesset Labor, Welfare and Health Committee Monday showed that only people with the highest levels of disability benefit significantly from hiring a consulting company to help them with their claims.</p> \n<p>The committee met to discuss the consequences of the so-called Livnat Poran law, named after a well-known Israeli disability claims consultancy . The law, passed in July 2015, caps the fees that a disability lawyer or consulting firm can charge for representing an individual submitting a disability claim with the National Insurance Institute.</p> \n<p>The NII study found that the average claimant with a disability rating of 90% or above who used the services of a consulting firm received 200 to 250 shekels ($55 to $68) more a month than individuals who filed their own claims. For insureds with lower disability levels the differences were negligible, and sometimes individuals without representation received even more. These outside consultants notably charge substantial fees for their services.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Medical information leaked after hackers breach Israeli emergency responders' website</p> \n<p>A survey of the average disability allowance received by individuals using representation found that some 11,800 people received an average of 3,087 shekels a month. In contrast, around 83,000 people who had no representation received a monthly average of 3,066 shekels. The gaps, as noted were most pronounced among the highest disability rating category.</p> \n<p>Representatives of the consulting companies disputed the data, casting doubts on the methodology, which they said was problematic.</p> \n<p>MK Miki Rosental, who called for the meeting, said, “The statistics prove that representation by an agent — lawyers, Livnat Poran and the like — does not increase the payment.” He added that he recommends to the public not to use agents because they offer no added value. “All that the companies for suing for rights and agents of the like do is draw a fat check from the disability pay of individuals,” he said, “It is important to understand that it simply isn’t worth going to those representatives. It is worthwhile going alone to the National Insurance Institute, at least in the first stage. One can always try again later to go through an agent.”</p> \n<p>A National Insurance Institute representative commented in the meeting, “The gap in disability pay is less than half a percent for the ones with representation.” NII representatives stressed that there has been no decline in the number of disability claims or in the amount of disability benefits issued since the law came into force.</p> \n<p>It is noteworthy that NII representatives, who prepared the report, have a significant interest in getting rid of agents.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The opening scene of season two of “The Deuce,” one shot lasting nearly two minutes, was one of the most complicated challenges faced by Israeli-American cinematographer Yaron Orbach, who filmed the entire last season of the HBO flagship series – created by&nbsp;George Pelecanos and David Simon&nbsp;(who has to his credit the masterpiece “The Wire”) and&nbsp;starring Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Franco.</p> \n<p>This long shot, which centers on the character Candy, played by Gyllenhaal, actually consisted of a seamless combination of two cuts, reveals Orbach, and required the production crew to coordinate with perfection a large number of elements.</p> \n<p>For purposes of filming, the production received special permission from City Hall to take a section of northern Manhattan – Amsterdam Avenue between 168th and 174th Streets, to be precise – and to close it to traffic and pedestrians for several days every two weeks over a period of several months, transforming it each time into the New York of 1978.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“With 200 period cars and 250 extras, a lot of work on lighting and art – this means that each time we go into the neighborhood in a very intensive way,” says Orbach. “We have a department in the production with the sole function of coordinating between us and neighborhood residents.”</p> \n<p>For Orbach, a 43-year-old former Israeli who has been living in New York for the past 22 years, “The Deuce” is the high point to date of a career that has been on an upward trajectory for a number of years. Recent credits have included the second season of another hit series, “Orange is the New Black,” and two seasons of “The Path.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Orbach had to deal with another major challenge at the heart of the work on ”The Deuce”: since this series is about the rise of the porn industry in New York in the 1970s, and since its main female protagonist is a veteran streetwalker (Gyllenhaal) who decides to become a part of the rising and flourishing film industry – “The Deuce” abounds with sex scenes.</p> \n<p>This was a two-fold challenge. Not only was it necessary to root out any sexy atmosphere from these scenes and to emphasize the exploitation, in the age of MeToo they also needed to be especially cautious in dealing with this issue.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This caution became even greater when, this past January, a number of women accused the male star of the series, James Franco, of sexual misconduct.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Unlike films and series that simply got rid of actors who had been accused of sexual assault and harassment (recent examples include Kevin Spacey, whose scenes in the 2017 film “All the Money in the World” were reshot with another actor, and Jeffrey Tambor, who was dropped from the cast of the show “Transparent”), at HBO they decided to adopt a policy of “business as usual” and let Franco continue to star in the second season of “The Deuce.”</p> \n<p>Franco denied the accusations against him, and in the wake of an internal investigation, Simon and HBO stood by him, made it clear that his conduct on the set had been completely professional during the first season, and announced that he would also star in season two.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Gyllenhaal, who is also one of the producers of the series, told an interviewer recently that she and her colleagues had taken seriously the accusations, which involved Franco’s work on other productions and in his personal life, and as a result, examined his work in the first season of “The Deuce.”</p> \n<p>“We spoke to every woman on the crew and in the cast,” she told the satellite radio show “Sway in the Morning,” “to find out if they felt respected and what their experience of working with James was and everyone said that they had been totally respected by him.”</p> \n<p>The decision to retain Franco in his role in the series – one of whose regular themes is sexual exploitation of, and violence against, women – may seem questionable and disturbing when one views the show.</p> \n<p>However, Orbach says that the dark shadow of those accusations hovered over the set and led the production to deal with the issue with the utmost caution. “We are in a very fraught period,” he observes, “and the whole time we thought about whether we were dealing with the sex scenes in the best way possible. Above all, we took care to maintain a calm atmosphere with a lot of respect for the actors, who are often required to be in very uncomfortable situations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“We hired someone who was given the title of ‘intimacy coordinator,’ and her job was to liaise between the actors and the production and ensure that all the actors felt comfortable with what they were doing. She was there to check whether in the sex and nude scenes, the actors needed another layer of clothing, for example, or if they needed some kind of protection, and she would tell us what worked well for them and what didn’t.</p> \n<p>What do you mean by “protection?”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“In filming a sex scene, there is often use of a protective layer. That is, we put something on the pelvic area on an actor who is in a sexual position in order to create a separation between his sex organ and hers.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Obviously, the protective layer is supposed to be invisible on screen. Additionally, says Orbach, in filming “The Deuce,” they often used penile prostheses for the frequent scenes of oral or masturbatory sex. “In those cases, it was the prostheses that got pulled out of the pants – they look very believable.”</p> \n<p>How common is the use of an intimacy coordinator on movie and TV sets in the&nbsp; United States? Is this a new function?</p> \n<p>“As far as I know, this is the first time there has been such a position in the production of a television series. Nina [Kostroff Noble], one of the producers, had the idea and since it worked so well for us and made the actors feel that someone had their back, it is now becoming standard for other series as well.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“I as a cinematographer,” continues Orbach, “had to be very sensitive about this issue and remember that even if the setting of the series is the porn industry and I have to serve the story, I have to remember that at the end of the day of filming people have to leave the set and go home without feeling humiliated. So we would make sure to talk before shooting, in order to explain where exactly we would be placing the camera, how the lighting would be and what exactly would be done. This isn’t easy, but as someone who stands behind a camera, relatively protected, I have to have a lot of respect for those who are in front of it.”</p> \n<p>There are harsh, violent sex scenes in the series. Were there actors who had a hard time coping with this?</p> \n<p>“There were cases in which it was a bit unpleasant. You have to remember that they signed on to working in the series – it’s not that they didn’t know where they were going to be, but still, every so often it happened that someone felt uncomfortable, that it was too much for them, and they would ask if it was possible to moderate it a bit, to make it less extreme.”</p> \n<p>Inspired by Attenborough</p> \n<p>Yaron Orbach was born in 1975 in Ramat Hasharon to a father who managed a publishing house in the United Kingdom, and a mother who worked as a secretary. When Yaron was 3, the family moved to England for his father’s work.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Because of the weather, I watched a lot of television,” he recalls. “I especially loved David Attenborough’s nature programs about animals in Africa. I dreamed of filming such things myself.”</p> \n<p>Even after the family returned to Israel, his father continued traveling to Britain, and always returned with video copies of acclaimed films. Thanks to that, says Orbach, by the age of 10 or 11, he had already been exposed to masterpieces by such directors as Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa.</p> \n<p>He studied film at Alon High School of Arts and Sciences, in Ramat Hasharon, and already then began to focus on photography. “I wasn’t attracted to writing,” he says. “There was something quiet about being behind the scenes, as a cameraman, which I have always loved. I was drawn to telling the story through the the camera’s movement and the lighting. I like to think about where where it’s best to place the camera – angles, height, on my shoulder or static – and to tell a story as I move it.”</p> \n<p>In high school, he says, he also became aware of one of the aspects of filmmaking that he loves most, “the cooperative teamwork, which to this day is one of the things that I find most satisfying in my work, beyond the professional and the visual aspects. This circus that’s created on the set, with so many people from so many different backgrounds working together, under quite pressured circumstances. We share a challenge, and we achieve results together.”</p> \n<p>In 1997, Orbach moved to New York, where he began studying at the School of Visual Arts. For four years he shared “a small and dirty apartment” with another Israeli who was studying there, illustrator Tomer Hanuka. After completing his studies, he had several difficult years ahead of him, he says.</p> \n<p>With no connections in the American film industry, and with no experience – he was not exactly snapped up for work. He recalls how he sometimes took non-paying filming gigs just to get a free lunch on the set. “I was like a fakir, like a starving artist, but I was young and I enjoyed it a little. I could live for days on end on canned goods, living off odd jobs and working almost for free just to accumulate experience.”</p> \n<p>Orbach talked an NYU film student into letting him shoot his final project and was totally surprised when in 2004 that film won the prize for the best short at the Tribeca F Film estival.</p> \n<p>From there he began his very slow climb up the ladder, photographing a number of other film-student projects, and then working on films with increasingly higher budgets – features made, first for $100,000, and then $200,000, and a million and $3 million – and upward. In 2006 he received the American entertainment industry’s seal of approval when he found an agent to represent him. “She could put me in front of projects I couldn’t get to on my own,” he explains. “Without an agent it’s almost impossible to get big projects.”</p> \n<p>He was excited to film John Carpenter’s “The Ward” (2010), had the privilege of working with Peter Bogdanovich (“She’s Funny that Way,” from 2014), and enjoyed working with John Carney (“Begin Again,” 2013). Between one American film and the next, he also managed to work on two Israeli documentaries shot abroad – Nati Baratz’s “Unmistaken Child,” which he filmed mostly in Nepal, and Nitzan Giladi’s “In Satmar Custody,” which was filmed in New York State. Three years ago he filmed “Sing Street,” which Carney also directed and was a nominee for the Golden Globe for the best comedy or musical movie.</p> \n<p>In recent years, though, Orbach has been working mainly on television shows. His breakthrough into the field came four years ago, when he was asked to shoot the second season of “Orange is the New Black.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“At that time I happened to be on a visit to Israel,” he recalls. “They interviewed me on Skype, and it was even before the [first season of the] series had been released, and no one knew just what a success it would be. The director warned me that it wasn’t going to be very challenging and he was right, because everything takes place within a prison: beige walls, with women wearing orange suits and fluorescent lights on the ceiling. There isn’t&nbsp; much you can do with all that. However, it was fun with the actors and it was a great first step in the television world.”</p> \n<p>Since then he has filed two seasons of “The Path,” the racially charged 2018 mini-series “Seven Seconds” for Netflix (by Veena Sud, who created the U.S. remake of “The Killing), and he is currently filming a new series for Amazon, “Modern Love,” which is based on the weekly New York Times column of the same name.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In recent years Orbach says he has preferred to work in television, because it lets him spend more time with his family.“I have two small children now and many movies aren’t filmed in the city. So, mainly I film [TV] series that don’t require me to leave the city for several months.”</p> \n<p>Television series today are also made with big budgets, so what in fact is the difference between working on a series and working on a movie?</p> \n<p>“It’s still very different from working on a film. A series is a number of episodes and therefore it involves complex logistics – it’s a large operation with many parts.</p> \n<p>There can be different directors for each episode, and even if you are filming something specific on a given day at the same time you are already busy planning what you are going to do the following week. The pace is entirely different from that of a film. For a movie, there is usually a lot more time to prepare – for five or six weeks before filming begins, for example, you make the rounds to see the various locations. In&nbsp; in television, you often do this via photos. There is no time to go out to the field.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The World Zionist Organization’s Settlement Division has provided dozens of loans over the past two decades to fund the establishment of unauthorized Jewish outposts and farms across the West Bank, an investigation by Haaretz has revealed. Documents obtained by Haaretz show a pattern in which settlers have established farms and unauthorized outposts over the past 20 years with loans from the Settlement Division — financed entirely through taxpayers' money and frequently secured by liens on agricultural equipment or livestock. The World Zionist Organization refused to respond for this article.</p> \n<p>By cross-referencing maps at the offices of the Israeli Civil Administration for the West Bank with the names of individuals who have obtained mortgages, along with their places of residence and the year in which the loan was granted, it becomes apparent that the division repeatedly gave loans to people who were establishing unauthorized outpost, and did so during the period when the outposts were being set up. In most cases, the collateral for the loans were assets associated with the land on which the outposts were built, such as a flock of sheep, a chicken coop or agricultural equipment.</p> \n<p>The Haaretz investigation was based on dozens of documents relating to mortgages pertaining to 26 outposts across the West Bank. These included large outposts such as Amona, which has since been evacuated. Mortgage financing was also provided for illegal structures in authorized settlements such as Yitzhar; and for the Havat Har Sinai, Einot Kedem and Shkedim farms.</p> \n<p>The first of the loans that Haaretz identified were provided in the mid-1990s. The most prominent of them was to Avri Ran, a well-known right-wing activist who established a string of outposts at Gva'ot Olam on the hills adjacent to Itamar. In the first of the loan agreements with him, he provided a chicken coop as collateral. He also mortgaged what was described as Havat Itamar, the Itamar farm, for a loan from Bank Leumi in the mid-1990s.</p> \n<p>There is a chicken coop and an agricultural plot at Gva'ot Olam, but the sites were never authorized for settlement. According to maps at the Civil Administration, at last 12 demolition orders have been issued against Gva'ot Olam. Some of the land on which these outposts were built is state land and some of it appears on the maps as not owned by the state.</p> \n<p>The granting of the loans continued beyond the 1990s to the present decade. In 2014, for example, the World Zionist Organization Settlement Division granted a loan to the Yitzhar settlement to establish a flour mill. According to aerial photos, the location in Yitzhar where the mill is located is subject to three demolition orders.</p> \n<p>An anomaly</p> \n<p>The Settlement Division is an anomaly. It is not under the government's direct authority. From an organizational standpoint, it is an arm of the World Zionist Organization, but all of its funding comes from the Israeli taxpayer. Officially, its role is to establish rural communities in Israel. It operates in the Galilee, the Negev and in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>In 2015, its operations were suspended after Deputy Attorney General Dina Zilber issued a legal opinion in which she stated that the division had been acting as a policy-setting entity and not only as an outside agency that carried out government policy.</p> \n<p>“This situation has created a significant flaw in government's capabilities to govern in that it has hampered the effectiveness of the government to set its own policies in settling the land,” Zilber wrote. A year later the state signed an agreement with the division that was to have provided the necessary oversight. The division then resumed its operations.</p> \n<p>Over the past 20 years, the division has provided dozens of loans to individuals who have established unauthorized outposts, according to documents obtained by Haaretz. At the Havat Shkedim outpost, the Settlement Division took 130 sheep as collateral for a loan. Dalia Har Sinai, a resident of Havat Har Sinai, received a loan from the division secured by a flour mill, a freezer, a packaging machine, a compressor and a piece of agricultural equipment. A portion of Havat Har Sinai, where the Civil Administration has issued three demolition orders, is on state-owned land and some is not. In the late 1990s, the Settlement Division granted the founder of the unauthorized outpost of Havat Talia a loan secured by sheep and lambs, a generator, a sunshade and a fence.</p> \n<p>The founders of the unauthorized outpost of Havat Skali received a loan in 2001 secured by a livestock pen and 100 head of sheep. Havat Mor, which was also set up without government authorization, received loans in 1999 and 2002. The founder of the Givat Hatayas outpost at Itamar, Yedidya Meshulami, who operates a landing strip there, received a loan in the early part of the last decade, despite the fact that Givat Hatayas was established without official permission.</p> \n<p>In 2003, a resident of Amona received a loan secured by a home mortgage, but the land on which the home was built was never owned by the loan recipient and the loan was given in violation of the law.</p> \n<p>Dror Etkes of the left-wing group Kerem Navot, which fights the dispossession of Palestinians of their West Bank land, said the Settlement Division’s methods have provided a means of providing large-scale financing for illegal outposts. “It’s been obvious for years that the division has adopted unlawful patterns of operation after assuming the role of contractor carrying out the dirty work that state authorities have tried to distance themselves from having direct responsibility for. The documents show systematic and continuous unlawful conduct intended to support the most extremist and violent elements among the settlers, people who are responsible for the expulsion and expropriation of Palestinian communities from wide areas of the West Bank.”</p> \n<p>The documents show that some illegal outposts received loans from private banks. In some cases, equipment or vehicles were provided as collateral, while for others flocks, a generator, a shed or a fence were the security interest for the loan. In some cases, the land itself was mortgaged, such as at Mitzpeh Kramim, even though the recipients of the loan had no legal ownership over the land they were mortgaging.</p> \n<p>As a rule, banks do not provide mortgage financing to establish unauthorized outposts, which are considered illegal under Israeli law, but the founders of outposts have sometimes obtained bank loans. In at least one instance, a bank loan was provided after the World Zionist Organization Settlement Division provided the bank with documents stating that land belonged to individuals seeking the mortgage, even though that was not the case.</p> \n<p>Sources at two different banks told Haaretz that their banks would receive a request for a loan and then approach the Settlement Division for approval. The division would confirm that the applicants were owners of the land or were legally working it. The loan was then approved by the bank. “The bank’s attitude to the division was as if it were the Israel Land Authority for the territories,” said one source.</p> \n<p>The Israel Land Authority does not operate in the territories, but the Settlement Division is not its proxy there. Determining who owns the West Bank land requires consulting the land registry maintained by the Civil Administration — which is generally classified. The Settlement Division does not have such a registry and is not an official government entity.</p> \n<p>This isn’t the first time Haaretz has revealed that the Settlement Division has funneled public funds to establish unauthorized outposts in the territories. Last month it was reported that the division purportedly transferred ownership to settlers at Mitzpeh Kramim even though the state had found that the land was privately owned Palestinian and had been mistakenly allocated to the division.</p> \n<p>Last year it was reported that the division had taken control of 50 dunams of private Palestinian land and given it the outpost of Ma'aleh Rehavam, purportedly for tree planting, although the division had no rights to the land. In 2017 there were other instances in which the division handed out land to settlers — at Ofra, Amona and Beit Horon, among other locations — without having legal rights to it itself.</p>",

Saudi Explanation for Khashoggi's Murder Puts Trump to the Test</p> \n<p>The shocking brutality of Jamal Khashoggi’s abduction and murder by Saudi security forces cannot be papered over, no matter how implausibly it is dressed up as an interrogation gone wrong or the work of rogue actors.</p> \n<p>But its implications go deeper than the tragedy visited upon Khashoggi’s family and fiancee. It raises fundamental questions for the United States and Israel about their whole strategic concept in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>On the one hand, cynics could argue that the brazenness of Khashoggi’s murder differed only in degree, than kind, from the longstanding behavior of Arab autocrats, including those allied with the United States.</p> \n<p>There are no boy scouts in the Middle East, and the U.S.-Saudi alliance has persisted through decades of repressive Saudi policies against their own people.</p> \n<p>American interests could still be served by some of the economic and social reforms that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) has championed, and by the advancement of the joint strategic goals of checking Iranian aggression in the region. Those considerations cannot be so easily dismissed.</p> \n<p>But the Khashoggi murder, beyond obliterating red lines of immorality, also points to the fundamental unreliability of Saudi Arabia under MBS as a strategic partner. What happened in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul echoes words once used to describe Napoleon’s elimination of an opponent: &quot;It’s worse than a crime. It’s a mistake.&quot; One might add, a strategic mistake.</p> \n<p>Already, MBS had proven himself to be a reckless and impulsive actor in conducting Saudi foreign policy. His legitimate campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthi in Yemen has been prosecuted with total disregard for the vast suffering of civilians it has caused. His forced resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri blew up in his face.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Who’s got the guts to call for a boycott against Saudi Arabia?</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia's all-out blockade of Qatar has distracted the Gulf states from their common goal of containing Iran and produced minimal results. And MBS’s severing of relations with Canada over a tweet criticizing Saudi detentions of human rights activists was an absurd overreaction.</p> \n<p>But now, clearly at MBS’s direction, a terrible murder was committed, essentially out in the open. And the Saudis lied about it to President Trump for days. They are still lying.</p> \n<p>Trump himself may care little, motivated by his own amorality or the over-hyped job-creating impact of Saudi weapons orders.</p> \n<p>But MBS did not take into account that in ordering the Khashoggi hit, he crossed all lines of acceptability to the American public and the bipartisan membership of Congress. Indeed, the harshest criticisms and calls for consequences have come from Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio.</p> \n<p>Again, one can be cynical about this. Saudi repression is not new, and perhaps the American political system could accommodate it if it stayed below a certain level of visibility. The outcry was not nearly as loud as perhaps it should have been over the imprisonment of Saudi women’s rights activists, which took place at the same time that women were finally given the right to drive cars.</p> \n<p>But MBS miscalculated badly by not understanding that the kidnapping and dismembering of a U.S. resident journalist, whose only crime was expressing his views, simply was more than Americans could tolerate. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>One cannot flaunt that kind of brutality and expect business as usual with the United States. Trump himself may not care, as his courtship of Vladimir Putin, who also murders journalists, suggests. But the American people have their limits, and may indeed hold friendly governments to a higher standard.&nbsp;They expect that allies, at least, not implicate the United States in brazen crimes.</p> \n<p>The reasons for that are debatable. The grisly details of the killing are part of it. But Khashoggi’s murder also touches on broader international trends of illiberalism and a crackdown on truth-seeking journalists. The context was not simply MBS silencing a Saudi critic.</p> \n<p>That MBS did not understand that reality or could not assess it, that he thought he could get away with it and had no adviser willing or able to check his impulses, raises significant questions about his judgment and reliability, not to speak of the definitive answers it provides about his morality.</p> \n<p>For Israel, this sordid episode raises the prospects that the anchor of the new Middle East realities it has sought to promote - an Israeli-Sunni Arab coalition, under a U.S. umbrella, to check Iran and Sunni jihadists - cannot be counted upon.</p> \n<p>And Israel must be careful how it plays its hand. There will, without question, be a U.S. response to Khashoggi’s murder, even if it is resisted by the Trump administration. It will not lead to a total dismantlement of the U.S.-Saudi alliance, but Congressional and public revulsion will have its price.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The price could include significant restrictions on arms sales that had been contemplated. It is already leading key U.S. investors to distance themselves from the major development projects MBS has promoted. At a minimum, there will be no replay of the warm, PR-friendly visit by MBS to multiple U.S. cities last March, no more lionizing of him in the American press as a reformer who will reshape the Middle East.</p> \n<p>Israel, which has a clear interest in keeping Saudi Arabia in the fold of U.S. allies to maximize the strategic alignment on Iran, will need to avoid becoming MBS’s lobbyist in Washington. Israel’s coordination with its partners in the region is still necessary and desirable. Simple realpolitik requires it. But there is a new risk of reputational damage from a close association with Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It won’t be easy for Israel to navigate these waters, as the Washington foreign policy establishment has quickly splintered into anti-Iran and anti-Saudi camps. The idea that the United States should equally oppose Iranian and Saudi brutality toward their peoples, and not let MBS’s crimes lead to a lessening of pressure on Iran over its malign regional activities, is in danger of being lost.</p> \n<p>For Israelis, that may be the biggest blow in the fallout of Khashoggi’s murder. MBS, in his obsession with silencing his critics, has actually undermined the attempt to build an international consensus to pressure Iran.</p> \n<p>The damage is broad. Trump may be an outlier. But what Member of Congress, what European leader, would be willing to sit with MBS for a consultation on Iran now?</p> \n<p>That is the greatest evidence of MBS’s strategic blindness, and the damage will likely persist as long as he rules the kingdom.</p> \n<p>Daniel B.

        "text":["<p>The U.S. president is suddenly revealing that the sawed off limbs of Jamal Khashoggi have landed in the corridors of the White House and on Capitol Hill, and threaten to stain the shiny carpets leading from the Oval Office to the Saudi Royal Palace.</p> \n<p>Given the horrific details about the method of the murder which continue to emerge from Turkey, Trump can't suffice with a few tweets. He swiftly dispatched his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Riyadh and Ankara not only to gather some intelligence, but mainly to defuse the bomb that may blow up in the president’s face.</p> \n<p>The extraordinary interview that his confidant, Senator Lindsey Graham, gave to Fox news, shows the pressure on the president as well as the entire Republican Party with next month's midterm election approaching.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Why the Khashoggi murder is a disaster for Israel | Opinion ■ Explained:&nbsp;Will the Khashoggi 'murder' bring down Saudi’s Crown Prince?</p> \n<p>Graham didn’t just let off steam, vowing he wouldn’t visit Saudi Arabia until the issue was resolved and accusing the top echelons of the Saudi regime of involvement in the murder. He also named Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the guy “pulling the strings” and called bin Salman a schizophrenic who “must go.”</p> \n<p>In pointing a finger at bin Salman, Graham is apparently expressing the spirit of senior Republicans and, at the same time, smashing the theory that “rogue elements” were behind the murder — a theory senior White House and Saudi officials tried to advance in recent days in order to distance suspicions from bin Salman.</p> \n<p>Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein touched a raw nerve and particular concern of Trump’s when she made clear she wouldn’t support any weapons sales to the Saudis or back the Saudi war in Yemen. This is exactly the abscess that may burst if the $110 billion deal signed by bin Salman goes down the tubes. But it’s not only the future of this huge deal that worries Trump.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia is a crucial ally for the sanctions Trump is planning to impose on Iran next month. The kingdom is supposed to fill the gap that will be created in the oil market when and if Iran is barred from marketing its produce, and to ease a rise in oil prices that have spiked over the past three weeks. If the Saudis decide to wield the oil weapon to prevent a continued investigation or punishment of top Saudi leaders, the American and world economy may pay a steep economic price.</p> \n<p>Nobody is counting on Saudi Arabia’s pledge to “seriously” investigate the murder. Its cooperation with Turkish authorities have met with serious difficulties. According to reports from Turkey, which apparently still has a lot of information it hasn’t yet released, the Saudi consul in Istanbul, Mohammed al-Otaibi, was present during the murder which occurred immediately after Khashoggi entered the consulate building. The hacking up of his body was carried out by Saudi intelligence's head of forensic evidence, pathologist Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy, who also ordered that poison be pumped into Khashoggi to silence his screams. Even the Saudi intelligence chief Khalid bin Ali bin Abdullah al Humaidan, who bin Salman appointed personally a year ago, bears direct responsibility and the crown prince cannot claim he was not aware of the plot to murder the journalist.</p> \n<p>“If the intention was just to interrogate Khashoggi, why was the pathologist sent to Istanbul and why did they need a saw? The intention was to kill him,” an exiled Saudi analyst said in an interview with Al Jazeera.</p> \n<p>The Saudi and American goal was to create a narrative that could persuade world opinion that Khashoggi’s murder was a rogue initiative, to find scapegoats to punish and thus resolve the issue. But the chances of this plan succeeding are swiftly dissipating since no one knows what information is in the hands of the Turkish government, which is playing the role of observer for now. Ankara won't let the affair die, leaking new information daily. But it has refrained from cutting off relations with the Saudis or expelling the Turkish ambassador (the consul has already left the country) or breaking into the consulate building. For now Turkey prefers to let Washington handle the crisis and set the rules for how to respond to the Saudis.</p> \n<p>Erdogan feels this policy could help him reap economic benefits from the Saudis and Gulf states as &quot;compensation&quot; for his calm behavior, in particular, from some of bin Salman’s grandiose projects. Furthermore, from Erdogan’s standpoint, it would be better for Trump himself to arrive at the conclusion, under pressure from the House of Representatives, that bin Salman is not Washington's dream partner, and that Turkey — despite the tensions between Ankara and Washington — is a preferable ally.</p> \n<p>The Saudi leadership may have to make some tough decisions about bin Salman’s future. The crown prince, who has won unprecedented popularity in the West and praise for his “liberal” ideas, has caused some reverberating failures that have raised questions about the kingdom’s ability to play a leadership role in handling Middle East crises. He initiated the failed war in Yemen which has stirred an international outcry. His attempt to alter Lebanese politics by firing Prime Minister Saad Hariri failed dismally. Syria has completely slipped out of Saudi hands and Saudi Arabia has disappeared from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Attempts to curb Iran haven’t gotten off the ground, and the Khashoggi affair has endangered the participation of international donors in future economic projects he has initiated.</p> \n<p>Despite this, it is difficult to expect that King Salman will initiate a shake&shy;&shy;&shy;–up and deny his son his title as crown prince and heir apparent. The possibility of any regime change is remote given the king's desire to preserve the family’s status and stability of the regime as well as the understanding that the United States and Trump won’t abandon the kingdom. The royal family is convinced, and justifiably, that Saudi Arabia’s huge investments around the world and especially in the United States should protect it from having to face any sanctions or boycotts. Furthermore, Saudi archives are also full of information about shady deals it has conducted with the United States, information that could leak if Trump deviates from the rules that have thus far governed bilateral relations. The Saudis therefore expect Washington to hold an honorable burial for Khashoggi’s remains, and discuss the terms of any compensation at a later time.</p>",

It’s inconceivable that after the state worked to bring them here, it would alienate them. To prevent discrimination against members of the community we founded the anti-discrimination unit in the Justice Ministry, which is working to assure equal rights for community members.

In any case, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon has had enough with the foot-dragging; on Monday he sent a letter to Cabinet Secretary Tzachi Braverman demanding that the cabinet meet immediately to approve exports and advance legislation to that end.</p> \n<p>“For more than six months, the Public Security Ministry has been preventing the plan from being put on the cabinet’s agenda, thereby harming Israel’s economy, farmers and local industry,” Kahlon wrote. “During these months a number of countries around the world, including Australia and Canada, began to export medical cannabis.”</p> \n<p>When the cabinet last discussed the issue in April, legalization of medical-marijuana exports had the backing of the finance, health and agriculture ministries, as well as the Prime Minister’s Office. Even officials in Erdan’s Public Security Ministry supported the measure after Kahlon agreed to increase the police budget to ensure enforcement of cannabis laws.</p> \n<p>The Public Security Ministry demanded that the number of authorized exporters be limited, but the Justice Ministry opposed that. Treasury officials have tried to meet with Erdan to hear his objections, but he has declined.</p> \n<p>Since then, Kahlon said in his letter, the Public Security Ministry has even added new conditions, including legislation that would give the police more enforcement authority over marijuana growers.</p> \n<p>“The [ministry’s] demands would increase uncertainty in the market, in particular with growers,” Kahlon said. “I fear that we are being made to stop the [legislative] process for as long as possible …. It’s impossible to hold the economy, farmers and entrepreneurs hostage.”</p> \n<p>The Public Security Ministry said Kahlon was being misled by his staff.</p> \n<p>“As we understand it, the only condition now hindering government approval is the justified demand by the police to receive authority to enter drug farms and enforce laws to ensure that the large quantity of drugs being grown don’t leak out and flood Israel with drugs,” the ministry said.</p> \n<p>“It’s puzzling that the Finance Ministry is torpedoing such a clear need by the police to protect the public.”</p> \n<p>More than two years ago, the Health Ministry overhauled the Israeli medical-marijuana industry, which included the issuing of an unlimited number of licenses to grow cannabis. Over 200 entrepreneurs have received licenses.</p> \n<p>However, the local market isn’t anywhere near large enough to support more than a handful of growers. Nearly all of them have been waiting for exports to be approved.</p> \n<p>Kahlon said medical-cannabis-based products had export potential of up to 4 billion shekels ($1.1 billion), along with the creation high-productivity jobs for farmers, and entrepreneurs in medical and agricultural research.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It's almost impossible to imagine but Maya Reik, who dropped out of school six years ago at the age of 14 to study fashion, now boasts 20 full-time employees at the Jaffa Port headquarters of her brand, Marei 1998 – as well as branches in New York and Milan.</p> \n<p>To date, the 20-year-old Israeli fashion designer has produced eight collections, all of which have been received with a mixture of excitement and amazement. The latest, the 2019 summer collection that hit the runway at New York Fashion Week – and was featured simultaneously at showings in Milan and Paris – signified Reik's unambiguous breakthrough into the realm of global fashion.</p> \n<p>Reik, who grew up in Beit Yanai, in central Israel, and took courses at the Shenkar School of Engineering and Design and elsewhere, says she divides her life today between Tel Aviv, New York and Milan.</p> \n<p>&quot;So,&quot; she says, “if I needed to describe my status, I would say I live ‘between places.’” Her clothing line is manufactured in Italy and India, and she has financial support from her family. (Reik’s father, businessman Avi Reik, along with his brother, sold their Flying Cargo Group to international shipping giant DHL for $100 million in 2007.)</p> \n<p>“I’m aware I’m lucky – that I can do what I do with the privilege that's been given to me, with substantial help. I do my best and I don’t feel a need to apologize for it,” Reik says. “I work hard, I provide jobs, I do good things and touch people.” Those workers, who toil around the clock for her in Jaffa? “Some are 20, 30 and even 40 years older than me,&quot; she says quietly, &quot;but it still feels very natural for me to employ and manage people older than me.”</p> \n<p>Marei 1998's collections are dripping with luxury and characterized by elegance and opulence in the style of old Hollywood, with clean and minimalist lines, a restrained colorfulness and a fondness for adventures of the past. Reik says she is inspired by a broad range of sources: from her travels around the world – Iceland, Japan, Italy and the African savannah, among many others – to Art Deco, to neoclassical Renaissance, and artists like Man Ray, Modigliani and Matisse.</p> \n<p>Since she founded Marei 1998 in 2015, Reik has been exhibiting at the various seasonal fashion weeks, first in Milan and then in New York. Prestigious boutiques such as Moda Operandi sell her clothing, and her designs have won high praise from the world's top fashion magazines – Vogue, InStyle, The New York Times, Women’s Wear Daily and Carine Roitfeld’s CR Fashion Book. These publications typically laud her mature designs and their nostalgic flair, along with Reik’s impressive achievements – considering her age.</p> \n<p>“What does that even mean?” she wonders. “I have never managed to understand if it's positive or negative. The approach I follow in the creative process is to design items that are not dated – that can continue and live on in a closet for a long period without losing their relevance. At the same time, the responses [from the magazines] show that I have succeeded in arousing some sort of memory or emotion through the designs.”</p> \n<p>Reik's brand has also won rapid recognition thanks to the celebrities who wear it, among them supermodel Bella Hadid and actresses Amy Adams and Priyanka Chopra.</p> \n<p>The coup with Hadid and her wardrobe came about via connections with the model's staff. Reik sent her office a number of fake-fur coats and in the end Hadid was photographed wearing one of them and the picture was posted to Instagram.</p> \n<p>“It was a very long courtship that I conducted by myself through personal connections – real creative work. It was a process that took a couple of months, but the result was very heartening,&quot; Reik adds. &quot;It didn’t change my world, but it had a media effect and power, even at a distance of a couple of months. I especially enjoyed seeing the way in which she wore the coat – with jeans and boots.&quot;</p> \n<p>Because Hadid and Chopra share the same stylist, the path to the movie star's closet was even shorter. The next goal? Actress Natalie Portman, says Reik. “My biggest dream is to reach everyone who wants to wear me.”</p> \n<p>For young and young-at-heart</p> \n<p>The latest Marei 1998 collection features 30 designs, the most important of which are silk and satin robes that make you want to become addicted to pain-killers; or evening gowns with soft silhouettes and d&eacute;colletage spilling out. Some have flowery embroidered motifs inspired by the late Scottish designer and artist Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Prices start at $300 and climb to $2,000, for an embroidered dress.</p> \n<p>Reik: “I chose to manufacture my collection as a personal and nostalgic diary. I draw inspiration from the authentic moments in life. As the social media sweeps us away into the lives of others, they are being pushed aside.”</p> \n<p>Who are your clients?</p> \n<p>Reik: “That is a question that took us a lot of time to answer. With time and experience, I realized that it could be someone who is 30 years old and to the same extent also someone who's 70. It made me very happy – to provide an answer for women in a variety of ages and with different needs. Everyone of them wears the items differently. Some take it to a classic place and some refine it in a rock 'n roll sort of way. What they share is the search for the uncompromising quality of an item that has an ongoing continued lifespan, and which one day they can pass on to their daughters.</p> \n<p>&quot;There is a quiet presence in my designs, a bit serious. [These are] not items that someone enters the room and they shout out ‘look at me!’ They give respect to the woman, to who it is that is wearing them.”</p> \n<p>As opposed to her first collection, in which she used mink and fox fur, now Reik is launching a spin-off collection which, in the spirit of the times, features faux fur. It's been named “I am Furless,” a reference to both lack of fur and lack of fear. The launch of the line was accompanied by a Parisian photo shoot by 24-year-old Israeli photographer Daniel Jacont, along with a video clip filmed in Tuscany. In addition to handbags, scarves and fluffy sweatshirts, the eco-fur brand stars some 12 designs with prices in the $300-to-$800 range, and new styles will be introduced every few weeks.</p> \n<p>“Personally, I used to wear real fur in the past. When I established Marei 1998,&quot; says Reik, &quot;it was clear to me that I would incorporate furs into its collections, and I liked the final results, but the more I got into this world, the more I understood the manufacturing process used for mink and fox furs, what it involved – and its implications.</p> \n<p>“After a season of using [real] fur, I channeled all my resources into finding alternatives. I was lucky and at the same time there were new developments in the global fashion industry, so that I didn’t need to give up this niche in order to reach the same product quality, but without cruelty to animals. This is not blindly following a trend. It is something that I am very proud of that happened in the brand. It is part of its DNA, and the material feels and looks just like the real thing.&quot;</p> \n<p>Reik adds that, &quot;A lot of customers don’t believe that it is artificial fur, and I need to convince them. I’m happy to see that I have managed to influence women. Those who are interested in fur and ultimately buy from me – it’s very satisfying.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>A 94-year-old former enlisted SS man went on trial Tuesday in Germany, charged with being an accessory to murder for crimes committed during the years he served as a guard at the Nazis' Stutthof concentration camp.</p> \n<p>Johann Rehbogen is accused of working as a guard at the camp east of Danzig, which is today the Polish city of Gdansk, from June 1942 to about the beginning of September 1944.</p> \n<p>There is no evidence linking him to a specific crime, but more than 60,000 people were killed at Stutthof and prosecutors argue that as a guard, he was an accessory to at least hundreds of those deaths.</p> \n<p>Stutthof prisoners were killed in a gas chamber, with deadly injections of gasoline or phenol directly to their hearts or shot, starved and even forced outside in winter without clothes until they died of exposure, prosecutor Andreas Brendel said.</p> \n<p>The former SS Sturmmann, roughly equivalent to the U.S. Army rank of specialist, does not deny serving in the camp during the war but has told investigators he was not aware of the killings and did not participate in them, Brendel said.</p> \n<p>Rehbogen's attorney, Andreas Tinkl, has said his client will make a statement in the trial at the Muenster state court, which is scheduled to last until January, but it was not immediately clear when he would speak.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Germany's Nazi-friendly, anti-Semitic far right has a new mission: recruiting Jews | Opinion</p> \n<p>Rehbogen lives in the western municipality of Borken near the Dutch border. In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, with no more than two non-consecutive days a week. At the same time, because he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court.</p> \n<p>The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate some 20 Stutthof survivors for the case to serve as possible witnesses, emphasized that such trials are important, even more than 70 years after the end of World War II.</p> \n<p>&quot;The passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,&quot; said the center's head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.</p> \n<p>Many survivors, along with relatives of victims, are also joining the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under German law.</p> \n<p>Even though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor's office in Ludwigsburg that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing. In addition to looking at camps like Stutthof, Buchenwald, Ravensbrueck, Mauthausen and Flossenbuerg, it is also investigating former members of the mobile killing squads known as the &quot;Einsatzgruppen.&quot;</p> \n<p>The legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.</p> \n<p>Demjanjuk was convicted in Munich on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He always denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.</p> \n<p>The 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany's top criminal court on appeal, cementing the precedent.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'Operation Finale': How Israel captured Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann</p> \n<p>The Stutthof case is the first time a prosecution is going to trial using this line of reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.</p> \n<p>Stutthof was established in 1939 and underwent several iterations, initially being used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from the nearby city of Danzig on the Baltic Sea coast.</p> \n<p>From about 1940 onward, it was used as a so-called &quot;work education camp&quot; where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens who had run afoul of their Nazi oppressors, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah's Witnesses.</p> \n<p>From mid-1944, it was filled with tens of thousands of Jews from ghettos being cleared by the Nazis in the Baltics as well as from Auschwitz, which was overflowing, and thousands of Polish civilians swept up in the brutal suppression of the Warsaw uprising.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A week ago, for the first time,the&nbsp;Israeli national anthem, Hatikva, was played at an international sporting event hosted in the UAE after judoka Sagi Muki won a gold medal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The images of a tearful ministry of culture and sports Miri Regev in Abu Dhabi or Netanyahu shaking hands with Sultan Qaboos of Oman, that Friday might well be fodder for the current Israeli government's PR campaign.But that aside, any breach in the Arab world consensus against normalizing relations with&nbsp;Israel should be welcomed.</p> \n<p>Almost all countries of the Arab League and many of the countries of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation take part in a systematic boycott of Israel, Israelis, and people linked to Israel.&nbsp;Despite the buzz over BDS in the last few years, the boycott is nothing new.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This policy has remained an unquestioned consensus in the Arab World since&nbsp;its informal proclamation in&nbsp;1933 with the boycott of Jewish-owned businesses in Mandatory Palestine, 15 years before Israel's establishment, and its formal enactment in 1945, one of the&nbsp;first decisions of the nascent Arab League.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>85 years later, the isolation of Israel and its exclusion from regional forums has not prevented a single war, hasn't helped protect Palestinian lives&nbsp;orrights, hasn't brought a just solution to the conflict or reinforced moderate voices anywhere.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As a decade of a brutal blockade of Gaza proves, isolation and sanctions have never been an efficient way to push for change, yet questioning the isolation of Israel has remained one of the most absolute taboos in the region and the Muslim world, where suspected sympathies for Israel are often used as powerful conspiracist theory-fuelled arguments to discredit rivals.</p> \n<p>From Algeria to Bangladesh, whether religious or secularists, Christian or Muslim, communists or nationalists, artists or business and STEM leaders, those openly meeting, sharing a stage, cooperating or just stating their appreciation for anything Israeli are far and few and often have to face, in addition to public shunning, concerns for their personal safety and in some cases serious legal consequences. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Thus, athletes have preferred to step down or be eliminated rather than competing opposite Israelis, artists have preferred to have their movies or books not shown rather than having Israeli audiences, and scientists and business leaders have preferred to lose opportunities rather than collaborating with their Israeli colleagues.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Normalization, a word abhorred in the Arab world and among many advocates of Palestinian rights, is a key to solving this &quot;intractable conflict.&quot; Having now worked for many years on reconciliation and people to people initiatives between Israelis, Palestinians and others, in the field of economic development and science diplomacy, I can state that putting a face, a name and a voice on the &quot;other,&quot; so often framed as &quot;the enemy,&quot; is critical.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Israeli-Palestinian, or Israeli-Arab, conflict, like any conflict, needs to be solved by political leaders via negotiations, concessions and sacrifices but peace can't work, and leaders can't afford to bet on peace, if the enemies haven't first learned to accept, humanize and trust each other. Those conversations might be difficult, the diverging point of views might never be reconciled but there is a lot more to gain than to lose.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In every event I've participated, I witnessed how curious and keen people were to get to meet each other, learn about each other, and find out how similar they really are, in many ways. I saw firsthand that normalization has the power break&nbsp;stereotypes and&nbsp;the rhetoric of fear and hatred, accepted as facts by generations of Israelis, Palestinians and their Arab neighbors and used by their leaders to justify the lack of progress in the peace process.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This experience is also supported by what’s called&nbsp;the intergroup contact theory, a field of study in social psychology&nbsp;based now on six decades of studies and empirical evidence that show the virtue of a certain form of mediated interaction between conflicting groups.</p> \n<p>Shattering preconceived perceptions of the other and giving credence to his narrative is an important tool to overcome the zero-sum mentality, the bias that leads individuals and groups to think that they either loose it all or win it all, an characteristic of long protracted conflicts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Zero-sum thinking is also one of the most powerful rallying call for imposing loyalty and conformity and can explain the virulent opposition to dialogue initiatives from sections of the Israeli right&nbsp;and anti-normalization activists on the Palestinian side.</p> \n<p>Israel will most likely continue to exist and prosper as a Jewish majority state in the heart of the Middle East,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it is in the Palestinian's and the Arab world's best interest that this happens in mutual exchange and cooperation among neighbors.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It would be na&iuml;ve not to see that the historical rapprochement between Gulf leaders and Israel is the result of regional realpolitik and shifting alliances more than a reconciliation of the peoples. It is also true that normalizing relations with Israel is not a priority in many parts of the Middle East in the midst of horrible and tragic wars.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, the argument of the united front against Israel, and the commitment to an&nbsp;unflinching boycott, have often been used as justification for strong one-party regimes&nbsp;in all&nbsp;corners of&nbsp;the Middle East. Normalizing contact with Israel and Israelis, might be one of the steps towards the normalization of dissent and the building of a free public space in the Arab world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lately, social media and the internet have allowed for some forms of contact between Israelis and their neighbors. Under the protection of anonymity a growing number of people in the Arab world have expressed their curiosity about Israel and Israeli culture and have started to reach a welcoming digital hand to individual Israelis. The relatively welcoming tone of many Gulf Twitter users to the recent visits by Israeli officials was another interesting indication.</p> \n<p>Interestingly, and despite growing pressure and intimidation from anti-normalization activists, it is among Palestinians, whether citizens of Israel, East Jerusalemites or residents of the West Bank, that the boycott of Israel is less consensual.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Palestinians, mostly Palestinian citizens of Israel, make up approximatively 20% of the student body in Israeli institutions of higher education, and the growing integration of Palestinians in the Israeli workforce at every level of responsibility, working side by side with Israeli Jews, has already shifted the perception of &quot;the Arab other&quot; among Israelis.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In my experience of organizing cooperation events with scientists and experts, Palestinians, including residents of Gaza, were much more willing to sharing a stage with their Israeli peers than residents of any other Arab state, often animated by the conviction that cooperation was necessary to tackle important issues of equal gravity and relevance to both sides.</p> \n<p>The end goal should be that of a &quot;warm peace,&quot; a peace of the peoples, when Israelis can openly&nbsp;visit the cafes of Ramallah, Cairo or Beirut, without the fear of being arrested, kidnapped or killed, and where Palestinians from Nablus, Ramallah and Hebron are free to travel to the sea in Jaffa without permits or checkpoints. Mobilizing the necessary coalitions to realize this vision requires normalization.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I'm not under the illusion that the current Israeli government is dedicated to advancing the peace process or build trust with the Palestinians - and I don’t believe Miri Regev or Netanyahu's latest efforts were meant as a step in that direction.</p> \n<p>But I am convinced that peace will be less unthinkable, and easier to imagine and achieve, when Israelis meeting with Palestinians, Hatikva being played in an Arab state, or an Israeli minister shaking hands with&nbsp;their&nbsp;Arab host, won’t be headline news anymore.</p> \n<p>Jonas Moses is the Assistant Director of the Sharing Knowledge Foundation, a Swiss based non-profit that supports scientific cooperation and Science fo Peace initiatives in the Mediterranean region.&nbsp;Twitter:&nbsp;@JonasLustiger&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>For Democrats, the midterm&nbsp;elections&nbsp;have been a beacon in the dark, a chance to re-emerge from the political wilderness and repudiate a president they view as a dangerous force.</p> \n<p>But on the cusp of Tuesday’s vote, many Democrats are as anxious as they are hopeful.</p> \n<p>Their memories from 2016, when they watched in disbelief as Donald Trump defied polls, expectations and political norms, are still fresh. And as Trump travels the country armed with a divisive and racially charged closing campaign message, the test for Democrats now feels at once similar and more urgent than it did two years ago: They failed to stop Trump then, what if they fall short again?</p> \n<p>“Part of what’s at stake here is our ability to send a message that this is not who we are,” said Karen Finney, a Democratic consultant who worked on Hillary Clinton’s losing 2016 campaign.</p> \n<p>This year, history is on Democrats’ side. The sitting president’s party often losing ground in the first midterm after winning office, and for much of 2018, voter enthusiasm and polling has favored Democrats as well.</p> \n<p>Primary contests filled the Democratic roster with a new generation of candidates, including several minority candidates who could make history in their races. While the fight to regain control of the Senate, largely playing out in conservative states, may prove out of reach for Democrats, the party has been buoyed by its ability to run competitively in Republican-leaning states such as Texas and Tennessee.</p> \n<p>Democrats’ focus is largely on snatching back the House and picking up governors’ seats in Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio and elsewhere. The party is also seeking redemption in the Midwest where Trump won over white, working-class voters who had backed Democrats for years. In Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Democrats appear poised to regain ground.</p> \n<p>Such victories would build momentum behind the party’s shift toward a new generation of candidates who are younger, more diverse, with greater numbers of women and more liberal than Democratic leadership. They would also signal that Trump’s hard-line positions on immigration and his penchant for personal attacks turn off more voters than they energize.</p> \n<p>A good night for Democrats on Tuesday would provide a blueprint for how the party can successfully run against Trump in the 2020 presidential race. At least two dozen Democrats are waiting in the wings, eager to take on Trump.</p> \n<p>But the president has proved once again to be a powerful political force late in a campaign.</p> \n<p>Even with his daily airing of grievances on Twitter and an approval rate below the average for his recent predecessors at this point, he has almost single-handedly put Republicans in a stronger position this fall. He’s aggressively appealed to his loyal, core supporters with a sharply anti-immigrant, nationalist message and by casting Democrats as outside the mainstream.</p> \n<p>“A vote for any Democrat this November is a vote to really put extreme far left politicians in charge of Congress and to destroy your jobs, slash your incomes, undermine your safety and put illegal aliens before American citizens,” Trump said during a rally Saturday in Pensacola, Florida.</p> \n<p>If Republicans hang on to control of Congress, Trump will almost certainly be emboldened. Democrats would be left with difficult questions about a path forward.</p> \n<p>For example, how can Democrats assemble a winning coalition in 2020 if they fail to appeal to the moderate suburban voters who hold sway in the congressional districts that decide which party holds a House majority? And how will Democrats, if they fall short, sustain the energy from young people and women who have marched in protest of Trump, registered to vote and volunteered for the first time this election season.</p> \n<p>“I’m concerned that if the election is not what we hoped for that people will say, ‘it’s too hard’ and become disengaged,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who served as Clinton’s communications director during the 2016 campaign.</p> \n<p>As Americans participated in early voting this weekend, that same anxiety was palpable among some voters.</p> \n<p>In Southern California, lifelong Democrat Theresa Hunter said she didn’t take Trump seriously in 2016. But she sees a chance for Democrats to render their judgment on the president by pushing his party out of power in a different branch of government.</p> \n<p>“To see his party jump on board and march in lockstep is what’s terrifying,” said Hunter, a 65-year-old retired salesperson from Lake Forest, California.</p> \n<p>A few hours north, California voter Lawrence Reh was casting his ballot. Afterward, his voice quivered and he wiped back tears as he voiced frustrations about Trump and his worries about the direction of the country.</p> \n<p>“If we don’t make any progress in this election, I don’t know where we’ll go from here,” Reh said.</p>",

The hearing was held following the PA’s arrest of Issam Akel, a resident of East Jerusalem who holds American citizenship, two weeks ago in Ramallah on suspicion that he sold his home in Jerusalem’s Old City to a Jewish right-wing association.</p> \n<p>At the hearing, right-wing MKs reprimanded the police&nbsp;representative for allowing the PA to operate in East Jerusalem and not doing enough to release Akel. Also at the hearing, MK Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi) said: “Why don’t you pick up the phone and call the responsible person in the PA and tell him that either the guy gets back within an hour or two or buildings start to fall? What if this was a Jew from Tel Aviv?”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since the hearing, it seems police have taken a tougher attitude toward the PA’s Jerusalem District Governor, Adnan Ghaith, who was apparently involved in Akel’s arrest. On Thursday, officers from the Jerusalem police raided a sports club in the Silwan neighborhood, where they arrested several people and dispersed a rally that was led by Ghaith. Israel arrested Ghaith two weeks ago on suspicion of involvement in Akel’s detention and released him a few days later; he was arrested again during the raid on the club but was released after several hours.</p> \n<p>About a month ago, a similar affair sparked a storm in the PA. In that case, Palestinian residents of the Old City discovered that a large building near one of the entrances to the Temple Mount had been transferred from Palestinian to Israeli hands. In recent years, it was rumored that the building had been sold to a settler nonprofit, and when Jews began occupying the building last month accusations were hurled between senior Palestinian officials in Jerusalem and the PA, particularly between the associates of PA President Mahmoud Abbas and associates of his rival, Mohammed Dahlan.</p> \n<p>The building belonged to the Joudeh family, a prominent family in East Jerusalem. The head of the family, Adeeb Joudeh, is the custodian of the keys to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Joudeh family had wanted to sell the property for some time. About two years ago they agreed to sell it to a man named Fadi al-Salamin, a Palestinian political activist who lives in the United States and is considered close to Dahlan. Salamin is also highly critical of Palestinian Authority corruption.</p> \n<p>Palestinian sources claim that the PA torpedoed the sale of the house to Salamin, which prompted the Joudeh family to hire a broker named Khaled Atari, who reportedly has ties to senior people in the PA, particularly to the head of Palestinian intelligence, Majad Faraj. Atari purchased the building last April for 2.5 million shekels ($694,000) and transferred its ownership to a company he holds that is registered in the Caribbean. Six months later, Jews moved into the house.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian Joudeh family, one of two families entrusted with the keys to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, published an unusual statement after the sale, saying that it has decided to take away the church’s key from Adeeb Joudeh. In the family’s statement, it was said that the keys would be transferred to another family member until the issue was clarified.</p> \n<p>The Joudeh and Nuseibeh families were the two families, both Muslim, entrusted with the keys to the church in the 12th century, in an effort to halt the bloodshed between rival Christian groups. Adeeb Joudeh has served as the custodian of the church’s keys for many years.</p> \n<p>Last month, several senior figures in East Jerusalem, led by Sheikh Abdullah Alkam of the Shoafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem, began a process akin to arbitration regarding the man behind the sale of the building to Jews. Recent police action has stopped that process.</p>",

The baby had not been registered with the Interior Ministry or for baby care.</p> \n<p>In recent weeks, doctors in Jerusalem hospitals warned that they were losing control over the outbreak and raised the prospect that complications from the illness could turn fatal. According to Health Ministry data, in the first ten months of 2018, there were 1,287 reported cases of measles in the country, about 60 percent of which were in the Jerusalem area. The Health Ministry has reached out to ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods of the city, hoping to increase the vaccination rates there.</p> \n<p>In addition to the Jerusalem area, where 753 cases have been reported, there have been 213 cases reported in the Safed district, 89 in the Petah Tikva district, 84 in the Tel Aviv district, and smaller numbers elsewhere, including Acre, Ramle, the Sharon region, Afula, Rehovot, Be'er Sheva, Haifa and Ashkelon. In October alone, 621 people were infected. Most have been children between the ages of one and four. There have also been outbreaks abroad.</p> \n<p>Measles, a serious contagious viral disease, causes a rash, runny nose, sore throat and redness of the eyes. It can also cause serious complications to the respiratory and nervous systems. About a third of patients develop complications such as ear infections, diarrhea or eye infections. Rarer complications include pneumonia or encephalitis.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The assimilation boogeyman, again</p> \n<p>In response to “Make aliyah or disappear” (Israel Harel, Opinion, November 2).</p> \n<p>Israel Harel repeats the canard that Jews, particularly those in the U.S., must either make aliyah or assimilate, as if no other options exist. Jews can also stay in the U.S. and be Jewish. Yes, some American Jews assimilate completely. But many don’t. How many generations must remain Jewish to prove this? Case in point: My ancestors immigrated to the United States in the 1880s and 1890s. Today, almost all of their grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great grandchildren are practicing (non-Orthodox) Jews. Yes, a few assimilated along the way. A few even made aliyah! Why would future generations necessarily be any different? Yet that is what Harel and his ilk claim.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, he has the gumption to say, “Only in Israel is it possible to live your lives at any point on the Jewish spectrum, and especially on the secular end, without assimilating.” Even were this statement true, it neglects to mention that only outside of Israel do Jews “on the secular end” have full civil rights. American Jews can be legally married by a Reform, Conservative or Reconstructions rabbi, or by a judge. Israel Jews can’t. Gee, I wonder why all the American Jews won’t make aliyah.</p> \n<p>Billie Goldstein</p> \n<p>Rehovot</p> \n<p>We made aliyah, but Israel made yeridah</p> \n<p>We made aliyah from free countries 70 years ago in order to be Jews in our own free state, and, to quote Habonim’s slogan, “To build and be built.”</p> \n<p>Today I am in a dark place and see only a few beacons of light, among whom are our president, mayor of Tel Aviv, Benny Begin, Amos Oz and the like.</p> \n<p>We have a quasi-fascist goverment, a prime minister who is under investigation and jails filled with corrupt politicians and tycoons, without going into other problems.</p> \n<p>Is this the place that should attract other Jews, such as those from Pittsburgh, whose entire community of neighbors have shown solidarity?</p> \n<p>Sad.</p> \n<p>Reena Stoch</p> \n<p>Kfar Vradim</p> \n<p>Canceling my visit to Israel</p> \n<p>When the only official support for President Trump at the Pittsburgh synagogue was the Israeli ambassador, yet Trump’s support for right-wing hate groups has emboldened anti-Semitism in the U.S., I lost my appetite to visit Israel. I’m canceling my month-long visit. I feel as though Israel has let us American Jews down. Shame!</p> \n<p>Joel Rosado</p> \n<p>Makaha, Hawaii</p> \n<p>Insensitivity and hypocrisy from Chief Rabbinate</p> \n<p>One cannot fail to notice the insensitivity of the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox establishment – the Chief Rabbinate – in the aftermath of the terrible tragedy in Pittsburgh. The only thing that this corrupt institution of sanctimonious watchdogs of Orthodox Judaism have achieved is the division of the Jewish people. The chief rabbi of Israel does not recognize their places of worship as synagogues. What are they then? Something frivolous? The Pittsburgh Muslim community and the U.S. Muslim community in general showed greater sympathy, love and empathy than the Orthodox establishment of Israel.</p> \n<p>The representative of Israel’s coalition government, Cabinet Minister Naftali Bennett, is also part of the Israel’s Orthodox establishment that does not recognize Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism. He spoke of the unity of the Jewish people in this sad loss. Such hypocrisy! It takes a tragedy to talk about Jewish unity when there is so much ostracism towards these non-Orthodox Jewish congregations. The chances of these congregations being recognized as Jewish are virtually zero in Israel.</p> \n<p>Shimon Z. Klein</p> \n<p>via Haaretz.com</p> \n<p>Grateful at least for Bibi’s reluctance</p> \n<p>In response to “Netanyahu, man of peace” (Gideon Levy, Opinion, November 4).</p> \n<p>I am always in awe of the whole (especially U.S.) media, and a lot of people who just totally blame Hamas for everything. I remember in the war of 2014, a Jewish general actually praising Hamas for what they were trying to do to defend themselves, amidst the planes and the bombings that went on. He said that if the roles were reversed, they (Israel) and most other countries would do the same, after all they have no Iron Domes, and no planes, and nothing to defend themselves with. I also know that if Hamas disappeared tomorrow, the settlements and occupation would not automatically reverse themselves at all. Netanyahu knows his extremists very well, he knows how rabid they are. He remembers Rabin and what happened clearly, since he was a part of the incitement that led to Rabin’s demise. He is surrounded by extremists.</p> \n<p>Right now in the U.S., since the Pittsburgh tragedy, some politicians are considering a “gag order” in which any condemnation of Israel labels you an instant anti-Semite and would be against the law. So much for free speech. So much for a real solution. Israel and the U.S. have real problems, a president who says that if the “caravan of migrants” starts throwing rocks, the military can shoot at them. While the left-wing media is having a fit (which is understandable), no one mentions that this is what the IDF has been doing for years to Palestinians when they throw rocks. As for those other limited fireworks that land in empty fields, no one can dispute the difference in the means of fighting (planes versus fireworks). I am grateful that Bibi is reluctant to start another “war” of nothing but killings of more and more Palestinians. I wish he would take the next steps, which might entail the removal of certain members of his cabinet.</p> \n<p>Chantal</p> \n<p>via Haaretz.com</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Social Affairs Ministry is not implementing the law that gives critical economic and social support to battered women, although more than eight months have passed since the deadline for its implementation.</p> \n<p>In late June 2017, the Knesset passed into law a program to give housing, therapy and economic aid to battered women so that they could start new lives and not be forced to return to their violent partners after leaving a battered women’s shelter. The Social Affairs Ministry wanted two years to implement the law, but the Knesset Labor, Welfare and Health Committee insisted the law go into effect within six months – with a possible extension until the end of February 2018.</p> \n<p>Yet months after that deadline, women leaving shelters are still not getting this aid, which is meant to include transition housing, family therapy, employment services, subsidies for higher education or vocational training and subsidized child care.</p> \n<p>Nor are they likely to get these services soon, because the choice of suppliers for these services is subject to a bidding process that is far from complete. The Finance Ministry has allocated 10 million shekels ($2.7 million) annually to fund the program, but the money has yet to be spent.</p> \n<p>Lacking realistic alternatives, some 30 percent of women who emerge from battered women’s shelters end up returning to their violent partners within a year.</p> \n<p>The Social Affairs Ministry said that ministry teams are working “as quickly as possible to implement the law, but because of bureaucratic procedures that required two tenders, there was a delay; one of them is getting final approval and will be published shortly, while the other has been published and we are in the process of choosing the winning suppliers.”</p> \n<p>“The Social Affairs Ministry is abandoning battered women,” said former Meretz MK Zehava Galon, who was one of the sponsors of the law. “Instead of being able to start new lives, they are being forced to return to the cycle of the battering man, because the 10 million shekels that are waiting for implementation of the law are lost in the ministry bureaucracy.”</p> \n<p>Sources familiar with the issues have raised questions about why the ministry chose to invest time and money in soliciting bids and in outside organizations, rather than simply assigning these tasks to specific social workers in the local authorities.</p> \n<p>Dina Havalin Dahan, who chairs the forum of nonprofit organizations that run the shelters, said, “We believe it would be proper to implement the law – by strengthening the ties between the shelters and the community services provided by local social service offices, along with antiviolence centers, in the communities where the women choose to live after they leave the shelter. In this way, most of the budget for the law would be allocated to support and purchase services for the women and their children, and not to building and maintaining a new bureaucracy … especially since anyway, at the end of the process, the woman and her children must integrate into the community, and if necessary get help from there.”</p> \n<p>The second part of the law is meant to significantly increase the supply of transitional apartments for women who leave the shelters, where they can live for six months to a year, work and get professional help without having to worry about paying rent and other housing expenses. There are now 15 such apartments and the law promised eight more. While the ministry has issued a tender, it still hasn’t announced the winner that will operate these apartments.</p> \n<p>“It would be an endless tragedy if bureaucratic helplessness blocks the implementation of such an important and historic law,” said Naomi Schneiderman, director of the Woman to Woman organization, who was involved in drafting the law. “It’s not clear why it was decided to implement the rehabilitation basket through outsourcing. But if that’s what was decided, the question is why things are being held up.” She said she hoped the ministry would be in contact with the shelters and make use of their expertise in planning the services basket, and that it would take into account the cultural and language needs of Arab women.</p> \n<p>The Labor and Social Affairs Ministry said in response, “The Labor and Social Affairs Ministry supplies broad solutions for rehabilitation and preventing family violence. In the years 2016-2017, the funding for a woman in a shelter was increased 33 percent to 20,000 shekels a month; 23 new centers were opened, making a total of 113 centers and units for treating family violence operating at the end of 2017. Six units were opened throughout the country for employment rehabilitation for women who are victims of family violence. The ministry was involved in amending the income maintenance law to include actively examining the rights and eligibility of every woman in a shelter for income maintenance.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The October 4 video looks like the scene of an olive harvest. After all, it's that season. Two young people, at least one of whom is a minor, are holding a large tarp. The smaller of the two of them is holding a stick and hitting a tree, but rather than knocking off the olives, the blows break the tree's branches.</p> \n<p>The olive trees in the West Bank Palestinian village of Burin in the northern West Bank do not belong to these young men, and no one gave them permission to harvest olives in this grove west of the Hawara checkpoint. They are unmistakably Jewish. Their white skullcaps, sidecurls and tzitzit ritual fringes make that clear.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Masked Israeli settlers filmed destroying Palestinian olive trees ■&nbsp;More than 2,000 trees in West Bank Palestinian villages destroyed in two months</p> \n<p>A Burin resident who will be identified only as N. was asked to film what was happening. He managed to get to the scene around 20 minutes later. He called the police, and by the time they arrived, 15 to 20 minutes later, he had managed to film the young men hitting three trees.</p> \n<p>When the intruders saw a police vehicle, they fled. Three sacks of olives would later be found by police in one of two abandoned houses in the grove, one of which belongs to the owner of the grove. The second house belongs to a family from Nablus whom Jews evicted, tossing out all their furniture and belongings, at the beginning of the second intifada, around two decades ago, N. said. That family has never returned to live there.</p> \n<p>The two homes and the hundreds of dunams of privately owned land around them are considered a dangerous area that Palestinians need to coordinate with the Israeli army to enter. Permission is only granted two or three times a year. Why is it dangerous? Because the area also has a spring that had been used to irrigate Burin’s groves for years. Israelis have turned it into a religious ritual bath and leisure spot.</p> \n<p>It is a also near the Jewish settlement&nbsp;of Har Bracha and the unauthorized outpost of Givat Ronen. To avoid “friction,” the Israeli authorities bar the Palestinian owners of the land from access to it.</p> \n<p>The policemen eventually found the young men with the ritual fringes under a large tree. N. saw them being taken away in the police car. When the owner of the olive grove arrived, he discovered that other trees had been hit in the same way, apparently two or three days earlier, and that a considerable portion of the olives were no longer there.</p> \n<p>The spokesman's office for the West Bank district of the Israel Police issued the following statement on the case: “Due to the decisive action of the Israel Police, three juvenile suspects were arrested for suspected agricultural theft and racially motivated offenses. The investigation is still underway, and when it’s concluded, the case will be transferred for review and a decision by the State Prosecutor’s Office.”</p> \n<p>N. was asked to come to the police station at the West Bank settlement of Ariel to provide an account of the incident. “Not inside it, but outside the eastern gate of the settlement,” he said, adding that the policeman used the exterior of his cruiser as a desk in writing out N.'s account. N. does not remember the number of times he has reported to the police about similar incidents in his village. But the villagers' complaints have never resulted in criminal charges or convictions that might deter others.</p> \n<p>According to United Nations figures and information supplied by N., the recent olive theft was one of 48 acts of violence and vandalism by Israeli civilians in Burin alone in the past three years. There were six attacks in 2016; 18 in 2017; and 24 so far this year. The nature of the incidents has varied: raids by civilians accompanied by soldiers who have provided them cover; stone throwing at people, including shepherds and houses; the torching of fields and orchards; the theft of olives; trees that have been chopped down or damaged; and attacks on farmers at work.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, October 20, Palestinian farmers were permitted access to their land near the settlement of Yitzhar for the sole purpose of harvesting olives, and only with prior coordination with the army. One farmer’s grove is in the wadi, N. said. When he came to harvest his olives, there was a military jeep there. As the soldiers in the jeep looked on, 12 Israelis descended from one of Yizhar's mushrooming outposts, and threw stones at him, he said. But someone called the Border Police and when they arrived, the intruders scattered. As a result of the incident, the farmer was given special permission to work on his plot on another day — last Tuesday.</p> \n<p>A week earlier, on October 13, N. was present for an olive harvest on land belonging to villagers from Burin and Hawara, south of Givat Ronen. It was the same story: Israelis descended from the outpost to throw stones, and the olive pickers fled. Then one of the Israelis approached the tarps on which the olives had been gathered, tossed the olives into the brush and took the tarps. “And everything was caught on video,” N. said.</p> \n<p>Since 2016, individual Israelis have staged raids at the nearby village of Urif 16 times and 35 times at Hawara. According to United Nations figures, of the 99 attacks documented in these three neighboring villages, 13 involved arson. At least 1,700 trees and large amounts of crops have been vandalized in the three villages over the course of the last three years.</p> \n<p>Madama, Asira al-Qibliya and Einabus are also on the list of villages that have been hit within the same territory of 25-square kilometer (16-mile). This is just a small portion — half a percent — of the West Bank, and it is the subject of a recent report issued by the Israeli human rights organization Yesh Din, which focuses on that violent epicenter. The report is entitled “Yizhar — A Case Study: Settler violence as a vehicle for taking over Palestinian land with state and military backing.”</p> \n<p>Yesh Din has documented 275 attacks against these six villages between 2008 and 2018 that were allegedly committed by Israeli citizens. There are other such cases in this area, but these are the ones that Yesh Din documented. In 167 of the documented cases, the Palestinian victims filed complaints with the police. As of May of this year, 152 complaints had been processed. Only five (3 percent) ended in an indictment, while 117 (77 percent) were closed because the perpetrator could not be identified. Another 22 cases (14 percent) were closed due to insufficient evidence.</p> \n<p>These statistics and rate of impunity are similar to data on crimes against Palestinians for the West Bank as a whole. In October alone, the Israeli organizations B’Tselem and Yesh Din documented 12 cases of attacks on olive harvesters or damage to trees allegedly committed by Israelis in the central West Bank.</p> \n<p>In a response for this article, the Israel Police West Bank district spokesman's office, said it was unaware of the statistics and could not determine their reliability.</p> \n<p>The army and police are both aware that the groves that have been hit are prone to such assaults carried out by Israelis, since they have been attacked in the past. Palestinian access to them is usually restricted. Since the beginning of the second intifada, which erupted in 2000, it has generally been limited to two or three times a year. Dozens of trees are usually damaged in each attack, meaning that several people are involved.</p> \n<p>When the trees are young, they can be easily uprooted, but more mature trees require an electric saw. This means the attack requires planning, and even if there are two saws, cutting them down takes time and makes a lot of noise. In other words, the assailants likely feel fairly confident that they will not be punished, even if they are caught.</p> \n<p>The areas are dotted with army surveillance cameras. At times, the attacks (mainly arson and assaults on harvesters) have been carried out with soldiers present. The material damage is extensive, and the emotional damage cannot be quantified.</p> \n<p>Muhammad Awwad of the village of Turmus Ayya is 80 years old. Agriculture is his main source of income, and he is considered one of the major farmers in the area. He told Iyad Haddad, a B’Tselem fieldworker, of his shock when he came to his grove on October 7, in coordination with the army. He discovered that dozens of olive trees had been destroyed, their branches severed from the trees' trunks. “I thought I was imagining,” he said.</p> \n<p>The trees were of particularly high quality and were planted 40 years ago. An officer from the Israeli District Coordination and Liaison Administration, along with a policeman and a soldier, arrived, but Awwad told Haddad categorically: “I have no desire wasting my time filing a complaint that isn’t worth it and the results of which are known in advance.”</p> \n<p>In fact, in recent years, both B’Tselem and Yesh Din researchers have noted a clear drop in the number of Palestinian victims who bother to complain to the police over such incidents.</p> \n<p>For his part, Abu Atta of the village of Awarta did file a complaint in October 2017 about the theft of his olives. The prospect that his complaint would be investigated and turned into an indictment as an example to others was ostensibly high. After all, it was no less than an Israeli officer at the Israeli District Coordination and Liaison Administration who caught the Israeli citizen stealing olives from the Palestinian grove near the entrance to the settlement of Itamar. He had photographed the thief and even took the trouble to seek out the owner of the plot, Abu Atta, and to help him file a complaint.</p> \n<p>An investigation closed</p> \n<p>A team from Yesh Din and lawyer Michael Sfard sought to monitor the progress of the investigation of the theft of Abu Atta's olives, but they received no information for six months. To their surprise, in August, they were informed that it had been decided to close the case without even questioning the suspect. Sfard wrote to Israeli attorney and officer Gil Deshe at the Samaria district of the Israeli police, to ask why. He also asked that a Yesh Din representative be allowed to photocopy the investigation file.</p> \n<p>At the end of September, Deshe, replied that the file was closed due to lack of public interest, which is why he would not allow the file to be copied. Sfard has since filed an appeal over the closure of the case. Only following Haaretz questions 10 days ago, regarding the case, was Sfard informed that the file could in fact be copied.</p> \n<p>“This story isn’t any different from hundreds of other cases that were closed without [questioning] suspects, without indictments and without even a real investigation,” Sfard told Haaretz. “What was new this time was that I got an official confirmation from the law enforcement system of what we’ve known for a long time: that harm inflicted on a Palestinian farmer doesn’t interest them.&quot; In comments relating to Deshe's official response, Sfard said Deshe had &quot;so internalized the spirit of the times&quot; that he forgot to engage in a &quot;masquerade&quot; and &quot;simply told the truth: the case was closed because there’s no public interest.”</p> \n<p>For its part, the spokesman's office for the Israel Police in the West Bank said no request to photocopy the file had been made to the prosecutor's office. “And to the extent that the complainant wishes to do so, he needs to submit an orderly request,” but it did not provide an explanation as to why the case was closed for lack of public interest.</p> \n<p>Following Sfard's filing of an appeal, &quot;the prosecution is examining the investigation file and the existing evidence,” the spokesman's office said.</p> \n<p>The spokesman's office also said that over the past month, the olive harvest has been taking place in the West Bank, and “security forces are deployed on the ground to prevent friction between the various populations, thereby enabling the Palestinians to harvest the olive trees that they own in their area.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;The Israel Police regard any act of violence or thuggery as serious, and accordingly, whenever a complaint is received by the police, it is thoroughly investigated to arrive at the truth, regardless of the origin or identity of the victim or offender, or the location of the violation. The statistics presented [showing that most of the cases were closed] are not known to the police, and the extent of their reliability is not clear,&quot; spokesman's office said.</p> \n<p>The statement continued: “What is clear is that in recent years, the police have been working to arrest and prosecute a large number of suspects for causing damage to and stealing Palestinian property. Therefore, despite the relatively low rate of complaints over damage to agricultural property, the police usually act on their own initiative, initiating an investigation and enforcement and prevention operations, together with the Israel army and security forces. The Israel Police will continue to act decisively, openly and covertly, together with the other security forces in the area and at the points of friction to prevent such incidents, enforce the law [and] investigate and prosecute those involved.”</p>",

And all I can say is, wow, what a treat for the eye – and I’m not just referring to the extremely photogenic pairing of Alexander Skarsg&aring;rd (Nicole Kidman’s abusive husband in “Big Little Lies”) and Florence Pugh (the British starlet who’s constantly referred to as the “next Kate Winslet”) in leading roles.</p> \n<p>This is a story that has been told before on screen, of course, in a 1984 Hollywood version that was so bad, director George Roy Hill later admitted to Le Carr&eacute;: “I fucked up your movie.”</p> \n<p>Based on the first two episodes of the six-part adaptation, no apologies will be required second time around.</p> \n<p>Under the assured direction of South Korea’s Park Chan-Wook (still best known for 2003’s “Oldboy,” in which a character eats a live octopus on screen – yes, it remains every bit as disgusting as it sounds), “Drummer Girl” will have you spouting words you never believed possible: “These staircases are to die for!” “I love that mustard-colored dress!” and “That Hollywood actor’s Israeli accent is quite good!”</p> \n<p>It’s from the same production team that brought you the 2016 hit “The Night Manager.” But this Le Carr&eacute; adaptation is a far more somber affair than its predecessor, which was basically villa porn, Hugh Laurie twirling a metaphorical mustache and Tom Hiddleston’s butt.</p> \n<p>There are two key differences between the two adaptations: First, while “Manager” rattled along like a train, speedily jumping over some of the more far-fetched plot points, “Drummer” marches to a far slower beat, relishing the tradecraft and complex characters within the storyline.</p> \n<p>Second, there is a disappointing lack of unity among rogue arms dealers, so their presence was conspicuously absent outside the BBC in a protest against their depiction in “Manager.” The Israelis and Palestinians, on the other hand…</p> \n<p>I worked at the BBC in the early 2000s and it was quite common during tense flashpoints to see a Palestinian protest outside the corporation’s London headquarters one day, followed by an Israeli one the next – both protesting what they saw as biased coverage by the public broadcaster.</p> \n<p>My take on this has always been that if you’re managing to offend both parties, you’re probably doing something right – and, despite the inevitable criticisms no doubt heading its way, this production after two episodes cannot be accused of favoritism (and the author went out of his way to try to portray both sides fairly in the original novel – his research even took him to see PLO leader Yasser Arafat in war-torn Beirut in 1981).</p> \n<p>Although Le Carr&eacute; wrote “Drummer Girl” a full decade before “Night Manager,” it is a more mature and ambitious story – a sprawling (661-page) tome, rich in detail and written by an author at the top of his game (and probably relishing the chance to write something that wasn’t about the Cold War).</p> \n<p>It’s set in the late 1970s, when the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was being played out across Continental Europe almost as much as the Middle East, with the added complication of German terror groups full of righteous young members, raging against their country’s refusal to confront its Nazi past. Fertile dramatic terrain, but one that still, 50 years on, is full of potential dramatic minefields.</p> \n<p>Both book and series begin with a horrific terror bombing in Bonn, and each conjures up an almost disturbing beauty. While the novel leisurely (and wittily) describes the diplomatic quarter and the Israeli attach&eacute;’s wife “whose kibbutz upbringing had not prepared her for the rigorous luxury of diplomatic life,” the show offers a hypnotic staging of the actual blast, the moments leading up to it and its devasting effect.</p> \n<p>Director Park has described the story as “an extremely painful, but thrilling, romance,” and he cast well in Skarsg&aring;rd and Pugh as his young couple. She plays left-wing, budding thespian Charlie Ross, who meets an international man of mystery (Skarsg&aring;rd) while holidaying on a Greek island and follows him to the Greek mainland (cue an absolutely stunning scene at the Acropolis, featuring a perfectly lit Parthenon by night – the first time filming has been allowed there, by all accounts).</p> \n<p>Then, as Pugh herself told the U.K.’s Radio Times recently, her character “gets caught up in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It’s a little bit heartbreaking. But six episodes later, you end up in more or less the same place, with lots of people hurt.” I don’t think we need to label that a spoiler, but rather a perfect summation of the conflict itself.</p> \n<p>It is also not much of a spoiler to say that Skarsg&aring;rd’s character (whom Charlie christens “Joseph” for his “coat of many colors”) is actually an Israeli spy called Gadi Becker. He’s working for senior Israeli intelligence agent Martin Kurtz (Michael Shannon), on a mission – I’d say “frantic,” but there is nothing frantic about this show – to catch Khalil (Charif Ghattas), the Palestinian mastermind behind the spate of European bombings.</p> \n<p>If Skarsg&aring;rd and Pugh provide the sparks, Shannon is the enigmatic presence at the show’s heart. With his bushy mustache and methodical mind, he’s more reminiscent of super-sleuth Hercule Poirot than any super-spy you’ve seen on screen. He’s absolutely mesmerizing and offers the audience a way into this dense story, where what is “true” and what is “staged” is constantly up for debate in this so-called Theater of the Real.</p> \n<p>The character of Charlie was originally inspired by Le Carr&eacute;’s far-left activist half-sister (and actor) Charlotte Cornwell. As the author explained in his 2016 memoir “The Pigeon Tunnel: Stories From My Life,” “The task I set myself was to share the journey with her; to be swayed, as Charlie is swayed, by the arguments hurled at her by each side, and to undergo, as best I could, her contradictory surges of loyalty, hope and despair.”</p> \n<p>Even so, the BBC may be wise to schedule a few more staff for its complaints department as this engrossing series evolves, swaying from one side to the other.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A large Jordanian flag flutters high over the so-called Island of Peace in the northern Jordan Valley, visible for miles around.</p> \n<p>“That flag wasn’t there a few days ago,” says Orna Shimoni 77, a member of nearby Kibbutz Ashdot Ya’akov. “The Jordanians put it up as a symbol of sovereignty. It’s provocative – and it’s meant to be.”</p> \n<p>The 250-acre area where the Yarmouk River flows into the Jordan River is known to Israelis as Naharayim (“Two Rivers”) and to Jordanians as Baqura. In the 1949 armistice agreement between the two countries, Naharayim remained Israeli (although Jordan claimed at the time there had been an administrative mistake and parts of Jordanian territory had been missed off the map).</p> \n<p>In 1994, when the peace agreements with Jordan were signed, then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin – in a goodwill gesture – relinquished the area to Jordanian sovereignty. In return, the Jordanians leased Naharayim (along with an area in the Arava Desert known as Tzofar to the Israelis and Ghamr to the Jordanians) back to Israel for a period of 25 years.</p> \n<p>While Jordanian soldiers are stationed in the area, special arrangements have allowed the kibbutzim to develop agriculture and tourism there.</p> \n<p>Thousands of tourists have crossed annually through a rickety shack into sovereign Jordan, to enjoy the confluence of the rivers, the flora and the area’s many historical sites.</p> \n<p>The Island of Peace was not meant to be a mere buffer zone though. In the heady, hopeful days following the peace agreement, it was meant to be a symbol of everything that peace between Israel and an Arab country could be.</p> \n<p>But the 25-year period is up next year and King Abdullah II announced last month he would not renew the lease, giving Israel the required one year’s notice.</p> \n<p>The warning signs have been there for a while, says Shimoni. Some three years ago, the Jordanians built an imposing gate on the island, featuring large pictures of the late King Hussein in regal dress and King Abdullah in fatigues and aviator sunglasses.</p> \n<p>“We were complacent, not thinking of how the Jordanians were seeing things,” she says. “That gate should’ve made us more sensitive.”</p> \n<p>Yana Abu Taleb, Jordanian coordinator for EcoPeace Middle East – a trilateral environmental NGO promoting cooperation between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians – agrees that the king’s decision to stop the lease should not have come as a surprise.</p> \n<p>“As an organization, our vision focuses on creating a just peace for all the states involved,” Abu Taleb tells Haaretz via phone from Jordan. “But in this agreement all of the benefits – the tourism and most of the agriculture – have gone to Israel and Jordan has received almost nothing, as reflected in His Majesty’s decision.”</p> \n<p>But Gidon Bromberg, Abu Taleb’s Israeli counterpart, offers some words of cautious optimism. “The lease doesn’t end for another year. Maybe it’s not too late to negotiate something new, something that will benefit both countries,” he says.</p> \n<p>Bomb shelter birth</p> \n<p>Shimoni notes that, perhaps not coincidentally, King Abdullah announced the decision not to renew the lease on the Hebrew date of Rabin’s assassination. “We had such hopes for this region,” she says. “But those were the days of Rabin and King Hussein, who had a wonderful relationship and shared their vision for peace. [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and King Abdullah don’t have the same friendship or vision.”</p> \n<p>Following Rabin’s assassination in November 1995, the hoped-for warm peace never really materialized. Relations between the two countries have been particularly strained in recent years, exacerbated by tensions on the Temple Mount and the shooting of two Jordanian citizens in Amman by an Israeli Embassy security guard in July 2017. He claimed one of the men had tried to stab him with a screwdriver and he shot both him and the other man in an act of defense. After a brief impasse, Israel was allowed to evacuate its embassy in the Jordanian capital. But when Netanyahu gave the guard a hero’s welcome back home, it sparked a diplomatic crisis that has yet to fully heal. The embassy only reopened last January.</p> \n<p>A lack of progress on the Israeli-Palestinian front has presumably not helped matters. Some 2.2 million registered Palestinian refugees live in Jordan, comprising a constant threat to the stability of the kingdom, which struggles to provide for them with its economy in decline. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to end support for the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, and Netanyahu’s close alignment with Trump, have aggravated tensions further.</p> \n<p>The king has been under intense pressure to reassert Jordanian sovereignty over the two areas. Earlier this year, some 80 Jordanian lawmakers signed a letter to the government calling on King Abdullah to refrain from renewing the lease.</p> \n<p>When Haaretz visited Naharayim at the end of October, Shimoni was gardening on the Hill of Plucked Flowers – a low, gentle slope next to the border shack. It was here, in March 1997, that a group of teenage schoolgirls from Beit Shemesh were standing on the hill by the man-made lake when a rogue Jordanian soldier approached them and opened fire. He killed seven girls before being subdued. He received a life sentence in Jordan, but according to reports was released last year on the 20th anniversary of the attack.</p> \n<p>Shimoni was there when the terror attack happened, and helped evacuate the survivors and the bodies. She later planted the seven mounds of flowers, each bearing a victim’s name, upon the hill.</p> \n<p>“I change the flowers in the fall and spring,” she says, pointing to some bright begonias. “It’s like changing the girls’ dresses.” She also recalls how, in a torrential storm, King Hussein flew his own plane into Israel following the attack, visiting each of the families and asking forgiveness in his name and the name of his kingdom.</p> \n<p>Shimoni says her life and the life of Israel are entwined in this region. Growing up in the area in the 1940s and ’50s, she remembers infiltrations and border skirmishes. And coming to the kibbutz as a bride, between 1968 and 1970 she endured the War of Attrition – a period of near-constant shelling of Naharayim and the Jordan Valley by the PLO, led by Yasser Arafat.</p> \n<p>“I gave birth to one of my children in a bomb shelter because of that shelling,” Shimoni says, matter-of-factly. “My life, and so much of the history of modern Israel, are part of this valley,” she adds.</p> \n<p>In 1970, during Black September, King Hussein began to attack the PLO and drove the group into Lebanon, where its members regrouped and eventually became part of the Lebanese National Movement. Israel would fight the PLO in 1982, in the first Lebanon war. Then, after that war ended, it occupied southern Lebanon and established a “security belt” in the area. Shimoni’s youngest son, Eyal, served in the Israel Defense Forces, but just a few months after the seven schoolgirls were killed in Naharayim, he was killed in Lebanon when a missile hit the tank he was commanding.</p> \n<p>In response to her loss, Shimoni established the Four Mothers anti-war protest movement, which helped turn public opinion against Israel’s continued presence in Lebanon and led to its eventual withdrawal from the area three years later.</p> \n<p>‘Feel the tension’</p> \n<p>Despite King Abdullah’s recent announcement, buses full of tourists continue to visit Naharayim. However, Avner Ron, a tourist guide from the local kibbutz, says “it feels different now. You can feel the tension.”</p> \n<p>On this crisp fall day, visibility is sharp and the dusts of summer have been washed away by the heavy yoreh (first rains of the season). Across the border, to the east, numerous small Jordanian villages can be seen at the foot of the hills of Gilead. Look west and you see Kochav Hayarden – the remains of the Crusader fortress built in the 12th century on an isolated hill. Dozens of kites – black birds of prey with a broad wingspan – circle somewhat menacingly above.</p> \n<p>Our bus crosses over a small bridge into Jordan and Ron hands a passenger list to the Jordanian soldiers. “The soldiers are jumpy,” he tells the tourists, warning them: “Don’t take pictures until we get past the barrier, and don’t do anything provocative.”</p> \n<p>What was once a routine procedure now takes about 15 minutes. The soldiers seem unsure of what to do. They call their superiors and hold the bus back until they receive confirmation and raise the border barrier. “That never happened before,” observes Ron.</p> \n<p>As the bus moves forward, he tells his passengers: “Now you can take as many pictures as you like – but not of the soldiers. And don’t do anything provocative.”</p> \n<p>The bus makes its way around the tourism sites. At a Jordanian outlook, the flag visible from Israel is flying on what Ron says is an 18-meter (60-foot) flagpole. Nearby is a large paved square that is now overrun. It was initially intended as a space where Jordanian and Israeli families separated in 1948 could meet. But both countries were afraid that it would turn into a smuggling spot for weapons and drugs, so the visits were curtailed.</p> \n<p>The main attraction on the tour is a hydroelectric power station that was built after Russian-born Zionist Pinchas Rutenberg founded the Palestine Electric Company in the 1920s. The plant, built in the Bauhaus style with long straight lines and curved corners, was meant to take advantage of the heavy flooding in the Yarmouk River. Opened in 1932, it once provided electricity to the entire northern region. But it was attacked by Iraqi forces in the War of Independence and abandoned, its Israeli workers taken as prisoners of war and released only many months later.</p> \n<p>Nearby, seemingly in the middle of nowhere, sits an abandoned railroad station. Also built in the Bauhaus style, this was part of the Hejaz railway that ran from Haifa to Damascus (and then on to Medina), with a whistle-stop break at Naharayim. Hebrew-language graffiti on the walls dating from the ’30s and ’40s includes complaints that the trains are always late.</p> \n<p>“Maybe someday we’ll take the train to Damascus,” says Ron. “But probably not in my lifetime.”</p>",

The deal would reduce the original anti-terrorism charges against Amitzur in exchange for his admission to having racist motives.</p> \n<p>The court accepted the prosecutors’ request for an extended jail term for his having been “the main spirit of a group that perpetrated these acts with a common thread of the motive being racist, without any provocation on the part of those who came under attack.

The decision was made in discussion with representatives of the health maintenance organizations, and the chairman of the pediatricians’ union, among other experts.</p> \n<p>Currently, the vaccine is being recommended for babies between the ages of 6-11 months only before traveling abroad.</p> \n<p>The Health Ministry decided on Sunday that further steps are necessary to contain the outbreak, and they are checking into the possibility of barring from schools any children who haven’t been vaccinated – which is a complicated step from a legal standpoint.</p> \n<p>Two more pupils, 12th graders in the Golan Heights town of Katzrin, have been diagnosed with the illness, and according to reports on Sunday, these young women attended school last week with measles.

But this is still a lower rate of immunization than elsewhere in the country, and lower than the 95 percent immunization rate needed for herd immunity, the level at which the disease stops being passed around.</p> \n<p>The ministry is extending the hours of well-baby clinics and keeping them open from 8 A.M. until 8 P.M., and on Fridays from 8 A.M. until noon.

        "text":["<p>For 10 years, various MKs have been trying to pass an anti-pornography law that will restrict people’s exposure to online pornography. This time around it is MK Shuli Moalem-Refaeli of Habayit Hayehudi and MK Miki Zohar of Likud, with the support of 20 other coalition and opposition members. They are trying to advance a bill that would require internet service providers to block pornography and gambling sites as the default; anyone wanting to enter those sites could do so only by keying in a code.</p> \n<p>The bill’s sponsors want to protect minors from being exposed to pornography. But the bill creates problems of implementation on the one hand and undermines freedom of expression on the other. First of all, who will decide what constitutes pornography? During the last Knesset debate on the bill, it was even proposed that anytime someone searches for the terms “sex” or “gambling,” a site will appear that will require a password to enter.</p> \n<p>The effort to dump responsibility for content oversight on internet service providers (ISPs)– companies with commercial interests that don’t dovetail with those of parents – is likely to be pointless. The bill ignores the fact that companies which spend millions of dollars to fight pedophilia, for example, have a hard time distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate content. These problems come in addition to the realistic assumption that consumers will have to foot the bill for this filtering.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the Justice Ministry has warned that the ISPs could put together blacklists of people who watch this content, which would essentially facilitate surveillance of users. This law would enable the creation of a list of all pornography consumers in Israel.</p> \n<p>The possibility that the state, and not the ISPs, could censor the internet and decide which content is worthy of viewing – or issue pornography consumption permits to residents – is a bad idea and would give the state the power to undermine consumer freedom, which is a crucial characteristic of the internet. It could also enable the state to freely spy on residents.</p> \n<p>This law is a superficial attempt to deal with a complex problem. Instead of parents and educators teaching children how to navigate the internet wisely, lawmakers want to make commercial companies responsible for protecting Israel’s children from harmful internet content, or, alternatively, to become the national censors.</p> \n<p>But above all, this legislation would be ineffective. Web content obstructions are easily bypassed, even without technical knowledge, and in any case a great deal of pornography isn’t distributed via websites, but through WhatsApp or Instagram. This would be a costly “solution” that lacks any technological feasibility.</p> \n<p>There is room for regulating the internet and the state mustn’t treat it as a foreign, frightening world. But sweeping and unreliable blockages, which will lead almost incidentally to creating databases of those who insist on resisting them, are not the right way.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz’s lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

Bennett paired this with an equally problematic message that the threat of anti-Semitism in America was overblown.</p> \n<p>“This is not in any sense Germany of the ’30s, it doesn’t resemble that in any possible way,” Bennett declared confidently, according to&nbsp;a report in the Jewish Insider.</p> \n<p>He was confronted by 89-year-old Edward Bleier, a former Warner Bros. president, media pioneer and Jewish philanthropist who, disgusted by Bennett's obversation, gave him the schooling he badly needed. He noted that the Israeli minister is poorly educated when it comes to the Jews of the Diaspora, their history and sensitivities.</p> \n<p>“Some of us are older than you are and we recall the pre-war period in America when the Nazis convened in Madison Square Garden and paraded on 96th Street with brown shirts and swastikas. And the rallying cry of the anti-Semites was ‘America First.’ So my hair stands on end when I hear an American president invoke that line,” Bleier told him.</p> \n<p>It was a rare moment: An American Jew confronting one of the pack of Israeli officials who saw it as their role to act as Trump’s political armor, shielding him from any responsibility for Pittsburgh.</p> \n<p>Most grieving American Jews were polite and deferential to Bennett and the parade of other Israeli officials whose remarks inspired headlines like “Israel Defends Trump Amid Synagogue Shooting Criticism,” “Israeli Minister Calls it Unfair to Link Trump With Synagogue Shooting” and “Trump Finds Support After the Pittsburgh Massacre, From the Israeli Government.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The fury, resentment and disgust of American Jews toward Israel’s representatives only came pouring out afterward, in private conversations and across social media.</p> \n<p>In the opinion pages and comment sections of Jewish outlets, commentators like former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro opined that Israelis had one job while America was “sitting shivah”&nbsp;– to listen, not lecture them on how they should feel or who they should blame, and certainly not on the eve of critical U.S. elections.</p> \n<p>Shapiro recalled how, as ambassador, he was always careful not to bring politics into houses of mourning. And yet, long before this Shabbat, when we marked seven days since the murderous Pittsburgh attack&nbsp;–&nbsp;a symbolic shivah&nbsp;–&nbsp;American Jews got an earful from their Israeli brethren as to which political leaders they should or shouldn’t blame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It is something they have always made an effort not to do when the shoe is on the other foot. In their countless “solidarity missions” over the years when Israel was feeling attacked, broken and vulnerable, American-Jewish leaders&nbsp;always held back from telling Israel what to do as it mourned and buried its dead, after the all-too-frequent wars and terror attacks.</p> \n<p>Whenever Diaspora Jews have dared step out of line, speak out, disagree or point out missteps by their Israeli counterparts, they are always scolded and shut down.</p> \n<p>The typical reaction to such chutzpah is: “How can anyone who hasn’t lived in Israel, hasn’t served in the IDF or sent their children to serve, who hasn’t huddled in a shelter as missiles have fallen, seen friends and neighbors die in terror attacks, possibly understand what Israelis are going through?”</p> \n<p>Daring to voice a partisan opinion on what is happening while parachuting in for a photo opportunity is seen as unacceptably audacious by people who, while they may be fellow Jews, have no skin&nbsp;– or blood – in the game.</p> \n<p>Over the past week, when American Jews expected comfort and support, Israeli government officials instead offered carefully honed political talking points: It is “unfair” to assign responsibility to the president, they lectured. Trump is the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House. He has Jewish family members, therefore any implication that he is either anti-Semitic himself or encourages anti-Semitism with his populist “America First” rhetoric is outrageous.</p> \n<p>U.S. midterms:&nbsp;From Nevada to Florida, a look at the key races to follow on election night - a special 3-part video series</p> \n<p>These arguments were inevitabley followed up by the “both sides” defense: That Farrakhan-style anti-Semitism is equally as bad and dangerous as white supremacist Soros-bashing xenophobia.</p> \n<p>The relationship between Israel and the overwhelmingly liberal non-Orthodox American-Jewish population has been no picnic in recent years. Memorable low points in the relationship: The crisis over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressing Congress in order to lobby against the Iran deal, over the objections of the Obama White House; and the furious reaction by liberal non-Orthodox streams after what they viewed as betrayal over the Western Wall deal.</p> \n<p>But until this moment, nothing has left American Jews feeling that they are being physically abandoned by their Israeli brothers. Never before has the State of Israel so blatantly demonstrated that it will protect its own political interests at the expense of American Jews.</p> \n<p>Not only did Israel’s leaders choose Trump over American Jews, but they did so easily, naturally, without hesitation, leaping to the defense of a political leader who is actively and openly fanning the flames of hatred that now has an unprecedented death toll.</p> \n<p>That they did this, and did so before the bodies of 11 American Jews&nbsp;– &nbsp; brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers –&nbsp;were even buried, was experienced as a stab in the back that, even if it does heal one day, will leave a scar.</p> \n<p>The image of the president touching down in Pittsburgh against the wishes of the mourners, no national congressional leaders or local politicians agreeing to be seen greeting him, accompanied only by Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer as a political flak jacket will remain an indelible image.</p> \n<p>Like Bleier’s memories of the Brownshirts in Madison Square Garden, it may fade but will never be forgotten.</p>",

        "text":["<p>There is a certain symmetry to two years of Donald Trump's presidency: he rounded off his presidential election campaign with an ad condemned as dog-whistling to anti-Semites and he's ending the GOP's midterms campaign with an online ad described as a &quot;bullhorn&quot; to racists.</p> \n<p>The suggestion that Trump was an inciter whose language and references mainstreamed hate speech has, of course, always been comprehensively dismissed by his close advisors.</p> \n<p>This is what Trump’s erstwhile lawyer, now Middle East adviser Jason Greenblatt wrote in Haaretz during the campaign, back in May 2016 - a defense that sounded far-fetched then, and enirely fantastical now: Anyone thinking &quot;hate speech espoused by...often anonymous individuals is indicative of the environment Mr. Trump will foster in our great country is reckless and ill-informed….to suggest, through innuendo and outright assertion, that Mr. Trump represents “the ascendancy of hate” is irresponsible in the extreme.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There was already significant tension in the overwhelmingly Democratic-voting U.S. Jewish community when Trump won the 2016 election. Since then, there have been a series of events, watershed moments, that have triggered intense debate within the Jewish community about whether the Trump presidency presents a threat to its well-being and safety.</p> \n<p>From the shocking images of Charlottesville and Trump's morally hazardous comments, to the atrocity in a Pittsburgh synagogue, the same questions are being asked: Is the president consciously inciting against minorities and immigrants? Are we framing anti-Semitism in America solely, and wrongly, as a phenomenon of the Trump era? What is the relationship between xenophobia and hostility to American Muslims and refugees - and anti-Semitism? What activism best answers the needs of these times?</p> \n<p>And - a debate that intensifies every day - what is the relationship between Trump's exploitation of racist tropes and a president who loudly proclaims his support for Israel, the Jewish state, and - to the plaudits of not only the Israeli government, but many U.S. Jews as well - moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem?</p> \n<p>As Israelis proudly identify as the world's outliers in expressing their confidence in the Trump presidency, echoing Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu's highly vocal warmth towards the president, how solid is the 'special relationship' between the two countries?</p> \n<p>Has the Trump administration - by cancelling the Iran nuclear deal and aid to the Palestinians - proven its allyship with Jerusalem, or has it endangered its safety? Is the administration laying the ground for an 'ultimate' peace deal or an ethno-nationalist, annexationist Israel? How does the Israel-U.S. relationship fit into the rise of right-wing populist governments around the world? How reliable is a president as transactional and mercurial as Trump?</p> \n<p>Over the last two years, Haaretz has covered these burning issues intensively from a broad range of viewpoints.

        "text":["<p>In Israel, more men study in religious academies than do in university. The ones at yeshiva or kollel, schools for unmarried and married men respectively, have some idea what is taught at universities. The ones at university have no idea what's being taught at the Jewish academies.</p> \n<p>What actually are yeshiva students doing? They are trying to understand the will of God.</p> \n<p>God falls silent</p> \n<p>According to religious belief, prophecy ceased to exist at the very beginning of the First Temple period, with the death of the last prophets Haggai and Malachi (or, as some believe, Ezra). Since then, God has been silent, and Jews have had to rely on the laws he had already handed down to us through revelation.</p> \n<p>God’s revelations are manifested in the written law: the Torah and the rest of the Bible, and the Oral Law, which religious Jews believe God gave to Moses together with the Torah atop Mount Sinai.</p> \n<p>This Oral Law is believed to contain the correct interpretation of the Torah as well as supplemental laws and instruction, without which the Torah would be incomprehensible.</p> \n<p>For example, the Torah says: &quot;Thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the Lord hath given thee, as I have commanded thee” (Deuteronomy 12:21), but nowhere does it elucidate how exactly this kosher slaughter is to be performed. The manner of slaughter is believed to have been handed down to the Jews through the Oral Law.</p> \n<p>According to tradition, God's words to Moses were orally transmitted onwards from generation to generation: “Moses received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Joshua, and Joshua to the Elders, and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great Assembly” (Mishnah Avot 1:1).</p> \n<p>But then the Romans destroyed the Temple in 70 C.E. and the Great Assembly was no more. Transmission of the Oral Law fell to the rabbis.</p> \n<p>Each rabbi taught the law and his interpretation of it to his students, who went on to teach it and their own interpretation to their students, who taught it to theirs, and so on.</p> \n<p>In the 2nd century, following the abortive Bar Kokhba revolt, the Romans laid waste to much of Jewish Palestine. A rabbi called Judah the Prince who remained in the ruined land collated the different teachings.</p> \n<p>Judah the Prince is credited with redacting the Mishnah, a legal code arranged by tractates, each dealing with a different aspect of Jewish life, from how to sacrifice goats at the Temple to the proceedings of a legal dispute over the border of a wheat field. The Mishnah also quotes rabbis debating these laws over the generations.</p> \n<p>Despite its complexity, the Mishnah was not written down. The tractates were memorized by Rabbi Judah the Prince’s students, who, starting in the early 3rd&nbsp;century C.E., continued the tradition of oral dissemination.</p> \n<p>The Talmud, born in argument</p> \n<p>Unlike the Bible, the Mishnah was not considered to be the &quot;final product&quot;. For roughly the next 200 years, rabbis, now in two centers – northern Palestine and Babylonia - debated the laws, elaborating and adding to them as they went along.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These discussions and comments were then memorized by students who would become rabbis and make their own comments, and so on.</p> \n<p>This continued until roughly the 5th&nbsp;century, when this giant collection of comments and discussions on the Mishnah and Jewish Law in general was redacted, giving rise to the Talmud (or rather&nbsp;the two Talmuds: one Palestinian and one Babylonian).</p> \n<p>This Talmudic knowledge is referred to as the &quot;Oral Law.&quot; And it was indeed&nbsp;oral, at least at first.</p> \n<p>The Talmud was not put into writing, but was transmitted unchanged from generation to generation by word of mouth, until apparently the 8th century. From roughly that point, commenting on the Talmud&nbsp;– now a written text –&nbsp;began again.</p> \n<p>The Talmud needed more comment and elucidation because the exact meaning of the rabbis was not always clear, if only because it is mostly in Aramaic, a language no longer commonly used by Jews.</p> \n<p>Oral Law studied in yeshiva is, therefore, the aggregate of commentaries on Jewish Law, the Mishnah; with its commentary, the Talmud; with its commentaries; and the commentaries on these commentaries, built up over about 2,000 years. And that is what they study in yeshiva.</p> \n<p>To this day the Oral Law remains a dynamic, growing thing, expanding and unfolding as generations of Jews study the text.</p> \n<p>The lulav laws</p> \n<p>So, study of Jewish Law in yeshiva is not based directly on the Bible but on the Talmud, since the rabbis of the Talmud are believed to have had a special sensitivity to the written word of God and an ability to extract whole laws from minute details of the text in ways that later generations could not.</p> \n<p>Yeshiva students are not studying the Jewish laws per se; the laws have long been extracted from the Talmud and organized in legal codices such as the Shulkhan Arukh. To find out what a particular law is, they can look in the literature.</p> \n<p>What Jewish academies are doing is analyzing the Talmud and its commentaries in the hope of reverse-engineering from them the underlying reason governing the Oral Law itself. By doing this, they believe that they are uncovering the laws underlying God's will.</p> \n<p>Their employ rigorous logic to pursue their analyses. One method, for example, is seeking after seeming contradictions, that cannot be such, as the will of God cannot contradict itself.</p> \n<p>For example, the Talmud teaches that one cannot fulfil a mitzvah by way of sin. An oft-repeated example is that stealing a lulav (date frond) to shake on Sukkot as is commanded does not fulfill the mitzvah, since stealing is a sin. But the Jerusalem Talmud also forbids tearing one's clothing on Shabbat – yet doing that in mourning for a relative does constitute fulfillment of the mitzvah of mourning.</p> \n<p>Since this could not be a contradiction, the rabbis uncovered the underlying distinction: the sin only matters (regarding mitzvot) if it concerns the essence of the mitzvah, not something that is incidental to it.</p> \n<p>That explains why blowing a stolen shofar on Rosh Hashanah does fulfill the mitzvah of shofar-blowing on the holiday: it is not the shofar that is essential for the mitzvah, but its sound.</p> \n<p>God and the Large Hadron Collider</p> \n<p>From reasoning such as this, more and more abstract categories and distinctions are created, and are used in the study of the Oral Law.</p> \n<p>These theoretical abstractions are the goal of yeshiva learning. They are held to be more valuable than the particular rules of Jewish Law, for they uncover the underlying architecture of God’s plan for the Jews and the world.</p> \n<p>Theoretical physicists do much the same when they conceptualize particles and processes in order to explain the underlying workings of the universe based on observation.</p> \n<p>The difference lies in the observations being analyzed and studied. Physicists pore over data gleaned from experiments in the Large Hadron Collider. Yeshiva students pore over the Oral Law, hoping to uncover its underlying principles as a way to understand the mind of the creator of the universe.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Last week, Nazareth had a screening of the film “Holy Air.” The 2017 film is the work of director Shady Srour, a native of Nazareth, who filmed most of it there. The theater was so crowded that, on the spot, the filmmakers decided on a second screening that same evening for those who couldn’t squeeze their way into the first.</p> \n<p>Although it wasn’t easy for some city residents to watch the nude scenes and the movie’s frank discussion and portrayals of sex, not to mention its grotesque portrayals of Christian clerics, overall the audience responded with great enthusiasm to the movie, and additional screenings were scheduled in local movie theaters.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Now, however, those additional showings in Nazareth are in doubt, due to pressure by BDS activists in the Galilee town, who claim that Srour’s planned participation in Seret, the London Israeli Film and TV Festival next May constitutes cooperation with Zionist groups, who are connected to official Israel. But can a Palestinian filmmaker, or for that matter any Palestinian living in Israel, really exist without cooperating with organizations connected to the local establishment?</p> \n<p>Since the initial release of “Holy Air” about a year ago, it has opened the Tribeca Festival in New York and participated in festivals in Los Angeles, France, Sweden, Sydney and Rome. Earlier this month, it opened at theaters around Israel. Srour, for whom this is his first commercial feature, hopes that after so many years of work he will also gain recognition from the wider public.</p> \n<p>Srour, who is all of 23, first had the idea for the film, a comedy, four years ago, when he returned to Israel from the United States in order to get married. A year later, his wife informed him that she was pregnant. “My first reaction was that I wasn’t ready,” he recalls. “In addition to the fact that I wasn’t ready to be a father, I wasn’t satisfied with my situation here in Israel. I was afraid that my son or daughter would ask me the questions that I asked my father when I was little. I didn’t know how I would answer those questions.”</p> \n<p>Today Srour is a father of three, says that thinking about his place of residence became dependent only on his children. This approach, which basically puts people before politics, also characterizes the film. Although “Holy Air” deals with complex political questions that look inward at Palestinian society in Israel, just as they look outward at Jewish society and at the world in general, it does so by way of its characters: a young Palestinian couple about to bring a child into this a conflicted land.</p> \n<p>Adam, the prospective father, realizing he needs to be able to support his family, cooks up an entrepreneurial plan to market “holy air” from the city where Jesus lived. For it to succeed, he needs to work together with the leaders of the Jewish, Muslim and Christian communities who run Nazareth.</p> \n<p>“I created a modern and realistic couple – Adam and Lamia,” says Srour. “They aren’t black or white and they are not stereotypes.” Srour notes that the choice of a likeable and educated couple was deliberate. “I put all the politics in the background,” he says. “I didn’t use symbols that I’m familiar with, like soldiers, bombs, flags. I’m sick of that. Rather, I started with the people, who are attractive, smart, nice, and anyone can identify with them.”</p> \n<p>Anan Barakat, a Palestinian filmmaker and critic, who served as adviser on the film, describes “Holy Air” as part of a new wave of Palestinian cinema. “Shady represents a new cinematic and aesthetic language, one that hasn’t previously existed in Palestinian cinema,” he maintains.</p> \n<p>“The main character doesn’t declaim the Palestinian cause – he speaks about violence, about what’s happening in the Arab sector, about Christians and Muslims, communism, sex. Shady takes the main character and says to him: Speak. And slowly but surely he becomes active. He also adds an active woman, a fighter for change, for a feminist revolution. He presents very daring things that haven’t been seen until now in Palestinian cinema.”</p> \n<p>Srour acknowledges that his place on the artistic map in Israel is unclear to him. “I’ve always understood that when it comes to art, I’m not part of the hegemony, I’m the Other,” he says. “And I know that there are tools designed to leave me outside. I studied at university and I also teach at a university. I took my bachelor’s degree in the theater department at Tel Aviv [University]. Because I kept going to auditions and they didn’t think I was ‘Arab’ enough, for my master’s, I studied directing, and then I could give myself the leading roles.”</p> \n<p>And in fact, in “Holy Air,” Srour plays Adam, the lead character. “Adam is a symbolic example of every Palestinian Arab who lives in the State of Israel,” he explains. “He’s part of a generation that at a certain point had hopes for peace. After [Prime Minister Yitzhak] Rabin was assassinated, an entire generation grew up that doesn’t believe in peace and no longer has hope. That’s why it was very important to me, personally and as a director, to bring hope to the screen. I did it through the colors, through the relationships. With all the seriousness of the film and the harsh statements, there’s hope and we always have to offer it.”</p> \n<p>Palestinian society in Israel is still quite conservative, and sex, violence and religion are not subjects that are openly discussed. for the most part. “I went to a grocery store in Nazareth for milk, and the owner was angry at me and wouldn’t sell me the milk,” says Srour. “When I asked what was wrong, he told me that the Holy Spirit is a very holy thing, how can you make fun of the Holy Spirit? We agreed that he would go to see the film, but it caused tension.</p> \n<p>“All over the Middle East, religion is part of society, part of life, and I think that we have an obligation to examine how we relate to it and how it influences us. I grew up in a communist society, but communism was only a cover for unity among the religions. In fact Christians marry Christians, Muslims marry Muslims, and so on. The characters in the film are also quasi-religious, but in fact they commercialize religion.”</p> \n<p>The processes that Srour describes in the film and in life as typical of Palestinian society in Israel, however, are processes that many people in Arab societies throughout the world can identify with. “Today, people want self-criticism,” he notes. “They want a film that shows them the truth. The films of the previous generation were more about politics and didn’t discuss society itself in depth.</p> \n<p>“But this generation is tired of that. With its technology and the internet, it’s beginning to break out, to see other things. It wants to be free, but doesn’t know the meaning of freedom. In Arab society, the concepts of liberty are not sufficiently understood. They have to be redefined, and we have the job of placing a mirror in front of them and saying: Let’s look at ourselves.”</p> \n<p>The internal criticism, which Srour was so afraid of, is quite low-key for now. His real problem at the moment is coming from an unexpected direction – the cultural boycott by local BDS activists. Srour says that they asked him to cancel his participation in the Seret festival because it’s supported by Zionist groups.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Israeli Arab Director Rejects BDS Movement’s 'Dangerous, Condescending' Request to Ax U.K. Film Screening</p> \n<p>Speaking about the London festival, “We asked about the support they receive, and they said that they’re a nonprofit organization registered in London, which is not allowed to be supported by political organizations. The only thing that bothered me was that they wanted to mention that the festival is celebrating the 70th anniversary of the State of Israel. I told them that for me it’s the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, and they eliminated that description. I, as Shady, want my film to be shown everywhere, even to those who don’t support me. For me, a film is an excellent place to show that there are people here who should be seen as human beings.”</p> \n<p>Barkat adds that “Srour didn’t take a French cinematographer to film the Palestinian, but someone from the other side, an Israeli [Jew]. BDS considers that normalization. This viewpoint contradicts all the ethical rules of cultural activity, I create culture in order to create a dialogue with the world. If I engage in a cultural boycott, I go back to being a tribe. That’s what BDS is doing.”</p> \n<p>Srour is more ambivalent on the topic.</p> \n<p>“The issue of BDS is complicated,” he says. “Today, with what’s happening in Israel and worldwide with the Palestinians, BDS is the only tool they have left for fighting it. I’m not opposed to this idea, I’m in favor. It’s a positive idea with an agenda of peace. But there’s a Palestinian branch in Israel that is making a mockery of the idea of BDS. They’re behaving in contradiction to the guidelines of the cultural and academic boycott, which create a distinction between general government funding, from the Culture Ministry, for example, and money earmarked for public relations for the State of Israel, from the Foreign Ministry, for example.</p> \n<p>“And neither of them wants to conduct a dialogue with us. It took me 11 years to raise the budget and to make the film, and in the end we were able to get only 600,000 shekels [$165,000]. I don’t care where I bring money from, the main thing is to preserve my narrative. If I preserve my narrative as a person, then I’m also preserving my national narrative. The grants from the government are money I have coming to me. The government spends 70 million shekels a year on cinema, Arab [taxpayers] pay 20 percent of that, and how much of that do we get? I fought for my rights. Most of us directors in Israel can’t go abroad and meanwhile there are no Palestinian foundations.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Terming the crisis between Israel and American Jewry “existential,” Jewish Agency Chairman Issac Herzog said on Tuesday that he was “shaken to my core” by the growing rift between the two largest Jewish communities in the world.</p> \n<p>Addressing a plenary session of the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America, Herzog said: “Dear friends, let me speak candidly, even emotionally, from the bottom of my heart: I am worried. I see the demography of the Holy Land and I understand that if Israel does not change course, it will endanger itself. I see the identity crisis of many North American millennials and I understand that if American Jewry does not redefine itself, its phenomenal success story might be jeopardized.”</p> \n<p>In Israel, he said, “there are those who shamefully refuse to recognize the great non-Orthodox Judaism of North America,” while in North America, “there are those who disavow the centrality of Israel to Jewish life. “&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“This is wrong,” he added. “This is not the way forward.”</p> \n<p>It was the first time Herzog, former Labor party leader, had addressed the GA in his position as chairman of the Jewish Agency, after replacing Natan Sharansky. He assumed the top job at the organization, which receives much of its funding from the JFNA, in August.</p> \n<p>Herzog warned that if Israel and Diaspora Jewry did not work together to mend their differences, “we are in danger of losing a significant part of the Jewish people.”</p> \n<p>The GA is held once every five years in Israel. This is the first year that the most important Jewish world event of the year - titled &quot;We Need to Talk&quot; - is being held in Tel Aviv. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to address the estimated 3,000 delegates in attendance at the closing session on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Herzog outlined in his address his vision of what he termed a “new unity” for the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>“This new unity cannot be the unity we so often spoke of in the past,” he said. “We can no longer pretend we are all the same. We are not. We can no longer pretend that there are no major disagreements between us. There are. We cannot tell ourselves we are all angels. We are not. And we cannot tell our children we have no flaws. We do. What we can — and must — do is to create for our people a new ethos of a pluralistic union.”</p> \n<p>Vision, he said, was not sufficient, though, and it was time to take immediate action. As a first step, the Jewish Agency leader said he intended to demand funding from the government to subsidize Hebrew language courses for Jews abroad – out of a belief that if Jews in Israel and overseas spoke a common language, they would communicate better.</p> \n<p>“From here on,” he said, “it will be every young Jew’s birthright, where ever he or she may live, not only to visit this historic homeland but to learn the language of the Jewish people. Hebrew can be a common denominator of all Jews, from all streams of Judaism and of affiliated.”</p> \n<p>President Reuven Rivlin&nbsp;spoke at the opening session of the three-day conference on Monday&nbsp;and called for the creation of a “Reverse Taglit-Birthright” program to help young Israelis acquaint themselves with Jewish communities abroad.</p> \n<p>“We must increase Israeli exposure to your schools, camps and communities,” Rivlin told more than 2,000 delegates. “They must realize they have a family.”</p> \n<p>Referring to the event's title, Rivlin said: “I cannot agree more.

        "text":["<p>While Donald Trump’s word salad&nbsp;du jour on Israeli-Palestinian peace&nbsp;vacillates between one state and two, it is by now clear that his administration has jettisoned the longtime bipartisan U.S. goal of a two-state solution. Nothing the administration has said indicates that it embraces this vision, and everything it does undermines it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Where does that leave American Jewish establishment organizations which have made the two-state solution a pillar of their policy on Israel?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Take, for example, the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA), which this week is holding its massive General Assembly in Tel Aviv. Its Israel Action Network&nbsp;boasts of its advocacy for &quot;a peaceful future with two states for two peoples.&quot; Read the like-minded policy positions of the&nbsp;Anti-Defamation League&nbsp;and the&nbsp;American Jewish Committee.</p> \n<p>Even the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the Jewish community’s official pro-Israel lobby, recently&nbsp;reaffirmed that it &quot;remains fully supportive of direct negotiations leading to a two-state solution.&quot; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>We presume that these organizations adopted the two-state solution because they believe it is best for Israel’s future. Given an administration that is pursuing policies clearly hostile to the two state&nbsp;consensus support among American Jewish mainstream organizations, these groups must stop the wrecking ball President Trump has aimed at Israeli-Palestinian peace.</p> \n<p>Are we unfairly characterizing the Trump administration’s policy? Let’s examine the facts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While Donald Trump can’t seem to decide what the result of his Ultimate Deal should be, the architects of Trump’s policy on Israel-Palestine have not equivocated.</p> \n<p>The lead architect, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, came to his position with a zealous, well-documented&nbsp;animus toward the two-state solution. Though he&nbsp;feigned conversion to a two-state solution supporter in order to win Senate confirmation, Friedman has not only worked against the establishment of a Palestinian state in the near term, his efforts are designed to prevent it from ever materializing.</p> \n<p>While Trump and his &quot;peace&quot; team (David Friedman, Jason Greenblatt, and Jared Kushner) never miss an opportunity to blame the Palestinian leadership for intransigence, they have done all in their power to destroy U.S. relations with the Palestinians.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>They targeted the two most emotive issues for the Palestinians –&nbsp;Jerusalem and&nbsp;refugees – purporting to take them &quot;off the table.&quot; On Jerusalem, they radically changed U.S. policy by transferring the U.S. embassy there and declaring Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, without saying anything about the capital of a future Palestinian state.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On refugees, they not only terminated U.S. funding for UNRWA, the UN agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees, they used this and other humanitarian aid cuts as an attempt to scale back radically the definition and scope of the refugee problem. Trump went on to defund projects aimed at bolstering Palestinian institutions for a future state.</p> \n<p>The latest volley in the anti-Palestinian barrage has gone largely unnoticed, crowded out by other breaking news. The hostile takeover of the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem by the U.S. embassy to Israel downgrades the U.S. diplomatic mission to the Palestinians to a &quot;Palestinian Affairs Unit&quot; within the embassy, indicating that American policy toward the Palestinians is subordinate to U.S. bilateral relations with Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In effect, the Trump administration is&nbsp;signaling an acceptance, if not embrace, of perpetual Israeli control of East Jerusalem and Israel’s accelerating process of annexing the West Bank. The administration is signaling that it sees Israel and the West Bank as one administrative entity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Eliminating the position of consul general in Jerusalem and making David Friedman the U.S. envoy to Palestinians further downgrades U.S.-Palestinian relations. Following President Trump’s closure of the PLO mission in Washington, the Trump team has undermined the last official channel for dialogue.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;placing America’s mechanism for reporting on West Bank settlements under the authority of Friedman, a long-time settlement booster and occupation denier, truly puts the fox in change of the henhouse.</p> \n<p>As former U.S. ambassador to Israel Dan Kurtzer&nbsp;has argued, the &quot;merger&quot; of the consulate into the embassy is the capstone in the Trump team’s systematic deconstruction of seven decades of American policy toward the conflict.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Mainstream American Jewish organizations have not produced a strategy to confront the Trump administration’s assault on the two-state solution. They have not even opposed individually the destructive steps taken by the Trump team. Israel’s friends know that perpetuating occupation will produce binationalism, entrench an apartheid-like status quo in the West Bank, and destroy Israel as a liberal democracy and national homeland for the Jewish people.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>American Jews know it, which is why they support the two-state solution by a 2:1 margin, according to a recent&nbsp;AJC poll.</p> \n<p>If those mainstream American Jewish organizations care about Israel, it is well past time they publicly state that Trump’s policies are killing the two-state solution. Sheldon Adelson, the right-wing Jewish minority, conservative evangelical Christians, and the GOP love Friedman’s policies, and will happily stand by them.</p> \n<p>We won’t change that. But a public assertion by groups identified with the vast majority of American Jews that Trump’s policies are harming Israel’s future could be a game-changer.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As long as these organizations remain quiet, they are complicit.</p> \n<p>Debra Shushan is Director of Policy and Government Relations at Americans for Peace Now, the sister-organization of Israel’s Peace Now movement.

It must be what it feels like to be George W. Bush. At its best, it’s a tense thriller that grips like a gecko. At its worst, it’s less plausible than a Brett Kavanaugh testimony and has more holes than even President Donald Trump might consider reasonable on a weekend. It also has various plot twists that, like an albino in a snowstorm, you just won’t see coming.</p> \n<p>To be fair, as far-fetched as some of the plot points are, the show is actually drawing upon several real-life incidents for powerful dramatic effect. (I won’t spoil anything here, but after you’ve finished the series just google “Alan Johnson and Scotland Yard” or check out any Lady Di biography.)</p> \n<p>The show’s writer-creator, Jed Mercurio, is best known for another BBC thriller, “Line of Duty” (season five returns next year), in which the U.K. police’s internal affairs division investigates possible wrongdoings by fellow officers. That series is renowned for its interrogations, which see suspects being grilled in scenes lasting up to 30 minutes, ratcheting up the tension to crazy levels.</p> \n<p>That technique is also in evidence here, bolstered by at least one big action scene per episode. Indeed, while “Bodyguard” is unlikely to ever be mistaken for the 1992 film “The Bodyguard,” with Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston (and sorry for putting that song in your head again), it is a strange hybrid of police procedural and Hollywood blockbuster.</p> \n<p>It starts with a doozy of a set piece as Metropolitan Police officer David Budd (Scottish actor Richard Madden, best known as Robb Stark in “Game of Thrones”) takes the train back to London with his two young kids. An ex-serviceman who did several tours of Afghanistan, he’s not the type to stare aimlessly out of the window and watch the world go by. Instead, he regards every single person he sees as a potential terror threat – which must make him a really fun guy at parties.</p> \n<p>He spies a couple of incidents that get his Spidey senses tingling and before you can say “All change at Euston,” he’s trying to talk a suicide bomber out of detonating a device and taking the whole train with them. As explosive starts go, this is right up there with the beginning of Kathryn Bigelow’s “The Hurt Locker” (2008), and it’s debatable who’s sweating more during the negotiations – Budd or those watching at home.</p> \n<p>It’s not much of a spoiler to reveal that Budd isn’t blown to bits. Instead, his heroic actions earn him a plum job in the Met Police’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, serving as the personal protection officer – or PPO; the show does love its jargon – to government minister Julia Montague.</p> \n<p>She is brilliantly played by “Line of Duty” alum Keeley Hawes, who looks more likely to torch a wheat field than run through one a la British Prime Minister Theresa May. Indeed, Montague would probably secure more votes than May if the Conservative Party held a leadership contest tomorrow. And although her political allegiance is never explicitly stated, it’s clear she’s not a Labour MP because at no point does she start frothing at the mouth about &quot;those bloody Zionists.&quot;</p> \n<p>Montague has adopted a take-no-prisoners approach as home secretary (kind of like the U.S. attorney general or Israeli justice minister) and sees the terror attack as an opportunity to push through a draconian new law that would give the security forces even more surveillance powers. (Good luck trying to find space for even more closed-circuit TV cameras in Britain, where there is reportedly one CCTV camera for every 10 people and the average Londoner is caught on camera about 300 times per day.)</p> \n<p>Despite being the hero of the hour, Budd is clearly damaged goods – so much so that he may as well have the letters P-T-S-D tattooed on his knuckles. He is recently separated from his wife (played somewhat blandly by Sophie “Peaky Blinders” Rundle), is drinking too much and suffering the kind of shakes you don’t get at McDonald’s (although both are equally bad for you).</p> \n<p>There are brief scenes where we see Budd’s distaste for the hawkish politics of the woman he is safeguarding (these politicians blithely send young men like him to fight – and die – in far-off lands, you see). Yet for a show featuring a government minister at its heart, this is a show disappointingly light on weighty discussions. Mercurio is more interested in the politics of policing than actual politics. Sure, the thriller elements work well, but I wanted some recognition that politicians might actually talk about, well, politics occasionally.</p> \n<p>The other key storyline concerns a potential deep state conspiracy where various plotters may be either seeking to derail or aid Montague’s political ambitions. Is it just me that wants to reach for my (metaphorical) revolver whenever I hear the phrase “deep state” these days? It’s the lazy clich&eacute; at the heart of too many modern shows and far-right news channels – and British television already did it so much better back in the 1980s with the likes of “Edge of Darkness” and “A Very British Coup,” which remain benchmarks in British television.</p> \n<p>Much of the show’s appeal lies in the casting of the equally charismatic Madden and Hawes. He’s the most unusual of action heroes: The one who lets you see the fear in his eyes when he’s in the line of fire, a man fully aware of his own mortality. After this performance, it’s no surprise to see Madden being touted as the next James Bond. But while Hawes is totally believable and compelling in her role, I wish she had been given more to do – and yes, I am aware the show is called “Bodyguard,” not “Minister.”</p> \n<p>Various experts have highlighted what the show gets wrong about PPOs (for example, bodyguards would blend in at a restaurant, not draw attention to themselves by sitting there and staring blankly at their subjects). Ultimately, though, it doesn’t really matter whether “Bodyguard” is accurate but whether it works as a thriller, whether its characters are engaging and whether you are entertained. On all three counts, it succeeds.</p> \n<p>But if it’s a choice between “Bodyguard” and Mercurio’s other show – well, “Line of Duty,” I will always love you.</p>",

        "text":["<p>T., 40, recently stopped serving in the Israel Defense Forces’ reserves. After 15 years of service, this wasn’t due to a lack of time or motivation. Rather, the experience changed.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“There was no point anymore,” T. said “Over the past few years we stopped doing operational duty and had fewer exercises. When you meet the guys only every two or three years, the connection weakens. The policy of taking reservists off operational duty damaged our unity. I asked to be transferred to a post where I’m almost never called up.”</p> \n<p>This reflects the change in the IDF’s reservist policy of the past few years, which raised a storm among defense officials after the leaking of a dossier by IDF Ombudsman Yitzhak Brik on the IDF’s preparedness for war. Brik, for example, warned about the implications of the major cut in career army manpower.</p> \n<p>Still, the largest chunk of IDF manpower is actually reservists; the IDF is comprised of conscripts, career soldiers, civilian employees and reservists.</p> \n<p>The IDF has significantly changed its policy toward reservists over the past decade. Between 2004 and 2017, the number of reserve-duty days performed dropped by 83 percent. The number of Israelis called up for reserve duty was cut by 100,000 under the current IDF chief of staff, Gadi Eisenkot.</p> \n<p>This was done to cut costs, and the IDF decided it needed far fewer reservists. This was also due to the law on reservists passed in 2008 that puts a lid on the number of reserve-duty days a soldier must perform.</p> \n<p>G., another former reservist, remembers what broke him. He was called up at the start of the 2006 Second Lebanon War and served on the northern border. After the cease-fire, his unit spent another two weeks at the border. But a few months later he was called up for a two-week exercise. At age 31, after 10 years of reserve duty, he asked to see a mental health officer and get taken out of service for emotional reasons.</p> \n<p>Reservists who served before 2001 know the feeling of being drained. The reserve-duty burden isn’t shared equally – only half of Israelis are drafted, and only around 5 percent do 20 days or more of reserve duty over three years.</p> \n<p>Until sometime in the previous decade, this small percentage found themselves serving up to 30 days a year. But their time in uniform wasn’t utilized well; the feeling was that once you’re in uniform, time loses its meaning.</p> \n<p>Reservists who were called up for 9 A.M. knew there was no point in arriving at the base before 4 P.M., and their first day there would be spent waiting for the quartermaster to show up and unlock the storage facility. The final day meant hours of sitting around waiting to be released.</p> \n<p>Billions in savings</p> \n<p>In 2004, Israelis served 10 million reserve-duty days; by 2017 it was 1.9 million days, so that’s serious savings. The IDF pays a bit over 500 shekels ($135) per reservist day. Most of that goes to the National Insurance Institute to compensate the reservist’s employer, or the reservist himself. The NII is paid back by the Defense Ministry.</p> \n<p>As of 2017, the IDF was saving 4 billion shekels a year by calling up fewer reservists, compared with 2004. Defense ministers have neglected to mention this statistic in their calls to increase the defense budget, but the IDF uses this money in other ways.</p> \n<p>The use of reservists’ time has also changed. Before the law on reservists was passed in 2008, around half of reservist days were spent on training, and the rest on operational duties. Now more than 70 percent are spent on training. The IDF cites these figures as evidence of its preparedness for war. But given the steep drop in the total number of reserve days, total training days are actually down 75 percent.</p> \n<p>Does the IDF know for sure it won’t need a massive reserve call-up in a future war? During the Gaza war in the winter of 2008-09 (Operation Cast Lead), the IDF called up 10,000 reservists. During the eight-day air offensive on Gaza in November 2012 (Operation Pillar of Defense), it called up 60,000 reservists. During the 2014 Gaza war (Operation Protective Edge), it called up 70,000. But the last time reservists were used in a significant operational capacity was during the 2006 Second Lebanon War, when 90,000 were called up.</p> \n<p>The changes in the use of reservists are partly a reflection of changes in warfare and technology.</p> \n<p>“You don’t need a simple soldier with a katyusha so much anymore,” said Brig. Gen. (Res.) Shuki Ben-Anat, who headed the reservists from 2008 to 2013. “Currently the army’s main areas are cyberwarfare and precision warfare, for which reservists are less needed.”</p> \n<p>Reservists have a harder time maintaining their skills in these areas, Ben-Anat says. For instance, a soldier who develops and builds missiles needs significant skills; a reservist can’t serve enough days to maintain this level.</p> \n<p>Also, training for these positions happens in the conscripted army. But after five years or so, systems become obsolete, and with them, soldiers’ skills, Ben-Anat says.</p> \n<p>Conscripts do it better</p> \n<p>Nowadays, nearly all ongoing operations are done by conscripts; nearly all the soldiers on the Gaza front and in the West Bank are conscripts, he says. Commanders often prefer conscripts to reservists who show up for three weeks.</p> \n<p>“Reservists are used nowadays mainly for old-style warfare,” Ben-Anat said. “Many reservists were called up during Operation Protective Edge for what was supposed to be the second assault wave – war against Hezbollah [in the north] or an all-out war against Hamas [in Gaza].”</p> \n<p>Ben-Anat added: “Our concept of warfare and the enemy is constantly changing.”</p> \n<p>Reservists are inherently different from conscripts; there’s no comparing the responsibility and maturity of a 30-year-old reservist to that of an 18-year-old conscript. Over the years, reservists have been credited with putting the breaks on politicians eager to launch military adventures. For example, in the 1980s, it was reservists who sparked the wave of protests against the first Lebanon war.</p> \n<p>But MK Omer Bar-Lev (Zionist Union) notes that Israel’s enemies also have smaller armies nowadays. “We’re no longer facing five Syrian armies .… Warfare is more sophisticated,” he said, noting that Hamas probably has no more than 15,000 to 20,000 foot soldiers, and that Hamas too avoids head-on confrontations with Israel.</p> \n<p>MK Ofer Shelah (Yesh Atid) says the process of scaling back reserve duty is positive for Israel and the economy, even if it’s a problem for the morale of the remaining reservists.</p> \n<p>“It’s problematic in terms of the idea of a people’s army. And then there’s the issue of politicians and the army brass not wanting to use reservists for operational duty,” Shelah said.</p> \n<p>“So the reservist says to himself, ‘They’re not going to use me.’ Ultimately there’s no monetary figure that can compensate him for upending and risking his life,” Shelah added.</p> \n<p>“The compensation was always the significance of the service, and the knowledge that reservists won wars and saved Israel during the Yom Kipper War. The moment you’re saying, ‘They won’t use me, so why should I go,’ we have a crisis.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Not many working meetings between governments begin with a literary critique, but when the No. 2 person in the second biggest economy in the world avows that one of his favorite books is, coincidentally or not, also one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s favorite reads, the show is on.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has mentioned his appreciation of “The Lessons of History,” a book by Will and Ariel Durant, any number of times in interviews and speeches, in English and Hebrew, from the dais at Bar-Ilan University to the pages of The Economist. He quotes the Durants and, in a sort of metaphor of historical relativity, he seems to have somehow always just “recently” read it. He also repeats a joke about the book’s “good news” and “bad news”: Israel may be a small country, but it is mighty in spirit.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis: How Close to China Is Too Close for Israel?</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Netanyahu was enthusiastically waving about his dog-eared copy of the book before Wang Qishan, the incumbent vice president of the People’s Republic of China, ahead of the meeting of professional teams at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem. The two spent quite some time exchanging impressions and quotes, but there was one sentence in their beloved book that neither mentioned.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Acerbically paraphrasing a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln, the authors wrote: “You can’t fool all the people all the time, but you can fool enough of them to rule a large country.”</p> \n<p>The Jewish myth and the art of shackling discourse</p> \n<p>A common motif in the long-term diplomatic flirtation between Israel and Asia, which Netanyahu has turned into a key element in his foreign policy, is stressing the shared respect for ancient tradition alongside an aspiration for “innovation” – a magic word at these events, and the soft power that Israel hawks to the world. “We are like a tree that has deep roots in our ancient soil, our ancient tradition, and yet we throw up leaves to the heavens. We keep searching, keep inquiring, keep looking for new ways,” Netanyahu said for instance during his visit to India, while stressing the mutual benefit that could ensue from relations between countries such as India that excel in manufacturing and Israel, with its flourishing entrepreneurship.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As many Israelis who visited China know, this thesis can sometimes have a more simplistic, stereotyped side. More than a few people in Asia would explain, crassly enough, that the Jews are “smart and rich.” It’s practically reverse anti-Semitism. Books about the secret of Jewish smarts sell like bao buns. The jarring note aside, the intent is positive. In contrast to the Christian-ascetic dogma that took root in the West, in the East, money has no moralistic smell, nor the cloud of historic persecution. In other words, it’s a compliment. In any case, the Israeli foreign service, which is apparently aware that there are other types of Jews as well, is good at exploiting that Asian clich&eacute; about the extraordinary qualities of Jews to leverage the local industry even more.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Stressing economics and technology also helps avoid areas of greater complexity that may make it harder to advance the relationship. A lot has been said this week about the trade war between the U.S. and China and its possible implications for Israel, but the discourse has been carefully limited to high-tech, agriculture and infrastructure, for fear that it might slip into touchy areas of security. Both sides seem to have laid down the boundaries ahead of time and tiptoed carefully between the land mines. The show itself was the purpose, anyway. The high-level visit was meant to send a message to the little man in the Chinese street that business and tourism relations with Israel are a good thing that is encouraged by the governments.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;Israel-China ties are a very good thing</p> \n<p>There is no agreement on the Palestinian front either. China consistently supports the Palestinians in international institutions. Wang also visited Ramallah this week, where he signed a free-trade agreement memorandum of understanding between his country and the PA. Israel would like to be a signatory on such an MoU, as well.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has declared it a supreme goal to achieve a free-trade agreement with China in 2019, but Ramallah got the candy treat first. In the leaders’ conversations, Wang raised his reservations about the deteriorating conditions in the West Bank and Gaza, employing phraseology coordinated with Europe’s language on the matter. But in contrast with Europe’s leaders, the Chinese did not share publicly their opinion about the demolition of the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar in the West Bank. In that sense, the relationship is very comfortable for Netanyahu: High-tech, innovation and economics at the forefront, the rest is behind the scenes, in dribs and drabs and quietly. The only public hint at the conflict emerged when the two were attending the launch of the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, where a hologram of the deceased Israeli president, no less, read to the audience his spiritual legacy to combine innovation and peace. But even digitally raising Peres from the dead couldn’t leverage the issue in their discussions.</p> \n<p>Warming ties</p> \n<p>Einat Lev, Israel’s economic attache in Shanghai, has been tracking the warming ties in government and private business for three years. “The Chinese government is eager to develop independent technological abilities and an ecosystem that encourages entrepreneurship innovation,” she says, hence the choice of the brand “Startup Nation” as a focus for the relationship. “When the central government decides to ascribe us a status like that, it filters through to every level – Chinese local government, companies and investors. The visit is effectively Wang’s call to do business with Israel.”</p> \n<p>She notes Israel’s prominent status in the list of Chinese targets for investment in 2016, which is quite an achievement for a country whose population is about the size of a third-tier Chinese city. Israel has also been investing resources in the relationship: The Ministry of Economy and Industry has opened additional representations around China and encourages Israeli companies to come. During the first nine months of 2018, Israeli exports to China increased by 60 percent compared with the same period the year before. Alexander Pevzner, founder of the Chinese Media Center at the School of Media Studies of Israel’s College of Management Academic Studies, agrees that Sino-Israeli relations have been strengthening fast and prominently. The turning points were, in his view, the replacement of the Chinese leadership – the generation that experienced the cancelation of the Phalcon and Harpy deals left the stage; the Chinese five-year plan for 2011-2015, which stressed innovation and upgrading the manufacturing-oriented economic model; and identifying the opportunity to bring U.S. ally Israel closer, based on the difficulties at the time with the Obama administration.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s visit to China in 2013, among other things, marked that turning point. Another reason for the warming relations, Pevzner says, is the Netanyahu government’s decision to dissociate Israel’s ties with China, from China’s ties with Iran – “to do business without trying to persuade [the Chinese] to press Iran.”</p> \n<p>Since then, the improvement in economic relations has been marked. There is a clear uptrend in investments, tourism, Chinese students coming to Israel, and more. The flagship visit this week by Wang, who is considered to be the closest person to President Xi Jinping and his man for special missions, was preceded by visits by at least six politburo members. This is unprecedented, he says, not to mention the visits by Chinese ministers and return visits by Israelis in China.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Adi Weitzhandler, a lawyer and expert on the Chinese economy, has accompanied this process from the private business side, advising companies that operate in China, and Chinese companies that operate here. “In a country where the market forces are subjugated to the national interest, these visits are important and it filters down,” she says of Wang’s visit. “China set itself a target of becoming a technology superpower by 2025 and we’re already seeing it happening. So they come to places like Israel, a fertile ground for creativity and innovation, to see what makes us like that.”</p> \n<p>All three experts proclaim China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative to be a significant incentive for the improved relations. The plan, which aims to revive the ancient Silk Roads, is a picturesque soubriquet for investing vast amounts in creating a continuum of infrastructure and trade through dozens of countries from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean. The economic purpose is also to create a new world order. Despite critique in recent months that caution is due before involving China in national infrastructure in Israel, Netanyahu badly wants to be part of the One.</p> \n<p>According to Einat Lev, &quot;Israel’s inclusion would give us a significant advantage in the world.&quot; Pevzner however notes that there are risks involved, and what he means is the relationship with the U.S.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Foreign Ministry punctiliously deflects claims about American anger. As long as the discourse with the Chinese stays off exports and investments in advanced technologies that could have both civilian and military application, over which the U.S. has supervision, the Trump administration isn’t about to meddle, they believe. If and when American pressure rises, Israel will try to sustain the delicate balance, but the U.S. will, at the end of the day, call the shots.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Weitzhandler personally has not felt that the trade war is chilling private business so far, she says. In any case, weapons and technology with dual use is supervised by the government, she adds.</p> \n<p>For now, Netanyahu and Wang and his entourage are playing by the American rules. Eight agreements have been signed, all touching on innovation, science, health and agriculture. At joint events and ceremonies, the prime minister talked about his favorite subjects in recent years – which are highly reminiscent of Peres in his last years: smart transport, water technology and digital healthcare. While everybody talks about the risks from American displeasure and in the weapons business, they don’t discuss the significance of the technological collaborations based on the medical big data of a country like China. Or, as Durant, the historians so esteemed by the two, wrote: &quot;The first condition of freedom is its limitation.&quot;</p>",

The Israel Defense Forces struck targets in Gaza overnight Friday, as a slew of rockets were fired in Israel's south. Five Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire earlier Friday in Gaza border protests, and another in the West Bank.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The cease-fire was brokered through Egypt, Islamic Jihad spokesman Daoud Shihab said. The Israel Air Force said it struck 95 targets Friday and Saturday, including 87 Hamas targets and eight Islamic Jihad. Thirty-six rockets were launched at Israel's south.</p> \n<p>According to an IDF spokesperson, dozens of fighter jets and other IDF aircrafts carried out the strikes in Gaza. Among the sites attacked were two major weapons manufacturing locations and five military compounds, as well as a building that serves Hamas' general security forces in Gaza City, according to the IDF.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israel: Iranian force in Syria directed Gaza rocket attacks under Tehran's orders&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israel strikes 80 Hamas targets in Gaza Friday, 30 rockets launched at south</p> \n<p>The fighting continued Saturday, with the IDF attacking 8 Islamic Jihad targets in Gaza, six rockets launched at Israel and five intercepted. In total, the Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted 15 rockets fired into Israel's south over the weekend, the military said. The Air Force recommenced bombing the northern Gaza Strip Saturday.</p> \n<p>The IDF spokesperson said Saturday that the Islamic Jihad organization was responsible for the rockets, under guidance from Iran.</p> \n<p>The Palestinians killed at the border between Israel and Gaza Friday were named as 27-year-old Muhammad Khaled 'Abd al-Nabi; 22-year-old Ahmed Said Abu Libdah; 23-year-old Aish Sha'ath; 22-year-old Naser Abu Thayem. In addition, 23-year-old Mujahed Ziyad 'Akel succumbed to his wounds Saturday morning.</p> \n<p>Fourteen different alarm sirens were activated throughout the night Friday and on Saturday in Israel's southern communities, including the cities of Sderot and in the Eshkol Regional Council near the Gaza border.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The IDF reported that it had attacked a 4-story building that served as Hamas' general security forces headquarters in Gaza City. The IDF said it had warned the building's occupants several times to evacuate prior to the bombing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot held an emergency meeting with senior officials in response to the escalations. Safety instructions to residents of Israel's Gaza-bordered communities were issued, warning residents not to have gatherings of more than 100 people in an open area, and 500 in a closed area.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The safety restrictions were lifted Saturday afternoon once the cease-fire was announced, although instructions on gatherings remained unchanged.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Why Netanyahu really isn't eager for a Gaza war&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;The problems of Israeli children vs. the problems of Gazan children&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Pushing for war on Hamas, Israeli defense chief fails to rally security cabinet&nbsp;|&nbsp;Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Seven people have been treated for shock trauma in Sderot according to a Magen David Adom spokesperson. A 53-year-old man and a 14-year-old boy were lightly injured after running for protection when sirens sounded.</p> \n<p>Some residents reported hearing explosions, with some saying they witnessed interceptions by the Iron Dome. No damage or serious injuries have been reported.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The sirens came hours after Palestinian authorities reported that&nbsp;six Palestinians had been killed by Israeli military fire – five in the weekly protests on the Israel-Gaza border and one in clashes in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>&quot;How low can the terrorist organization in Gaza go by harming the ambulance crossing at Erez?&quot; Maj. Gen.

They have no empathy for babies, for elderly people, for the sick patients among you. Terrorist organizations hurt you first and foremost,&quot; Abu Rokon wrote on COGAT's Arabic Facebook page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel has been criticized for not allowing critically ill patients from Gaza through the border for life-saving treatment.</p> \n<p>Late on Wednesday night, the Israeli military struck eight Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip&nbsp;after a rocket fired from Gaza landed in an unpopulated area in Israel.</p> \n<p>The previous week, a rocket launched from Gaza hit a house in the southern Israeli city of Be'er Sheva, damaging it heavily.&nbsp;Another rocket landed in the sea near one of the major cities in Israel's largest metropolitan area.</p> \n<p>In response the Israeli military said it struck 20 targets in&nbsp;Gaza, including a Hamas attack tunnel in the southern Strip. The assault &quot;significantly damaged Hamas' capabilities,&quot; IDF Spokesman Ronen Manelis&nbsp;added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Eisenkot cut short his visit in the United States following the escalation on the southern border.

        "text":["<p>Political and military leaders have concluded that it would be better for Israel not to overthrow the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, officials who took part in the deliberations told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>A political source said Israel’s policy on Hamas has not changed; the plan to keep the group in power in the Strip stems from a desire to prevent a collapse of Gaza’s infrastructure, a problem that could harm Israel as well.</p> \n<p>Accordingly, the instructions to defense officials are to deter Hamas and weaken it, but in a way that will not put its control of Gaza at risk. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to support efforts to reach an agreement that will restore quiet to the south.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Gaza fuse is getting shorter as Netanyahu risks losing control of the conflict | Analysis</p> \n<p>The Israeli officials’ conclusion stems from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ rigid stance on Gaza and the attempts to reach an agreement.</p> \n<p>Abbas is making it difficult to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, for example, by opposing the entry of fuel trucks financed by Qatar. Israel fears that this increases the chances of an escalation.</p> \n<p>According to the officials, Abbas is hoping for a flare-up because he believes that this would serve the PA in its reconciliation talks with Hamas. In the near term, he plans to increase the punitive measures against the organization, the officials say.</p> \n<p>As a result, senior political and defense officials say Israel’s talks with Hamas through intermediaries will be more effective than a process that involves the PA.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu told reporters Monday that he continues to support efforts to de-escalate&nbsp;tensions between Israel and the Strip.</p> \n<p>“We are working to prevent [Gaza] forces getting into Israel to harm our soldiers and communities,” Netanyahu said. “On the other hand, we’re working to prevent a humanitarian crisis, which is why we’re willing to accept the UN and Egyptian mediation efforts to achieve quiet and fix the electricity situation.”</p> \n<p>A political source added that “there is no diplomatic solution with a group that wants to destroy us. The only solution is deterrence and a humanitarian solution to prevent a collapse that will end up exploding in our faces.”</p> \n<p>The source, using Abbas’ nickname, added that “the collapse is a result of Abu Mazen’s decision to cut [the Gazans’] funding. We were close to signing an agreement for getting back to calm but it was scuttled by the protests at the fence Friday. They were getting fuel before, so we thought things would calm down, but then they came to the fence.”</p> \n<p>According to political sources, Netanyahu wants to avoid a war, but that does not mean he will be able to.</p> \n<p>&quot;Our options are occupying Gaza, but if we had someone to give it to, we would have occupied it already,” one source said.</p> \n<p>“And it has to be done in a way that prevents casualties. But there’s no one to give it to; the Arabs don’t want to hear about it, so the other option is to hit it hard without occupying it. To give us time. But actually, we’re already giving them pretty hard blows.”</p> \n<p>Sources said Netanyahu is willing to take criticism because he believes he still has options to achieve quiet.</p> \n<p>“It’s not only a question of political capital, we have not exhausted all options,” the source said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Acting in Syria again</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Israel has operated in Syria since a Russian plane was downed by Syrian air defense last month, an accident that sparked a crisis between Israel and Russia, a diplomatic source said Monday.</p> \n<p>The source said Netanyahu may meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris on November 11. “We believe there’s a good chance the meeting will happen there,” the source said. “It’s convenient, but not yet set.”</p> \n<p>Fifteen Russian airmen were killed in September when the Ilyushin-20 turboprop was mistakenly shot down by Syrian air defense soon after an Israeli strike near the coastal city of Latakia.</p> \n<p>Israel blamed Syrian recklessness, while the Russian Embassy in Israel said the Israel Air Force’s actions were “irresponsible and unfriendly.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu said this month that he and Putin have agreed to meet for the first time since the incident.</p> \n<p>Haaretz’s Amos Harel wrote last week that Moscow has been taking a more forceful stance toward Israel concerning IAF activity in the north, ever since the Russian intelligence-gathering plane was shot down.</p> \n<p>Israel said on September 4 that it had carried out more than 200 airstrikes in Syria over the previous two years – an average of twice a week – with Russia largely turning a blind eye. There have been no reports of such missions since the Russian plane’s downing on September 17.</p>",

The daily said the move would affect several thousand Italian citizens.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;How a Jewish historian helped Benigni fend off Holocaust denial charges in ‘Life is Beautiful'&nbsp;■ 'Don't be scared of Europe's new populists,' Italy's media czar and Bannon connection tells Haaretz &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>Responding to the story, Union of Jewish Communities President Noemi Di Segni said: “As the institution representing all Italian Jews, we call on the parliament and the government to reconsider the measure,” adding: “Even if the timing and calculations [of the cuts] are still not clear, the moral aspect is at the heart of the problem.”</p> \n<p>She continued: “We are not even brave enough to tell the survivors what’s going on [with the cuts] – these people who struggle to tell the horrors of the Holocaust in their families, in front of students and teachers,” Di Segni said. “We don’t want to see that sense of desolation and abandonment in their eyes,” she added.</p> \n<p>However, on Monday, the Finance Ministry issued a clarification, saying it would only be diverting “excess” money (a reported 50 million euros, or $57 million) from the special fund, and that the move would therefore not affect people who are already receiving the payments.</p> \n<p>The special fund at the ministry provides minimal pensions – averaging around 500 euros a month – to victims born before 1945, or spouses and orphans of the persecuted whose income is below 17,000 euros a year, said La Stampa.</p> \n<p>Originally tailored to help political dissidents who were persecuted by the fascist regime, since the mid-1980s it was also extended to a number of Italian Jews who were able to provide proof of persecution.</p> \n<p>Di Segni said that such pensions are hard to get, because survivors are required to provide “absurd documentation” such as papers from the 1930s and ’40s to prove they were persecuted, and that the bureaucratic red tape is endless.</p> \n<p>The Union of Jewish Communities said Monday that it welcomed the clarification, saying that “according to the updates” the cuts are only adjustments due to “the natural decrease in the number of beneficiaries.”</p> \n<p>However, it added it will continue fighting to make access to such pensions easier. Meanwhile, critics both inside and outside the Jewish community insisted the cuts were symbolically unacceptable regardless of their reach.</p> \n<p>Rome’s new governing coalition was formed last spring by the far-right, anti-immigration League party and the grassroots antiestablishment populists of the Five Star Movement. This is their first budget.</p> \n<p>The country is marking the 80th anniversary of the promulgation of its Racial Laws, which legalized racial discrimination against Jews. After September 1943, with the Allies invading Italy from the south and the Mussolini regime collapsing, Germany invaded its former ally and established the puppet state of the Italian Social Republic, which played a major role in the deportation of over 7,000 Jews. In total, some 7,172 Italian Jews died in the Holocaust (or 8,879 when factoring in the island of Rhodes, which was under Italian rule at the time). Some 12.5 percent of the Jews who were deported survived.</p> \n<p>Also in Italy, an estimated 2,000 fascists marched Sunday in Predappio, where former Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was born and is buried. They were commemorating October 1922’s March on Rome, which brought Mussolini to power.</p> \n<p>A member of the far-right Forza Nuova (New Force) drew attention by wearing a T-shirt sporting the slogan “Auschwitzland” and a logo merging Disney’s famous castle with the infamous image of the entrance to the Nazi death camp. The marches occur in Predappio every year, notably to mark the birth and death of Mussolini, and the aforementioned March on Rome.</p> \n<p>JTA reported that photos of activist Selene Ticchi wearing the T-shirt went viral. In a video, Ticchi described her choice of T-shirt as &quot;black humor.&quot;</p> \n<p>However, the ANSA website reported Monday that Forza Nuova had suspended Ticchi from the Bologna branch of the movement &quot;indefinitely and with immediate effect&quot; for wearing the offensive garment.</p>",

He who creates peace in His celestial heights, may He create peace for us and for all Israel; and say, Amen.”</p> \n<p>Among the mourners was Brian Primack, a friend of Rabinowitz and a fellow member of the congregation he helped lead.</p> \n<p>&quot;There is sort of a debate about this in the Jewish community. Some people say that it is good to stand with others who are mourning, and others say that it is better to stay seated if you are not formally mourning a relative so that when you are mourning, your standing is somehow more meaningful.</p> \n<p>&quot;Given this experience and the loss of Jerry, I can say that from now on, I will now always stand, as he did, both for him and for others who have no one to stand for them.”</p> \n<p>Rabinowitz was remembered as a deeply caring physician and friend,&nbsp;easily recognizable with his trademark bow tie and smiling face, and as one of the first doctors in Pittsburgh to treat HIV-positive patients.&nbsp;He was a leader of Dor Hadash, the Reconstructionist congregation that met in the synagogue (one of three different congregations that hold services in the building).</p> \n<p>The congregation that was the main focus of Saturday's attack was holding services in one part of the building, while Dor Hadash met in a separate section at the same time.</p> \n<p>Avishai Ostrin, Rabinowitz's nephew, wrote a Facebook post explaining that his uncle had been killed while trying to help others.</p> \n<p>Ostrin wrote, “When he heard shots he ran outside to try and see if anyone was hurt and needed a doctor. That was Uncle Jerry, that’s just what he did.”</p> \n<p>He told Haaretz that this was the account his family had been given. “It speaks to his personality … he was extraordinary,” said Ostrin.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Primack told Haaretz that Rabinowitz ran to help when they heard a loud noise.&nbsp;Another Dor Hadash member, a nurse, was with him and is among the injured, according to Ostrin.</p> \n<p>Primack described Rabinowitz in a statement: &quot;Jerry was more than a pillar of our community. … He was a gifted teacher, a truly caring family doctor, and a tremendous community leader.</p> \n<p>&quot;He was the first to get to the Shabbat service so he could set up chairs&nbsp;– and then the last to leave so he could clean up and organize the books. … I will deeply miss his smile, his wit, his positivity, and his consistent urge to help,&quot; he added.</p> \n<p>Ostrin said his uncle had patients who were the third generation in their family to be treated by him.</p> \n<p>“It shows how committed he was to his patients,” he said. “His bow ties, his laughter – this is what stands out to me; he had this happy-go-lucky personality.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“Tel Aviv on Fire,” a film directed by Sameh Zoabi, won the prize for best Israeli film at the 34th Haifa International Film Festival on Saturday. It also won the award for the best screenplay. The best documentary film award went to Asaf Galay’s “Army of Lovers in the Holy Land.”</p> \n<p>The 100,000 shekels ($25,600) prize was awarded to Zoabi’s film, produced by Amir Harel and Ayelet Kait. It is a comedy about an intern working on a soap opera filmed in Ramallah, who one day is promoted to writing the show. Because he finds it difficult to write, he enlists an Israeli officer at the checkpoint he passes daily to help him, and pays the officer in hummus for the advice he gives.</p> \n<p>“The film is a humoristic and original breakthrough. A surprising perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that addresses both narratives, from a subversive and refreshing place,” was how the festival’s judges justified their choice for best Israeli film. The “wild, accurate and sharp characters collaborate in the existential absurdity that the occupation bequeaths. The subversive and original approach of the film could well communicate with the new and younger generation that has despaired of the search for known political solutions and has chosen to cut themselves off.”</p> \n<p>Joseph El-Dror’s film, “No Blood,” (produced by Liran Atzmor) was awarded the prize for the best Israeli debut film, while the best actress award went to Laliv Sivan for her performance in Yaron Shani’s “Love Trilogy: Stripped.” Shani’s film also won the prize for best film editing.</p> \n<p>The best actor prize was awarded to Naveh Tzur for his performance in Marco Carmel’s “Noble Savage.” Tzur also won the Award for Artistic Achievement in an Israeli Feature Film from the Federation of Film Critics of Europe and the Mediterranean.</p> \n<p>The cinematography prize went to Daniel Miller for his work on the film “Fig Tree.”</p> \n<p>The best documentary film, “Army of Lovers in the Holy Land” (produced by Naama Pyritz), was awarded 40,000 shekels ($11,000). It tells the story of Army of Lovers, a Swedish pop group that enjoyed great popularity in the 1990s and was famous for its mix of disco, camp, and queer music along with its messages of sexual liberation. The film follows the decision by one of the group’s members, Jean-Pierre Barda, to leave Sweden and immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return.</p> \n<p>About “Army of Lovers in the Holy Land,” the judges said that it was “refreshing and entertaining, and describes the move from the plastic world of stiletto heels and fake diamonds to the roughness of the Israeli reality and conservatism.” The judges said the film “creates entertaining and absurd moments alongside an authentic emotional process of searching and belonging.”</p> \n<p>Dalit Kimor’s “Unkept Secrets” received an honorable mention in the documentary film competition.</p> \n<p>The jury for the Israeli film competition included this year’s chairwoman, director Julie Shles, French director Philippe Le Guay, Israeli actress Salwa Nakkara, Israeli cinematographer Yaron Scharf and Spanish producer Jordi Rediu.</p> \n<p>The short animation film award went to “How and Why Don Jose Dissipated,” directed by Moshe Ben-Avraham, and the honorable mention went to “Dreams of Elsewhere.”</p> \n<p>Yotam Kislev and Eyal Tzadik’s “Evaluation” was named the best independent short film.</p> \n<p>The short film prize was awarded to director Alon Sahar for “Out,” and the short documentary prize went to “Malka, Malka,” directed by Maya Yavin.</p> \n<p>Black Sheep Film Productions won a prize, a grant of post-production services worth 90,000 euros, awarded to Naomi Levari and Saar Yogev, who produced two films screened at the festival: “Stripped” and “Fig Tree.”</p> \n<p>“Dead Women Walking,” Hagar Ben Asher’s first American film was shown outside the official competition and won the first prize in the festival’s Carmel International Film Competition.</p> \n<p>Yair Qedar’s Haivrim project, depicting a series of biographical documentaries on outstanding writers in Hebrew and Jewish culture, received an honorable mention. The first prize for the Golden Anchor Competition for Mediterranean Cinema was awarded to the film “Daughter of Mine,” directed by Laura Bispuri.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Angela Merkel is the answer to two questions: 1. Will Israel, “having no alternative,” attack the Gaza Strip before Friday, that being “the only possible response” to the multiplying demonstrations at the border fence? And 2. Now that the Monday-evening deadline given to the residents of the West Bank Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar to dismantle their simple structures has passed, will Israel’s Civil Administration raze the entire community Tuesday?</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>It probably won’t happen this week, so as not to embarrass Merkel. The German chancellor and her cabinet are scheduled to arrive Wednesday for meetings with their Israeli colleagues, the seventh such intergovernmental consultations since the tradition began in 2008. In between, the German delegation will visit an exhibition on technological innovation sponsored by the Foreign Ministry, at which six Israeli companies will present their wares.</p> \n<p>Officially, Germany — like all European Union member states — opposes the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar and the forced eviction of its residents, actions that violate international law and Israel’s obligations as an occupying power. Officially, Germany is concerned by the military escalation and the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Therefore, like all European states, it hopes for a nonviolent resolution of the military tension.</p> \n<p>But the consulting cabinet ministers aren’t supposed to delve into the bottomless expectation gap between the parties on the future of the Palestinian territories that were captured in 1967. The Germans are still talking about a two-state solution, even as Israel is realizing the eight-state vision (of defeated, disconnected Palestinian enclaves scattered throughout the expanse of Jewish sovereignty).</p> \n<p>In any event, the joint consultations address the real issues of mature countries. The parties will discuss their excellent technological, military and intelligence ties, their common place in the advanced industrial world, their cultural and scientific ties — not to mention, of course, the Holocaust and Germany’s eternal obligations to Israel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Israel Gives Residents of West Bank Bedouin Village Week to Evacuate</p> \n<p>We can infer, from the slogans inserted in the joint statement after the 2016 consultations, that some German minister will blurt out something about human rights, and the response will be that Israel is the only democracy in the region. An open expression of Israeli military and bureaucratic superiority during the visit wouldn’t go over well with the foreign guests.</p> \n<p>And so, the bulldozers and the deadly armed drones, the pride of Israeli technology, along with our female combat soldiers who operate them remotely, the pride of Israeli feminism, will be forced to wait patiently. Not this week.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, why should they wait patiently? Why shouldn’t it happen this week? The German ministers already ignore that an important part of Israeli technological, military and intelligence development is linked to maintaining the occupation and keeping the permanent conflict on a low flame that occasionally flares up. They must ignore this, mentally and emotionally, to continue cultivating partnerships with Israel. They can also ignore Israel’s use of its military capabilities during their visit.</p> \n<p>Each day that has passed since May 1999 (when the final-status agreement with the Palestinians was to go into effect), Israel has crossed another red line in shaping its unique regime of separation (apartheid, in Afrikaans). None of these crossings or violations of international resolutions led European countries to put genuine political pressure on Israel.</p> \n<p>Each day that has passed since May 1999, Europe in general and Germany in particular have crossed another red line in the normalization of Israeli apartheid. They make a complete separation between their partner in technological, scientific and intellectual progress and the Israel that plans to erase in the near future the small village and other communities, and that for 10 years has imprisoned 2 million people in the biggest concentration facility in the world.</p> \n<p>And the umbrella of the victims and survivors of the Holocaust is used to excuse and explain this intolerable ability to repress and compartmentalize.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Soon after Prince Mohammed bin Salman became second in line to the throne of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia, he turned his sights to the sprawling empire of the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group.</p> \n<p>In 2015, the prince, then 29, approached Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the family-owned construction giant, and told him he wanted to become a partner in the firm, according to six people briefed on the exchange.</p> \n<p>The prince pitched his offer as a patriotic opportunity to help transform the kingdom's oil-dependent economy. It would also, he said, ease the financial strain on the company as the government reined in infrastructure spending to cope with a drop in oil prices.</p> \n<p>As head of the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;royal family's favoured building contractor, Bakr bin Laden was accustomed to obliging royal requests. But he hesitated at the prince's approach, these sources said. The construction mogul replied that he needed time to consult other family shareholders.</p> \n<p>In the months that followed, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known by many simply as MbS, grew more powerful, rising to crown prince in June 2017. He championed economic reform and took aim at widespread corruption.</p> \n<p>The Bin Ladens, in contrast, experienced a dramatic fall from grace.</p> \n<p>Three Bin Laden brothers, senior executives in the family firm, were among more than 200 businessmen, royals and officials detained in November 2017 in an anti-corruption drive ordered by the prince. Bakr and two of his brothers, Saleh and Saad, eventually transferred their combined 36.2 percent stake in the family firm to the state in April 2018. Bakr, in his late 60s, is still in custody, although no charges have been made public.</p> \n<p>Reuters spoke to more than two dozen&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group employees, family friends, government officials, bankers and businessmen to tell the story of the fall of the Bin Ladens. Few of the sources would go on the record, citing the Bin Ladens' long-standing preference for privacy and restrictions on public criticism of the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;government. These sources charted the family's reversal of fortune, starting with that 2015 exchange between Bakr and Prince Mohammed and ending with the state taking management control of the family firm.</p> \n<p>The Bin Ladens' undoing exposes the contradictions in Prince Mohammed's plan to build a modern economy, some economists say. He has embraced privatisation, hoping to inject dynamism, yet the state has intervened in firms such as&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group. He has tackled corruption, yet there has been little transparency around the process. One&nbsp;Saudibusinessman said the Bin Laden saga had become a &quot;symbol of what's happening between the government and the private sector - a breakdown of trust.&quot;</p> \n<p>Asked to comment, a senior government official said Prince Mohammed did not seek a stake in&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group in 2015. The&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;government, he added, had saved the company from collapse after it experienced financial difficulties &quot;coupled with extensive supervisory and governance weakness.&quot;&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group was &quot;a vital&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;commercial entity,&quot; he said. The Bin Laden family and its representatives did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>NEW KING, NEW RULES</p> \n<p>The Bin Laden clan has known trouble before: The black sheep of the family, Osama, masterminded the attacks on America of Sept. 11, 2001. But the Bin Ladens, led by Bakr, survived that storm. Their reckoning began with King Abdullah's death in January 2015.</p> \n<p>Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group had grown from humble beginnings in 1931, nourished by the Bin Laden family's good relations with successive rulers. Royal contracts were arranged informally, sometimes scribbled on paper over coffee.</p> \n<p>&quot;It was the 'inshallah bukra' [God willing, tomorrow] way of doing business, with a meeting that might have been scheduled for 11 a.m. in the office, rescheduled to 4 p.m. and then actually taking place at 2 a.m. at the palace,&quot; said Thomas Fallows, an American banker who worked in Riyadh for eight years.</p> \n<p>In the last months of King Abdullah's life, oil prices tumbled to $60 a barrel from above $100 at their peak, slashing the kingdom's revenues. By the time 79-year-old King Salman acceded to the throne, projects commissioned in the boom years were becoming a burden. These included a Riyadh financial district, an airport in Jeddah and an economic city on the Red Sea coast.</p> \n<p>Salman quickly appointed Prince Mohammed, a previously little-known son, as deputy crown prince. Mohammed also took control of the kingdom's important economic and defence portfolios.</p> \n<p>As a teenager, Prince Mohammed had regularly attended meetings with his father, Riyadh's governor at the time, but left little impression, said a former senior Western diplomat. But Salman saw in the boy qualities he prized, according to&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;and Western sources. &quot;Clever, rugged, understands the locals,&quot; said one Western policy adviser. Other princes went abroad, but Prince Mohammed stayed in&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia, earning a law degree and investing in the Riyadh stock market. By the time Salman became king, the young prince was sitting in on meetings with foreign officials and silently communicating with his father via iPad, the former Western diplomat said.</p> \n<p>Reform-minded and ambitious, Prince Mohammed was keen to challenge the status quo. He introduced changes to streamline government, diversify the economy and cut costs, including slashing construction spending. One of the new government's first moves in 2015 was to order a review of state contracts, with a focus on the big projects on which&nbsp;SaudiBinladin Group depended, said two sources.</p> \n<p>Asked about the results of this review, the senior government official said, &quot;The government is keen to review all projects, including those contracts that may have a suspicion of corruption or negligence in their sites.&quot;</p> \n<p>Prince Mohammed encouraged&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group to sell shares in an initial public offering, according to seven sources familiar with the discussions, part of efforts to develop the kingdom's capital markets. The Bin Ladens had previously shelved IPO plans begun in 2011, worried that they would not get a good price in a stock market battered by low oil prices, and put off by the red tape involved in a share issue. The family was reluctant to revive the idea in 2015, when market conditions were worse, these seven sources said.</p> \n<p>Asked to comment, the senior government official denied that Prince Mohammed had promoted the idea that&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group should sell shares in an IPO.</p> \n<p>Then, in September 2015, a construction crane owned by&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group collapsed in Mecca's Grand Mosque, killing 107 people just before the start of Islam's annual haj pilgrimage. The government moved against the company, suspending it from receiving new state contracts and barring its board members and senior executives from traveling abroad. It also ordered the Finance Ministry to review the firm's existing projects, citing unspecified &quot;shortcomings.&quot;</p> \n<p>A senior&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group executive and a source close to the family said the crane accident gave the government an opening to act against the firm. The executive said&nbsp;SaudiBinladin Group wasn't responsible for the site at the time - the work fell under the supervision of local authorities in Mecca. The senior government official disputed this, saying it was standard practice that the contractor supervised the site. A legal case over the incident was still pending, he added.</p> \n<p>The Bin Laden family &quot;took the slap on the hand and accepted it,&quot; the executive said. &quot;They would never speak out against the king or the crown prince. They are loyal servants.&quot;</p> \n<p>The family tried to limit the damage. Bakr sent a letter to brother Saleh formally handing him responsibility for the company, hoping that a change of management would placate the government, according to two people who saw the letter. But the plan didn't work. As payments from the state dried up,&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group's finances deteriorated and it stopped paying tens of thousands of its workers, leading to riots. By mid-2016, much of the group's construction work was stalled, including at projects essential to Prince Mohammed's reform plans.</p> \n<p>Again the Bin Ladens tried to defuse the situation.&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group hired dozens of finance and management professionals from overseas, including former Morgan Stanley banker Klaus Froehlich as chief financial officer. Froehlich, who remains CFO, came armed with years of experience in&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;deal making. He also had ties to Mohammed al-Jadaan, who would soon be appointed finance minister, two sources said. Al-Jadaan did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>Creditors who had been struggling to reach&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group during its crisis said communication improved after Froehlich arrived. Government payments started coming through again. Financial pressure eased. The company also put plans for a public stock offering back on the table, bowing to state pressure to &quot;recycle&quot; some of the money it had made over the decades back into the kingdom, according to six people familiar with the plans. It appeared that relations between the Bin Ladens and the government were on the mend.</p> \n<p>But the detente would not last long.&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia was careening toward a recession, and market conditions for a listing were worsening. To the government's irritation, the stock offering plans stalled again because of this deteriorating environment. &quot;The rulers and MbS saw [the Bin Ladens] as a leech sucking the lifeblood out of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia but offering nothing in return,&quot; said one person who had worked on the company's restructuring. &quot;They ran out of patience.&quot;</p> \n<p>In June 2017, Prince Mohammed replaced his cousin, security chief Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir apparent, further centralising the levers of power. More than ever, Prince Mohammed was in a position to do something about the Bin Ladens.</p> \n<p>DOWNFALL</p> \n<p>On the night of Nov. 4, 2017,&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;authorities detained Bakr bin Laden in Jeddah along with more than 200 other members of the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;elite, in what officials said was a crackdown on corruption. Dozens of Bin Laden family members, including the brothers' children, had their bank accounts frozen and were banned from travelling abroad, said associates of the family. Brothers who were abroad at the time were recalled to the kingdom.</p> \n<p>For Bakr, it was the beginning of a detention that has lasted more than 10 months. Like many others, he was first held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh. So were his brothers Saleh and Saad, fellow major shareholders. Other Bin Laden brothers - Omar, Ahmed, Mohammed, Abdullah and Yehya among them - were brought to the hotel for shorter periods, according to four family associates.</p> \n<p>The purge affected royals, ministers and business leaders. The Bin Laden family's hometown of Jeddah, once the economic capital of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia, was particularly hard hit. Many of the city's merchant families had maintained close relationships with previous kings; few of them were spared in the crackdown.</p> \n<p>The government publicly has not said precisely why the Bin Ladens - or any of the other individuals caught up in the anti-corruption campaign - were detained. King Salman said at the time the purge was in response to &quot;exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.&quot;</p> \n<p>Two sources said the Bin Laden brothers received little attention in the hotel and were left alone in their rooms watching TV and eating room service. One family associate said a younger brother told him he was never informed why he was there, had no access to a lawyer and was barely visited by interrogators. Like others in the Ritz, they were made to keep the doors to their rooms open and a doctor came to check on them regularly. Authorities also employed a notary to facilitate the changing of power of attorney on assets. One brother described it bluntly to a friend upon his release: &quot;It was a shitty experience.&quot;</p> \n<p>Asked to comment, the senior government official referred Reuters to statements issued at the time by the kingdom's Attorney General. These statements said suspects had &quot;the same rights and treatment as any other&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;citizen.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and everyone's legal rights will be preserved,&quot; Attorney General Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb said on Nov. 5, 2017.</p> \n<p>The Ritz was cleared of prisoners in late January but Bakr is still in detention in Riyadh, able to receive visits only from his immediate family members, according to five people familiar with the situation. Asked about Bakr's whereabouts and the status of the investigation, the senior government official referred Reuters to the Attorney General. The Attorney General did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>The other brothers are at home in Jeddah, but keeping a low profile. Saleh, the most gregarious, has returned to playing card games with friends, said one acquaintance. Stripped of many of his assets, including a palace in Jeddah bestowed by King Abdullah, he has been visiting banks to ask for help, according to one lender. &quot;He's putting a brave face on,&quot; the lender said.</p> \n<p>Authorities seized the title deeds to the homes of senior brothers, including Bakr's villa overlooking the Red Sea, as part of settlements for their release, four sources said. The state also took private jets, cash, jewelry and Saad's $90 million automobile collection, which included limited edition Ferraris and other rare Italian cars, said two sources. Bakr's son Nawaf was relieved of every Maserati in his personal showroom.</p> \n<p>Asked to comment, the senior government official referred Reuters to the Attorney General's Office. It did not respond. In a statement at the time of the Ritz detentions, Attorney General Saud Al Mojeb estimated that corruption and embezzlement had cost&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia at least $100 billion over several decades. In Dec. 2017, he said most detainees faced with corruption allegations had agreed to a &quot;settlement,&quot; involving assets including real estate, cash and securities.</p> \n<p>THE TAKEOVER</p> \n<p>The core of the Bin Laden family's settlement with the government involved the conglomerate itself.</p> \n<p>On April 23, the government finalised the transfer of 36.2 percent of the company, representing the shares held by Bakr, Saleh and Saad, to an entity called Istidama Holding Company, according to a Commerce Ministry document reviewed by Reuters. Two people who have dealt with Istidama said it was set up by the Ministry of Finance to park the proceeds of settlements agreed between the government and individuals detained in the corruption purge. The senior government official confirmed to Reuters that the Ministry of Finance owns Istidama. There are no public filings about Istidama because it is not a listed firm, and Reuters was unable to contact the company.</p> \n<p>The government established a five-man committee to oversee the running of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group. Its members include Abdulrehman al-Harkan, a former chief executive of Riyadh-based developer Dar Al Arkan; Khaled Nahas, a board member of petrochemical producer&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Basic Industries Corp; and Khalid al-Khowaiter, chief financial officer at Advanced Electronics Company, a state-established technology firm. These government appointees are considered by many close to the company to be a front for the rulers. &quot;The bottom line is that the government has taken over,&quot; said one banker in Jeddah.</p> \n<p>Harkan, Nahas and Khowaiter did not respond to requests for comment. The senior government official said the supervisory committee was &quot;an independent committee that represents the interests of all partners.&quot;</p> \n<p>The remaining two-thirds of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group are still held by 15 younger Bin Laden brothers, according to the Commerce Ministry document. Two family representatives were appointed to the oversight committee - Yehya, who ran the back office, and Abdullah, a Harvard-educated lawyer who handled the conglomerate's interests in the United States. Several sources interpreted their inclusion as a token gesture by the government. The brothers and their representatives did not respond to requests for comment.</p> \n<p>The void left by the family's diminished role was filled by Harkan, the developer, who reports to the royal court and to Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan, according to the group executive. As chairman of the committee and the effective head of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group, Harkan was involved in securing an 11 billion riyal ($3 billion) loan from the Ministry of Finance in April. He has also met with creditors, primarily local banks, to offer reassurances about the group's future. Harkan told those present that the company was a &quot;mess and hopelessly insolvent,&quot; but that he had been appointed by King Salman to lead its turnaround, said one attendee. To the incredulity of some of those listening, Harkan also explained the brothers were &quot;relieved to be absolved of their responsibilities.&quot;</p> \n<p>Despite those assurances, the company's future remains uncertain. As Harkan has told creditors, plans drawn up after Froehlich was hired will be dusted off. The estimated 537 companies that make up the conglomerate, from construction to energy, will be broken up and the name of the company changed to distance it from the Bin Laden legacy.</p> \n<p>Also at issue is money owed to&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group. After the Ritz detentions, what one source described as an &quot;army of accountants&quot; began combing through the company's books, trying to make sense of the government's liabilities to the firm. A person close to the family gauged it at nearly $40 billion. A company director estimated the amount was smaller. The senior government official said the government had no liabilities to the firm, but there were &quot;some disputed payments among several government agencies that are being addressed.&quot;</p> \n<p>LIFE AFTER THE BIN LADENS</p> \n<p>Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group has 93 projects in hand and ties to 1,400 subcontractors, but most of its work is on hold. The company is focusing its efforts on delivering one massive project, commissioned by Prince Mohammed. The project is NEOM, a $500 billion business zone on the Red Sea coast that is the centrepiece of Mohammed's vision for a modern, dynamicSaudi&nbsp;Arabia. The city will have its own legal system designed to attract international investors in high tech industries such as biotechnology, advanced manufacturing and tourism.</p> \n<p>But the first buildings commissioned at the site were more traditional - opulent seaside palaces. These included a replica of the palace that&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group completed for King Salman in Tangier, Morocco, said three sources, one of them working at the site. According to a project design document reviewed by Reuters, the site has palaces for the king, Prince Mohammed and his brother Prince Turki, as well as smaller villas for other royal brothers and &quot;family princes.&quot; Landscaped with fountains and flowering trees, the complex will also feature three helipads, a marina and a golf course.</p> \n<p>Contracts for the palaces originally went to other&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;construction firms. But according to the source at the project site and two other sources, those companies were unable to handle the scale and speed of the project.</p> \n<p>Tens of thousands of Binladin workers were diverted from other projects around the country. They worked 24/7 at breakneck pace to deliver, toiling through the sweltering summer months, said three sources. Grass planted outside the palaces did not grow quickly enough for the Aug. 1 deadline, so the workers had to replace it with artificial turf before the royal arrival. The senior government official confirmed that a subsidiary of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group was involved in the building work.</p> \n<p>Prince Mohammed took regular flights around the project to survey its progress, according to four people familiar with the matter. Two of them said he has taken charge of marketing NEOM himself, bringing in prospective investors for official tours and alcohol-free parties. At the end of July, he and the king moved to the unfinished complex for their summer holiday. With no other structures on site, trailing cabinet members and business leaders stayed on yachts or in the nearby town of Sharma.</p> \n<p>Once again, the kingdom needed the knowhow of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Binladin Group.</p>",

The other man, 27, of Kiryat Shmona, died of massive organ failure in hospital a few hours after he was admitted.</p> \n<p>A 20-year-old man at the rave was taken to the hospital with moderate injuries, as was a young woman who fell and sustained slight injuries to her face.</p> \n<p>The Upper Galilee Regional Council said that the festival’s producers had obtained the necessary permits for the event “only after all conditions set by the police, fire department and health and security agencies had been met.” However, the council added, “a tragedy like the one that happened today is the reason we decided about a month ago not to allow many more mass parties like this in our council’s jurisdiction.”</p> \n<p>“Like in all parties in nature, there were lots of people who did drugs,” a woman who attended the festival told Haaretz. She added that she had heard about the deaths only from the internet and from messages, but that the party had ended several hours early. Several other people said that the police had told them to pack up their belongings and leave because the festival was ending early due to an unusual event.</p> \n<p>Among the musicians performing at Neverland – staged for the eighth consecutive year – were the local acts Infected Mushroom, Bliss and Astral Projection and quite a few international performers. The organizers described the event as “celebrating the psychedelic journey of each person individually and collectively. We celebrate the connection to roots, the sense of tribe, mutual responsibility and service to the community and of course the celebration of progress that planet earth has to offer.”</p> \n<p>Last year, a young woman, Tohar David, died at an outdoor rave party in the south. The investigation concluded that she had struck her head and collapsed and a delay in calling for help led to her death, a few days later. According to testimony by party-goers released in August, a DJ suggested giving David cocaine to stabilize her: “I said they could give her four lines because they say cocaine cancels out the effects of drugs taken before,” he said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“I’ve been in Israel for over 10 years, I went to school here, I speak and think in Hebrew. I barely remember the Congo, and now in four months from now they tell me that I have to go back there? I have a family that’s still living there, and they talk about rape and murders on a daily basis. If we return there we have no future, I can’t believe the decision,” says D., a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo in his twenties.</p> \n<p>He’s afraid of harassment by the government (in Congo or in Israel) if he reveals his identity. “If the situation in Congo were safe I would like to return to my homeland, but I’m afraid. Why do a few hundred people bother Israel so much? How can the government say that it’s safe for us to return there?”</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>D.’s question is hard to answer. Haaretz has learned that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees opposes the decision, saying that they were not consulted. The UNHCR says that no other countries have removed their protection from citizens of the violent country, and they believe that the situation will worsen due to upcoming elections. Scholars and experts called the decision “surprising” and feared that it’s a political decision that may endanger the lives of the returnees.</p> \n<p>The Israeli foreign and interior ministries say that the reasons for the change in policy are secret and refused to explain it.</p> \n<p>The dry figures speak for themselves. There are about 750,000 asylum seekers and refugees from Congo and over 4 million displaced persons forced to flee from their homes there. Most are staying in neighboring countries such as Angola, Burundi, Kenya, Uganda and South Africa, with many others in European countries such as Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, England and France. In Israel there are between 400 and 600 people from Congo, most of whom entered legally via Ben-Gurion Airport, and submitted requests for asylum.</p> \n<p>For 15 years, since 2003, Israel has provided them temporary protection, but this week Interior Minister Arye Dery, in consultation with the Foreign Ministry, decided that there’s nothing to prevent deporting them back to their homeland.</p> \n<p>Sharon Harel, a senior representative of the UNHCR in Israel, said: “We believe that the present situation in the DRC proves that the time is not ripe to remove protection from its citizens. The security situation has been deteriorating since early 2018, with interethnic and political tensions leading to a 16 percent increase in the number of displaced persons and a renewal of the emergency situation.</p> \n<p>“The flight of the population also increased due to the renewed outbreak of the Ebola virus in August, which remains unchecked due to the security situation,” Harel continued. “Alternative living arrangements within the country are unfeasible. If we add the presidential elections, which are scheduled for December and are usually accompanied by political and economic instability, violence and fights over resources, we get a gloomy picture of a vulnerable country that cannot protect its citizens. There have been no non-violent changes in the government since its independence in 1960.</p> \n<p>The UNHCR explained that cancelling protection for foreign nationals requires a substantial change in circumstances in their home country, which hasn’t happened in this case. “We are unaware of any country that rescinded the protection given to citizens of the DRC,” said Harel.</p> \n<p>“Had the decision makers consulted the UNHCR about the decision to end protection, we would have expressed our opinion and our concern,” Harel added. “We will continue to discuss the issue with our colleagues in the Interior Ministry with a request for clarification, and further explanation of our instructions regarding the situation in the country and the way other countries are treating the possibility of return.”</p> \n<p>Dr. Irit Back, head of the African Studies program at Tel Aviv University, also believes that the situation in the country may become more rather than less dangerous. “I assume that the decision is not based on academic research, but is more populist and political. The situation there is very unstable, with one of the worst wars in the world. There’s no indication of an improvement: not in politics, not in the economy, not in people’s safety. Before the elections the situation will probably worsen. This is a less significant group in terms of numbers, so maybe it’s a kind of ‘pilot’ project for deportation before deporting other groups. Israel’s motives are not clear and are liable to endanger this population.”</p> \n<p>Dr. Yaron Salman, a lecturer at Ben Gurion University and an expert on internal conflicts and civil wars, also provides a pessimistic picture of the DRC’s future. “I don’t see the crisis in Congo ending in the foreseeable future. It’s a huge country, with abundant natural resources but very poor. There has been political instability there for decades, one reason being the refusal of the president, who has been serving since 2001, to vacate his seat.</p> \n<p>“The official security services inflict serious violence on anyone considered an opposition, and the president manages to postpone the election repeatedly,” Salmon said. “There are millions of displaced persons every year who flee their homes for fear of the government forces. In light of that I predict that either the election will be postponed again or the president will find a way to stay in power. These processes will undoubtedly lead to further violence, and the Israeli decision didn’t necessarily take into account the political instability in the country. The motives for the decision are unclear to me, to put it mildly. I find it a surprising decision. Anyone returning there can expect a very unclear and gloomy future.”</p> \n<p>D. and his family, like many citizens of Congo, requested asylum when they entered Israel years ago, and have yet to receive a reply. “For years they’ve renewed our temporary status while examining our requests. We thought it means that in the end we’ll receive refugee status here, not that in the end they would deport us without preparation,” he said.</p> \n<p>D.’s request for asylum is one of 208 from Congo nationals in Israel (sometimes a request is made on behalf of two people) that have been sitting with the population authority for years without any decision on them being made. But the Interior Ministry will have to decide on these requests by January, since a person whose request for asylum has not been answered cannot be deported.</p> \n<p>Sigal Rozen, public policy coordinator at the Hotline for&nbsp;Refugees and Migrants, which has assisted the Congolese here for years, said: “The vast majority of the small Congolese community has found a tolerable refuge in Israel in the past two decades. Although they haven’t received refugee status, they haven’t suffered from harassment and government decrees like the refugees of the slaughter in Darfur and the oppressive dictatorship in Eritrea. We won’t allow the government to deport, within three months, asylum seekers who have been unable to receive a reply to their requests for asylum for over a decade. That’s while the despot [Joseph] Kabila, from whom they fled, still rules in Congo, and it’s not clear whether he’ll agree to vacate his seat after the election if defeated.”</p> \n<p>The Hotline is demanding that the population authority examine all pending requests for asylum by Congolese nationals, saying the indecision is a failure of responsibility on the part of the authority, which is demanding that they return to a dangerous country.</p> \n<p>A., a woman of 28 who has been living here since 2001 with her family, says the Congolese community in Israel has been frightened since getting the news. “People are crying, don’t know what to do, what will happen to them. We hope the government will change its decision,” she said. A., her siblings and her parents are one of seven cases in which Congolese nationals received refugee status from the interior ministry, so that they cannot be deported in January. She studied in schools and college in Israel and now works for a large Israeli company. But even among those few who received refugee status and settled in Israel, there is great fear. Says A.:</p> \n<p>“My little brothers speak only Hebrew. I’ve lived in Israel longer than in Congo. We escaped because my father had anti-government views and saw his friends being murdered one after another. He knew that we were next if we didn’t run away. You can’t speak against the government there without endangering your life. Women walking in the street are raped every day, there are murderers and robbers. My grandmother and cousins are still there and they tell me how terrible the situation is. Although we have refugee status, we have to get it renewed it every year. I’m afraid that next year they won’t renew it.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>A&nbsp;second major U.S. Jewish charity has acknowledged to the Forward that it funded the Israeli charity that appears to run Canary Mission, the online blacklist of student activists that the Israeli government has used to&nbsp;interrogate&nbsp;and&nbsp;detain&nbsp;U.S. citizens.</p> \n<p>Between November of 2016 and September of 2017, the Jewish Community Foundation of Los Angeles, one of the largest Jewish charities in the country, made a series of grants totaling $250,000 to Megamot Shalom, the Israeli not-for-profit organization that the Forward has&nbsp;identified&nbsp;as the likely operator of Canary Mission. The foundation now says that it will not fund Megamot Shalom in the future.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israeli spy firm in Mueller probe first attempted to undermine BDS movement&nbsp;■&nbsp;Revealed: Canary Mission blacklist Is secretly bankrolled by major Jewish federation ■&nbsp;Official documents prove: Israel bans young Americans based on Canary Mission website&nbsp;■ San Francisco Jewish Federation also funding far-right fringe groups</p> \n<p>Canary Mission operated in absolute secrecy for three years while posting political dossiers on more than a thousand undergraduates, most of them involved in pro-Palestinian activism. The site says that it intends to damage the students’ job prospects. The Forward has reported that Israeli border guards reference Canary Mission&nbsp;during interrogations, and in October, Haaretz&nbsp;showed&nbsp;that the Israeli government had cited a Canary Mission dossier in an official document used to bar a U.S. student from entering Israel.</p> \n<p>The Los Angeles foundation is now the second major U.S. Jewish charity linked to Canary Mission, following a&nbsp;report&nbsp;last week in the Forward that a foundation controlled by the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco,&nbsp;another of the largest&nbsp;Jewish charities in the U.S., made a $100,000 grant to support the website in 2016.</p> \n<p>Evidence is now building that major Jewish institutions with hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, and boards of directors that include prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community, have played a significant role in bankrolling the site.</p> \n<p>Two other large Jewish charities, the New York City-based Jewish Communal Fund and the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County, declined to respond to specific questions about whether they have funded Canary Mission.</p> \n<p>In addition to tying the Jewish establishment to a hardline attack on pro-Palestinian students, these revelations suggest that some large Jewish organizations are exercising little oversight over grants made using financial instrument like donor advised funds and supporting foundations, which they offer in order to provide tax benefits to wealthy donors. All of the known grants to Canary Mission went through such vehicles, which allow donors to suggest grants to be made with funds that the charities legally control.</p> \n<p>“A lot of people in the federation world shake their heads at the supporting foundations and the level of oversight over grant-making that the federations are exercising,” one federation official, who asked not to be named to discuss sensitive issues, told the Forward.</p> \n<p>Mystery Donor</p> \n<p>The grants from the Los Angeles foundation to Megamot Shalom were made at the advice of a donor whose identity the foundation would not disclose. They were made through the foundation’s donor advised fund, a&nbsp;philanthropic device&nbsp;that allows wealthy individuals to park assets at the charity. While donors to a donor advised fund can suggest how their gifts should be used, the assets belong to the charity, and the charity must approve all grant recommendations.</p> \n<p>The Forward has not received a response to questions it asked the Los Angeles foundation to submit to the donor.</p> \n<p>The foundation, which has net assets of $726 million, operates a large donor advised fund and controls more than three dozen other supporting organizations, many of which have millions more in assets. It has historical and institutional ties to the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, the central Jewish fundraising organization in Los Angeles. Though the two organizations are located in the same building, they have separate boards of directors and separate management.</p> \n<p>The foundation said in a statement that, following the Forward’s inquiry, there would be “no further distributions to Megamot Shalom at this time.”</p> \n<p>The foundation’s internal notes on the grants to Megamot Shalom do not mention Canary Mission. “The notes accompanying each of these four grants indicate simply that they were made ‘to Megamot Shalom to fight anti-Semitism,’” a spokesman for the foundation wrote in an email. It’s not clear why the foundation did not require more information before approving the grant.</p> \n<p>Little is known about Megamot Shalom, or “Peace Trends.” An Israeli not-for-profit organization, it was virtually unknown until early October, when the Forward first connected it to the Canary Mission website. The address that Megamot Shalom has on file with Israel’s charity registrar is a&nbsp;uninhabited-looking building&nbsp;in Beit Shemesh, a city near Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>While one board member of Megamot Shalom has told the Forward that he is not familiar with Canary Mission, evidence points to Megamot Shalom operating the blacklisting website. Two people have&nbsp;separately told the Forward&nbsp;that Jonathan Bash, the British-born rabbi who registered Megamot Shalom in late 2015, told them that he is in charge of Canary Mission. Bash has not responded to queries from the Forward about Megamot Shalom. Further, U.S. tax filings by the foundation that made the $100,000 grant in support of Megamot Shalom in 2016 directly linked it to Canary Mission.</p> \n<p>Megamot Shalom’s own filings with the Israeli charity registrar closely match the operations of Canary Mission. The organization says in its filings that its mission is to use digital media to protect the image of the state of Israel against the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. As of the end of 2016, it employed a dozen people; staff have included an editor, a writer/researcher, and a social media specialist.</p> \n<p>More Questions</p> \n<p>The Forward asked the fifteen largest Jewish federations in the U.S. whether they had funded Megamot Shalom or Canary Mission, either directly or through an intermediary like the&nbsp;Central Fund of Israel, a New York-based charity that has routed funds to Megamot Shalom.</p> \n<p>U.S. charities are not required to identify the recipients of foreign grants in their public tax filings. Since Megamot Shalom is based in Israel, its name would not necessarily appear in the publicly available records of a U.S. charity that had sent it money.</p> \n<p>The large federations, which raise and disburse charitable gifts collectively for their local Jewish communities, each have annual budgets that can reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and often sit at the center of a network of related charities and supporting foundations. Thirteen of the largest federations, based in cities including New York, Chicago, Cleveland, and Atlanta, told the Forward that they had not funded Canary Mission.</p> \n<p>Another federation, Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston, said that their policy was not to comment on grants made through their donor advised funds. A review of the Boston federations’ tax filings suggests that it is highly unlikely that the organization funded Canary Mission. Megamot Shalom does not appear in its tax filings; it made no grants to the Central Fund of Israel; and it made very few grants overseas. Its supporting foundations are focused on local causes.</p> \n<p>The Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach, however, was far less transparent. The organization would not comment on how the donor advised funds it manages had disbursed their grants, and the charity has withheld key information in its public tax filings. While the Internal Revenue Service’s tax forms require that charities list the recipient of each grant they make inside the U.S., the South Palm Beach federation does not do so. Instead, in its most recent tax filings, it reported a grant of $2.3 million to “various grants and allocations - available upon request.” It reported a similar disbursement in the prior tax year for $2.4 million.</p> \n<p>The Forward made that request multiple times, but the South Palm Beach federation did not respond, and would not say whether any of those undisclosed grants had benefited Canary Mission, either directly or indirectly. “It is our practice and good governance to refrain from commenting on philanthropic disbursements from our Donor Advised Funds,” Matt Levin, the federation’s president and CEO, wrote in an email.</p> \n<p>In addition to asking large federations if they had supported Canary Mission, the Forward put the same question to the Jewish Communal Fund, a New York-based Jewish charity similar in structure to the Jewish Community Foundation of Los Angeles. It operates a major donor advised fund, and is possibly the largest Jewish charity in the U.S., with assets of more than $1.5 billion. The organization did not respond to multiple queries about whether it had supported Canary Mission.</p> \n<p>In both 2016 and 2017, the Jewish Communal Fund made grants of $1 million to the Central Fund of Israel. The Central Fund serves as a conduit for U.S. grants to hundreds of Israeli charities, including right-wing and extremist groups, and was used by the San Francisco federation’s supporting foundation to send money to Megamot Shalom.</p> \n<p>The Jewish Communal Fund did not respond to a question about whether any of the grants it had made to the Central Fund had been earmarked for Megamot Shalom.</p> \n<p>The Wild West</p> \n<p>As the popularity of donor advised funds has grown massively across the U.S. philanthropic spectrum in recent years, major Jewish institutions have followed suit. Along with so-called supporting foundations, which are stand-alone family charities officially controlled by a parent organization, they now make up a&nbsp;substantial&nbsp;proportion of the assets controlled by the Jewish communal establishment.</p> \n<p>The arrangements offer significant tax advantages to the rich. Jewish communal officials value them as a way to build relationships with wealthy donors, keeping them in contact and opening an avenue to hit them up for support.</p> \n<p>Yet while the Jewish charities legally control both their supporting foundations and the assets in their donor advised funds, many have struggled to exert that control. Donors have the right to recommend how assets in the donor advised funds are disbursed, and have seats on the board of the supporting foundations they create. And while the charities must approve all of the grants from the donor advised funds, and have legal control over the supporting foundations, they are loath to say “no” to their donors.</p> \n<p>A person who advises federations on fundraising issues, and who asked not to be named in order to freely discuss sensitive matters, said that federations fear losing business to the non-Jewish donor advised funds, controlled by major investments firms like Fidelity and Vanguard, which impose no ideological restrictions on the grants they will approve.</p> \n<p>Some federations and community foundations have placed limits on which organizations can receive grants from their donor advised funds and supporting foundations, though those rules have been unevenly enforced. In 2010, the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco&nbsp;adopted&nbsp;guidelines that ban grants to groups that endorse “bigotry, violence or other extremist views,” or groups that participate in the BDS movement. Yet it now says that it strengthened “the implementation” of those guidelines in 2017, and in the process banned grants to the Central Fund of Israel, which its supporting foundation used in 2016 to send money to Canary Mission.</p> \n<p>A federation official, who asked not to be named to discuss sensitive issues, told the Forward that the Central Fund of Israel is “generally not a preferred partner” for Jewish federations. Yet that didn’t stop either the grant from the San Francisco federation’s supporting foundation to the Central Fund in 2016, or the New York’s Jewish Communal Fund’s $1 million grant to the organization in 2017.</p> \n<p>For more stories, go to www.forward.com.

        "text":["<p>When Ahed Tamimi was featured in Vogue, I thought that such an own goal had to be the result of a team effort. If Naftali Bennett, Gilad Erdan, Betzalel Smotrich and Miri Regev weren’t playing wholeheartedly together, perhaps we would have avoided this colossal failure. But the case of Lara Alqasem proves that Israel no longer has to work hard in order to defeat itself.</p> \n<p>Alqasem, 22, has been held for more than a week in the lockup at Ben-Gurion International Airport because she once boycotted some hummus. This disgrace has been reported by The Washington Post, Time magazine, Bloomberg News and even the Toronto Star. How did the security at Ben-Gurion Airport go from being a necessary evil to a Monty Python sketch? Kudos go to Gilad Erdan, the minister for public security, strategic affairs and strange procedures, who apparently decided to bring the war against the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement to the same level of excellence for which the Israel Police is known.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;This is the real game Israel is playing with the BDS movement. It’s terrifying | Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israeli minister should apologize, not the detained American student | Editorial&nbsp;■ Dare to know Lara Alqasem&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A young woman who is seeking to study in Israel is in detention on grounds that she is boycotting Israel, even though she has already declared that she does not support BDS. You have to read that sentence a few times to understand what losing one’s bearings looks like. Credit goes to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and to the Association of University Heads, which are supporting Alqasem. But Erdan has said he would allow her in only if she expresses remorse for having supported a boycott. Erdan, who can read minds, will let the public know when the regret expressed by Public Enemy No. 1 is truly sincere.</p> \n<p>Hanoch Levin, after his play “The Queen of the Bathtub” was shut down following extensive public protest, produced a letter of apology that was prepared for exactly these circumstances. “I erred,” he wrote. “I utilized the principles of democracy and freedom to undermine public morale, to curse and condemn Israel’s wars and to sow hatred and confusion within the united nation.” If that sounds like a confession from a Soviet show trial, it’s no coincidence.</p> \n<p>But Erdan is just the latest participant in the current march of folly. Also to blame is Judge Kobi Vardi, who decided to leave Alqasem in detention “until the claims against her regarding the risk and possible harm to the State of Israel are clarified;” MKs Smotrich, Roy Folkman and Yoav Kish, who sponsored the Boycott Law; all the MKs — save those of Meretz — who prefer to remain silent, as well as journalists who aren’t pushing to get answers about this absurdity.</p> \n<p>I support a boycott of settlement products and oppose a boycott of the state, but I suggest we remember that boycotts are not a security risk, economic terror or diplomatic terror. To argue otherwise is not just an insult to one’s common sense, but also to victims of terror and real security risks. In the cabinet they may be convinced that the inflated use of the terms “security risk” and “terror” accords them the halo of generals, but it mainly looks like the hysteria of kids playing make-believe.</p> \n<p>Israel has a clear interest in fighting any boycott against it, but it should also consider adapting its measures to suit the cause. The arrest of young women will not eliminate the boycott movement, but rather fuel it, and questioning opponents of the occupation at Ben-Gurion Airport does not further Israel’s reputation. This isn’t new; it is self-evident. But in Israel today even stating the obvious has become radical. There is no clearer indication than this of the nation’s state of mind after a decade under the regime of Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A moment before he sets the polls on fire, shakes up the system and captures the hearts of voters, it might be worth recalling just who Benny Gantz is. The center-left has already embraced him, just as it embraces any vacuum. Soon he’ll surround himself with a dream lineup, with urban social activists, an enlightened rabbi, a brave battalion commander, a few women and a token Ethiopian. A new Yair Lapid is born, taller and no less charming than he.</p> \n<p>The pundits like to write about the “nothing” that the public knows about his positions. Middle-of-the-roaders generally have no positions except for “both this and that” and a few slogans. But there are a few things we actually do know about Gantz, that everyone is ignoring. Israelis won’t pardon a rape committed decades ago, but they pardon war crimes in advance.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Gantz was the chief of staff during some of the military’s most horrific operations, the worst of which was Operation Protective Edge. This sympathetic figure, the model of Israeli moderation and restraint, who stood with the good guys against bombing Iran, has a great deal of blood on his hands, much of it the blood of innocents. No one is holding him accountable for this; after all, he’s a nice guy, “one of ours.” He would never express himself in a sickening manner like Yoav Galant (“The best of serpents — crush its head”). He represents the ethical, humane and moral Israel Defense Forces, the pretty face from Kfar Ahim, the way we like it.</p> \n<p>The 20th chief of staff could speak about morality and fought fiercely against religious coercion in the army. But in the guise of moderation, he led the military and Israel to the lowest moral nadir, particularly in his last year in the post, the black year 2014. Before we start delighting in him, we must not forget.</p> \n<p>It began with Operation Brother’s Keeper. Under Gantz’s command and with pressure from the settlers, the IDF launched one of the most disproportionate revenge operations ever, in response to the kidnapping and murder of the three yeshiva students in Gush Etzion. Over 400 Palestinians were arrested in that retaliatory wave, including 50 who’d been released in the deal for Gilad Shalit, the overwhelming majority of whom had nothing to do with the abduction and murder. The road to rockets being fired into Israel from the Gaza Strip was short, as short as the path to Operation Protective Edge, one of the IDF’s most brutal campaigns ever. Over 500 Palestinian children were killed, including 180 infants and toddler, as well as some 250 women and more than 100 old people: 2,202 fatalities, most of them noncombatants, and hundreds of thousands of people forced to leave their homes.</p> \n<p>Gantz didn’t think this was so terrible. About one of the vilest attacks, on Gaza City’s Shujaiyeh neighborhood, on July 19-20, he said, “We used our power in the most controlled way possible.” These were the results: In the first blow, the IDF within hours killed 40 residents and wounded 400. As controlled as possible. On the 120 targets in the neighborhood, most of them slum apartments, the IDF dropped 1-ton bombs. This, too, was highly controlled.</p> \n<p>And we haven’t yet mentioned “Black Friday,” August 1-2, the most serious war crime committed under the command of the warrior pure of arms. After the body of 1st Lt. Hadar Goldin was snatched, the Hannibal directive was issued. The battle in Rafah was fierce; 2,000 missiles, mortar shells and bombs were dropped on neighborhoods. Over 100 people were killed, most of them civilians. “You’re shooting like crazy people,” the Samson’s Foxes Brigade commander yelled into the radio. Amnesty International says it was a war crime.</p> \n<p>From Gantz, silence. The army closed the “investigation” into Black Friday only this year and of course no one was prosecuted. Why, what happened? Who died?</p> \n<p>Gaza still hasn’t recovered from its bereavement, its grief, its wounds or its ruins. Crimes have perpetrators and culprits. The chief of staff at the time, Benny Gantz, is now the great white moderate hope to replace the monster Netanyahu and the right. Once again, something to look forward to.</p>",

        "text":["<p>God goes by many names in the Bible, but he only has one personal name, spelled using four letters - YHWH. It truly has&nbsp;become an ineffable name: we know neither how it was pronounced in antiquity, or what it meant.</p> \n<p>The practical reason for the mystery of its original pronunciation is that Hebrew is written without vowels. Technically, almost any combination of vowel sounds could have been used with those consonants, thus many different pronunciations are possible.</p> \n<p>The other reason is more spiritual. The pronunciation of other biblical words were meticulously preserved for us by an unbroken chain of tradition passed on orally from generation to generation, until eventually it was put down in writing in Tiberias in the 10th century C.E. by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, who refined the system of diacritic marks that Hebrew still uses to indicate vowel sounds.</p> \n<p>But, this was not the case with the name of God.</p> \n<p>This may seem odd. Why would the Jews preserve the pronunciation of all other words in the Bible but neglect to preserve the pronunciation of the one most important word, which appears in the Bible some 6,600 times - the name of God himself?</p> \n<p>The reason is that during the Second Temple period, most likely in the early 5th century B.C.E., Jews decided that that name was ineffable, too holy to be uttered aloud. This was based on a particular interpretation of the third commandment, “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.”</p> \n<p>The commandment probably intended, at its origin, merely to prohibit inappropriate invocation of God’s name, when swearing and the like, but during this time it began to be viewed as a prohibition against uttering the name in all but the most solemn of circumstances.</p> \n<p>According to the Mishnah (redacted in 200 C.E. but containing ancient traditions going back hundreds of years), the sacred name was only to be pronounced in the Temple in Jerusalem, and only in very specific occasions - by the High Priest on Yom Kippur and when the priests sanctified the crowds with the Priestly Blessing.</p> \n<p>When the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 C.E. by Rome, to punish the Jews for their latest rebellion, there was no longer any context in which the uttering of God’s name was permissible. Since then, to this day, when the name YHWH arises during prayer or recitation outside the Temple, Jews read it aloud as 'adonai, meaning “my lord.” Thus the true pronunciation was eventually lost.</p> \n<p>Still, linguists and biblical scholars have come up with a likely reconstruction based on ancient transcriptions, information gleaned from theophoric names, comparative material, and Hebrew grammar. The details of these analyses are too technical and frankly boring to even summarize here, but the upshot is that in all likelihood, in biblical times, the name was pronounced yah-weh, with soft a and soft (and slightly elongated) e.</p> \n<p>The meaning of YHWH&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Moving on from its missing pronunciation, what did the name YHWH mean?</p> \n<p>Hebrew words, or words of any other Semitic language, usually have three-letter roots. Analysis of Semitic words starts with that trilateral root, which appears in other words with related meanings.</p> \n<p>This is, at a very basic level, how Hebrew and other Semitic languages work. The root has a basic meaning, which gains specific meanings with the addition of other sounds (consonants and vowels).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Take for instance the root SRK: masrek means comb, lehistarek means to comb (one's hair), saruk is the passive past tense, combed; srika means medical scan -&nbsp; combing through your innards, and so on.</p> \n<p>In the case of god, the trilateral root seems to be HWH.</p> \n<p>If this is true, and it probably is, the root HWH is likely a variant of the very common Hebrew root HYH. It is very common in Hebrew for W and Y to interchange. HYH simply means “being.”</p> \n<p>Also, the format of the name YHWH is similar to that of causative verbs, verbs that indicate the subject is causing a change in the verb’s object, such as English’s spill or hire. So, if we accept the root as HWH or HYH, and assume it has causative structure - taken together, the name seems to mean “bring into being.” Or, “creator.”</p> \n<p>This interpretation is supported to a certain extent by the Bible itself.</p> \n<p>Who are you?</p> \n<p>When God reveals himself to Moses in a burning bush (Exodus 3), Moses asks him what his name is.</p> \n<p>&quot;Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?&quot;</p> \n<p>God answers “I Am that I Am,&quot; and adds,</p> \n<p>&quot;Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you.”</p> \n<p>That “I am” repeated three times in this verse is ehyeh – again, from the root that means &quot;being.&quot;</p> \n<p>This means that at least the person who wrote this story understood God’s name to be related to &quot;being&quot;.</p> \n<p>Still, not all scholars accept this etymology. And there have been many other proposals.</p> \n<p>According to one very unlikely theory, the name is not Semitic in origin at all - it stems from the same proto-Indo-European word for god that gave Latin &quot;Jupiter&quot; and Greek &quot;Zeus.&quot;</p> \n<p>Somewhat more probable is the theory that connects YHWH with the Arabic verb haw, meaning “blow,” which would be fitting for a storm god; or the theory that the name arises from a hypothetical Ugaritic root HWY, which might have carried the meaning “speak.”</p> \n<p>Yet another theory has it that the name was formed from two Arabic words: ya, a short word used to indicate you are talking to a person (e.g., you tack it on before a name of a person you are addressing – as in &quot;Ya George, light the fire&quot;) and huwa, meaning, &quot;he.&quot;</p> \n<p>Whatever the name's meaning and however it was pronounced in the past, today the word itself is rarely written in Hebrew outside scripture and prayer. Modern written references to the deity in Hebrew take various forms and abbreviations. The most common is ה׳.</p> \n<p>However written, the name of God is considered so holy that once it appears on a page, it may not be erased, nor may the page be destroyed or thrown out in the trash. It must be deposited in a special synagogue archive called a genizah, or buried in a cemetery.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, as we said, we lost the original pronunciation of God's name because it is too holy to say aloud. But nowadays, even the euphemism used in its stead, adonai, is considered too holy to be uttered outside of a liturgical setting. So new euphemisms have arisen, the most common being: hakadosh baruch hu (“the holy one blessed be he”) and hashem (“the name”). Whatever that name may be.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Beita and Yonadav Ben Lulu, both 24, from Kiryat Shmona, arriving from India</p> \n<p>Hello. Where are you coming from?</p> \n<p>Beita: India. We were there for three weeks.</p> \n<p>And what do you do in life?</p> \n<p>Beita: I just finished an education degree at Tel-Hai College.</p> \n<p>Yonadav: I’m about to start studying political science. I want to deal with the public sector and work at government ministries.</p> \n<p>Why India?</p> \n<p>Yonadav: India was my dream. I had heard so much about it. It’s not that there was something specific, some unusual landscape or special body of water, but still, I had heard that it’s special.</p> \n<p>Beita: It was my second time. I was there two years ago with two girlfriends.</p> \n<p>So where did you go?</p> \n<p>Yonadav: We were in Dharamshala, Kasol, Rishikesh and Manali.</p> \n<p>All of that in three weeks?</p> \n<p>Beita: We managed to do a lot in a short time. We were in Dharamshala on Rosh Hashanah. There were 1,000 Israelis there.</p> \n<p>Yonadav: I think it was more like 2,000.</p> \n<p>What are the options for celebrating the holidays there? Chabad?</p> \n<p>Yonadav: There’s Bina [the pluralistic Jewish Movement for Social Change]. There are two Chabad Houses and there’s Lev Yehudi. Lev Yehudi is more religious Zionist, and Chabad House is open to everyone. I think Bina is just secular people who are trying to get a little closer to religion.</p> \n<p>Beita: What was nice at Chabad House was that even though there were 400 people, everyone received personal attention, and there was a family feeling.</p> \n<p>How did the two of you first meet?</p> \n<p>Yonadav: Through mutual friends. I’m originally from the Golan Heights and Beita is from Ofra.</p> \n<p>There were tough pictures of the evacuation in Ofra [in 2017 of residents of nine homes built on privately owned Palestinian land]. How did it make you feel?</p> \n<p>Beita: I wasn’t there, because it was after I got married. It was an unfortunate event, and it happened right at the end of my street. Most of the people who were evicted received alternative housing in Ofra, and some left, I don’t know where they went.</p> \n<p>We hear about the settlements mostly on the news. How is it to live in one on a daily basis?</p> \n<p>It’s everything that a child could ask for. [Ofra] is a very inclusive community, relatively big. Relatively to an [Orthodox] religious community, it’s fairly heterogeneous. You have people with all kinds of styles. Largely religious, and a few non-religious people. For me, there was a feeling of freedom. I went barefoot [there]. Now, living in a city, I miss the mutual assistance from there.</p> \n<p>Where do you live?</p> \n<p>Beita: We live at a yeshiva in Kiryat Shmona. We’re not connected to the yeshiva, but we live there. It’s important for me to have a sense of belonging to a community.</p> \n<p>How would you feel if you didn’t have a community around you?</p> \n<p>Beita: Maybe a little isolated.</p> \n<p>Yonadav: In a community, there’s support and a feeling of belonging.</p> \n<p>Beita: Right. You’re not alone.</p> \n<p>Yonadav: You feel anchored in life.</p> \n<p>Right. That you have a place to come to at the end of the day. And how is it in Kiryat Shmona [in Israel’s far north on the Lebanese border]?</p> \n<p>Yonadav: It’s like being abroad, in terms of the distance.</p> \n<p>Beita: At the Rami Levy [supermarket], they help me carry my groceries, people whom I don’t know. It’s makes me sad that we will be leaving after we complete our studies.</p> \n<p>Wait. Now you’re living in a yeshiva, and Yonadav, you used to study at a yeshiva?</p> \n<p>Yonadav: Yes, at Eli.</p> \n<p>Really!</p> \n<p>Yonadav: It’s an amazing place that aspires to develop influential and great people in society.</p> \n<p>Yes, I’ve heard of it.</p> \n<p>Yonadav: It’s true that recently statements have emerged [from there] that, considering the consensus in society, maybe didn’t need to be said. [He’s referring to comments made by the yeshiva’s deputy head earlier this year about the need to “exterminate” homosexuality.] I don’t know. Their views haven’t changed. They always thought that way. Today society is sensitive. The sensors have honed in. But it’s an amazing place, and I’m in touch with the place, which contributes so much to the State of Israel. In every setting, there is someone who will say something that people don’t want to hear.</p> \n<p>To my ears, those were more than statements that were unpleasant to hear.</p> \n<p>The question is, what you do with it.</p> \n<p>The Adato family: from left, Hadas, 36; Shahar, 9; Yair, 40; Roni, 6, from Kibbutz Ma’aleh Hahamisha, flying to Vienna</p> \n<p>Hello. What’s happening, kids? How was it going back to school?</p> \n<p>Shahar: We learned new things, and also we’re [my sister and I] at the same school now.</p> \n<p>And how’s that? Fun?</p> \n<p>Shahar: Honestly, it’s pretty annoying, because at every recess, she comes over to say hi to me, and she embarrasses me. Let’s say she sees me hiding inside my sweatshirt.</p> \n<p>Roni: I even told his worst enemy about it.</p> \n<p>At your age, you have enemies?</p> \n<p>Shahar: Yes. Every year I have one more enemy, but with some of them, we were enemies, and now we’re good friends.</p> \n<p>Okay. That doesn’t sound so bad. And what does Mom do?</p> \n<p>Shahar: She’s a baker!</p> \n<p>Hadas: At the moment, I’m on maternity leave after delivering a surrogate birth.</p> \n<p>Wow. Very interesting. Do you have something to say on that topic?</p> \n<p>Look, surrogacy in the Third World is not like in Israel, where [being a surrogate mother] is done as a matter of choice, and not for financial reasons. For me it was the fulfillment of a dream, and [also] for the couple who received a baby girl after waiting 23 years for a child. I am thankful to them for making it possible for me to do it.</p> \n<p>Shahar: Unfortunately for everyone, it’s a surrogate pregnancy, so there’s no doing it a second time.</p> \n<p>Hadas: The inappropriate comparison&nbsp;with organ trafficking or prostitution cheapens what we – me, my husband and the children – have done.</p> \n<p>Right. It’s something that really didn’t happen just to the couple and to you [Hadas] but to the whole family. How did all of you accept it?</p> \n<p>Shahar: I was sad when I understood that it wasn’t going to be our brother or sister, but I understood that I should feel happy because we were giving to a couple who couldn’t have a child and that’s a good deed, so I was really very happy.</p> \n<p>Roni: For me, it was a little sad and a little happy.</p> \n<p>And how was it for you, Yair?</p> \n<p>At the beginning, it wasn’t easy for me. The physical aspect scared me, but after I read the couple’s story, if I could have, I would have also given more. Triplets. Who am I to stand in the way of Hadas’ fulfillment?</p> \n<p>Why is this fulfillment for you, Hadas?</p> \n<p>I’m a kibbutznik. My father was born on a kibbutz. My grandfather was one of its founders. These are the values that I grew up with. When they changed the law so that married women could also be surrogate mothers, I was turned on to the idea. It started to develop until the right time came, and all of us became part of the journey.</p> \n<p>And how are you feeling?</p> \n<p>Hadas: Since I gave birth, I’m flying 10 centimeters off the ground, out of a sense of the privilege that I had. I don’t understand why everyone doesn’t go and do it.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to see distress and not extend a hand, if it’s possible. But didn’t it exact a price?</p> \n<p>No, because the pregnancy went okay. I don’t think I’ve paid a price. There are more complicated stories, but for us, knock wood, it was perfect. Look. I’m relaxing and flying to Vienna.</p> \n<p>And you weren’t apprehensive about getting attached to the fetus?</p> \n<p>Yair: There is no dilemma. It wasn’t hers from the beginning. You know in your heart of hearts that it’s not yours.</p> \n<p>Hadas: We knew that we were just caretakers, and that we would give it back. The midwife asked if I wanted to see the baby, but what I really wanted was to see the couple with the baby. That’s what was important to me. I developed a connection to the couple, not the baby. There are women who know they wouldn’t withstand this, and that’s legitimate, just as I knew in my gut that I wouldn’t get attached.</p> \n<p>And you kids are relaxing?</p> \n<p>Shahar: This year, I didn’t manage to choose an after-school activity, so we may volunteer and visit old people at their homes, which is fun, because we can help that way.</p> \n<p>Roni: And then everyone has a friend. Me, the old person and the dog who goes for a walk, and everyone’s better.</p> \n<p>I’m beginning to see the kind of education you’re receiving in your home. Or is this something genetic with you?</p> \n<p>Hadas: Growing up on kibbutz, everyone is involved in everyone else’s business. It’s natural to give, because we’re together all the time.</p>",

        "text":["<p>While Syria remains torn between Russian, American and Turkish interests, with world leaders working to avoid a bloodbath in the remaining pocket of resistance, one thing is certain: President Bashar Assad has won Syria’s devastating seven-year civil war.</p> \n<p>To secure his victory, experts say, Assad helped incubate the extremism that led to the rise of the Islamic State and the further spread of jihadism in Syria&nbsp;– the very elements he now vows to destroy in Idlib, the last rebel enclave in the country and home to millions of civilians and refugees.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel faces a much bigger challenge in Syria than S-300s&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>Robert Ford, the ambassador to Syria under President Barack Obama and the last U.S. ambassador to the country, told Haaretz that Assad “will stay in power for as long as the eye can see,” and more importantly there “won’t be any Nuremberg-like trial of Assad and his associates.”</p> \n<p>Furthermore, he says, not only will Assad not be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons or other wartime atrocities, but his allies Russia and Iran that helped him defeat the rebels won’t be able to bankroll the rebuilding of the war-ravaged country.</p> \n<p>“The Syrian government lacks financial resources, and neither Russia nor Iran can provide much more than they already provide,” says Ford, now a fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington and a professor at Yale.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Assad’s downfall seemed all but guaranteed at many points during the eight years since the Arab Spring began to topple Middle Eastern dictators. Yet Assad has now outlasted fellow despots like Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and Libya’s Muammar Gadhafi, and also Western leaders like Obama and Britain’s David Cameron who once vowed to stop his bloodletting and drew red lines warning Assad against using chemical weapons or risk regime change.</p> \n<p>Ford, who resigned in February 2014 to protest Obama’s alleged lack of policy against Assad, had regularly met with the rebels and wrote in The New York Times in June 2014 that while “these men were not angels … they acknowledged that they would ultimately have to fight Al-Qaida and the foreign jihadis.” But in the end it was Assad who ended up convincing much of the West that he was a better choice than the rebels to help battle the Islamic State and jihadism.</p> \n<p>A new narrative</p> \n<p>In 2011, months after the uprising against Assad began in Daraa and quickly started to destabilize the country, his regime released thousands of jihadists from Syria’s now infamous prisons.</p> \n<p>Using a cold and pragmatic calculus, Assad fomented chaos and terror to discredit the opposition and ensure that the West wouldn't intervene against him.&nbsp;Syrian war&nbsp;expert Christopher Phillips details how Assad tied the opposition to jihadists in his comprehensive&nbsp;2016 book &quot;The Battle for Syria: International Rivalry in the New Middle East.&quot;</p> \n<p>Phillips told Haaretz, “it is hard to tell just how successful the discrediting strategy was. Certainly the majority of Syrians who didn't flee or take up arms seemed to tacitly back Assad but was that because they didn't trust the opposition or because they feared the regime? It was probably a mixture of both.”</p> \n<p>“In 2011, the majority of the current ISIS leadership was released from jail&quot; by Assad, Mohammed Al-Saud, a Syrian dissident with the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, told Newsweek in 2014. “No one in the regime has ever admitted this, or explained why.”</p> \n<p>The leaders of two major Islamist groups, Hassan Aboud of Ahrar al-Sham and Zahran Alloush of Jaysh al-Islam, were also both in Assad’s prisons in early 2011. Additionally, as the Islamic State began to take root in Syria and spread into Iraq, Assad let the group grow. Phillips wrote in The Atlantic in August that this “was partly pragmatic, as ISIS was in the peripheral east while other rebels threatened the western heartlands, but it was also strategic.”</p> \n<p>“The regime did not just open the door to the prisons and let these extremists out, it facilitated them in their work, in their creation of armed brigades,” a former member of Syria’s Military Intelligence Directorate, one of more than a dozen of Syria’s secretive intelligence agencies, told Abu Dhabi-based The National in 2014.</p> \n<p>Assad “concocted a legitimizing narrative: It portrayed the oppositionists as violent, foreign, sectarian Islamists,” Phillips wrote, “in the hope that only jihadists and his regime would be left for Syrians and the world to choose from.”</p> \n<p>Assad’s survival and Hezbollah’s lasting presence</p> \n<p>As the war progressed, Hezbollah, Iran and later Russia intervened militarily to help Assad, while the United States, Turkey and the Kurds fought in Syria and set up military bases to battle the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Hezbollah was “absolutely key” to Assad’s survival, Phillips says.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: How Russian Military Support Is Secretly Airlifted to Syria's Assad | Putin's Private Army in Syria: Officially Illegal, the Kremlin Denies It, but the Evidence Is in the Numbers</p> \n<p>Hezbollah members were the first foreign fighters, in 2012, to enter on Assad’s side and “led the way in key battles like Qusayr and in reorganizing the army and pro-Assad Syrian Democratic Forces,” Phillips told Haaretz. “Iran’s Soleimani may have been the brains, but Hezbollah were the trusted implementers,” he added, referring to the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ Quds force.</p> \n<p>Iran has long viewed its presence in Syria as key in its desire to establish a&nbsp; land bridge between Tehran and Beirut, a strategic asset it hopes would thwart both Saudi Arabia and Israel, its regional rivals.</p> \n<p>Another major factor that allowed for Assad’s survival was the strength of prewar Syria’s government. Phillips wrote that in 2000, when Assad came to power, he had “inherited a coup-proofed regime” from his father, Hafez Assad.</p> \n<p>The structure Hafez built lasts to this day, and as Ford adds, it's the reason “neither Russia nor Iran control the Syrian power elite inner circle and that circle has stayed loyal to Assad consistently through the civil war.” Most of Syria’s top security positions are packed with Alawites, the sect the Assad family belongs to, which is only about 10 percent of the predominantly Sunni population. While Assad’s army suffered mass desertions and lost well over half its soldiers in the first four years of the war, the power structure around Assad stayed loyal.</p> \n<p>What’s next for Syria?</p> \n<p>Assad’s survival has left Syria in ruins; the country is now “weaker, poorer and less influential in the region,” Ford says. Assad's travel is now restricted to “friendly” countries, lest he face extradition.</p> \n<p>Russia, while reeling from its own economic woes, is working behind the scenes to secure funding to rebuild Syria. “Russia wants to show the world that the Syrian civil war is largely over, and refugees returning would be one indicator that the Assad government has won its victory,” Ford says.</p> \n<p>The Trump administration, however, has made clear that Washington will not help fund the rebuilding effort, and U.S. sanctions make foreign investment very difficult in the country.</p> \n<p>The Russian government even went so far as to release a list from its &quot;refugee coordination center&quot; at Khmeimim air base in Syria claiming that 900,000 refugees could return to Syria soon from Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. Turkey is amassing troops near Idlib and fears a mass exodus from the region toward its border.</p> \n<p>But Ford says Syria’s basic infrastructure can't handle a returning population. Recent estimates to rebuild Syria range from $250 billion to $400 billion, according to AP. “Little of Homs and Aleppo cities have been rebuilt even though fighting in those cities ended years ago,&quot; Ford says. &quot;Where would refugees live? What jobs would they have? &nbsp;What about clean water and electricity and heat for winter?”</p> \n<p>As a result, Russia has been lobbying Germany and France and even Turkey to foot the bill to rebuild Syria, while Trump has been pressing his allies not to support Assad financially. Iran’s indefinite presence in Syria is also all but certain to keep U.S. funding out and continue to isolate Syria both economically and diplomatically.</p> \n<p>Assad’s ruthless victory has created one of the largest refugee crises since World War II, one that has brought out demons in many Western countries now embracing anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim politics.</p> \n<p>The reconstruction and repatriation effort faces another problem&nbsp;– many refugees may not want to return. Syria’s security services are checking information on each refugee and, according to Ford, there are stories in the media of some people being detained or promptly sent into military service upon their return. Russia, Assad and Turkey have agreed for the time being not to enter Idlib and destroy the jihadists there at the expense of civilian lives, delaying the final military push that most observers still see as inevitable.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;After ISIS Loses Its Capital, Focus Turns to Strengthening Global Terror Network&nbsp;|&nbsp;The Rise and Fall of ISIS: From Organization to State</p> \n<p>Additionally, a recent UN report estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 Islamic State fighters remain in Syria and Iraq&nbsp;– despite Trump’s recent declarations of victory over the group.

        "text":["<p>In 1982, my sister Maniou, eight years older than me, moved to Israel from Amsterdam, where we were both born. I was 11 at the time. She studied psychology at Bar-Ilan University, got married, changed her name to Ma’anit, moved from Ramat Gan first to the Jerusalem suburb of Mevasseret, then to Kfar Darom (a settlement in Gaza that was evacuated in 2005) and then to Dolev, a religious settlement in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>When our father passed away in 1991, my sister was eight months pregnant with her fourth child and she was living in Kfar Darom, where I had visited her several times. She was not allowed to fly anymore, which is why my father was buried in Jerusalem. Our mother wanted to be buried next to him, so both our parents are buried in Jerusalem, even though they never moved to Israel. (She passed away in 2015.)</p> \n<p>My sister has seven children and, by now, I believe 12 grandchildren - I lost count.</p> \n<p>Although we both grew up fairly traditional (kosher food, going to synagogue on Saturday and Jewish holidays), my sister became more and more religious, and I less and less. She had always been an ardent member of the religious youth movement Bnei Akiva; I was sent there as well, but I was too much of a loner to feel at ease among those youth movement enthusiasts.</p> \n<p>As a child we were quite close, but we grew apart the moment I lost interest in Judaism and Zionism. My sister keeps begging me to come and visit her, but I have tried my best to avoid visiting her in Dolev as much as I could.</p> \n<p>Since she moved there in the late 1990’s, I have visited her on family occasions, such as the bar mitzvahs of my nephews. In 2001, visiting for one such bar mitzvah, my non-Jewish girlfriend wasn’t allowed to stay over Shabbat at my sister’s house: She was asked to go back to Tel Aviv. My mother begged me to remain, alone, for the ceremony, and I gave in to my mother’s plight. My girlfriend was on the beach in Tel Aviv, I was in the synagogue in Dolev.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But to me this was a watershed moment - I’d betrayed myself and my principles. I would never do it again, your values are not mine, I told my sister over the phone: &quot;You and your husband are plain racists.&quot;</p> \n<p>Even when my mother was buried in Jerusalem, I decided to stay in a hotel there rather than staying over in her settlement. I spent two or three daytimes at the shiva in Dolev, before going back to New York, where I have been living since 1995.</p> \n<p>The last time I saw my sister was in the early summer of&nbsp; 2016 when I visited the territories and Israel - Breaking the Silence had invited me to contribute to a book marking 50 years of the occupation.</p> \n<p>One afternoon, I took a taxi from East Jerusalem to Dolev; the Palestinian taxi driver told me that he often went there to bring and pick up people who had to go to Jerusalem. My sister and I played ping-pong. I didn’t tell her the reason I was visiting the region. Then I went back to East Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>On the one hand, I believe my sister genuinely longs to see me; family is important to her. On the other hand I believe she wants to save my soul.</p> \n<p>She wants me to get married to a Jewish woman, to have children. Her husband has told me several times that, even if you are not religious, at least you could produce Jewish children. Procreation was, he has told me, the purpose of life.</p> \n<p>So I have decided to go and visit my sister this December and to live in her settlement for a couple of weeks. To be embedded with her, so to speak.</p> \n<p>This wouldn’t be my first time being embedded. I was embedded with Dutch and German troops in Afghanistan in 2006, 2007 and 2011, and with American troops in Iraq in 2008 and 2009.</p> \n<p>The concept of being &quot;embedded&quot; could also be transferred to other subcultures and professions, I decided. So, in the last few years, I was embedded with psychiatric patients in an asylum; I worked in the dining car on Swiss trains, and in a hotel as a chamber maid (boy). A few years before my mother passed away I was embedded with her: I moved in with her, and recently I was embedded in a nursing home.</p> \n<p>I am already thinking about the question I want to explore, if not answer, during my stay in Dolev.</p> \n<p>The settlement where my sister lives reminds me of a prison. It’s a place I detest deeply, for reasons both political and personal.</p> \n<p>But if push comes to shove, could I live there? What do my sister and I still have in common? Will we end up playing ping-pong together in order to avoid real and painful discussions? Is my relationship with my sister inherently bound up with where she’s made her home? Can I separate them? Doesn’t she want them to be inseparable - love me, love my settlement?</p> \n<p>Do we need family?</p> \n<p>How did we reach such different conclusions about ethical and political values, having both been brought on the shared history of our parents? Our mother, born in 1927, survived the Nazi concentration camps. Our father, born in Berlin in 1912, survived the war in hiding in the Netherlands; he claimed to be a Wehrmacht deserter.</p> \n<p>And although my mother, especially, emphasized the need to continue the Jewish religious tradition - my father despised religious leaders of all sorts and almost never set foot in a synagogue - both my sister and I were raised with humanistic values.</p> \n<p>We were educated in equality, there was no fundamental difference between Jews and gentiles, that science and culture (especially German culture) were in the end more important than the Torah. Both of my parents were German Jews and they wanted very much to pass on their love of German culture.</p> \n<p>But what future will my sister’s children face? My sister went to university, she speaks several languages – and her children (with one exception) speak only Hebrew, and they didn’t go to university. I would call this downward social and intellectual mobility.</p> \n<p>Who are the people living there in Dolev? How much community do we need? Can I ever understand the appeal of nationalism, or even of nation-states?</p> \n<p>Is my sister a victim or a protagonist of an extreme form of identity politics and paranoia? Can I relate to her own certainty in both politics and religion? And to her claim that she understands certain things better than I did and do?</p> \n<p>Is living in Dolev, a West Bank settlement, going to change me?</p> \n<p>I don't know whether I will find answers to all these questions - and what other questions will arise that I can't even imagine or enunciate right now. But I have committed to living, temporarily, inside these perplexing issues rather than avoiding them, which would have been far more comfortable.</p> \n<p>When I write here again, after my time in Dolev, it will be up to the reader to decide if I interrogated my new surroundings, and my discomfort, enough.</p> \n<p>Arnon Grunberg is the author of the recent novels &quot;Good Men&quot; and &quot;Birthmarks.&quot; As a reporter he has been embedded with, among others, Dutch and German troops in Afghanistan and American troops Iraq, in a nursing home in Flanders, with a fire crew in The Netherlands and is about to travel all 50 U.S. states to explore God, love, work, race and punishment. He was born in Amsterdam and lives and works in New York. Twitter: @arnonyy</p>",

        "text":["<p>What did I consider more important about my meeting with Nobel Prize laureate Daniel Kahneman? My enjoyment of the meeting, which was fascinating and inspirational – or the photo that shows me talking with one of the world’s most brilliant men? According to Kahneman, this is a complex question that has caused confusion in happiness studies for many years.</p> \n<p>He came to the study of happiness through a circuitous route, as an outgrowth of research in which he sought to understand the connection between what we experience in real time – that is, the life we lead – and what we remember of these experiences (i.e., the narrative we carry with us and tell about our lives).</p> \n<p>A Tel Aviv native and professor emeritus at Princeton, Kahneman, 84, is a cognitive psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002 for research conducted jointly with Amos Tversky (who died in 1996). The two modeled a systematic, inbuilt set of cognitive biases and logical failures in our method of thinking that influences contexts, conclusions and decision-making. They then demonstrated how, as a result, we make decisions on the basis of erroneous assessments and intuitions that are inconsistent with either statistics or common sense.</p> \n<p>The research and behavioral models derived from their studies had a significant effect on the economic sciences, forcing it to change its models – which had previously been based on the fundamental assumption of rational behavior. Kahneman’s insights created the field of behavioral economics: A field that seeks to evaluate the influence of irrational, impulsive human behavior.</p> \n<p>In the 1990s, Kahneman studied another form of cognitive bias: That there is a discrepancy between our experiences as we experience them while they’re actually happening, and our memories of those same experiences.</p> \n<p>The subject of his initial research was not sexy and quite distant from the happiness debate. The study documented, in real time, patients’ degree of suffering during a colonoscopy (it was a painful procedure at the time, unlike today).</p> \n<p>It turned out there was no connection between the length of the procedure and level of pain a patient experienced and described at the time, and the extent of trauma he recalled afterward. The memory was based primarily on whether the pain increased or decreased toward the end of the procedure. The stronger the pain in the final stage of the procedure, the more traumatic it became in the patient’s memory – with no connection to the question of how much pain he actually experienced during it.</p> \n<p>Positive experiences are processed similarly. In a 2010 lecture, Kahneman related the story of a man who told him about listening to a symphony he loved, “absolutely glorious music.” But at the end there was a “dreadful screeching sound” that, the man said, ruined the whole experience for him.</p> \n<p>But as Kahneman pointed out, it hadn’t actually destroyed the experience, because the man enjoyed the music at the time. Rather, it ruined his memory of the experience, which is something completely different.</p> \n<p>“We live and experience many moments, but most of them are not preserved,” Kahneman said. “They are lost forever. Our memory collects certain parts of what happened to us and processes them into a story. We make most of our decisions based on the story told by our memory.</p> \n<p>“For example, a vacation – we don’t remember, or experience, the entire time we spent on vacation, but only the impressions preserved in our memory, the photographs and the documentation. Moreover, we usually choose the next vacation not as an experience but as a future memory. If prior to the decision about our next vacation we assume that at the end all the photos will be erased, and we’ll be given a drug that will also erase our memory, it’s quite possible that we’ll choose a different vacation from the one that we actually choose.”</p> \n<p>A very vague concept</p> \n<p>Kahneman’s studies of “What I experience” versus “What I remember” are what led him to get involved in the study of happiness.</p> \n<p>“I put together a group of researchers, including an economist whom I viewed as both a partner in the group and its principal client,” he told me when we met earlier this year. “We wanted to figure out what factors affect happiness and to try to work to change conditions and policies accordingly. Economists have more influence on policy.</p> \n<p>“The group developed a model known as DRM, or Day Reconstruction Method – a fairly successful method of reconstructing experiences throughout the day. It gives results similar to those of ‘What I experience’ and is easier to do.”</p> \n<p>It turns out there are significant differences between the narrative that we remember and tell, and the feelings of day-to-day happiness we experience at the time – to the point that Kahneman believes the general term “happiness” is too vague and can’t be applied to both.</p> \n<p>He views “happiness” as the feeling of enjoyment a person experiences here and now – for instance, two weeks of relaxation on the beach, or an enjoyable conversation with an interesting person. What is described as happiness in the “What I remember” is something Kahneman prefers to call – as he did more than once in his series of studies – “satisfaction” or “life satisfaction.”</p> \n<p>“Life satisfaction is connected to a large degree to social yardsticks – achieving goals, meeting expectations,” he explained. “It’s based on comparisons with other people.</p> \n<p>“For instance, with regard to money, life satisfaction rises in direct proportion to how much you have. In contrast, happiness is affected by money only when it’s lacking. Poverty can buy a lot of suffering, but above the level of income that satisfies basic needs, happiness, as I define it, doesn’t increase with wealth. The graph is surprisingly flat.</p> \n<p>“Economist Angus Deaton, the Nobel Prize laureate for 2015, was also involved in these conclusions. Happiness in this sense depends, to a large extent, on genetics – on a natural ability to be happy. It’s also connected to a genetic disposition to optimism. They are apparently the same genes.</p> \n<p>“To the degree that outside factors affect this aspect of happiness,” he continued, “they’re related solely to people: We’re happy in the company of people we like, especially friends – more so than with partners. Children can cause great happiness, at certain moments.”</p> \n<p>‘I was miserable’</p> \n<p>At about the same time as these studies were being conducted, the Gallup polling company (which has a relationship with Princeton) began surveying various indicators among the global population. Kahneman was appointed as a consultant to the project.</p> \n<p>“I suggested including measures of happiness, as I understand it – happiness in real time. To these were added data from Bhutan, a country that measures its citizens’ happiness as an indicator of the government’s success. And gradually, what we know today as Gallup’s World Happiness Report developed. It has also been adopted by the UN and OECD countries, and is published as an annual report on the state of global happiness.</p> \n<p>“A third development, which is very important in my view, was a series of lectures I gave at the London School of Economics in which I presented my findings about happiness. The audience included Prof. Richard Layard – a teacher at the school, a British economist and a member of the House of Lords – who was interested in the subject. Eventually, he wrote a book about the factors that influence happiness, which became a hit in Britain,” Kahneman said, referring to “Happiness: Lessons from a New Science.”</p> \n<p>“Layard did important work on community issues, on improving mental health services – and his driving motivation was promoting happiness. He instilled the idea of happiness as a factor in the British government’s economic considerations.</p> \n<p>“The involvement of economists like Layard and Deaton made this issue more respectable,” Kahneman added with a smile. “Psychologists aren’t listened to so much. But when economists get involved, everything becomes more serious, and research on happiness gradually caught the attention of policy-making organizations.</p> \n<p>“At the same time,” said Kahneman, “a movement has also developed in psychology – positive psychology – that focuses on happiness and attributes great importance to internal questions like meaning. I’m less certain of that.</p> \n<p>“People connect happiness primarily to the company of others. I recall a conversation with Martin Seligman, the founder of positive psychology, in which he tried to convince me I had a meaningful life. I insisted – and I still think this today – that I had an interesting life. ‘Meaningful’ isn’t something I understand. I’m a lucky person and also fairly happy – mainly because, for most of my life, I’ve worked with people whose company I enjoyed.”</p> \n<p>Then, referring to his 2011 best-seller “Thinking, Fast and Slow,” he added, “There were four years when I worked alone on a book. That was terrible, and I was miserable.”</p> \n<p>Despite Kahneman’s reservations, trends in positive psychology have come to dominate the science of happiness. One of the field’s most prominent representatives is Prof. Tal Ben-Shahar, who taught the most popular course in Harvard’s history (in spring 2006), on happiness and leadership.</p> \n<p>Following in his footsteps, lecturers at Yale developed a course on happiness that attracted masses of students and overshadowed every other course offered at the prestigious university.</p> \n<p>“In positive psychology, it seems to me they’re trying to convince people to be happy without making any changes in their situation,” said Kahneman, skeptically. “To learn to be happy. That fits well with political conservatism.”</p> \n<p>I pointed out to Kahneman that Buddhism – including Tibetan Buddhism’s spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, which whom he is in contact – also places great emphasis on changing a person’s inner spiritual state. “That’s true to a large extent,” he agreed, “but in a different way, in my opinion. Buddhism has a different social worldview.</p> \n<p>“But in any case, I confess that I participated in a meeting with the Dalai Lama at MIT, and some of his people were there – including one of his senior people, who lives in Paris and serves as his contact person and translator in France. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from this man. He radiated. He had such inner peace and such a sense of happiness, and I’m absolutely not cynical enough to overlook it.”</p> \n<p>Tending to mental health</p> \n<p>Kahneman studied happiness for over two decades, gave rousing lectures and, thanks to his status, contributed to putting the issue on the agenda of both countries and organizations, principally the UN and the OECD. Five years ago, though, he abandoned this line of research.</p> \n<p>“I gradually became convinced that people don’t want to be happy,” he explained. “They want to be satisfied with their life.”</p> \n<p>A bit stunned, I asked him to repeat that statement. “People don’t want to be happy the way I’ve defined the term – what I experience here and now. In my view, it’s much more important for them to be satisfied, to experience life satisfaction, from the perspective of ‘What I remember,’ of the story they tell about their lives. I furthered the development of tools for understanding and advancing an asset that I think is important but most people aren’t interested in.</p> \n<p>“Meanwhile, awareness of happiness has progressed in the world, including annual happiness indexes. It seems to me that on this basis, what can confidently be advanced is a reduction of suffering. The question of whether society should intervene so that people will be happier is very controversial, but whether society should strive for people to suffer less – that’s widely accepted.</p> \n<p>“Much of Layard’s activity on behalf of happiness in England related to bolstering the mental health system. In general, if you want to reduce suffering, mental health is a good place to start – because the extent of illness is enormous and the intensity of the distress doesn’t allow for any talk of happiness. We also need to talk about poverty and about improving the workplace environment, where many people are abused.”</p> \n<p>My interview with Kahneman took place as I started working on the Haaretz series of articles “The Secret of Happiness,” and was initially meant to conclude it. It was the key to the entire series. It’s interesting that Kahneman, one of the leading symbols of happiness research, eventually became dubious and quit, while proposing that we primarily address causes of suffering.</p> \n<p>The “secret of happiness” hasn’t been deciphered. Even the term’s definition remains vague. Genetics and luck play an important role in it.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, a few insights that emerged from the series have stayed with me: I’m amazed by Layard’s activity. I was impressed by the tranquility of the Buddhist worldview and the practices that accompany it. Personally, I’ve chosen to practice meditation with a technique adapted to people from Western cultures.</p> \n<p>I learned to collect experiences and not necessarily memories, which can be disputed. I don’t mind sitting for three hours in a Paris caf&eacute; or spending a day wandering through the streets of Berlin, without noting a single monument or having a single incident that I could recount. I gave up on income to do what I enjoy – like, for instance, writing about happiness and music.</p> \n<p>Above all, it has become clear that our best hours are spent in the company of people we like. With this resource, it pays to be generous.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Forty-two museums in the Netherlands appear to have at least 170 stolen works taken from Jews during World War II, according to a report by the Dutch Museums Association published Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The Association’s website contains a complete list of all the stolen items that have been identified thus far. These include 83 paintings, 26 illustrations and 13 Judaica objects that were probably taken from their owners between 1933 and 1945. Works whose original owners were identified and confirmed by a committee were returned to the families.</p> \n<p>In 2015, the Dutch royal family returned a painting by Joris van der Haagen to its original owners. The former queen of the Netherlands, Juliana, bought it in 1960 without knowing its source. A palace investigation was carried out as part of the Dutch Museums Association project and revealed that it had apparently been taken by force and transferred to a Nazi bank. In another case, a statue of Moses by the artist Alessandro Vittoria was recently restored to the heirs of Emma Budge, who died in 1937. According to the Association’s investigation, the statue is part of an art collection owned by Budge, captured by the Nazis after her death and sold at an auction.</p> \n<p>Other works on the list include paintings by Kandinsky and Matisse that form part of the collection of the Stedelijk Museum, a painting by Jan Adam Kruseman of the Rijksmuseum, a painting by Max Liebermann at the Boijmans Van Beuningen museum in Rotterdam, Hans Memling’s painting ‘De Bewening,’ two paintings by Isaac Lazarus Isra&euml;ls and others. Among other works, illustrations by Jan Toorop that appear in the list seem to belong to the extensive Goudstikker collection, parts of which were already returned to his descendants in 2006.</p> \n<p>The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is the only one yet to complete its examination, although around 25 works from its collection have already been added to the list. A five-person team has been working since 2012 to review all the works at the museum, but the size of the collection – the largest in the country – is causing delays.</p> \n<p>According to the website, those who think they may be legal heirs to one of the identified works can file a claim with the committee established to examine the matter. Since 2002, 460 works in Holland have been returned to their Jewish owners from museums, private collections and public institutions. The project involved 163 museums, 42 of which included works that found their way to the list. “This research is important for reaching historical justice,” said Chris Janssen from the Association’s project. “A museum should only show a piece of work if it knows its story and history. It is the only way it can provide its visitors with accurate information.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>He's not alone, and he's not in the minority. Likud MK Oren Hazan is a frighteningly accurate litmus test for the mood in Israeli-Jewish society. He unambiguously captures the racist-fascist-misogynistic&nbsp;sentiment: religious and nationalist arguments linked with a hatred of women&nbsp;– a hallmark of German and Italian fascism.</p> \n<p>See, for instance, the &quot;Ten Commandments for Choosing a Spouse” by the Third Reich's public health authorities. Read, for example, chapter 11 of &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; which says: &quot;The black-haired Jewish youth lies in wait for hours on end, satanically glaring at and spying on the unsuspicious girl whom he plans to seduce, adulterating her blood and removing her from the bosom of her own people.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 'She seduced a Jew': Lawmaker bemoans wedding of Fauda star to Israeli Arab TV anchor</p> \n<p>Hazan hasn't been blessed with Adolf Hitler's colorful writing style, but the sentiment he expressed about Lucy Aharish, an Israeli Arab news anchor who on Wednesday married Jewish actor Tzachi Halevy, is identical: The Arab Aharish &quot;seduced&quot; the unsuspicious Jew. A real Lilith.</p> \n<p>In racist ideology, the scary &quot;other&quot; is always the one who initiates, who generates the horror and violates the pure. The purpose of her &quot;seduction&quot; is to take advantage of her non-Jewish womb, as Hazan says: &quot;Preventing more Jewish progeny from continuing the Jewish dynasty.&quot; No less important is the motive: &quot;With the goal of harming our country,&quot; as Hazan tweeted.</p> \n<p>The social-media uproar that Hazan's post caused juxtaposed two opposite worldviews. In one, relationships and marriage are an individual choice, and the state's only job is to stay out. In the other, relationships are a demographic threat to the state, rendering its elected officials obligated to interfere to channel every relationship toward a clear, premeditated agenda.</p> \n<p>Israel, which puts marriage and divorce in the hands of religious institutions, already has trouble staying the course as it crisscrosses these different positions. It doesn't let people of different religions marry in its territory, though it recognizes such marriages if performed abroad.</p> \n<p>The state is officially silent, of course, when it comes to the intermarriage of Jews and Muslims or Arabs generally, but it gives the stage to right-wing activists such as Lehava and the group's founder Bentzi Gopstein, who have repeatedly attacked Aharish. The only elected officials to condemn Gopstein have been left-wing and Arab MKs.</p> \n<p>Behind the 65 legislators in Israel's governing coalition – the official face of Israel, the face that said not a word of condemnation against Hazan's racist post – stands a large constituency, a sturdy Jewish majority. If coalition members thought otherwise, if they thought Hazan didn't represent the values and beliefs of this community, they'd bother to tweet. But as long as they're silent, everyone is party to his post.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The 2018 Gault &amp; Millau restaurant guide to Israel has chalked up a dubious achievement. It has laid bare the convoluted language that has become standard for the Israeli food world.</p> \n<p>Hebrew has never sounded worse than in this volume’s description of 143 restaurants, replete with syntax and proofreading errors and laden with superfluous adjectives that ridiculously personify raw ingredients and foods. It’s a sad way to mark the book’s return in Israel after a 15-year absence. (The tome comes out in Hebrew, English, French and Russian. The quotations in this article are a translation from the Hebrew).</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;A culinary tour of Tel Aviv's most underrated market</p> \n<p>It’s not just the references, for example, to obedient ribs. In the book’s Hebrew version (page 163), the presentation at Tel Aviv’s Ouzeria restaurant “shows effort, is pleasing to the eye and excites the silverware.” At Pronto, “there are at times entirely neutral dishes from a geographic perspective such as salmon steak charmingly lying on a bed of mangold leaves.”</p> \n<p>Part of the problem is the translation effort from English or French, because, as the guidebook states, some of the reviewers are foreigners residing in Israel, “living a way of life based on a lot of touring and frequent visits to prestigious restaurants in Israel and abroad.” But much of the problem is the pompous talk that has taken root in conversation about food, mainly due to television reality shows.</p> \n<p>Twelve critics, according to the guide’s introduction, provided the reviews and ratings. These anonymous critics – and anonymity is a linchpin of modern restaurant reviews – are described as people from with extensive culinary knowledge, not to mention training from Gault &amp; Millau abroad.</p> \n<p>But it’s hard to understand why anyone should accept their opinions. A restaurant review can say anything, positive or negative, as long as the assertions are backed up.</p> \n<p>But the text of the Gault &amp; Millau Israel guide is clich&eacute;d and vague in the best cases. (“We liked the place because it’s fun sitting there. There are no two ways about it. It’s the charm of Jaffa,” Onza restaurant, page 161). In a bad case, the book shows a lack of culinary knowledge (“a pan of rare and spicy mushrooms with a surprising magic ingredient!” Whiskey Bar, page 213).</p> \n<p>In the worst case, it’s full of errors resulting from a lack of knowledge. (“The dishes were served the moment they were ready … and some were surprising for how they were served, such as the burrata wrapped in a ribbon of sorts, like a package of gifts,” Coco Bambino, page 55). Burrato, an Italian cheese, is traditionally tied with a green chive stem; the decision to serve it that way wasn’t taken by any restaurant committee deciding how to decorate their food.</p> \n<p>The tone is also pretentious at times; for example, at the Montefiore in Tel Aviv, “we would recommend that the chef forgo the Italian touches on the menu and focus on the Asian aspect, which is carried out here with impressive perfection,” (page 141). One of the most generous compliments the reviewers bestow on Israeli establishments – and it’s repeated time and again – is the locales' resemblance to “genuine” French or Parisian establishments.</p> \n<p>The reviewers may be anonymous for the sake of professional ethics, but they seem to be all from the same mold – ethnocentrism, a lack of diversity and an agenda.</p> \n<p>Just five Arab restaurants</p> \n<p>Gault &amp; Millau, like most of the world’s restaurant guides, loves to dwell on dry numbers accompanied by diagrams highlighting the book’s wealth of information and the hard work of everybody involved. The introduction notes the 12 reviewers and the 215 restaurants that were surveyed (of which 143 made it into the book). Then there are the 1,200 dishes ordered and the 10 awards that Israeli restaurants have received.</p> \n<p>It’s actually more interesting to consider figures that the guidebook downplayed – the fact that of the 143 Israeli restaurants, only five are Arab. And that no fewer than 14 are in hotels, and that 106, meaning the vast majority, are in Tel Aviv. It’s hard to understand how only five Arab restaurants made it into the guide, considering the influence that local Arab cuisine has had on new Israeli cuisine – which Gault &amp; Millau has lauded.</p> \n<p>Only one of the restaurants reviewed is a hummus place – Abu Hassan in Jaffa – which appears in the “pop” category of “places offering a more accessible and simple atmosphere than typical restaurants.” Editors of restaurant guides can of course decide that hummus joints aren’t appropriate for inclusion, but why include Abu Hassan and exclude other hummus restaurants?</p> \n<p>The first Gault &amp; Millau guide was published in the 1970s in France. Unlike&nbsp; Michelin's restaurant guides, it included less-fancy establishments. And Gault &amp; Millau was written in an innovative and accessible style. But since then a lot of water has flown down the Seine; the Israeli guidebook includes nearly 50 restaurants where the average price per diner tops 200 shekels ($55).</p> \n<p>Other than the one hummus establishment, the book has one restaurant specializing in the sabich eggplant-and-egg sandwich, one Yemenite restaurant, two restaurants serving Kurdish cuisine and two offering skewers of meat. Gault &amp; Millau makes no mention of Persian or Russian restaurants, and of course this also goes for falafel and shawarma stands.</p> \n<p>Kosher joints galore</p> \n<p>Those 14 restaurants in hotels, 10 percent of all the establishments featured, is a lot when you consider that many of the restaurants were simply opened to boost the hotels’ ratings. The cooks at these places are usually from an antiquated hotel hierarchy, not from the new generation of chefs who have made a revolution in Israeli cuisine. The hotel restaurants are also subject to strict kashrut rules.</p> \n<p>Particularly surprising is that 34 of the 143 restaurants are kosher. With all due respect to the progress in recent years to promote kosher cuisine in Israel, the guide’s number of kosher restaurants is disproportionate.</p> \n<p>Then there’s the Tel Aviv problem. As Israel’s leading urban and cultural center, the city boasts a decent number of good restaurants. But what about all the good ones elsewhere around the country?</p> \n<p>The guide excludes nearly the entire north, which is represented by one restaurant in Acre, two in Rameh and three in Haifa. And other than two restaurants in Eilat, the south is nonexistent. Also absent are entire cities that have become interesting culinary centers such as Nazareth and Ashdod.</p> \n<p>And it gets even more bizarre. The guide’s distinction between restaurants and “pop” establishments is inconsistent. Classifications aren’t clear. And many of the purportedly objective data, such as prices, are full of obvious mistakes.</p> \n<p>But the media, including this newspaper, has turned the return of the Gault &amp; Millau Israel restaurant guide into a news sensation, giving credence to its reviews. So the restaurants in the volume, particularly those that have won awards including restaurant of the year and chef of the year (Raz Rahav), have been handed a quality seal of approval.</p> \n<p>It’s true that the new Israeli cuisine has attracted major interest around the world, but the local restaurant scene isn’t stable, to say the least. It’s difficult to nearly impossible to keep a restaurant guide current when restaurants are constantly opening and closing and when the political and security situation has put off many global brands. It’s legitimate, of course, to publish a restaurant guide aimed mainly at kosher-seeking Jewish tourists, but it’s not clear that such a tome needs to be released as an international guide meeting standards of objectivity and quality.</p> \n<p>It’s doubtful if Gault &amp; Millau would have resumed its coverage of the Israeli scene after a 15-year absence were it not for local partners with a stated agenda – Israelis of French-Jewish origin.</p> \n<p>“The 2018 Gault &amp; Millau guide has set out to promote Israeli cuisines and raw ingredients around the world,” says Serge Sellem, the president of Gault &amp; Millau Israel. Sellem, like the others leading the project, declined to be interviewed by Haaretz or to provide information on his professional background. In an email, the CEO of Gault &amp; Millau Israel, James Nadjar, acknowledged some technical errors in the guide’s first edition.</p> \n<p>On a global scale, traditional restaurant guides are particularly losing influence where they originally held sway, in Europe and the United States. People are opting for the wisdom of crowdsourcing. Websites including TripAdvisor, which for better or worse are based on the democratization of reviews, are taking their place, as are alternative restaurant guides.</p> \n<p>Another factor that’s undermining the classic restaurant guides is the waning of haute cuisine; this is happening for both financial and cultural reasons. The aura of expensive dining experiences is on the decline, and a positive aspect of the revolution is the penetration of cuisines other than French and Italian into the international consciousness. (One reason Israeli cuisine is popular is that French food is no longer considered the only pinnacle around the world.)</p> \n<p>One way guidebooks such as Michelin and Gault &amp; Millau – commercial enterprises that have to turn a profit – compete is by finding new market segments, including those in Asia and the Middle East. The mark of quality that the old brands confer is still effective in these places.</p> \n<p>The guide’s halo of prestige from the past is enough for many people to rely on this “cosmopolitan” stamp of approval. Just as in the colonial era, the guidebooks’ writers speak to the “client states” in an Old World language marred by a patronizing tone. But who cares when the reader sees restaurants rated with stars and chefs’ hats?</p>",

        "text":["<p>The letter below, which was originally sent by email, was received by Haaretz on Wednesday – but without the writer’s address. It opens: “Residents of Alon, we are happy to share with you the temporary takeover of land for a Hebrew flock of sheep near the settlement for a period of about three months.” The letter was signed “Srulik, the settlement’s secretary.”</p> \n<p>Apparently this is Srulik Hirsch and the settlement’s website hasn’t updated the secretary’s name. Alon is an offshoot of Kfar Adumim, another settlement.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;I detest my sister's West Bank settlement. That's why I'm going to live there | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When I called to ask about the letter, Srulik answered immediately: “I know nothing about it.” He asked who gave me the information and said “I don’t know who passed something on to you and what he passed on to you.” He said he’d call later after he had confirmed the details.</p> \n<p>So here are the details, as they appear in the letter. Authentic or not, the details correspond to the way at least 10 other outposts throughout the West Bank have been built around a flock of sheep. Young people lead the flock, amid a family or two with children, with the considerable help of government agencies behind the scenes.</p> \n<p>The details confirm what has been concluded in the past. These aren’t private initiatives by eccentrics. A flock is an expensive thing – around 1,650 shekels ($455) a sheep – and there are several hundred sheep in each flock.</p> \n<p>The letter – even if not penned by “Srulik” – explains well the rationale behind the shepherds’ outposts: Grab as much Palestinian land as possible as fast as possible (and much more than by building houses). After all, the Hebrew flocks of sheep in the West Bank are a synonym for terrorizing anyone who’s a non-Hebrew shepherd or farmer.</p> \n<p>The letter says further down: “In accordance with the desire to keep in the council’s jurisdiction the state land around the settlement and in Gush Adumim, and in continuing the farming activity developing the area (the olive groves and flock of sheep grazing at Mishor Adumim), another flock has been set up that will graze from Alon Road east to Mitzpeh Yericho, on the border of Wadi Qelt, and up to Route 1. All this is part of the desire to create a contiguity of settlements from Mishor Adumim to Mitzpeh Yericho.</p> \n<p>“Since the flock already exists and all the permits for the pen’s final location have not been obtained, we have asked for a temporary permit to place the flock east of the settlement (in the [military] academy’s future location). This is a temporary solution for only three months in which the flock will graze and get used to the place. We point out that a grazing permit has been obtained from the legal authorities and the Civil Administration. The entire flock numbers some 200 sheep, in addition to two Jewish families with children who will live in trucks on wheels [sic], with youths who will look after the flock.</p> \n<p>“To maintain the families and the flock, basic infrastructure work will be carried out – a road, water and the like. Boaz Ido and Zambish [Ze’ev Hever] of Amana [the settling agency of the Gush Emunim settler movement] were partners to carrying out the idea, financing the enterprise and implementing it. To receive further details and submit additional, updated details, you are all invited to a discussion evening on the subject with Boaz Ido in the library on Wednesday October 17 at 9 (please come on time).</p> \n<p>“The program is in coordination with and has the approval of the settlement’s security coordinator, Yishai. The settlement’s secretariat, Srulik the settlement secretary.”</p> \n<p>There in black and white</p> \n<p>Again, Srulik says he doesn’t know about this. Boaz Ido didn’t answer the phone or the text message I sent him. By the way, he’s is the owner of a commercial outpost filled with illegal structures near Alon called Eretz Bereshit.</p> \n<p>I tried to find out what a grazing permit is and if the flock at Alon had been granted one. I was told that the Civil Administration doesn’t have a department that grants grazing permits, and that the World Zionist Organization’s Settlement Division grants grazing permits in the West Bank. The division’s job is to set up rural communities to strengthen the periphery of the State of Israel, above all in the West Bank outside the borders of the State of Israel.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>In 2015, the Knesset stipulated by law that the division is Israel’s official settlement agency. It is supervised by the Agriculture Ministry, headed by Minister Uri Ariel, a settler from Kfar Adumim, who already at the end of the ‘70s hatched a plan to expand the settlements in the Khan al-Ahmar (Ma’aleh Adumim) area by evicting all the local Bedouin communities.</p> \n<p>There is no grazing permit from the Civil Administration, but there is certainly an approved plan for an “academy” some 120 meters (394 feet) from Alon’s built-up area. A plywood bulletin board with two printed pages on it – one in Hebrew and one in Arabic – was there Thursday, stuck in the heart of the emptiness and rocks east of the settlement.</p> \n<p>The pages are still white, a sign they were put up recently. They’re signed by architect Natalia Averbuch, chairwoman of the subcommittee for settlement at the Civil Administration’s Supreme Planning Council, Judea and Samaria Region. The pages are not dated. In the notice, Averbuch announces the validity of the academy plan, which the Supreme Planning Council itself approved on August 2.</p> \n<p>From council meetings that took place earlier, it turns out that this is a structure for a pre-military academy, which already exists, in mobile structures in Alon. Once the academy is taken out of the settlement, more room will be made for additional housing units while widening the settlement’s perimeter.</p> \n<p>Construction will be coordinated with the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. The topography isn’t easy, it was noted in the discussion. It was also noted that this is a private institution, while the lot was intended for public structures. But apparently this hurdle was overcome.</p> \n<p>Deliberate intent to mislead</p> \n<p>On the Finance Ministry’s planning-administration website, where the details of the construction plan beyond the Green Line appear transparently, it says the plot is in the area of the village of Anata. But the plan by architect Uriel Rosenheim of Jerusalem says the landowner is “the custodian of abandoned government property in the Judea and Samaria area.” According to the plan, the developer is the World Zionist Organization – the Settlement Division.</p> \n<p>I sent a question to the Settlement Division; when the answer comes, we’ll publish it. I didn’t write to Ze’ev Hever of Amana, or to Yishai, the security coordinator.</p> \n<p>The costs can be estimated from those of another outpost, Havat Pnei Kedem, which aspires to expand to 400 sheep. As its website testifies, with commendable transparency, the project costs some 800,000 shekels, including fencing, an all-terrain vehicle, a week’s work with the vehicle, a guard at night and a security-camera system.</p> \n<p>It also says the settlers are acting “with the full cooperation of the Gush Etztion Regional Council and Zionist Organization. Together with the Agriculture Ministry and professional and business consultants, we have crafted a business plan for raising a flock of 400 sheep.”</p> \n<p>So why is there no transparency about Alon’s planned shepherds’ outpost?</p> \n<p>Since no one has responded to me, everything is guesswork; for example, that the letter is merely a hologram of similar existing outposts. So as not to repeat the mistakes of outposts that were set up on private Palestinian land, leading to problems and legal proceedings, outposts of recent years were built on public Palestinian land, which, with deliberate intent to mislead, is called in Israel state land. The state’s institutions abet the construction in every way while turning a blind eye.</p> \n<p>Take, for example, two shepherds’ outposts in the northern Jordan Valley. Similar to the outpost described in the letter, they consist of sheep, young people and Jewish families with children. One outpost is located east of an older outpost that has been sanitized, Givat Salit. The other is located in the Um Zuqa nature reserve. The Civil Administration said they were both unauthorized and that demolition orders had been issued for them.</p> \n<p>More than two years have passed and the two outposts are thriving; they are connected to the electricity, water and road networks. “The young people and Jewish families,” armed, walk with the flocks in a very wide area, intimidating Palestinian farmers and shepherds in the region, so much so they’re afraid to graze their flocks and cultivate their land.</p> \n<p>Between Alon and Mitzpeh Jericho there are Bedouin shepherds’ communities. One is the Jahalin al-Hilu at Khan al-Ahmar. According to persistent rumors, the community’s structures will be destroyed and its residents will be evicted to the landfill site next week. The settlements of Kfar Adumin and Alon were the first to demand that the High Court of Justice order this demolition, and the justices abided.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A young man who has been a resident of the Jenin refugee camp since the age of three has been detained at an Israeli prison for illegal aliens for the last 20 months. Israel is seeking to deport him to Brazil, where he was born.</p> \n<p>Maen Abu Hafez speaks only Arabic and knows no Portuguese or anyone in Brazil. He hasn’t been in that country since his early years and has no valid Brazilian passport. He was detained in February 2017 at a mobile checkpoint set up between the West Bank towns of Tul Karm and Jenin.</p> \n<p>He was transferred to Israeli immigration detention when it turned out that he had no identification documents other than a letter from the Palestinian Authority confirming that a request for family reunification in the West Bank had been filed for him.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Since then, a court that monitors the detention of people who are in Israel without official documentation extends his remand monthly. HaMoked, the Center for the Defense of the Individual human rights organization took over his case recently after his family could no longer afford private counsel.</p> \n<p>The organization filed an appeal last week against his continued detention in Givon Prison in Ramle. The organization has in its possession a letter from early October, from the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, confirming that a request for family reunification, in his name, is still under review.</p> \n<p>Abu Hafez, who is now 24, came from Brazil to the West Bank in 1997 with his Palestinian father, his Uruguayan mother and three brothers. He was then two years and ten months old. The mother and minor children entered on a tourist visa, valid for three months. They moved with the father to the refugee camp in Jenin, where he had been born.</p> \n<p>The father abandoned his wife and children a few months later, apparently returning to Brazil, and all contact with him was lost. Before leaving in a hurry he failed to request the registration of his children in the Palestinian population registry or to file a request for family reunification for his wife, processes which to this day are under the sole jurisdiction of Israel.</p> \n<p>The wife’s Uruguayan family broke off contact with her since she had converted to Islam before getting married. Since then the mother and her children have been living in the West Bank with no resident status. Without this they cannot get a permit from Israel to visit the detained Abu Hafez.</p> \n<p>Maen Abu Hafez and his brothers grew up with his uncle’s family in the refugee camp. He studied in schools run by UNRWA and the Palestinian Authority. Before his detention he started to work in a car repair shop.</p> \n<p>When he was arrested in February 2017 there were security-related suspicions raised at first, but the police released him after two days. In the absence of an ID card he was transferred to the detention facility. If the suspicions had been validated and supported by evidence there would have been no problem in indicting and trying him, says his attorney, Nadia Daqqa from Hamoked. Brazil has announced that it would not let him in against his will.</p> \n<p>In July 2017 a district court for administrative affairs in Lod rejected his first appeal against his deportation order and his request to return to Palestinian-administered territory. Judge Dr. Michal Agmon-Gonen adopted the Ministry of Interior’s position, explaining her ruling by stating that he was in the West Bank illegally and that the court had no authority to order the deportation of a person to a state he was not a citizen of and that he had no legal status in Palestinian Authority territory. He hadn’t tried to sort out his status there, she said, which is why he couldn’t be returned there.</p> \n<p>Abu Hafez’s detention illustrates a problem that is common to tens of thousands of Palestinians and their family members in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Since the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000 Israel has frozen the family reunification process in these areas it controls, ceasing to give resident status to Palestinian children who were born overseas or to foreign spouses of Palestinian residents.</p> \n<p>This freeze placed tens of thousands of people under a constant threat of deportation, as well as causing families to leave or even break up. In 2006, a legal and public Palestinian campaign was launched by Hamoked, aimed at resuming this process. In 2007 Maen’s uncle submitted a request for family reunification on behalf of his sister-in-law and her children.</p> \n<p>As required by the Oslo Accords, this request was submitted to the civil affairs department of the Palestinian Authority, which was supposed to transfer it to the Israeli coordination and liaison office. In 2008-9 Israel granted resident status to 30,000 people who had submitted similar requests years earlier. Since then, as part of the political sanctions imposed by Israel on the Palestinian Authority, it has not resumed this process.</p> \n<p>The request by the Abu Hafez family, like thousands of other similar ones, have not been transferred by the Palestinian office to the Israeli one, which declared (orally) that it was not accepting such requests. Despite this, last May Authority officials managed to transfer the family’s request to the Israeli office and in early October confirmation from the Coordinator’s office arrived, stating that the request was under review (i.e. had been received).</p> \n<p>The explanations offered by attorney Daqqa did not convince Judge Raja Marzouq, who ordered the continued detention, or the Ministry of Interior’s representative Yaron Brinder. In a court hearing on October 10, Brinder reiterated that the detainee was a Brazilian citizen who must return to his country, and that Israel cannot return him to the territories or to any country he is not a resident of.</p> \n<p>“Only the State of Israel is responsible for people residing in it and it has decided unequivocally, based on the deportation order against him, that he must return to Brazil,” Brinder said in court. In an appeal filed by Daqqa last week she claimed that according to the first section of the 2003 law regulating citizenship and entry into Israel “a resident of an area occupied since 1967 is someone who is registered there or who lives there without being registered, other than residents of Israeli communities.” She added that the arrest of Abu Hafez by Israeli soldiers in the occupied territories was based on the state’s rule there, which means that it does have the authority to return him there.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The race never ends. The number of people in the world is growing rapidly, thus agriculture is constantly trying to improve to feed all those mouths. In the 20th and early 21st centuries the attempts have been successful, if barely. Thanks to sophisticated fertilization, advanced irrigation and pest control, humankind has managed to avert an agricultural crisis.</p> \n<p>Now we seem to be confronting a new challenge. According to a UN report published last month, by 2050 global warming is expected to rack agricultural yields in densely populated regions such as West Africa and India, where yields are expected to decline 2.9% and 2.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, according to a 2016 UN report, agricultural production will have to increase by about 70% by 2050 to feed another 2.3 billion people.</p> \n<p>This challenge hasn’t been lost on Israeli entrepreneurs; in Israel there are about 530 technology companies focusing on agriculture. Israel’s agricultural sector has its origins in the kibbutz movement, but 58% of all active agritech companies were established only about a decade ago, and 40% in the past five years.</p> \n<p>Thus this is a young industry in the Israeli startup scene; about 400 of these outfits employ fewer than 50 workers. “The main problem is that this industry has to prove itself, because it’s new,” says Dikla Montekio Malter, a partner at GreenSoil Investments, which focuses on Israeli agritech and manages about $40 million In Israel.</p> \n<p>She says this sector is still growing, though more slowly than the other branches of Israel’s startup powerhouse. “Unlike the speed of the cybersecurity industry, these are things that take time,” she says, referring to the vagaries of agriculture.</p> \n<p>Still, the Israeli companies aren’t lagging; around the world last year, 7% of all transactions in high-tech agriculture were partnerships with Israeli startups.</p> \n<p>An agritech veteran is Evogene, which was founded in 2001. But the company, which specializes in the genetic engineering of plants, only recently joined the trend of precision agriculture.</p> \n<p>“The challenges haven’t changed, but the tools for dealing with them have,” says Evogene CEO Ofer Haviv. “Think about the field as a factory: You want maximum control over production, but in agriculture it’s dunams of crops. These aren’t only working machines, they’re plants, living creatures that are constantly changing and reacting to their environment. Knowing what’s happening at any given moment is a difficult task.”</p> \n<p>Haviv says the trend is changing thanks to technology that was developed in recent years. “Today sensors in the field can send messages about the amount of water, light and fertilizers, and every day drones circle and photograph the field in high resolution,” he says. “All that is channeled to a central computer that analyzes the data.”</p> \n<p>As Haviv puts it, “It’s a kind of field hospital. It’s a hospital that flies from one plant to the next, gathers information about the patients and sends it to a monitoring center for analysis. For example, the system is capable of recognizing that a specific disease is developing, and will then spray pesticides in a specific spot, not over the entire field. We can see that in a certain area there’s a shortage of fertilizer and increase the amount.”</p> \n<p>Thus fewer resources are needed to guarantee an improved yield. “That means fewer chemicals, fewer polluting fertilizers and more sustainable yields,” Haviv says.</p> \n<p>Creeping revolution</p> \n<p>Through the Phenomics Consortium, sponsored by the Israel Innovation Authority, Evogene cooperates with other players in the industry and the academic world to improve its technology, including Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, the Technion technology institute, the University of Haifa, and the companies Rahan Meristem and Elbit Systems.</p> \n<p>This may seem a strange industry for a defense contractor like Elbit Systems, but Shuki Yehuda, the company’s chief technology officer, says Elbit’s capabilities are made to order for precision agriculture.</p> \n<p>The company combines sensors, data analysis and drones to contribute to the consortium. “We altered a drone for civilian flight and installed electro-optical indexes,” Yehuda says. “We collect the data it gathers and draw a map that updates the farmers about their crops.”</p> \n<p>Yehuda says Elbit Systems is the only company in the world that surveys agricultural plots with hyperspectral sensors, which absorb information from the entire electromagnetic spectrum. He says that in this way one can know, for example, how many chemicals a plant contains.</p> \n<p>“We use methods that weren’t feasible until recently, and this data is being gathered for the first time in a consortium,” Yehuda says. “Today we can test the leaf and estimate precisely the amount of water and photosynthesis.”</p> \n<p>But Yehuda predicts that at least at first, the changing trend won’t lead to lower prices. “I think that as in every such revolution, it begins at a premium; for example, improving the growing of grapes,” he says. “During the initial stage, we’ll want to improve the level of the grape to produce a better wine, and to charge a higher price for it.”</p> \n<p>But he believes that eventually the economics will improve. “That will lead in the end to a significant reduction in prices,” he says. “We’ll save on manpower, fertilizer, water and land, and increase production.”</p> \n<p>Elbit is testing the technology outside Israel as well. At present Elbit’s Hermes 450 drones – which are used by the Israel Defense Forces – are taking off from the runway of Casselton, North Dakota. Over the course of an hour, the company films 160 square kilometers (62 square miles) from a height of 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) in order to sell U.S. farmers information about their fields.</p> \n<p>“What we’re doing is creating databases that will make it possible to analyze data as a function of time. For example, wheat and grapes are annual crops, and every year their level of exposure to the sun and the amount of rainfall change,” Yehuda says.</p> \n<p>The government’s consortium initiative was launched in the past year and is expected to end in another two years. It has a budget of 60 million shekels ($16.5 million).</p> \n<p>That’s a modest sum, considering that Aviv Zeevi, director of technological infrastructure at the Innovation Authority, says there are still plenty of challenges. “For example, when you grow tomatoes, the leaves conceal part of the fruit, which makes it hard for us to know the size of each tomato,” he says. “We have to solve that with algorithms.”</p> \n<p>Zeevi says the Innovation Authority consortium isn’t the only group working in precision agriculture. In 2015, about 500 U.S. companies raised $5 billion for investment in the industry. A key player in the market is tractor maker John Deere, which last year paid $300 million to acquire the California-based startup Blue River Technology, which specializes in automation for farmers’ fields.</p> \n<p>“We didn’t invent anything that’s completely nonexistent,” Zeevi says. “But we’re trying to develop a better and cheaper system than our competitors. It’s not easy for defense firms like Elbit to enter this new field.” Zeevi predicts that one day precision agriculture will become the default choice.</p> \n<p>“It won’t be possible not to use precision agriculture; it makes it possible to germinate more grains of corn,” he says. “If you don’t use the right species and the right technology, you’ll have fewer grains, and your yield won’t be able to compete.”</p> \n<p>Meet the beetles</p> \n<p>A rising star in Israeli agritech is Prospera, which was founded in 2014. The startup’s system analyzes data from irrigation systems, sensors in the ground, satellite photos and the weather. It thereby helps farmers maintain existing yields, predict problems, make decisions in real time and increase production. The company so far has raised about $24 million and employs about 50 people.</p> \n<p>Another company that offers a bird’s-eye solution is Taranis, which since its establishment in 2013 has raised about $10 million. Ofir Schlam, the CEO and co-founder, says that usually, when Taranis demonstrates its services to farmers in their fields, “they’re amazed at a picture of a beetle chewing on a leaf and ask, ‘Wait a second, was that taken from a plane?’ They then call all their workers to come over and take a look.”</p> \n<p>Taranis has developed three patents that make it possible to fly 200 kilometers per hour above agricultural areas and take pictures at a resolution of half a millimeter per pixel. “It would take an agronomist an entire day to walk through the field and document it, while we’re capable of doing it in a few minutes,” Schlam says.</p> \n<p>His company provides farmers with equipment installed on aircraft used for fertilization and pest control. As Schlam puts it, “Farmers are currently losing about 40% of their crop due to diseases, parasites and weeds.”</p> \n<p>To deal with pests effectively, Taranis developed a system that enables drones and planes to fly low at high speed “and at the moment of filming, when the shutter is open, to keep track of the focal point while calculating the acceleration, angles and amount of light,” Schlam says.</p> \n<p>After the field is filmed, the information is sent to Taranis’ servers, which give the farmer a detailed report within 24 hours. Schlam says that with artificial-intelligence software and an in-depth study that was developed with the help of 50 agronomists, every insect and parasite can be identified.</p> \n<p>Not all precision-agriculture firms are involved in increasing yields and killing pests. FruitSpec, which was only founded in 2016, aims to predict the number of fruits (or vegetables) that will eventually ripen in a field.</p> \n<p>“Today, nobody knows how many fruits there are in an orchard until they’re picked,” says CEO Raviv Kula. “But stores and supermarkets make decisions important to farmers based on the yield. After all, if there are too many fruits, their price falls.”</p> \n<p>The challenge, Kula says, is to separate the green fruits, which haven’t yet ripened, from the leaves of the tree. Unlike many companies in the sector, FruitSpec decided not to use drones for that purpose.</p> \n<p>“Drones won’t work in an orchard environment,” Kula says. “Receptors that survey the orchard from above won’t be able to see fruit hanging on trees’ interior sides.”</p> \n<p>Instead of aircraft, FruitSpec offers a motorized device that patrols an orchard’s rows and measures the size of the fruit.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In mid-July, a strange performance played out in the Military Court of Appeals at the Kirya, the defense establishment’s headquarters in Tel Aviv. The judge, an Israel Defense Forces general, called Meretz MK Esawi Freige, from the Israeli Arab town of Kafr Qasem, to the witness stand, and asked him just one question: Would publication of classified documents relating to the massacre in his village in 1956 be likely to stir up its residents?</p> \n<p>Freige, several of whose family members were among the dozens of victims killed by the Border Police, responded that the anger has not dissipated in the 62 years that have passed since the incident. However, the MK emphasized, the villagers are not looking for revenge.</p> \n<p>“We have no interest in disrupting the security of the state or the life of any person,” he said, adding that people know exactly where Brig. Gen. (res.) Issachar “Yiska” Shadmi, the highest-ranking officer to be brought to trial after the event, lives.</p> \n<p>Shadmi, the commander of the brigade responsible for that area at the time – and under whose orders the massacre was carried out – was not far away at the time, sitting in his spacious home in the upscale neighborhood of Ramat Aviv. He didn’t know that his name was once again being raised in connection with the affair that had hounded him for his entire adult life, like a mark of Cain imprinted on his forehead.</p> \n<p>The trial, which is still ongoing, involves a lawsuit by historian Adam Raz, who is demanding that the IDF and Defense Establishment Archives declassify documents relating to the affair. “Most of the material is still classified,” says Raz, 35, who works for the Berl Katznelson Foundation, in a recent interview with Haaretz. “I was surprised to discover that it’s easier to write about the history of Israel’s nuclear program than about Israel’s policies regarding its Arab citizens.” The court has yet to hand down its judgment, but Raz’s Hebrew-language book “Kafr Qasem Massacre: A Political Biography,” is being published this month by Carmel Press. It is the first such comprehensive study of the affair.</p> \n<p>One of the people Raz interviewed was Shadmi, who died last month at the age of 96. Back in the summer of 2017, this writer joined Raz for the conversations with Shadmi, which took place at the latter’s home. With the frankness often reserved to those who have reached a ripe old age, Shadmi provided a rare, troubling behind-the-scenes look at one of the formative events in the history of the State of Israel, and especially of its Arab community. Among other things, the incident gave rise to the concept of a “blatantly illegal order,” and led to an exceptional apology by the president of Israel for a crime that the state’s soldiers committed against its citizens.</p> \n<p>Now, in the wake of Shadmi’s death and the publication of Raz’s book, we are publishing the former IDF officer’s testimony for the first time. At its center is his contention that the 1958 court case against him was nothing more than a show trial, staged in order to keep Israel’s security and political elite – including Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan, and GOC Central Command (and later chief of staff) Tzvi Tzur – from having to take responsibility for the massacre.</p> \n<p>Shadmi told us that the trial, in which he was initially accused of murder but later acquitted, was intended to mislead the international community with regard to Israel’s ostensible pursuit of justice. For his part, Raz is convinced that the background to ostensibly staging the trial was pressure from above to conceal “Operation Mole” (Hafarperet), a secret program to expel to Jordan the population of the so-called Triangle of Arab towns, located southeast of Haifa – details of which have never been revealed.</p> \n<p>Shadmi was blessed to have been able to age in dignity. In his final years, he was lucid and enjoyed good health. When he died, he was buried in the cemetery of the kibbutz of which he had been an early member, Sdot Yam in Caesarea. In our long conversations with him, he recalled minute details of the formative incident in his life.</p> \n<p>“This subject has always disturbed me. Why? Because when people say ‘Kafr Qasem,’ they say ‘Shadmi.’ ‘Shadmi, the guy from Kafr Qasem,’” he said. “There are those who step on a land mine and lose their legs. I stepped on a land mine. Its name was Kafr Qasem.”</p> \n<p>‘Good Arabs, bad Arabs’</p> \n<p>Yiska Shadmi’s life was replete with all the episodes one would expect in the biography of a member of the so-called 1948 generation, the generation that founded the state. Were it not for the stain of Kafr Qasem, he would have entered the history books as one of the first senior commanders of the IDF, and perhaps he would even have gone into politics, like his friend and peer Yitzhak Rabin.</p> \n<p>Shadmi was born in 1922, the sabra son of two immigrants from Eastern Europe, Shoshana (n&eacute;e Goldberg) and Nahum Kramer. The family name, meaning “grocer” or “peddler” in German, was Hebraicized to Shadmi, a derivation of the biblical word shdema, or field. “Agriculture, not commerce and the stock market. This was the Zionist revolution,” he wrote in his memoir.</p> \n<p>Nahum had served in the Red Army, and became one of the first commanders of the Haganah pre-state army and then of the nascent IDF. Yiska, an only child, spent his earliest years on the agricultural settlement Bitanya, near Lake Kinneret, before moving with his parents to the nearby community of Menahemia.</p> \n<p>As a boy, he received initial training for the Haganah. In his memoir, he writes of his first military operation, serving as aide de camp to Haganah officer Yigal Allon, who would later serve as the legendary commander of the elite Palmach strike force. At about the same time, during the years of the Arab Revolt (1936-1939), Shadmi became aware for the first time of the Jewish-Arab conflict.</p> \n<p>“I grew up together with Arab children. We were friends and would play together. To me, Arabs were not foreigners that one needed to hate or fear. I grew up with them, I spoke with them, they spoke Hebrew and Yiddish, and I spoke Arabic mixed with Yiddish,” he wrote in his personal diary. “When the riots broke out, a rift was opened. There were good Arabs, who worked, and bad Arabs, who shot guns. In the context of the fears that gave rise to the conflict, I began to discover the figure of the Jewish hero, riding a horse with a keffiyeh and an abaya [robe].”</p> \n<p>In a different entry, from 1938, he wrote: “Today we are in a terrible situation in this land, a whirlpool of blood. Self-restraint is weakening and acts of vengeance are taking its place. We don’t have the strength to bear it any longer. The beast-like instinct within us is awakened by the scene of blood flowing throughout the land… The rifle is the tool that gives every one of us the privilege of living. Were it not for the rifle, we would not be able to stay alive in this cruel world… I respect the device that kills!!!”</p> \n<p>In 1939, Shadmi joined Kibbutz Sdot Yam, which had initially been founded in 1936 north of Haifa but moved south to Caesarea in 1940. He served in the British Mandate’s coast guard, and later as a Palmach platoon commander at Beit Ha’arava, near the Dead Sea, and as a commander in the Haganah Field Corps in Samaria. During “Black Sabbath” in 1946 (when Mandatory forces rounded up several thousand Jewish soldiers and officials, following a spate of violent actions by Jewish forces), he was arrested and taken to a British detention camp. In the War of Independence, he commanded the Fifth Battalion of the Harel Brigade and the Seventh Battalion of the Negev Brigade. Afterward, he climbed the ranks in the IDF and served, among other positions, as commander of the Officers Training School and of the Golani Brigade.</p> \n<p>Then 62 years ago this month, Shadmi stepped on his land mine. It all began on October, 29, 1956, the first day of what would be called the Sinai Campaign. Shadmi, then responsible for a Central Command brigade, was tasked with defending the area abutting the Jordanian border, and ordered the ongoing curfew that was then in effect, under martial law, to begin earlier than usual that day on the Arab villages in the vicinity, among them Kafr Qasem.</p> \n<p>The commander of the Border Police battalion, Shmuel Malinki, said later during the trial held for him and the soldiers involved in the events, that Shadmi’s order said to shoot at anyone who violated curfew. The words that he attributed to Shadmi have since entered the history books: “During the hours of the curfew, they can be in their homes and do as they desire… but whomever is seen outside, who violates curfew, will be shot. Better that a few go down, and then they will learn for the next time.”</p> \n<p>Malinki also said that in response to his question: “What will be the fate of the civilians who return to the village after the curfew [takes effect],” Shadmi said: “I don’t want sentimentality; I don’t want detainees.” When Malinki persisted in his request to receive a straight answer, he claimed that Shadmi said, “Allah Yerhamu” – Arabic for “God have mercy [on their souls].”</p> \n<p>At his trial, Shadmi denied ordering the killing of curfew violators. Whatever the case, the result was a disaster. Between 5 P.M. and 6 P.M. on that fateful day, 47 Arabs who were returning to their homes in Kafr Qasem – boys and girls, women and men – were shot to death by Border Guard troops. An additional victim, who was elderly, had a heart attack after he learned that his grandchild had been killed. In the end, according to the villagers, the total number of victims was 51.</p> \n<p>Eight of the 11 IDF officers and soldiers put on trial for the shootings were convicted and sent to prison for varying terms, but later their sentences were commuted, by the president and chief of staff, among others. By 1960, all had been released without having served most of their jail terms. Some were even awarded desirable state jobs – Malinki, for instance, was appointed chief of security at the nuclear reactor at Dimona by Ben-Gurion.</p> \n<p>A little more than two years after the bloody massacre at Kafr Qasem, Shadmi became the highest-ranking officer to be brought to trial for it. He was accused of the murder of 25 villagers (half of the victims, because there was no proof that the order to shoot violators of the curfew had been intended to include women and children, as it was interpreted). In the end, Shadmi was exonerated of the murder charges: The judge determined that the accusations against him were “unproven and unsubstantiated generally and in principle.” The ruling stated that “the orders to shoot violators of the curfew could not be understood in any way as orders to shoot people returning from work to the area under curfew.”</p> \n<p>Shadmi was convicted on only one procedural and technical charge – of “exceeding his authority” and giving orders regarding the hours and parameters of the curfew, when only the military governor was authorized to do so. The punishment he received infuriated the residents of Kafr Qasem: a symbolic fine of 10 prutot, or one-100th of an Israeli pound, and a reprimand.</p> \n<p>When he left the courthouse, Shadmi excitedly waved his hand, grasping a 10-prutot coin. A photo of this was published in the press and Shadmi’s coin thus became a watchword among Arab citizens of what they saw as the cheapness of their lives in the eyes of the regime.</p> \n<p>‘Not Don Quixote’</p> \n<p>Shadmi celebrated his “victory” with Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, who described in his own diary how “we drank to his exoneration.” A party was held at Sdot Yam, with Chief of Staff Haim Laskov and other IDF generals in attendance. Yet in retrospect, Shadmi told Adam Raz and myself, the expressions of joy were mostly for public consumption; he was not at all surprised by the verdict he received. He told us that the outcome of the trial, which he called a “play” and a “show trial,” was fixed from the start. From his descriptions – some of which also appear in his self-published memoir – it seems that the legal proceedings were conducted in defiance of all accepted norms.</p> \n<p>From the start, he claimed, he was promised the best legal defense. The state appointed the highly respected attorney Yaacov Salomon – and paid for his services. In light of this, Shadmi said he felt the balance of power between the weak military prosecutor and the superlative defense he was awarded was always tilted in his favor.</p> \n<p>Moreover, according to Shadmi, “I was told that I could object to the judges that were appointed if I didn’t trust them.” He also received assurances from another senior IDF and legal figure, Meir Shamgar, deputy military adjutant general at the time and later president of the Supreme Court. Shamgar, Shadmi recalled, “took me aside and said: ‘Listen, this is a show trial,’” and urged him not to worry. Shadmi added that “Shamgar whispered to me that this was to my benefit.”</p> \n<p>Asked now for his response to Shadmi’s comment, former justice Shamgar told Haaretz that he did not remember saying such things.</p> \n<p>Eventually, Shadmi said he understood that he had truly become an actor in a grand performance – after his attorney, Salomon, “tried to brainwash me and persuade me to take a defensive position that I didn’t like and didn’t match the facts as they were known to me. Facts that gave me moral courage in asserting the justice of my case and of my honest and simple claims.”</p> \n<p>For some two weeks before the trial opened, he and Salomon stayed at a Tel Aviv hotel, working on their arguments “every day until 2 A.M.,” Shadmi recounted. “He wanted to break me, so that I would accept the version that he would dictate to me, what I should say in court…. He tried to plant things in my head.”</p> \n<p>Behind his words hid Shadmi’s most serious criticism, according to which Salomon, as Ben-Gurion’s emissary, tried to use Shadmi as a means to distance senior IDF commanders and the political echelon from the Kafr Qasem massacre – as a kind of punching bag to stand trial in their stead and prevent the indictments of others.</p> \n<p>In the center of the drama stood Tzvi “Chera” Tzur, who was Shadmi’s superior officer at the time of the massacre and later became the IDF’s sixth chief of staff. Shadmi was convinced that the judges “needed to protect Chera” and that his attorney “was not protecting me, but protecting the IDF and Tchera and the rest of those…. So this wouldn’t climb any higher,” in his words.</p> \n<p>These comments may sound conspiratorial, but Raz found support for them from yet another source. In a meeting of the cabinet on November 23, 1958, about a month before the opening of Shadmi’s trial, Ben-Gurion was already predicting, “From talking with Shadmi, I assume that he will not say that he received an order like that, that one needs to fire…. Tzur isn’t on trial. Shadmi won’t say such a thing.”</p> \n<p>Shadmi also noted that his father, who until 1958 was president of the Military Court of Appeals, was a friend of Shamgar’s: “Shamgar told my father ‘Explain to your son that they aren’t out to get him, but want to protect the IDF.”</p> \n<p>According to Shadmi, Ben-Gurion, by means of his underlings, made sure that the military judges appointed to conduct the trial would be among those who had been under Tzur’s command in the Givati Brigade, so they would not exactly feel comfortable incriminating him. “They were not chosen by chance,” Shadmi told us. “And in their outlooks and political positions, they were aligned with the same party of which Ben-Gurion was an admired leader.”</p> \n<p>On this point, however, Shadmi qualified his statement: “I am not at all convinced that the judges consciously saw themselves as someone else’s emissaries.” And indeed, according to him, “those who dispatched them to the court intended, quite clearly, that they would assist naturally in building an obstacle against accusations, even partial ones, involving the most senior ranks.”</p> \n<p>Ultimately, as Shadmi admitted, he went along with his attorney’s game and adapted himself to the defense dictated to him. “I also set a barrier for myself at the beginning of the trial, because I knew the legal rule – that if someone with a higher rank than mine is implicated in the accusations, that doesn’t relieve me of responsibility. And that is also the reason I did not try to press my attorney to call the general [Tzur] to testify at the trial.”</p> \n<p>Added Shadmi, “I was an IDF man, and if needed, I would keep silent about all sorts of things about which I knew more or differently. I didn’t sally forth like Don Quixote to fight for my justice, because I knew what they wanted from me.”</p> \n<p>Wrapped in cotton</p> \n<p>Shadmi thought that his trial was intended to prevent the case from reaching the International Court of Justice, which had been established by the United Nations in The Hague following World War II. “They explained to me that they needed to put me on trial, because if I had tried in my own country and convicted, even if I was fined only a penny, I wouldn’t go to The Hague…. If they didn’t prosecute me… I would be tried at The Hague. And that is something that neither I nor the country were interested in.”</p> \n<p>It bears mentioning here that in those days, the ICJ did not operate in a way that would made it possible to put Israeli officers or politicians on trial. However, as historian Raz notes, “the fact Shadmi was mistaken about the international judicial system, didn’t mean that there wasn’t real concern in the Israeli upper echelons about an international response.” According to Raz, from Ben-Gurion’s response to the affair, it appears that the Israeli leadership was in fact “very worried about the potential international response.” But if there is any documentation of this in the state archives, it is not accessible to the public.</p> \n<p>Shadmi’s account, as we heard it last year in his home, are borne out by the facts appearing in the archival documents. Indeed, Raz did encounter other testimony in the army archives suggesting that already then, people were calling for more senior figures than Shadmi to stand trial.</p> \n<p>Thus, for instance, Transportation Minister Moshe Carmel wrote: “We will not be able to avoid asking questions and won’t be able to flinch from investigating if indeed the final and ultimate responsibility falls upon Col. Shadmi, and on him alone…. A commander does not operate, in the end, on his own say-so, but within a framework of plans, orders and guidelines, formed somewhere else, invented for him by a higher commanding authority…. The public seeks to know, and rightly so, what orders and guidelines were given to Col. Shadmi by his superiors, according to which he operated and dispatched subsequent, more particular directives…. And also from whom he received his orders.”</p> \n<p>Later on, the grandson of Yitzhak Greenbaum, Israel’s first interior minister, related the following: “When the Kafr Qasem massacre occurred, my grandfather explained to me how an order for a massacre is handed down from the senior members of government to operational personnel, without the senior ranks saying anything explicit that might seem like an order.”</p> \n<p>In 1986, in an article by Dalia Karpel in the Tel Aviv weekly Ha’ir, Malinki’s widow was quoted as saying: “Part of the trial was conducted behind closed doors and it was clear that it was impossible to go up the chain of command looking for responsible parties, and to reveal the part of the GOC Central Command, chief of staff or even the government in this affair. It would mar the image of the state in the world. Ben-Gurion told my husband: ‘I am asking for a human sacrifice on behalf of the state, just as there are sacrificial casualties, people who fall in war. I promise you that your status and rank will be returned to you.”</p> \n<p>On the basis of testimonies, written and recorded, that he gathered, Raz is convinced of Shadmi’s version of events, according to which the whole trial was fixed: “Ben-Gurion sought an insurance policy that would enable him to point to Shadmi as the one who gave the order, and to stop there.... Shadmi would be prosecuted because Ben-Gurion and his colleagues needed to prove to the public and the political establishment that the chain of command led no further than the brigade commander. And in the end, as noted, [Shadmi] was also exonerated.”</p> \n<p>Shadmi’s silence with respect to those above him paid off, even if not immediately. On the military level, his promising career came to an end in 1962, and he was not promoted to the rank of full general like his peers. He continued to serve in the reserves, fighting in the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War, in which he was seriously wounded in a helicopter crash.</p> \n<p>Behind the scenes, though, as Shadmi claimed, a deal was cooked up that paid off later for both sides. “Chera wrapped me up in cotton,” he said, referring to Tzvi Tzur. “I got anything I wanted,” he recalled candidly.</p> \n<p>The details of the entire affair, had they surfaced today, would have been tagged immediately as being tainted by corruption and liable to land people in court. Nonetheless, all these years later, Shadmi was quick to acknowledge that because of the “debt” that Tzur owed him, for not revealing all he knew in the courtroom, he was well compensated as a civilian: “I turned into a major Defense Ministry building contractor.”</p> \n<p>Shadmi went into some detail regarding the lucrative work from his defense work, but requested that these parts of the interviews not be recorded. He added that Tzur took care of him “with an open hand” in this regard. The reason, he emphasized time and again, was that, “I kept quiet, I didn’t speak out against the IDF. Tzur understood that I saved him.”</p> \n<p>‘Operation Mole’</p> \n<p>Adam Raz is convinced that there was a reason that Shadmi’s trial was staged and aimed to protect his superior officers, as well as for other reasons. Raz believes there was an effort at the same time to hide the existence of a secret program called “Operation Mole,” whose goal was the expulsion of Arabs from the Triangle, which included Kafr Qasem, to Jordan.</p> \n<p>“The public is familiar with the ‘Mole’ program only as a rumor,” says Raz, noting that it has been mentioned in the press only a handful of times over the years, since the 1960s. In 1991, the journalist and linguist Ruvik Rosenthal dealt with the subject in the newspaper Hadashot, and later expanded his article in a collection of essays he edited about the Kafr Qasem massacre. But details of the program were never fully revealed, and much of the documentation remains classified in the IDF archive. The evidence includes closed-door discussions held during the Kafr Qasem trials. The speakers used only code, referring to a “famous order” dealing with “an animal of the mammalian family.”</p> \n<p>Still Raz managed to follow the scent of the secret scheme by means of other sources, among them lawyers involved in the trial of Malinki and the soldiers, other testimony, interviews with the “heroes of the affair,” etc. In a meticulous archival investigation, he unearthed tidbits, such as: “A. Surround the village; B. announce the evacuation to the village elders and the option to cross the border within the established period (three hours).”</p> \n<p>In addition, Raz was able to find the written testimony of Gen. (res.) Avraham “Avrasha” Tamir, the architect of the program, according to which “Ben-Gurion requested a plan to deal with the Arab population of the Triangle” in the event that a war would break out with Jordan. Tamir’s account accords with the explanation given by Ben-Gurion himself, in 1953, at a cabinet meeting on the subject of martial law – to the effect that there was a solution to the ostensible problem of the Arabs in the Triangle, and that it “depended upon whether there would be a war or not.”</p> \n<p>Tamir’s testimony states: “The plans were more or less mine… I took what the Americans did to the Japanese in World War II [imprisoning them in internment camps out of concern that they would constitute a “fifth column”]. To put it simply, if war broke out, whoever did not flee to Jordan would be evacuated to concentration camps in the rear; they wouldn’t stay on the border. These were the plans, to evacuate them to the rear so that they wouldn’t impede the war effort…. The way to Jordan would remain open for their flight if they so chose. But whoever remained – we would need to evacuate them to the rear to facilitate freedom of action in which the defense forces could maneuver.”</p> \n<p>To understand the historical context connecting Operation Mole, the Sinai Campaign and the Kafr Qasem massacre, one must remember that in roughly that same period, up until the Six-Day War, when Israel conquered the West Bank, Arab villages like Kafr Qasem were situated very close to the border with Jordan. In the weeks before the massacre, tensions rose and many infiltrators penetrated Israel. The IDF was increasingly worried about cooperation between the latter and their countrymen in the Israeli villages. Until 1966, martial law was in effect in those communities, among them Kafr Qasem.</p> \n<p>The massacre occurred on the day the Sinai Campaign began: In it, Israel, England and France joined forces in fighting against Egypt, and eventually the IDF conquered the Sinai peninsula. In a certain sense, the massacre was part of that same war, but took place on a completely different front, as Rubik Rosenthal wrote in his 2000 book “Kafr Qasem: Events and Myth” (Hakibbutz Hameuchad), the first book about the massacre.</p> \n<p>In the period prior to the Sinai Campaign, Israel launched a diversionary operation, in the context of which forces were concentrated along the Jordanian border, including the area of Kafr Qasem, to create the impression that Israel was preparing an attack on its eastern front. “The lower ranking officers and troops that participated in the operations thought that war really was breaking out on the eastern border,” writes Rosenthal.</p> \n<p>Raz thinks one must see the Kafr Qasem massacre in this context: “The massacre wasn’t perpetrated by a group of soldiers who were out of control, as has been argued until today. From their point of view they were following orders, which in essence would lead to the expulsion of the villagers,” he says. Or, in other words, they were operating in line with the directives of Operation Mole, as they understood them.</p> \n<p>Raz’s study presents much testimony that supports this view. In his book he reconstructs the hour-by-hour chain of events that led to the horrifying outcome on that fateful day, and thus proves his claim that there is a connection between the massacre and the secret operation.</p> \n<p>Thus, for example, he provides authoritative documentation about meetings prior to the massacre between the battalion commander, Malinki, and other top brass, which dealt with the secret scheme – sometimes explicitly and sometimes without actually naming it. On October 24, five days before the killings in Kafr Qasem, Malinki met with the GOC Central Command Tzur.</p> \n<p>According to Malinki’s testimony, he was told that, with war approaching, one of the missions of his battalion would be to deal with the Arab villages in the Triangle. “There is a complex portfolio at the Operations Directorate and I must prepare the mission,” he said.</p> \n<p>On October 25, Malinki met with the military governor, Zalman Mart, who emphasized that “the issue is how to motivate them [the Arabs] to leave the country.” Several hours later, Malinki met with Tamir, then chief of Central Command’s operations branch. The latter conveyed the directives of the plan.</p> \n<p>“A plan was conveyed to me,” said Malinki. “The general context was explained, and the urgency…. We must prepare the plan as quickly as possible so that it will be ready for immediate implementation…. This is a most secret plan.”</p> \n<p>He later testified that on October 28, the day prior to the massacre, he met with Shadmi, the brigade commander, who asked him to wait until he received orders from Central Command about Operation Mole, “which I was supposed to execute,” as Malinki put it. “The Mole commanders discussed issues concerning the treatment of the Arab minority in the area under martial law…. Execution of arrests…. Imposition of curfew…. Complete evacuation of the villages if the need arises.”</p> \n<p>On the morning of October 29, Shadmi announced that the plan had not been authorized in its entirety, but particular clauses would “of course” be authorized by the afternoon. As to what happened in the meeting between Shadmi and Malinki, a few hours later, it emerges that a dispute broke out that dogged them both until their final days.</p> \n<p>Malinki, as noted, testified that Shadmi ordered him to fire “without sentimentality” in order to kill whoever violated the curfew. Shadmi denied this. Later on, when meeting his soldiers just before the massacre, Malinki explained to them that war was about to break out. In other words, the secret plan, whether officially or only as something hovering in the background, was in the minds of troops of every rank – from the highest commander to the lowliest foot soldier. After the massacre, Shadmi also admitted himself that “the final proposal before embarking on the day of the operation took the form of an Operation Mole directive passed down from Central Command. That order specified in detail the method of evacuation of the population from the area along the border during the first stage of the deployment of forces.”</p> \n<p>According to Shadmi, in testimony he gave to the police, prior to being charged, “I showed [Malinki] immediately the Mole orders... according to which we were to prepare the operation. Malinki answered me … with a self-satisfied smile and informed me that the entire portfolio of the secret operation was all planned out. Therefore, I saw him at that moment as an expert about everything that had been discussed.”</p> \n<p>Two months after the massacre, Malinki claimed that he had not been comfortable under Shadmi’s command, but didn’t do anything about it.</p> \n<p>“I thought about calling the commander of the Border Police, but that seemed like an act of disloyalty with regard to the officer in question. I didn’t know [Shadmi], but as I was a witness to his conversations with the general [Tzur] with regard to the Mole and as I had personally received the order for that operation from headquarters – I was stunned by the drastic approach that had been decided upon, but didn’t doubt that this was a decision of the highest authority, and I saw the brigade commander as a pipeline,” Malinki later wrote to Ben-Gurion.</p> \n<p>General Tzur himself responded to the secret plan, in testimony before the investigative commission that Ben-Gurion convened immediately after the massacre, prior to the trial. He explained that Operation Mole “relates to the entire country and all are working according to the same methodology,” adding that the operation was part of an overall plan of war vis-a-vis Jordan.</p> \n<p>In this context, Raz believes that plans for Operation Mole “fulfilled a central purpose in motivating the troops to succeed in their mission [in Kafr Qasem].” According to him, “they correctly understood the harsh curfew order as an initial stage in the expulsion of the residents of the villages, and acted to the maximal degree to follow their orders ... They were correct in their interpretation: They indeed imposed the curfew, whose objective was the expulsion of the Arabs in the event that Israel and Jordan found themselves in a state of war.”</p> \n<p>Here is where the staged trial that Shadmi claims was conducted, enters the picture. In its course, as noted, he covered for his superiors and did not open his mouth about Operation Mole.</p> \n<p>Raz: “What did they want of Shadmi? They wanted him not to tell the truth. And the truth is that the plan for which the troops and officers were training, and the plan that was put into action, in large part, was Operation Mole.”</p> \n<p>The option of expelling the Arabs of the Triangle in a future time of war with Jordan, he adds, “was a policy that could be implemented, from the perspective of Ben-Gurion, Dayan and others.” Indeed, much of the testimony the historian found from a variety of sources support that view, including that of Dayan, who said at one point: “I hope that in the coming years there will perhaps be another opportunity to effect a transfer of these Arabs from the Land of Israel.” According to Raz, “the conditions on the eve of the Sinai Campaign enabled them to progress toward realization of the plan.”</p> \n<p>Based on the vast array of materials Raz compiled, a small portion of which are detailed here, he declares: “The fact that Shadmi ordered implementation of parts of the plan [i.e., Operation Mole] – up to the expulsion order itself – is not, according to my analysis, in doubt. But it’s clear that the order for this arrived from on high.” Shadmi, says Raz, “understood that he was being used as a main character in a performance intended to cover for those truly responsible: Ben-Gurion, Moshe Dayan and Tzvi Tzur.”</p> \n<p>At present Raz is waiting for the decision of the military appeals court as to whether he will be allowed to examine all the classified documents relating to the affair of the massacre at Kafr Qasem, and more generally those relating to Operation Mole. For its part, the army claims that declassifying these documents will impair the security of the state, its relations with foreign entities, and also the privacy and well-being of various individuals.</p> \n<p>As for Shadmi himself, he raised four children with his wife, Pnina, a math teacher who died in 2013; there are also grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Their son, Col. (res.) Yiftah Shadmi, served as a fighter pilot in the air force.</p> \n<p>Shadmi’s memoir was eventually self-published, unlike his personal diary. Leafing through them, one finds these comments about death: “Consciously, I force myself not to be afraid [of it], and have also begun to believe that there is nothing to fear. For at the very worst, one could be killed. Indeed, it’s a pity to give up on life, but the awareness that one fell for the sake of the homeland is the reward and the atonement for the life one gives up. In one sense, I have no desire to die before I fulfill my obligation, to do the maximum in my power for the country and the nation. I want there to be no distinction between the benefit that I can bring during my lifetime, and that which I can bring in sacrificing myself upon the altar of defense.”</p>",

Other ministries providing funding include the Science, Technology and Space Ministry, the Environmental Protection Ministry and the ministries of social equality, justice and education. Some of the funds will come from this year's budget, with the rest coming from the 2018 budget.</p> \n<p>The new construction in Hebron is the first substantial Jewish settlement construction there in a decade.

The city has the highest number of diagnosed new cases of the highly contagious disease in Israel, and some figures in the field of public health say they’re not sure the Health Ministry is up to the challenge of containing its spread.</p> \n<p>In the year to date, 341 cases of measles have been reported in Jerusalem — more than half of all reported cases in the country this year. In September alone, 213 new cases were reported, and experts expect the total number of cases in the current outbreak to be 10 times that number.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“Hospitals in Jerusalem are getting between five and 10 new cases of measles every day,” said a senior physician who specializes in diseases said and was speaking on condition of anonymity. “The medical teams are doing Sisyphean work to try to locate everyone who may have come in contact with each patient, but they can’t keep up, and the disease continues to spread.”</p> \n<p>The physician said the Health Ministry must launch a national information campaign calling on residents to stay current with their vaccines, the situation will get worse and the disease will spread to other areas of the country. “Such a contagious disease won’t just stay in Jerusalem, it will spread. We have a problem and we must solve it,” he said.</p> \n<p>Health officials began to express concern in August, when the number of new measles diagnoses in the Jerusalem area suddenly jumped to 69, from six to nine a month. Doctors were urged to refer unvaccinated children for immunization. Vaccination campaigns were carried out in neighborhoods with low vaccination rates, with a focus on ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods. These efforts were only partially successful, as the steep jump of new cases in September demonstrated.</p> \n<p>“The problem in Jerusalem is in areas and populations, like some of the ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, with pockets of non-vaccination, or where not everybody gets vaccinated,” said Prof. Yechiel Schlesinger, an expert in infectious diseases and director of the Wilf Children’s Hospital at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>“We’re in a situation where a critical mass has been created and thus the outbreak is serious. We are seeing a significant rise in the number of diagnoses — in adults, but mainly in children,” Schlesinger said.</p> \n<p>He said the children coming to the hospital are either babies under a year old who have yet to get their first dose of the vaccine, or older children who have never been vaccinated or never got the second dose.</p> \n<p>“At this point, fortunately, we don’t have patients in intensive care but we have kids with serious pneumonia, and a pregnant woman who was infected, whose baby had to be treated with antibodies immediately after birth to prevent him from getting sick. In previous outbreaks there were more serious cases,” Schlesinger said.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: Vaccinate Your Children |&nbsp;Editorial</p> \n<p>Schlesinger said that in Jerusalem, the low vaccination rate in some neighborhoods isn’t necessarily the result of some principled decision or deliberate choice, but rather a lack of awareness and understanding of the implications of failing to vaccinate.</p> \n<p>And even people who think they’ve been immunized are not necessarily protected.</p> \n<p>“What many people don’t know is that there’s a large segment of the population, those born between 1957 and 1977, that wasn’t properly vaccinated,” said Prof. Eli Schwartz, an expert in infectious diseases at Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer. “The Health Ministry warns travelers to Europe and countries where measles is endemic [to get vaccinated] but it has to focus on populations that were not properly immunized and call on them to get vaccinated,” he said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Saudi Arabia has been waging a cruel war in Yemen for more than three years. Millions of Yemenis have become refugees and 22 million of the country’s inhabitants rely on humanitarian aid for food and provisions. That aid, too, is limited. The Saudi siege – by sea, in the air and on the ground – is preventing access to millions of people. The United Nations recently declared that what is unfolding in Yemen is the world’s most serious humanitarian catastrophe.</p> \n<p>But the war in Yemen is forgotten by most of the world, rarely making the newscasts. It’s apparently too much to be shocked at the horrors in Syria, Libya and Yemen at the same time. And thus, Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman can enjoy the status of a political star, even as he lays waste to the neighboring country.</p> \n<p>All that was true until the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul a month ago. Overnight, the young, charismatic prince morphed into an arch-villain, and Saudi Arabia became the kingdom of evil. Even Donald Trump was forced to profess shock. And it really is appalling: A journalist is tortured and murdered outside his country and his body is chopped up. As if it had ever really been possible to think, before the murder, that Saudi Arabia was the embodiment of a functioning democracy.</p> \n<p>Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was able to turn the Khashoggi affair into a one-man police drama. Like a detective or an investigating judge, he delivered a brilliant prosecution speech against the Saudis, presenting to the world the “naked truth” about the journalist’s murder. The media worldwide reported obsessively about the revelations in the case. Gradually a detailed picture emerged, just as you might expect from the TV detective series “CSI.”</p> \n<p>But the truth that was presented on-screen, both in Erdogan’s speech and in the media in general, concealed a ludicrous show of major hypocrisy. First, it ignored the fact that Saudi Arabia, its moderate image notwithstanding, kills civilians all the time – not only in Yemen but on its own soil too (executions are not rare events in the kingdom; indeed, in August a citizen of Myanmar was crucified in Mecca after being convicted of murder and theft). Second, Erdogan himself persecutes journalists on a wholesale basis, and Turkey has been termed “the world’s biggest prison for journalists” by Reporters Without Borders. Third, freedom of the press and human rights are deteriorating in dozens of countries, and not just in the Middle East – due in no small measure to Trump himself, who has no compunctions about branding the media as the enemy of the people. But all these are trends, developments, processes. Nothing can compete with a snappy court drama.</p> \n<p>A perusal of the newscasts in the past few months shows that the Khashoggi affair is not alone. The events that generate the greatest resonance are those that are framed on the news as ongoing detective investigations: the episode of the poisoned Russian spy Sergei Skripal, the affair of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the case of Sara Netanyahu. These are not routine crime stories; they are political affairs that take the form of criminal investigations, with all the suspects and all the evidence that they can entail.</p> \n<p>Leaders also have a new role: They pose as top lawyers. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to interrogation rooms himself, assumes the role of attorney time and again, presenting “new evidence” about the Iranian nuclear project. In contrast, the Russian defense minister presents evidence meant to prove Israel’s guilt in the downing of the Russian plane over Syria in September. And in that case, too, despite the hypocrisy ingrained in the Russian stance, the accusations are accepted with absolute seriousness.</p> \n<p>An effective speech by a leader no longer presents a political doctrine or new ideas, but judicial revelations. Trump’s remarks last weekend following the massacre in the Pittsburgh synagogue contained a few scandalous statements, but that was of no interest to Ayala Hasson on Israel’s TV Channel 10 news. Ensconced in the studio, she cut off the broadcast of his comments because, Trump “didn’t provide new information.”</p> \n<p>The media aren’t looking for an expression of this or that ideology, but rather seek dazzling forensic details. If it’s not legal-related, it’s not interesting. If there’s no suspect, there’s no point turning on the TV. No wonder the revelation about identification of a hair found on the body of Tair Rada – a girl who was murdered 12 years ago in Kiryat Shmona – sent reporters scurrying to the studios as though World War III had erupted. That drama was highlighted even earlier, in the miniseries “Shadow of Truth.” Young people who have never read a newspaper in their life and wouldn’t recognize the Knesset building or the country’s president, are experts about every mitochondrion in the cells of A.H., whose DNA matches that of the hair. The case of Roman Zadorov, who was convicted of Rada’s murder, will likely linger on even after Israel ceases to exist, floating in interstellar space.</p> \n<p>It’s surprising sometimes to see how, amid all the uncertainty of our era, the belief in judicial truth continues to exist and is even gaining strength. Leaders of enemy countries, who seemingly agree on nothing, behave as though they’re all in one courtroom and presenting evidence to the jury. It’s important to take note of this, especially during a period in which clich&eacute;s about the “post-truth era” are bandied about: The judicial truth is enjoying an unprecedented status.</p> \n<p>Political dialogue in its conventional form, with parties and arguments about society and the economy, is collapsing in a grotesque show of grunts and groans. In his book “Futurability,” published last year, the Marxist thinker Franco Berardi maintains that democracy will not recover from its present crisis. In this age of fragility, he writes, an impotent public will be incapable of creating effective forms of autonomy, of fomenting change by dint of its willpower or of bringing about changes democratically, because the age of democracy is over.</p> \n<p>In many places globally, there are no longer many people who still expect to bring about political change through a party that participates in a democratic public debate. The only method that still works is to produce evidence about a crime that was committed in the past. We are all prosecutors and we are all judges. We seem to have lost the ability to be citizens of the republic who choose intelligently. But to serve on a jury – that we’re ready to do, and even voluntarily.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Each day brings new trauma and disgust</p> \n<p>In response to “Liberal U.S. Jews and Israelis at odds in their reaction to attack” (Amir Tibon, October 29)</p> \n<p>How can Benjamin Netanyahu write a letter to the governor of Pennsylvania praising U.S. President Donald Trump for his vapid statements following the massacre in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.</p> \n<p>Trump compiled his remarks while on his way to meet with young farmers to convince them to support the Republican candidates in the upcoming midterm elections. His main concern was to board Air Force One and not be bothered with the tragedy that occurred, generated by his own racist, vitriolic statements throughout the years of his presidency and during the campaign prior to that. And our prime minister supports him.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Then there were the remarks by Israel’s Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau, who once again demonstrated his disdain for Conservative and Reform Jews.</p> \n<p>I just read Lau’s disgusting refusal to call Tree of Life a synagogue because it is Conservative. He is further proof that we Jews don’t need neo-Nazis, racists and maniacs to destroy us, as we are very capable of destroying ourselves.</p> \n<p>I am sick and tired of hearing the Orthodox, whether Ashkenazi or Mizrahi, leadership and members of that religious stream claiming exclusivity regarding their Judaism. It seems to me that people who go to synagogues, no matter which denomination, recite the prayers in the siddur, read from the Torah, observe bar/bat mitzvahs and follow the traditions of Judaism with which they are comfortable and which answer their religious beliefs are just as Jewish, or even more so, than those who bury their heads in books at the yeshiva, contribute little or nothing to the country in terms of work, national or military service, and feed off the taxpayers’ money.</p> \n<p>This attitude, and that of our government regarding asylum seekers and the treatment they receive, make me wonder “Who is a Jew.” Thousands of these asylum seekers from Darfur and Eritrea have been applying for residency and recognition for years and our “overworked” immigration department cannot find the time to process their applications. Can we as a Jewish nation turn people away who are seeking freedom, a place to live, study, work and contribute, or do we want to emulate the position of the president of the United States, who plans to block those seeking refuge in the United States? And, by default, blames the Jews for funding them, especially George Soros.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Can someone answer my questions, my concerns, and my fear for my children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren?</p> \n<p>Judy Telman</p> \n<p>Mevasseret Zion</p> \n<p>Trump’s absurd response</p> \n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s response to the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting is absurd. A white supremacist man walked into a Pittsburgh synagogue on the Jewish Sabbath with a machine gun. After 20 minutes of mayhem, the gunman killed 11 people and injured several others, including two officers and two SWAT team members. Saturday’s attack is believed to rank as the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.</p> \n<p>Shortly after, Trump responded to questions from a reporter on the shooting before boarding Air Force One by saying, “if they had an armed guard inside, they might have been able to stop [the shooter] immediately.” He added, “Maybe there would have been nobody killed, except for him.”</p> \n<p>Frankly, this is a preposterous response by the president and is nothing more than blaming the victims and condoning this terrorist attack.</p> \n<p>We should not arm schools, churches, temples and mosques to feel safe. What’s needed is for a president who is not lax with his supporters and lets them get away with anything.</p> \n<p>Here is what Trump can do to make America great again:</p> \n<p>1. Trump should not tell his supporters to beat the hell out of the protesters and he will pay the legal fees.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>2. Trump should not smile in agreement when his supporters chant at rallies “shoot her” or “lock her up.”</p> \n<p>3. Trump should advise his supporters that carrying signs at rallies that read, “Allah is not God and Mohammed is not a prophet,” or “NO MUSLIM ALLOWED,” is hate speech, not free speech.</p> \n<p>4. Trump can start calling other countries by their names instead of “shit hole” countries.</p> \n<p>President Trump should understand that his rhetoric and fear- and hate-mongering is what instigated the kind of violence carried out by his followers against his critics, by using mail bombs or the mass shooting of the Pittsburgh synagogue. When Trump’s followers do not respect the rule of law, the tragic terror attack carried out at a Pittsburgh synagogue will not be the last one.</p> \n<p>Mahmoud El-Yousseph, retired U.S. Air Force veteran</p> \n<p>Westerville, Ohio&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Anti-Semitism flourishes in the far right and the far left</p> \n<p>On the right are the neo-Nazis and their European-style traditional racism. They are small in number and are mostly inconsequential today.</p> \n<p>On the left are Louis Farrakhan, tacitly supported by America’s left wing, including former President Barack Obama, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Black Lives Matter movement and universities throughout the West.</p> \n<p>Universities are spurred on by left-leaning professors and the Muslim Students’ Associations, which sponsor the boycott, divest and sanctions movement, Israel Apartheid Week and other so-called pro-Palestinian activities. MSA is part of the Muslim Brotherhood, as is Hamas.</p> \n<p>Black Lives Matter has hooked up with MSA, making it part of the anti-Semitism plaguing America.</p> \n<p>It has become axiomatic that the more left/progressive one is, the more likely one is to be anti-American, anti-white and anti-Semitic, regardless of their ethnicity.</p> \n<p>The world’s oldest hatred has become socially accepted again. History has shown that attacks against Jews soon spread to others. If left unchecked, Western democracies will be imperiled.</p> \n<p>Len Bennett</p> \n<p>Ottawa, Ontario</p> \n<p>Rabbinical unity after Pittsburgh</p> \n<p>Here in Ottawa, a remarkable community-wide memorial event took place Sunday evening. It was hugely attended, despite just hours of preparation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The event concluded with pulpit rabbis from local congregations standing and reading together a selection of Psalms. Imagine this sight: Orthodox, Chabad, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis reciting tehillim in one voice, and concluding with the singing of “Ani Ma’amin.”</p> \n<p>When Israel’s Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau visited here a few months ago on his self-described fact-finding tour, perhaps he did not see or understand this powerful aspect of our reality. We mean it when we say “Kol Yisrael Haverim.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Victor Rabinovitch</p> \n<p>Ottawa, Ontario</p> \n<p>Attack on principles that we all espouse</p> \n<p>The attack on the Pittsburgh synagogue is a horrendous atrocity that assails us all. That was not only an attack on the United States or the American Jewish community, but an attack on the noble values and principles we all espouse.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;It is disheartening that the plagues of anti-Semitism, xenophobia and Islamophobia are still among us, this time as invidious and subtle manifestations of patriotism, white supremacy, nationalism and populism that President Donald Trump stokes on a daily basis.</p> \n<p>Our response should be espouse solidarity, social justice, equality, human rights, compassion and internationalism, never slipping into the abyss of division and stereotypes.</p> \n<p>Dr. Munjed Farid Al Qutob&nbsp;</p> \n<p>London&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel’s insincere, philo-Jewish sympathy</p> \n<p>I wish I could accept Israeli government officials’ condolences as sincere. Their hyperboles and superlatives strike me as fake sympathy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “heartbroken and appalled by the murderous attack.” He asserts that “[t]he entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead.” I hear no heartbreak or disgust from Netanyahu at “murderous attacks” on neighbors in Syria. I see nothing about “grief” for those starving to death in Yemen.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Education and Diaspora Affairs Minister Bennett proclaims “the State of Israel is deeply pained. ... Our Jewish brothers and sisters” while his party and government refuse to acknowledge Reform and Conservative Jews as equals in Israeli-Jewish law and disown the 25 percent of Israel’s citizens who are non-Jewish.</p> \n<p>“All Israel are responsible for one another.” Bennett should remember this when religious parties threaten to dissolve the government instead of providing equal access for all Jews at the Western Wall in Jerusalem — Jews like those who were murdered in Pittsburgh. And remember this when similar crimes occur in non- Jewish parts of Jerusalem — annexed by Israel, yet systematically neglected by state law enforcement.</p> \n<p>While commendable, it’s condemnable to send “emergency and resilience teams [to provide] psychological assistance and community rehabilitation” for non-citizen-Jews as opposed to deploying those resources for citizen-non-Jews in Israel or here in the Occupied West Bank, where occupation breeds psychosis and systematically de-habilitates communities.</p> \n<p>I lived in Pittsburgh and worked near the synagogue that was attacked. My heart breaks for the patrons of the Tree of Life synagogue, as it does for those murdered here ... in Palestine.</p> \n<p>Judy Bamberger</p> \n<p>Volunteer in Tulkarm, West Bank, Palestine</p> \n<p>O’Connor ACT AUSTRALIA</p> \n<p>Racism, playing with children’s lives</p> \n<p>In response to “Netanya reassigns children of African asylum seekers to separate kindergarten” (Or Kashti, October 31)</p> \n<p>With all the horrors, the suffering of so many around the world, I was surprised that it was the article describing the pain of little children in Netanya that elicited a scream of rage inside my head.</p> \n<p>Is it because I am a grandmother and see daily the centrality of friendship for small children and their need for a safe, caring environment? Is it because of the memories of the battles we fought so my little grandson would not be assigned to a kindergarten where he would be separated from his little friends? Is it because I immediately saw in my mind 2-year-old Ella with her arms intertwined with 2-year-old Aloni?</p> \n<p>Or is it the fact of coming face to face with pure evil, pure, homemade, blue-and-white evil? Despicable racism playing with the lives of little children.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;Or is it the fact that parents struggling for daily survival have found the strength and courage to fight back for the good of their small children?</p> \n<p>Five-year-old Milcha is wondering why she is no longer together with her friends Gavriel, Aaron and Jonathan.</p> \n<p>She is lucky to have parents fighting for her well-being, but knowing our country, our system, I am, alas, convinced that these parents will not be able to achieve their goal. They can only succeed if the parents of Gavriel, Aaron and Jonathan join them in their struggle.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;So I turn to them with the plea: Fight this despicable , racist decree for the sake of all of the children.</p> \n<p>Veronika Cohen, professor emeritus</p> \n<p>Jerusalem</p> \n<p>Letters should be exclusive to Haaretz and must include the writers name, address and telephone number (an email address is not sufficient).

        "text":["<p>A neo-Nazi murdered 11 Jews in an attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh. In response, the Israeli right went on the defensive.</p> \n<p>The prime minister condemned the attack, but found it necessary to prattle about Islamic extremism as well. Israel’s ambassador in Washington explained that there are also anti-Semites on the radical left. I can’t recall this pair saying “There are also neo-Nazis on the right” after any Islamist terror attack.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Under Trump, violence against Jews will only rise. We must be prepared | Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Trump, the Jews and anti-Semitism: A dangerous double game&nbsp;| Explained&nbsp;■&nbsp;Why I call the Pittsburgh massacre a pogrom, and Trump a czar&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While the politicians are trying to sever the murder from its political context, the right-wing “street” has already identified the guilty parties. “Did we or did we not say that the left is guilty of encouraging anti-Semitism against Jews?” online commenters said, reiterating the Likud’s talking points. And from the bottom of the barrel, the rapper known as “The Shadow” screamed that the Pittsburgh murderer “is fed up with radical leftist organizations,” moments before he blamed the Jewish left for the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>Rightists are on the defensive. They instinctively discerned the connection between America’s president and the attack, and given a choice between the safety of American Jews and Donald Trump, they chose the latter. Even on the Orthodox Jewish right, there are some who seem to be indifferent to the murder of Jews if they aren’t “one of us.”</p> \n<p>American Jews watched their president run off to a campaign rally immediately after the synagogue shooting. To justify his attendance, he falsely claimed the stock exchange had opened the day after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. They heard him praising nationalism and warning against “globalists.” They saw the Republican Party refuse to denounce its candidate in Iowa, who defrauded a Holocaust memorial group to finance a series of meetings with Nazis in Austria. They saw Trump continue calling the media “enemies of the people” even after a mail bomb was sent to CNN. And now they see the Israeli government doing contortions to give this dangerous American leader, the darling of neo-Nazis and white nationalists, the legitimacy he so badly needs.</p> \n<p>And they’ve already seen this before. It took Benjamin Netanyahu three days to denounce the car-ramming attack in Charlottesville, during which neo-Nazis shouted “Jews will not replace us.” He was waiting for Trump’s denunciation. The latter memorably condemned all sides and claimed that there were also “good people” at the white nationalist demonstration. This didn’t stop Netanyahu from declaring that the Jewish people has “no greater supporter” than Trump, who in turn used this to brush off accusations of anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>American Jews have been convenient partners. They have defended Israel despite the years of occupation and were willing to swallow the humiliation of Israel’s discrimination against Reform and Conservative Jews in silence (even if recently, they have begun to politely clear their throats). But politeness should not be confused with blindness, especially when Israel embraces someone who endangers their lives.</p> \n<p>“Any strategy for enhancing the security of American Jewry should involve shunning Trump’s Jewish enablers,” wrote Franklin Foer in The Atlantic. “They have placed their community in danger.”</p> \n<p>David Simon, creator of the television series “The Wire,” urged Education Minister Naftali Bennett not to come to Pittsburgh. “Netanyahu’s interventions in US politics aided in the election of Donald Trump and his raw and relentless validation of white nationalism and fascism,” he tweeted.</p> \n<p>When Bennett, who is also minister of Diaspora affairs, boarded his flight to Pittsburgh, an American Jewish friend reminded me that Bennett hadn’t bothered to attend the Jewish Federations of North America’s General Assembly in Israel last week. “The government is willing to talk to us only as bodies,” he said.</p> \n<p>David Simon was even harsher on Twitter. “Your rabbinate only believes them to be Jews for purposes of a photo op,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>American Jews don’t need pictures of Bennett lighting candles at the murdered Jews’ graves. Nor do they need an Israeli denunciation of Trump. What they do need, desperately, is for Israel to stop defending a president who encourages political violence for the sake of its own narrow interests. But for Netanyahu, even this appears to be asking too much.</p>",

        "text":["<p>An Israeli team playing a ball game in the Olympics? It sounds like a distant dream. Even the lacrosse team – a national project in a sport that isn’t even in the Olympics yet – is aiming for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, if at all. So to speak of an Israeli team in Tokyo 2020? Well, the Israel Association of Baseball is doing exactly that.</p> \n<p>Baseball may not be popular in Israel, but it could be Israel’s only chance to send a team to Tokyo. The Israel Association of Baseball launched a project to persuade professional American players to come to Israel. And believe it or not, it worked.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Ball games, which were brought back to the Tokyo Olympics as one of five new sports, are really old-new. The sport entered the Games officially in Barcelona 1992, taken out after Beijing 2008, and now returns especially for baseball-crazy Japan. But what’s Israel got to do with it?</p> \n<p>Apparently the connection is the United States. “When I was in college, the first World Baseball Classic, in which Israel took part in the qualifying matches, was held. I saw the team and said ‘Wow, I’ll be glad to play for Israel, it will be super cool, it’s a dream,” says Jonathan Moscot, an Israeli-American pitcher who played with the Cincinnati Reds in 2015 and 2016. But during his seasons there he was injured and played very little.</p> \n<p>A bigger stage</p> \n<p>“The second world championship arrived, and then I was supposed to play for the team. I was injured just before that, so I couldn’t take part,” he says. “When I got the idea to be on the Olympic team I grabbed the opportunity. First, because I didn’t get a chance to play two years ago due to my injury and second, because it’s an even bigger stage – the Olympics. It’s a great chance for Israel and for Israeli baseball to grow.”</p> \n<p>The World Baseball Classic’s laws enable anyone who is eligible for citizenship to register as a player, so Israel registered in 2013 with 22 Jewish Americans and three Israeli citizens. The team played in the qualifying matches but did not advance to the championship itself.</p> \n<p>A similar number of top Jewish-Americans played in the 2017 championship, but by then the project attracted better players and Israel finished sixth in the world.</p> \n<p>“Since the last world classic, interest in baseball has increased in Israel,” says association secretary-general Margo Sugarman. “People come to us, including Israelis with no connection to the United States, and want to play. Also, we’ve had a great response from professional players in the United States. Last year Robinson Cano (second baseman for the Seattle Mariners, eight-time All Star and veteran of the World Series champion 2009 New York Yankees team) visited here and spent time with our players.</p> \n<p>He was followed by Andruw Jones, a five-time All Star and 10-time Golden Glove outfielder in a 17-year career, mainly with the Atlanta Braves. “He contacted us. He said he wanted to come and meet our players and have a training session with them. Others are on their way,” says Sugarman.</p> \n<p>Olympic rules currently require players to be citizens of the country they’re representing for at least a year. So the baseball association brought 10 American players to Israel, including Moscot, and made sure they were sped through the immigration process. Thus, last week Israel gained 10 new citizens, who are also good at baseball, by no coincidence.</p> \n<p>Moscot, one of these new Israelis, grew up in a Jewish home in Los Angeles. “I’m very connected to Judaism. We used to go to synagogue, but we didn’t keep kosher and such things. It’s much more difficult in the United States,” he says a few hours after landing in Israel, and before being joined by his team members.</p> \n<p>“I have family in Israel and it’s very religious,” he says, “and I have a very strong connection with my faith and with Judaism’s cultural aspect. For me it’s huge. It’s refreshing to come here and feel like part of this nation.”</p> \n<p>Small world</p> \n<p>Moscot knows some of his teammates well. “One of them is even a close friend of mine, with whom I played in the senior league. He plays pitcher too,” he says. “There’s also a guy here from my high school – it’s a small world.”</p> \n<p>Still, getting into the Olympics is a difficult mission. Since baseball is a new sport, it has received only six slots in the Tokyo games. In other words, to enter the Olympics, Israel must be among the six best teams in the world.</p> \n<p>Surprisingly it has already achieved that distinction, but then it was an all-American team and in a far less complicated qualifying tournament. To advance to Tokyo, Israel must finish first in the second tier of European championships. Then it would join the final games among the first five in the top tier of the European Championships. Only then would it advance to the qualifying Olympic tournament, which will include five European teams and the African champion. If Israel won there too, it would advance to the Olympic Games. The team that finishes second will get to the “last qualifying tournament” due in April 2019, giving a last chance to the top six teams that didn’t make it.</p> \n<p>Peter Kurtz, baseball association president, is aware that this is a complex challenge.</p> \n<p>“I think that we can win in second tier, we can be among the five first in the first tier, but to win in the qualifying games – I’m not sure,” he says. “I want to get to Europe’s qualifiers and then I’ve done my part. If we’re lucky enough to get to the Olympics, it will really be a dream.”</p> \n<p>In addition to all this, the Major League Baseball season will takes place simultaneously with some of the qualifying games, so not all the “purchased players” will be at Israel’s disposal.</p> \n<p>“I hope some of the players are able to play with us, I can only put the best players on the field and the rest is up to the coach and players,” says Kurtz.</p> \n<p>Coaching the youth</p> \n<p>Apart from the 10 Americans’ naturalization, the association is using this meeting to let them train together and pass some American baseball skills on to the Israeli youths playing baseball. “We invited all the children registered as players in the organization, aged 9-17,” says Sugarman, who is also in charge of finding the best pub in which to hold the first evening’s briefing.</p> \n<p>For Moscot, the Olympics isn’t everything. “An important part of spreading baseball in Israel is to show the children that there are Jewish athletes who are good at this sport,” he says.</p> \n<p>“The World Classic was tremendous, but there hasn’t been an Israeli ball game team in the Olympics since the ‘70s (the Israeli soccer team in Montreal 1976) and I think this is our best chance,” says Kurtz.</p> \n<p>Moscot, who is considering moving to Israel and advancing the sport here, says, “If there’s an Israeli team in the Olympics, it will be a big deal,” he says. “What is there here – basketball and soccer? The chance of baseball growing in Israel is huge.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The race to fill the post of IDF chief of staff, which effectively ended a week ago with Lieberman’s nomination of Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, was a clean one. The four candidates refrained from media and political campaigns and did not engage in mudslinging. That hasn’t always been the case.</p> \n<p>Interviewed by veteran Israel public broadcaster military correspondent Carmela Menashe after the announcement, Maj. Gen. Yair Golan congratulated his rival for the position and said he didn’t regret his remarks at the 2016 Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony that in practice ended his chances of becoming Israel’s top military commander. “I wasn’t raised to regret the truth,” Golan said.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>This time, the mud was generously provided by the politicians. Lieberman’s announcement took Netanyahu by surprise as he prepared to return from Oman. That score was soon settled with an unofficial quote provided to journalists by Netanyahu’s aides as soon as his plane landed. In a single long and unwieldy sentence, the prime minister’s office managed to get a jab in at three of the four candidates (Golan they already dealt with two years ago). Kochavi, the reporters were told, wasn’t even Lieberman’s first choice, Nitzan Alon was. Kochavi’s appointment only went ahead after Lieberman was convinced to give up on Alon; and Eyal Zamir still isn’t experienced enough, but he will probably be appointed deputy chief of staff now.</p> \n<p>So, one general was portrayed as a compromise candidate, another as unsuitable from the start, while a third was again maneuvered, with no justification, into being the prime minister’s emissary. It takes quite some talent to achieve such results, and is also a good reflection of the paranoia that is epidemic among the country’s political leaders. As expected, the defense minister reacted aggressively. The appointment of the next deputy chief of staff is a matter for the defense minister and the next chief of staff to decide, said associates of Lieberman, and anyone who tries to interfere in this via leaks to the media “is going mad.”</p> \n<p>For Kochavi, this was yet another lesson in politics. Like the outgoing Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, he comes to the post as a mature, experienced candidate who has passed through all the necessary stations. No chief of staff since the late Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who served in the 1990s, was younger than 50. Kochavi is 54. Even so, he did not go through the formative experience, shared by his predecessors, of the first Lebanon war.</p> \n<p>During Operation Protective Edge in 2014, after the regular Paratroops Brigade moved from Nablus to Bethlehem, someone asked then-brigade commander Kochavi to compare the fighting and destruction in West Bank Palestinian cities to Beirut in 1982. His answer was surprising. Kochavi couldn’t say, he only began serving in the paratroops after the war in Lebanon was under way.</p> \n<p>This week, as the IDF waited to see what would happen with Gaza, the general staff forum met for its yearly seminar at the Yitzhak Rabin Center to mark the anniversary of the Rabin assassination. This year discussion focused on what Eisenkot considers a critical question, the army’s role in Israeli society. The second panel of the day was devoted to proper conduct in the various security organizations. Speakers included Police Commissioner Roni Alsheich, former Mossad chief Tamir Pardo and former Shin Bet security service chief Yoram Cohen. If I didn’t know Eisenkot better, I might suspect him of wanting to troll the prime minister on his way out the door.</p> \n<p>Kochavi was absent from the gathering. After his widely covered meeting with Netanyahu, who had to interview him after Lieberman’s announcement, the designated incoming chief of staff took a vacation. The army can be very organized when it wants to be. Let’s hope someone saved the minutes of the discussion for Kochavi.</p> \n<p>The army as police force</p> \n<p>Another conference was held this week, this one at the Open University of Israel and called “Who Controls the Policing Army?” The organizer, Prof. Yagil Levy, said the topic arose from the Elor Azaria episode, in which an Israeli soldier was convicted of manslaughter and served nine months in prison for killing an incapacitated Palestinian assailant. Levy said the incident “clearly revealed how a policing army has come into being in the West Bank whose rationale of operation is different than that of the official army.”</p> \n<p>At the same time, Levy said, he grew interested in this after witnessing the discomfort shown by “researchers with conservative outlooks and upholders of the army’s good reputation” when addressing the issue. The army’s behavioral science department opted not to present research at the conference.</p> \n<p>Levy says there is little research on this subject, both in Israel and elsewhere, despite the growing involvement of armies in policing. A study presented at the conference by Dr. Ofra Ben-Yishai said that policing activity is perceived as a “lowering’ of the army and the soldier’s status, so as not to hurt the motivation of soldiers in units that are largely assigned to such activity, the principles of war were applied to policing operations. However, at the same time, having to do policing also puts the IDF in a trap. While it functions as an army, it is required to show the restraint characteristic of police operating within a civilian population (Besides the Azaria case, the Ahed Tamimi case is another example of this). The IDF is also subject to monitoring by human rights organizations. According to Levy’s article, the policing army is not overseen in the same hierarchical manner as the official IDF, but rather overseen culturally, politically and even operationally by a whole range of parties — from security coordinators in settlements to various rabbis to organizations like B’Tselem and Breaking the Silence.</p> \n<p>At the conference it became apparent that there is a debate among researchers as to the moderating effect of women serving in policing units in the West Bank on the units’ behavior. Dr. Eyal Levin felt that units with a gender balance tend to inhibit violence in contacts with the local population. But research by Levin as well as by professors Edna Lomski-Feder and Orna Sasson-Levy also found that when women are in the minority in a unit, they feel in competition with the men, with a need to prove themselves. As a result, they exhibit a greater tendency toward violence and do not have an inhibiting effect.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Netanyahu excluded from defense minister's announcement of next army chief&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The commander of one IDF brigade in the West Bank was asked this week about the mood among his soldiers. The residual tensions from the Azaria case have dissipated, he maintained. There has been turnover by now among the vast majority of the soldiers and once the senior chain of command used the incident to hone the rules concerning what is permitted and what isn’t, this has become clearer to the soldiers too.</p> \n<p>Is service in the West Bank particularly charged for the soldiers? On the contrary, the brigade commander asserted. “When you ask them, most of the soldiers say this is the sector where they’d prefer to serve. When they’re on the northern border or the Gaza border, usually not much happens and there isn’t always an obvious connection between all the things they’re doing and the main mission. Here they are busy all the time — patrols, guarding, arrests — and it’s very clear to them that a nighttime arrest is preventing an attack on the nearby road the next day, or even a terror attack in Jerusalem.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Imagine if Rabin still led us</p> \n<p>When I saw the picture of Yitzhak Rabin — a man who was fighting for peace and a new hope for Israel and her neighbors — portrayed in a Nazi uniform, this seemed the height of infantilism to me. From the articles in Friday’s newspaper, however, I now understand that — yes — it was two 15-year-old boys who were behind the use of these despicable and completely untrue pictures.</p> \n<p>That Rabin, a great leader and soldier, was still ready to talk peace with the enemy, is the thinking of a mature and reasonable man. That the talks could take five or 50 years wasn’t important. The killings would (hopefully) stop, the talks would continue and enemies would slowly but surely get to know each other as human beings. This seems inevitable if you talk to someone for 50 years.</p> \n<p>However, this was not to be. Those pictures, as childish and as untrue as they were, influenced older and (so-called) wiser people — and we know the results.</p> \n<p>Imagine if Rabin was still leading us! Thousands of lives would have been saved, relations with the neighbors would have been on a more familiar footing and — let an old, humble voter assure you — Rabin was not about to give away anything of the Land of Israel. This was a convenient fiction thought up by those who were never interested in peace.</p> \n<p>There are still those who believe that land is more valuable than life (as long as it isn’t the believer’s life), and this is the message that has taken precedence today. Let’s take the land, let’s fight, let us kill for land, but let others die for that land.</p> \n<p>We haven’t given in to the enemy – we have become like him.</p> \n<p>Mike Porter</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>The real problem</p> \n<p>In response to “U.S. Jews’ despair over Pittsburgh atrocity is compounded by Trump’s complicity and Netanyahu’s hypocrisy” (Chemi Shalev, October 29)</p> \n<p>OK. So [Robert Bowers] obviously wasn’t an anti-Semite before Trump became president, and attacks on Jewish institutions by mentally unstable anti-Semites didn’t happen before Trump became president. So all we have to do is get rid of Trump and we’ll all live together and sing “Kumbaya.”</p> \n<p>The simplicity and inaccuracies in your story are scary. Every article you and The Forward write can have the same title: It’s Trump’s fault. The attack on the California Jewish community center during the Obama years: Trump’s fault. The attempted bombing of a synagogue in Aventura, Florida during Obama’s administration: Trump’s fault.</p> \n<p>The only difference between this attack and scattered anti-Semitic attacks in every administration in modern times is that this one was more successful.</p> \n<p>If you actually want to save Jewish lives rather than score political points, the only rational response is to increase security in our synagogues, JCCs and other Jewish institutions.</p> \n<p>We could, and we should, pass dramatic gun-control legislation, and it would have minimal impact for the next two decades since there are 300 million guns in America. So get real and do your job.</p> \n<p>In his social media, [Bowers] rants against Trump for being a globalist and letting Jews into his country. In other word, Mr. Trump is at fault, because in [Bowers’] deranged [mind], Trump was too good to the Jews and Israel. But the narrative is that Trump is encouraging neo-Nazis by demonstrating hatred to the “other.” So which is it? [Trump] is guilty because he hates Jews, or guilty because he loves Jews? Or answer, he’s guilty no matter what. You’re pitiful. There were school shootings during the Obama years, and he was not responsible for them. There was a school shooting during Trump’s administration and he’s not responsible for it. Yes access to guns is too easy and we must do something about it. It will take decades, so the only thing we can do right now while we try to limit guns is to increase security. I’ve been to synagogues with security. I find that offensive, irrational and completely naive. I recommend an increased tax on all guns and ammunition, and that money be used to subsidize security in churches, synagogues and mosques. Let’s address the real problem in this country: mental illness.</p> \n<p>Ed Farber</p> \n<p>via Haaretz.com</p> \n<p>Dangerous simplification</p> \n<p>In response to “$6 billion of Iranian money: why Israeli firm Black Cube really went after Obama's team” (Chaim Levinson and Hagar Shezaf, October 26)</p> \n<p>What evidence did Stephen Flatow have to blame Iran for the terrorist attack that killed his daughter? Why is it that both Israel and the U.S. blame Iran for all sorts of terrorist acts? When Sunni Muslims have been implicated as suicide bombers in the Middle East, Africa (Boko Haram), Kenya, Indonesia, the Philippines, etc., there were no Shi’ite suicide bombers from Iran.</p> \n<p>Iran’s government is abhorrent. It supports Hezbollah and Assad. But the U.S. supports Saudi Arabia, which uses American bombs to slaughter people in Yemen. So I suppose that with the logic that Iran is behind all the terrorist acts in the Middle East, then the U.S. is also a supporter of terrorism, by arming the Saudis. Therefore, why doesn’t Black Cube go after American assets as well as Iranian ones? Upshot: Black Cube’s spy game is simplifying complex international phenomena they don’t understand, and as a result, they taint Israel’s reputation in the world of nations, something Israel doesn’t need.</p> \n<p>Karen</p> \n<p>via Haaretz.com</p> \n<p>An opera called ‘Miri McCarthy’</p> \n<p>In response to “In Israel, it's loyalty’ or culture&quot;(Editorial, October 21).</p> \n<p>I had a dream, and in my dream I saw a festival called Loyalty in Culture Week, in which all of the players in the Israeli cultural scene participated: Habima, Cameri, the Palestinian National Theatre-El-Hakawati, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and artists from all religions, ethnic groups and nationalities. The festival would be dedicated to loyalty to democratic values, freedom of expression, peace, equality and, above all, truth.</p> \n<p>It would feature performances of the classic plays of Hanoch Levin, especially “Queen of the Bathtub” and “Murder.” There would be readings of “Khirbet Khizeh” by S. Yizhar and the publications of B’Tselem and Breaking the Silence. There would be a docudrama based on Benny Morris’ “The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949,” a musical on the life and works of Yeshayahu Leibowitz, a satirical show based on “The King’s Torah” and the writings of rabbis such as Dov Lior and Yitzchak Ginsburgh, an opera called “Miri McCarthy” and a multimedia extravaganza called “A Country of All Its Citizens.”</p> \n<p>Then I woke up.</p> \n<p>Dr. Shlomo Ariel</p> \n<p>Ramat Gan</p> \n<p>Danny Danon, hero</p> \n<p>In response to “The real hero is the B'Tselem chief” (Gideon Levy, Opinion, October 21)</p> \n<p>I believe I have now read it all.

Unlike the Palestinian child, the Israeli child does not live in what has accurately been described as the world’s largest outdoor prison, where the ever-present sound of Israeli drones remind the people of who is still occupying them. His friends have not died in Israeli bombings. His parents haven’t been killed by bombs. He lives a good life disturbed only by the smoke and fire that come from Gaza, where a good life is unknown to Palestinian children. If life was better for Palestinian children, life would be even better for Israeli children.</p> \n<p>Jan</p> \n<p>via Haaretz.com</p> \n<p>Crybibi</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to bypass the mechanisms in the Basic Law on the Government for determining the prime minister after an election. This attempt is at the heart of the storm in which, according to Netanyahu, Gideon Sa’ar and President Reuven Rivlin concocted an arrangement whereby after Likud’s presumed election victory, Netanyahu would not be assigned to form the government.</p> \n<p>The road to this fundamental change is based on a series of populist assumptions whose connection to reality and truth, is at best shaky, if it exists at all.</p> \n<p>First, the claim that an attempt was made to undermine a serving prime minister is completely baseless; in a democratic system of government, the opposition will always work to bring down a serving prime minister. This claim by Netanyahu and his cronies was meant to prepare the ground for claiming the democratic process is illegitimate — or, in academic and political science terms, being a crybaby.</p> \n<p>Another claim in this narrative is that the existing law is lacking. This was not raised when this same supposed deficiency allowed Netanyahu to serve as prime minister after past elections. There is a dual deception here. One is the claim that the party that wins the largest number of votes is the “winner” of the election, and the second is that the size of the parties in the coalition reflects the opinion of the majority — and this is not true.</p> \n<p>The claim of “victory” is not true because the task of forming a government is difficult and exhausting, and only at the end is it possible to declare this same bittersweet victory. The size of the party reflects the amount of support of its voters only. In the proportional representation electoral system used in Israel, the prime minister does not enjoy the support of the majority of the public, and his appointment to the post is the result of coalition agreement. This is true for the present Knesset too: Likud won 30 Knesset seats, which represent 25 percent of the votes of those who exercised their right to vote. This means over 75 percent of the voting public actually did not vote for Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>The attempt to revoke the president’s authority and force Israel to accept Netanyahu’s continued rule is unconstitutional. I would not be surprised if at the base of this idea lies an attempt to provide further protection to Netanyahu from criminal proceedings and their consequences.</p> \n<p>Oded Baharav</p> \n<p>Ra’anana</p> \n<p>Letters should be exclusive to Haaretz and must include the writers name, address and telephone number (an email address is not sufficient).

He will be based in New York and report to Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s founder and chief executive, and Marcelo Claure, its chief operating officer... Mr. Ginsberg’s most recent job was at Time Warner, where he was in the middle of the fight to defend its sale to AT&amp;T.&quot;&nbsp;[NYTimes]  Ginsberg commented:&nbsp;&quot;I have admired SoftBank’s evolution and growth for many years, and I’m thrilled to be joining them now at such a dynamic time when the Company’s mission to invest in some of the world’s most critical and defining new technologies has never been more important.”  DRIVING THE CONVO —&nbsp;Republicans and Democrats Struggle to Own Conversation on Jewish Vote — by Jacob Kornbluh:&nbsp;For the Republican Jewish Coalition&nbsp;following the U.S. Embassy move to Jerusalem and the decision to back out of the Iran deal, Trump’s pro-Israel bona fides speak for themselves. But while the GOP feels confident in its appeal to pro-Israel voters, it struggles to dismiss what the Jewish Democratic Council of America&nbsp;describes as a troubling pattern of lending a sympathetic ear to neo-Nazis and white supremacists.&nbsp;In a set of dueling interviews with&nbsp;Jewish Insider,&nbsp;Matt Brooks and Halie Soifer, serving as executive directors of their respective organizations, parried each others’ criticisms and pounced on the vulnerabilities of the other side.  Brooks cited Trump’s achievements since taking office as proof that Republicans are the pro-Israel party. “The consequence of Donald Trump being elected president is that we now have a United States Embassy in Jerusalem, we now have recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. We have ended the flawed Obama deal with Iran,” he listed.&nbsp;Democrats, however, see a growing culture of hatred as the larger issue affecting Jews. “What we have seen since Trump came to office is really, to some degree, the legitimization of Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, Holocaust deniers, who all appear to have come out of the woodwork,” JDCA’s Soifer charged.&nbsp;  In turn, Brooks pointed to the Democratic Party’s acceptance of candidates “who advocate virulently anti-Israel positions,” singling out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, House candidates running unopposed in the general election. “Their silence and their unwillingness to stand up and to push back on these views and on these candidates fosters an environment in which people believe that holding these views and espousing these views is now part of the acceptable dialog,” he stated.  Soifer denied moral equivalency, saying she “would not equate Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and Holocaust deniers, all of whom are running for office as Republicans, with those on the left who may have espoused different views with regard to Israel.”&nbsp;Read in full here [JewishInsider]  HEARD YESTERDAY — Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY)&nbsp;discussed the future of support for Israel among Democrats&nbsp;during a panel — along with Reps.&nbsp;Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX, Roger Marshall (R-KS) and Juan Vargas (D-CA) —&nbsp;titled&nbsp;&quot;Legislative Priorities and Decisions for the upcoming 116th Congress&quot;&nbsp;hosted by Ken Fisher and Ezra Friedlander Tuesday morning in Midtown Manhattan.</p> \n<p>&quot;I do not think that support Israel in Congress has eroded,&quot; said Nadler. &quot;I do believe there's a long-term threat of that happening, but not now. And the threat goes back a long ways. I helped form an organization called Liberal Democrats for Israel at the 1976 Democratic Convention. So, as far back as then, we saw developments that necessitated in our opinion that we have an organization of liberal Democrats for Israel.&nbsp;And the truth is there is, on the far left, a very strong anti-Israel opinion, and very slowly and very gradually that's been seeping to the less far left. And it is starting to seep into the Democratic party.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Now, I have said for a long time, I don't worry about this generation of Democratic Congressmen with respect to Israel. I worry about the people who are now in college or law school who'll be Congressmen 20 years from now because that's where I see a possibility of change.&nbsp;Then&nbsp;you have the Republican Jewish Coalition, which for partisan reasons&nbsp;seeks to do everything to say that Democrats are not pro-Israel and that becomes part of a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, we are fighting to maintain Democratic support Israel and we have.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;There have been headlines recently about various people winning primaries who are not pro-Israel. And it's true. And some of these people, maybe we can work with and some maybe we can't. That remains to be seen. But it's a small number. You're talking five or six people out of 435 districts. So, this should be kept in perspective.&quot; [Pic]&nbsp;</p> \n<p>MIDTERMS —&nbsp; The Hope of Rashida Tlaib — by Esther Wang:&nbsp;&quot;No profile of Tlaib fails to note that she will&nbsp;become&nbsp;the first Muslim American woman in Congress (along with Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar if she wins, as she is likely to do), and the first Palestinian American woman... It is clear that America’s progressives are ready to anoint Rashida Tlaib as one of the new national faces of the left flank of the Democratic Party... And while much has been made of her ethnicity and her religion, Tlaib credits her victory in large part to her message, pointing out that less than five percent of her district is Arab American.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;But is Tlaib’s district ready for her? She won her primary by less than&nbsp;900 votes... The party establishment, and Detroit’s political class, were almost uniformly united against her. If there had been just one or two fewer candidates in the race, there’s a good chance we wouldn’t be talking about Rashida Tlaib at all.&quot; [TheSlot]</p> \n<p>Iowa Jewish Leaders Condemn Steve King After His Meeting With Far-Right Austrian Org — by Gideon Resnick:&nbsp;“We are writing from the depths of our grief, in horror at the news of the&nbsp;Tree of Life&nbsp;synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh,” wrote Alan Steckman, of Adas Israel, and John Pleasants of the Ames congregation, according to a draft of the letter viewed by The Daily Beast. “We feel we must speak out because our Congressional Representative, Steve King, is an enthusiastic crusader for the same types of abhorrent beliefs held by the Pittsburgh shooter.”&nbsp;[DailyBeast]</p> \n<p>Stivers ‘could not stay silent’ on Steve King — by Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan:&nbsp;&quot;Steve Stivers, who leads the National Republican Congressional Committee, had been briefed on racially charged comments made recently by Iowa Republican Steve King... And so with not even a heads-up to GOP leaders, Stivers went on Twitter and blasted his colleague. He “could not stay silent,” said one source familiar with his thinking.&quot; [Politico]</p> \n<p>King responded&nbsp;in a statement posted on Twitter:&nbsp;&quot;These attacks are orchestrated by nasty, desperate, and dishonest fake news... Establishment Never Trumpers are complicit.&quot;</p> \n<p>— King&nbsp;tells Jewish Insider&nbsp;via email that his tweet&nbsp;comprises his response to Stivers until after the election. &quot;Then I will have more to say.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How the 2018 midterms became the most expensive in history — by Fredreka Schouten:&nbsp;&quot;Large Republican donors are helping make up the difference in crucial races... Among big donors, Nevada casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, lead the way. They have handed out more than $113 million to groups aiding GOP candidates. It's the most money the Adelsons have ever disclosed spending in an election cycle. Democratic mega-donors also are giving big sums... Tom Steyer&nbsp;had donated $51 million to federal races through mid-October. And... Michael Bloomberg&nbsp;also is writing large checks to help Democrats.&quot; [CNN]&nbsp; George Soros, undeterred by bomb threat, leaves the door open to more midterm contributions [CNBC]</p> \n<p>Republican Campaign Mailer Fuels Anti-Semitism Complaints In State Senate Race — by Neil Vigdor&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shawn Beals:&nbsp;&quot;A campaign mailer showing a Jewish candidate for state Senate with a fistful of money is drawing condemnation for what critics say is its blatant anti-Semitic imagery. It was sent out by Republican Ed Charamut and targets Democratic state Rep. Matthew Lesser, his opponent in the race for the 9th Senate District seat...&nbsp;“I started getting text messages about it when I was at a forum with teachers in Cromwell [on Monday], people said they got an anti-Semitic flyer,” Lesser said. “I did not believe them, I thought there was a mistake. Someone showed it to me and I think it would be a gross understatement to say I was surprised.&quot; [HartfordCourant]</p> \n<p>Instagram Is Teeming With Anti-Semitism — by Taylor Lorenz:&nbsp;&quot;While many users see Instagram as a bastion of lifestyle, entertainment, and humor content,&nbsp;the platform is also rife with anti-Semitism. Before it was removed, a search for the word&nbsp;Jews&nbsp;revealed 11,696 posts with the hashtag “jewsdid911,”&nbsp;The New York Times&nbsp;reported on Monday. It took me only three clicks to find a slew of anti-Semitic memes on Tuesday morning.&quot; [TheAtlantic]&nbsp;</p> \n<p>TALK OF OUR NATION ― The Jews of Pittsburgh Bury Their Dead — by Emma Green:&nbsp;&quot;When one person dies, members of the Jewish community often step in to care for the body and the family. When 11 people die, the whole community becomes part of the mourning process. The logistics are complicated. Eleven bodies have to be accompanied, washed, and buried. Eleven funerals have to be planned. Families move into an intensive period of mourning, called&nbsp;shiva, that lasts for up to seven days after the burial. In many circles, the fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters of the dead will say a special prayer, the&nbsp;kaddish, in the year following the death. For them, and for the Pittsburgh Jewish community, the sense of loss will likely last far beyond that. As one rabbi said, now there will always be a time before the shooting, and a time after.&quot;&nbsp;[TheAtlantic] At a Pittsburgh Crime Scene, Jewish Volunteers Guard the ‘Bodies of Holy Martyrs’ [NYTimes]&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Pittsburgh Honors Two Brothers, ‘Gentle Giants’ of the Community — by Emma Green:&nbsp;&quot;The Tree of Life building is still closed, so other synagogues in the area have opened their doors to host funerals. A letter from a friend of the family’s was read at the brothers’ funeral on Tuesday at Rodef Shalom, a historic reform synagogue in Pittsburgh. It was from a Catholic priest. Addressing Cecil and David’s parents, he wrote that God had “created your sons in his image,” a sentiment that captured the core theme of the funeral.&quot; [TheAtlantic]&nbsp;&nbsp;Armin Rosen on&nbsp;the funeral of David and Cecil Rosenthal [Tablet]&nbsp;</p> \n<p>MOURNING TOGETHER — Hundreds gather in Miami Beach to remember synagogue shooting victims — by&nbsp;Liane Morejon:&nbsp;&quot;There is simply no place for hate,&nbsp;not here,&nbsp;not anywhere, and furthermore&nbsp;there are absolutely no good people who stand on the side of hate. Period,&quot; said Norman Braman, the former president of the&nbsp;Greater Miami Jewish Federation.&quot; [Local10]&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Cuomo says fabric of America is ‘stressed and frayed’ during synagogue shooting vigil&nbsp;[NYPost]</p> \n<p>‘I’m Dr. Cohen’:&nbsp;The powerful humanity of the Jewish hospital staff that treated Robert Bowers [WashPost]</p> \n<p>Pittsburgh Unites in Grief, Even as It Splits Over Trump’s Visit — by&nbsp;Campbell Robertson,&nbsp;Julie Hirschfeld Davis&nbsp;and&nbsp;Trip Gabriel:&nbsp;&quot;The presidential visit, welcomed by some in Pittsburgh, unwanted or vigorously opposed by many others, began with a motorcade into the city and a visit to the Tree of Life synagogue. Mr. Trump lit memorial candles in a vestibule near where the shooting unfolded, and placed stones and white roses from the White House outside... Mr. Trump was accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. They were greeted by Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, the spiritual leader of the Tree of Life congregation...&nbsp;Later, Mr. Trump... sat for about an hour with Peg Gottfried, the widow of Richard Gottfried, one of those killed on Saturday.&quot; [NYTimes]</p> \n<p>— &quot;Ron Dermer,&nbsp;Israel's ambassador to the U.S., accompanied the president and first lady during their visit, as did... White House advisers who are Jewish, and Treasury Secretary&nbsp;Steven Mnuchin.&quot; [TheHill; Pic]</p> \n<p>Josh Marshall:&nbsp;&quot;This is a touchy subject. Many will disagree with me. But I find it offensive and bizarre that this was choreographed so that the Israeli Ambassador is the one who greeted the President first at the Tree of Life synagogue. The President is not visiting Israel.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>BEHIND THE SCENES —&nbsp;Amid Scrutiny, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner Shaped Trump’s Pittsburgh Response — by&nbsp;Katie Rogers&nbsp;and&nbsp;Maggie Haberman:&nbsp;&quot;[Trump's] son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who keeps a photograph of his grandparents, both Holocaust survivors, in his West Wing office, and a mezuza on the doorway, as well as his daughter Ivanka...&nbsp;have quietly and persistently shaped the president’s response to one of the nation’s deadliest cases of anti-Semitism...&nbsp;And it has been Mr. Kushner, in particular, who has been phoning Trump allies and encouraging them to support the president.&quot; [NYTimes]</p> \n<p>Meet Jason Greenblatt, the longtime Trump attorney sent to Pittsburgh after synagogue shooting — by John Fritze:&nbsp;&quot;Though he initially planned to speak at Hillel Academy, a private Orthodox Jewish day school in the neighborhood where the shooting occurred, school officials said they didn’t want to subject students to speeches. Instead, Greenblatt attended morning prayers and spoke with students and staff individually. Rabbi Sam Weinberg, principal at Hillel Academy, said Greenblatt’s presence was “very low key” and “very apolitical.” Greenblatt's message&nbsp;as he wandered the halls was that “the world Jewish community” was grieving with Pittsburgh, according to Weinberg. “He didn’t come with a photographer,” Weinberg said, adding that Greenblatt asked permission before noting his visit on Twitter. “I found him to be very sensitive.”&nbsp;[USAToday] &nbsp;Greenblatt writes:&nbsp;What I learned from my visit to the Tree of Life Synagogue [FoxNews]</p> \n<p>Pittsburgh Jews Give Trump a Furious Reception — by Allison Kaplan Sommer and Amir Tibon:&nbsp;&quot;While Trump and his family lit candles in memory of the victims, thousands of people rallied outside to protest Trump's divisive rhetoric... Protesters held signs that read, &quot;President Hate, Leave our state,&quot; &quot;Words matter,&quot; &quot;Ban assault rifles, Be a leader&quot; and &quot;Trump will lie about this too.&quot; [Haaretz]&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump tweets this morning:&nbsp;&quot;Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad &amp; solemn day. We were treated so warmly. Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful!&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>GOP Jewish leader says community is 'comforted' by Trump:&nbsp;&quot;I think the president is great on our issues,&quot; Neil Boylan Strauss, national spokesman for&nbsp;the Republican Jewish Coalition, told Hill.TV... &quot;We're also comforted by the fact that he has plenty of Jewish voices around him, and we're comfortable with how he has acted on Jewish issues, whether it's support for Israel, whether it's something like condemning the attacks,&quot; he said.&quot; [TheHill]&nbsp;</p> \n<p>ZOA's Mort Klein tells us...&nbsp;&quot;It was the absolute right thing to do, for Trump to go to Pittsburgh to show his own devastation by this horrific massacre. As you know, there are many extreme left-wing Jews who have told him not to go to Pittsburgh, I assure you&nbsp;if he did not go to Pittsburgh they would condemn him for insensitivity and lack of concern. These are not people who are looking at this rationally, they despise Trump and they'll attack him no matter what. They have not gotten over that their heroine Hillary Clinton is not president. They are very upset that he's trying to keep illegals out of the country.&nbsp;They want to appease our enemies like Abbas.&quot;</p> \n<p>HEARD ON CABLE —&nbsp;Former Meet the Press host&nbsp;David Gregory&nbsp;on CNN with Wolf Blitzer:&nbsp;&quot;I think when the president uses what I consider to be anti-Semitic tropes, when he talks about himself as a nationalist, when he gives in any way comfort to those who would express anti-Semitic views, I think it's dead wrong. I think he has an obligation in the name of his Jewish son-in-law and daughter, who's a convert, and his Jewish grandchildren, to specifically denounce anti-Semitism and go farther... There are a lot of&nbsp;Republican Jews who look at him and say he's a stalwart supporter of Israel, we're behind this guy and that has created the split.”</p> \n<p>&quot;What I don't like is that Jews are dividing politically instead of saying, 'Let's remember Jewish virtues. You know, we can talk about Israel. There's divides about Israel. But it's also about hold up the treatment of the stranger, the treatment of immigrants, and be able to find some consensus... I've said it privately to Israeli representatives in this country, I think they have an obligation to not just stoke the political divide in this country that Trump has created among Jews. I just think it's bad for the Jewish community writ&nbsp;large in America.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Gloria Borger remembering 97-year-old Rose Mallinger on CNN Newsroom:&nbsp;&quot;You know, everyone has a Bubby in their family.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel's&nbsp;Minister of Diaspora Affairs&nbsp;Naftali Bennett&nbsp;tweets:&nbsp;&quot;Using the horrific anti-Semitic massacre to attack President Trump is unfair and wrong. As Israel’s Minister of Diaspora, I came to Pittsburgh to offer the State of Israel’s support and sympathy to the Jewish community and all the American people... President Trump is a true friend of the State of Israel and to the Jewish people.&nbsp;With President Trump&nbsp;we never have to worry if he has our backs. He has delivered on every promise. This is something we will never forget.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>HAPPENING TODAY —&nbsp;The&nbsp;Council on Foreign Relations will host&nbsp;Bennett for a conversation with&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;Distinguished Fellow Martin Indyk.</p> \n<p>Michael Oren writes...&nbsp;&quot;What Israel Owes American Jews:&nbsp;Threatened by rising anti-Semitism, American-Jewish communities need to know that Israel is behind them and not only in words... By recognizing Conservative and Reform Jewry, Israel will not only defy the anti-Semites but also, more important, reaffirm itself.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Brian Cuban writes about his childhood experience with his brother Mark in&nbsp;Squirrel Hill:&nbsp;&quot;Mark and I&nbsp; battled for control of the black and white television. I preferred cartoons. Mark preferred movies. I changed the channel. Mark pushed me aside and turned it back... Our&nbsp;grandmother’s basement meant hidden treasure. Books written in Russian or Yiddish. They smelled of must and mold, but to a ten-year-old child, it was the smell of adventure and places far away.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Jews assail 'Christian rabbi' who appeared with Pence, and so does his own movement — by&nbsp;Corky Siemaszko:&nbsp;&quot;Loren Jacobs, who was invited onstage by Vice President Mike Pence to speak at a rally in Michigan for a GOP congressional candidate, was defrocked 15 years ago, according to a spokeswoman for the Union of Messianic Jewish Congregations... Meanwhile, mainstream Jewish leaders and experts on the faith said they could not fathom why GOP congressional candidate Lena Epstein, herself a longtime member of a Detroit–area synagogue, invited Jacobs at all to her rally Tuesday because in their eyes he’s not even a real Jew, let alone a rabbi.&quot; [NBCNews]&nbsp;</p> \n<p>TOP TALKER —&nbsp;Denmark Says It Foiled Iranian Assassination Plot — by&nbsp;Laurence Norman:&nbsp;&quot;Danish authorities this month arrested a Norwegian citizen of Iranian descent for allegedly planning the assassination of the leader of an ethnic Arab separatist group, Denmark’s Security and Intelligence services said...

Her parents relocated to the United States in 1984 and Portman became a dual citizen... Portman has not shied away from expressing her political opinions, which have made headlines, especially when it comes to her country of birth. She describes her relationship to Israel as “very complicated, like family—you love it more than anything else in the world and you also are more critical of it than anything else in the world.”</p> \n<p>“Last spring, there was an uproar when she declined to accept the 2018 Genesis Prize in person. “I’d like to clarify I have no issue traveling to the country. They may have issues with it now, but I don’t,” she says. “I was choosing not to attend an event where I was supposed to be onstage with Prime Minister Netanyahu, sitting next to him, which felt like an endorsement. So there is a distinction.”</p> \n<p>&quot;It’s more than just a footnote that “Harvard graduate” occupies part of Portman’s biography. (She was one of many research assistants to Alan M. Dershowitz, who recently consulted for Weinstein’s legal team and came out in support of Brett Kavanaugh. “I pretty much disagree with him on everything he’s doing right now,” says Portman, adding, “Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising to see.”)&quot;</p> \n<p>“She reads everything—there is no end to her curiosity.

A paper published in the world archaeological journal Antiquity reports that the health of hunter-gatherers in prehistoric Vietnam seems to have been just as lousy as that of early farmers who lived a couple of thousand years later.</p> \n<p>The two groups may have suffered from different kinds of problems, but it cannot be said that one was clearly healthier than the other.</p> \n<p>The paper, by Prof. Marc Oxenham of the Australian National University and colleagues, describes Da But hunter-gatherer communities who lived at a site called Con Co Ngua, starting around 8,000 to 7,000 years ago. The Da But culture lasted a couple of thousand years.</p> \n<p>When, where and how agriculture began is one of those things that makes archaeologists want to brain each other with stone axes. But clearly, by around 4,000 years ago – after the Da But people were long gone – the area was populated by farmers (who augmented their diets by hunting, as people living in remote villages without supermarkets do to this day).</p> \n<p>The surprise is that the team’s evidence indicates the earlier hunter-gatherers and the later farmers had roughly similar disease burdens. That had not been expected.</p> \n<p>“It is often, in bioarchaeological studies, seen in terms of a binary ‘healthy’ versus ‘not healthy’ categorization, which is clearly not how health works in reality,” Oxenham explains.</p> \n<p>Foraging at Walmart</p> \n<p>Around 11,000 years ago, the northern hemisphere warmed as the Ice Age began to subside. Sea levels rose, flooding coasts worldwide. In the southeastern Asian area in question, rainfall was as much as double the precipitation levels of today. It was also 1 to 4 degrees Celsius hotter than now, on average. Plants thrived and game thronged – which is a good thing for hunter-gatherers – and the conditions were ripe for cultivation to begin.</p> \n<p>Different areas around the world began growing different grains at different times. The Levant went for wheat, barley and oats, which were baked into bread. The oldest known so far is an unleavened flatbread dating back 14,400 years ago, found in what is now Jordan.</p> \n<p>Asian cuisine, from antiquity to date, was more focused on steaming in clay pots rather than barbecuing on open fires, and the crop of choice was rice. In northern Vietnam and Thailand, rice cultivation seems to have begun a tad late – about 4,000 years ago. In China, domestication of rice seems to have begun as much as 11,000 years ago.</p> \n<p>In any case, Oxenham stresses that early farmers continued to rely on hunting and gathering as well, for millennia.</p> \n<p>This is a good place to ask what an early farmer is. Archaeologists tend to look at that in binary terms too, but reality isn’t black and white, Oxenham explains to Haaretz.</p> \n<p>“You’re a farmer or a hunter-gatherer, and if we can’t plug you into one of these categories, you must be something else (such as a cultivator, whatever that means),” he says. Yet people today in remote villages in Asia and Africa farm for subsistence, and also still fish, trap birds and hunt: It isn’t the human norm to do just the one or the other.</p> \n<p>For instance, the 2017 discovery in Israel of flint sickles dating back 23,000 years proves that grain was being harvested. But that doesn’t mean it was being purposefully farmed, let alone at subsistence levels.</p> \n<p>“Many of our Neolithic sites, on further examination, are highly variable in terms of subsistence,” Oxenham explains. “Some show extensive use of hunting, while others the reverse. What are you? If you’re like me, you go to the supermarket to collect (buy) food, so you’re a forager!” Point taken.</p> \n<p>Same spot, different ancestors</p> \n<p>When saying the hunter-gatherers and early farmers had similar (i.e., terrible) states of health, that doesn’t mean they had the same problems.</p> \n<p>Oral health was better among southeast Asian hunter-gatherers relative to later farmers. Studying their teeth shows that the hunter-gatherers had only a 1.5 percent rate of cavities, while the farmers had something like 11 percent.</p> \n<p>Trauma patterns, such as which bones they broke, also differed. But the overall frequency of trauma was not necessarily that different between the two groups, says Oxenham.</p> \n<p>Also, tapeworm infestation was rife among the hunter-gatherers of Con Co Ngua, going by the discovery of hydatid cysts. Also, Oxenham tells Haaretz, they suffered from gout (which we now know is not related to diet but to inherited predisposition). “Neither hydatids nor gout has been identified in later farming communities in ancient Vietnam,” he says.</p> \n<p>For their part, the later farming communities had other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, and nonspecific (or unidentified) infectious diseases identified by way of lesions in the bones, Oxenham explains.</p> \n<p>One caveat to the comparison of their state of health is that the hunter-gatherers and early farmers at Con Co Ngua not only lived at different times, they had different ancestors.</p> \n<p>The Da But hunter-gatherers stemmed from early modern humans believed to have taken the southern route out of Africa, reaching southern China, Melanesia and Australia around 65,000 years ago, Oxenham explains. The farmers seem to have descended from a different group of early humans, who went more north and originally colonized Siberia around 40,000 years ago.</p> \n<p>Later descendants of the hunters and farmers probably mixed. Evidence from another northern Vietnamese site, Man Bac, indicates that when farming was starting in the area around 4,000 years ago by migrants from southern China, they did mix with indigenous descendants of the Da But.</p> \n<p>However, though they lived a couple of thousand years later, the early farmers in northern Vietnam do not seem to have descended from the hunter-gatherers – so they wouldn’t have inherited their propensities to disease or anything else.</p> \n<p>The comparison of their well-being begs another caveat: There is no evidence that the Da But people at Con Co Ngua grew a thing, but they likely managed wild plant resources such as sago (tapioca-like starch from palm tree stems) and canarium, as well as wild animals such as water buffalo.</p> \n<p>Oddly, while assuming that farming harmed our health, it has also been assumed that its development constituted cultural progress – that agriculture is superior to lurking in the bushes and spearing passing rabbits or cornering some hapless ibex. Oxenham for one isn’t slave to the theory that farming advanced humankind.</p> \n<p>Yet at the same time, maybe farming isn’t the demon we thought. “It’s got to the stage where, by default, we expect to see poor health in farming assemblages,” Oxenham says. “So, this Antiquity paper is turning the tables on this idea. We are saying: Hold on, health was crap among these hunter-gatherers at Con Co Ngua. It was, in fact, as bad as any farmer’s.”</p> \n<p>In short, the archaeologists sum up, the supposed correlation between farming and a decline in health may need to be reassessed.</p>",

When we do, we will do so,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday at the Knesset about a bill he had opposed. His explanation was harshly criticized by the opposition and gay activists.</p> \n<p>“I’ve asked MK Amir Ohana to draw up a bill we could get coalition partners to pass, which we could put before the Ministerial Committee on Legislation next month,” he added. “I heard your comments and your stories, and we identified with your desire to have children, to raise a family. That’s what you want and that’s what I want, too.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Why Israel's LGBT protest is soaring, while other liberal causes crash and burn | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu had to participate in the debate after lawmakers gathered a requisite 40 signatures for him to do so. The debate took place a short time after the Knesset rejected two opposition bills to include the LGBT community in surrogacy legislation.</p> \n<p>“It’s not an issue of right or left but rather one of humanity,” Netanyahu said. “My wife and I have often helped members of the LGBT community. In 2015 we did a lot on behalf of those who were stuck after the earthquake in Nepal, with the aim of bringing them all safely to Israel.”</p> \n<p>“I ask you, prime minister, look me in the eye and tell me I couldn’t be a good enough father,” said MK Itzik Shmuli (Labor), who is gay. “For 22 years thousands of people in the country have realized their dream to become parents. Hundreds of thousands of others have been given a life sentence to loneliness and discrimination. You made a promise and today the legislation was thwarted yet another time. We ask for the acceptance of a simple principle, that a human being is a human being,” Shmuli said. “We ask, demand and expect the right steps to be taken to adopt equality when it comes to surrogacy rights and in adoption. In the end it’s all in your hands.”</p> \n<p>Chen Arieli, head of the Association for LGBT Rights, said, “The prime minister saw it fitting to spell out clearly that he has no real intentions of permitting equal LGBT parenthood in Israel, and he’s blamed this on the coalition. The prime minister is hiding behind excuses instead of showing leadership to muster a majority in the Knesset, with the help of the LGBT community and Knesset factions. In clear words he calls upon the LGBT community not to support this coalition, in clear words he admits that the coalition controls him and that it’s not him who’s running the country. We won’t be silenced against a government that stands for discrimination.”</p> \n<p>Opposition chairwoman Tzipi Livni (Zionist Union) said during the debate that “Israel has citizens, human beings, who want to be parents and have a family. But what you’re telling them with each vote and this vote is let them keep on wanting. You tried to escape the debate but you weren’t permitted to do so. People asked on your behalf a number of times not to hold the debate today. The time has come for you to look them in the eye and explain to them why they may not be parents.</p> \n<p>“You knew that the same-gender issue isn’t a natural fit for your natural coalition partners,” Livni continued. “Your choice is always political, survival always wins. It’s wonderful to use a community as a prop to talk about how liberal Israel is. But your government represents the exact opposite of liberality.”</p> \n<p>Yesh Atid leader MK Yair Lapid quoted Netanyahu’s promise to pass legislation, and said, “It’s not even against your values,” Lapid said. “But in your value system there’s one thing beyond the right of people to become parents, and that is your right to be prime minister. In the end there’s not a single ideological bone left in your body. It’s all about the politics.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Middle East policy is unlikely to determine the outcome of next week’s mid-term elections in the United States. Voters will more likely be motivated by their sense of their economic well-being and prospects, the social and political tensions dividing America, and whether they want a more unleashed or a more constrained President Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>But it bears evaluating how Trump’s Middle East record stacks up at the halfway point of his term, and considering the paths it is likely to take depending on the election results.</p> \n<p>On a range of issues, Trump has achieved at least a partial success.</p> \n<p>In Syria, U.S. and allied forces have nearly completed the campaign to destroy ISIS, and U.S. strikes on Assad following chemical attacks seem to have deterred the dictator from resorting to the use of those weapons (although not other atrocities against regime opponents).</p> \n<p>Trump’s Iran gambit, withdrawing from the nuclear deal and imposing harsh unilateral sanctions, is generating far more pressure on the Iranian economy and regime than many observers predicted could be achieved by this point. Even tougher blows are still to come when full oil sanctions are restored in November.</p> \n<p>In Israel, Trump enjoys widespread popularity, a product of his unstinting support, his warm relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Iran decision, and his historic relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Regionally, the United States maintains partnerships with a coalition of Israel and Arab allies, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Jordan, and has pushed hard for openings toward normalization between Israel and Arab states. Netanyahu’s visit to Oman and the Israeli athletic teams competing in the UAE are recent dividends on that strategy.</p> \n<p>Each of these areas of progress, however, are incomplete, and many run parallel to ongoing challenges. Some initiatives drift with low prospects of resolution. Trump’s ability to consolidate the gains and advance further toward his goals, will be tested in 2019.</p> \n<p>In Syria, the Assad regime has been stabilized through brutal crushing of the opposition, and Russia has emerged as the dominant player.</p> \n<p>Israel is working hard, with U.S. support, to protect its interests by acting kinetically to disrupt Iran’s ongoing efforts to entrench threatening military assets in Syria. But Russia’s willingness to accommodate Israeli action is being tested following the downing of a Russian military aircraft by Syrian air defense units.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Overall, the United States is largely absent from efforts to shape the post-war Syrian reality now emerging, raising questions about its ability to ensure that U.S. and Israeli interests are protected.</p> \n<p>The Iran strategy, so far, involves the United States acting alone. While acquiescent to some secondary sanctions, no European country has followed the United States out of the nuclear deal. And the desired endgame is far from clear.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After sanctions impose a further bite on Iran, then what? Will the United States entertain negotiations with Iran on a new nuclear agreement, and if so, what kind of agreement would be considered success? What are the chances one could be reached?</p> \n<p>And if Iran pulls out of the agreement and resumes uranium enrichment to the threshold of nuclear breakout it was at before the JCPOA, would the United States pursue a military option or give Israel a green light to do so?</p> \n<p>If Trump has answers to these questions, they remain opaque.</p> \n<p>The Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, meanwhile, seems hopelessly stuck. That is not Trump’s fault, given the deep and abiding mistrust between the two sides, but the extreme Palestinian reaction to the Jerusalem announcement, and subsequent blows by the administration against the Palestinians, cutting off nearly all U.S. non-security assistance, has left the United States unable to conduct even a rudimentary dialogue with a Palestinian partner.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With no channel to one of the parties, no prospects for a deal or even negotiations between the current leaders, and Israeli elections around the corner, Trump may simply decide never to present his plan for the ultimate deal.</p> \n<p>And while the regional partnerships have borne fruit, they are also susceptible to the whims of unreliable players.</p> \n<p>The murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, on the heels of Saudi missteps with Qatar, Lebanon, and Canada, and a grinding war with devastating civilian suffering in Yemen, raise questions about the reliability and effectiveness of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is supposed to be the strategic anchor of the U.S.-led anti-Iran regional coalition.</p> \n<p>Can Trump rally to advance on this complex agenda? Sustained attention is one challenge. His foreign policy interests run toward consolidating his friendship with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and reaching a nuclear agreement with North Korea’s Kim Jung Un. He will soon turn his focus toward his own reelection campaign. And in the coming months, Special Counsel Robert Mueller may issue a report that could derail his presidency.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, if Democrats gain control of even one house of Congress, their ability to clip Trump’s wings, through hearings, investigations, and subpoenas, will be formidable. Under these circumstances, Trump and his national security team will be tested in a way they have not been yet: Building bipartisan support in Congress for controversial foreign policy initiatives.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To succeed on rolling back Iran’s nuclear program further, to ensure a robust U.S. military presence in Syria as leverage for the diplomatic endgame of the civil war, to effectively pressure and incentivize the Palestinians to come back to the negotiation table, and to keep the newly troubled relationship with Saudi Arabia on track, Trump will need Congressional help. Democrats, if they finally control the gavels, may be slow to provide it.</p> \n<p>If, on the other hand, Republicans maintain full control on Capitol Hill, Trump will have few, if any constraints. A full-on confrontation with Iran, an unrestrained Saudi Arabia, a collapsed Palestinian Authority, and a fully Russian-dominated Syria could all come to pass.</p> \n<p>Americans often choose divided government as a way of keeping the parties’ policy agendas in balance. With the Middle East in a delicate phase, and U.S. decisions that can inflame it or keep it calm still pending, there may be wisdom in that approach.</p> \n<p>Daniel B.

        "text":["<p>Tuesday’s local elections are not Israel’s version of the midterms. They are not even similar to local and regional elections in most Western democracies, where the national parties can use the results as a barometer of their popularity.</p> \n<p>In most cities and local governments in Israel, the majority of slates competing for seats are formed on an ad-hoc basis, and at most are only loosely aligned with national parties. Most mayoral candidates are independent, and while they vie for the endorsement of national leaders, whether they win or lose does not necessarily reflect on those who backed them.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>For all these reasons, there are usually few takeaways about national politics to be gleaned from local elections. For example, what is expected to be a close race between Tel Aviv’s mayor of 20 years, Ron Huldai, and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;-turned-nemesis Asaf Zamir, has little relevance outside of the city – even though Huldai is a member of the Labor Party.</p> \n<p>Another Labor member, the popular incumbent Ruvik Danilovich, is almost certain to win a third term as mayor of Be’er Sheva by a landslide, despite Labor having received only 12 percent of the vote in the national election there in 2015. It won’t be a sign of an improvement in the party’s sagging prospects.</p> \n<p>That said, local elections in Israel do sometimes indicate important and wider political trends. One such election took place in 1993, when two things happened that were important harbingers for the future.</p> \n<p>At the time, the national parties were more involved in local elections. The young leader of the opposition, Benjamin Netanyahu, had been elected Likud chairman eight months earlier and was doing badly in the polls. Yitzhak Rabin’s government, borne on the initial popularity of the Oslo process, seemed confident of wiping Likud out.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Orthodox goes secular, Jew votes Palestinian: In Jerusalem, traditional walls are cracking&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The right-wing party was also in deep debt and had just gone through a major round of budget slashing and firing key employees. But Netanyahu needed to prove himself to his skeptical party colleagues and threw himself into the local campaigns, raising money for candidates and setting up a centralized apparatus that offered services like advertising for Likud slates across the country.</p> \n<p>It worked, and in dozens of local races – including the most prestigious ones in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv – Likud unexpectedly beat Labor’s lackadaisical operation. But Rabin and Shimon Peres shrugged it off, instead of taking note of how Netanyahu was capable of making up for his party’s shortcomings by transforming it into a lean campaign machine.</p> \n<p>The most humiliating of Labor’s losses was Jerusalem, where Rabin had personally urged the city’s 82-year-old mayor of three decades, Teddy Kollek, to run one last time. Kollek was felled by Likud’s Ehud Olmert, who, on the eve of the election, had reached an agreement for the ultra-Orthodox parties to pull their candidate out and join him. It was an epochal moment in Haredi politics.</p> \n<p>Before that, the ultra-Orthodox parties had maneuvered between Likud and Labor, driving hard bargains after each election. Jerusalem 1993 was the sealing of their deal with the right-wing – and particularly with Netanyahu, who would count on the small group of men who ran Haredi politics to be his loyal allies for the next 25 years.</p> \n<p>In 1996, this time in a national election in which he went head to head with Labor’s complacent Peres, Netanyahu would again prove what a devastatingly efficient campaigner he is and utilize his alliance with the ultra-Orthodox to the maximum.</p> \n<p>Now, 2018 could turn out to be the rare local election that signals a generational shift in Israeli politics.</p> \n<p>Even before we know the results, two major trends are occurring. First, the leaderships of the main ultra-Orthodox parties which succeeded in coordinating electoral strategy on the local and national levels since the early 1990s have dissolved.</p> \n<p>There are at least five Haredi blocs: the Hasidic Agudat Yisrael; the “Lithuanian” Degel Hatorah; the breakaway “Lithuanian” Peleg Yerushalmi; the Mizrahi Shas party and the breakaway group from it, Yachad. And all are at war with each other. In Jerusalem alone, the Haredi blocs are supporting three different candidates for mayor.</p> \n<p>The breakdown of ultra-Orthodox politics will almost certainly influence next year’s national election and could quite likely deny Netanyahu the crucial alliance he needs for forming a strong coalition – one that will stick by him once he is inevitably indicted for corruption.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the prime minister has more immediate troubles: The wheels are falling off his formidable election machine.</p> \n<p>This is partly due to the fact that for years he has failed to invest in Likud’s local operations, but also to a weakening of his authority. In Jerusalem, Minister Zeev Elkin is running as Likud’s candidate without the support of the local party branch and with Netanyahu’s grudging endorsement.</p> \n<p>In other big cities like Tel Aviv, Haifa and Be’er Sheva, Likud doesn’t even have a candidate. In some smaller cities, like Bat Yam, there are two Likud candidates. And in others that have a strong Likud voter base, Netanyahu’s favored candidates – such as MK Jackie Levy in Beit She’an – are far from assured of victory.</p> \n<p>Cracks are beginning to show at every level, with branch chairmen, MKs and ministers publicly coming out in favor of candidates who Netanyahu refused to endorse.</p> \n<p>It’s nowhere near a collapse of his authority, but it’s the start of Likud beginning to prepare itself for the succession battle on the day Netanyahu is forced to leave. All this is happening even before we know the results (polls close at 22:00 local time).</p> \n<p>Here is another scenario that may arise from the 2018 local elections. If the young secular centrist Ofer Berkovitch pulls off a victory in Jerusalem, Huldai succumbs to Zamir in Tel Aviv and newcomer Laborite Einat Kalisch Rotem turfs out Mayor Yona Yahav in Haifa – and all these outcomes are within the realms of possibility – it may create a wave of anti-incumbency that could sustain itself into next year’s national election and hit the biggest incumbent of them all.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Ofer military court on Wednesday acquitted a Palestinian of murder, opting to instead issue a manslaughter conviction over a 2016 incident that led to the death of an Israeli reserve soldier.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian, Mamdouh Amro, was running from a considerable distance toward Eliav Gelman with a knife, prompting Israeli forces in the area to open fire. The soldiers missed their target and shot and killed Gelman by mistake.</p> \n<p>In a two-to-one decision, a panel of military judges ruled that it cannot be proven that Amro intended to cause the death of the soldier at the scene. Gelman was waiting for a ride at the Gush Etzion junction in the West Bank&nbsp;when he was shot.</p> \n<p>Military court Judge Lidor Drachman ruled that in light of Amro's statements that he had come to the site with the aim of being killed himself by Israeli soldiers' weapons fire, it cannot be proven that he intended to murder Gelman.</p> \n<p>&quot;The combination of several [pieces of] evidence casts reasonable doubt regarding the intent to kill as the only possible conclusion,&quot; Drachman wrote. &quot;It is apparent from the outset that the accused has provided a version of events demonstrating that it was not his intention to make use of the knife or to cause anyone else's death.&quot;</p> \n<p>The evidence does not show that Amro tried to attack soldiers or civilians at the scene, Drachman added. &quot;The fact that the accused chose to pull out a knife at a relatively large distance, wave it over his head, and run with it towards the armed soldiers after they called on him to stop backs up his claim that he wanted the soldiers to shoot and kill him, or alternatively, that he wanted to be arrested.&quot;</p> \n<p>Drachman also based her decision on the testimony of a psychiatrist who had treated Amro a month and a half prior to the incident. The psychiatrist attested that Amro had said, at that time, that he wanted to die. Amro was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds that he was apathetic to the possibility that other people could be hurt in the incident.</p> \n<p>A second member of the three-judge panel, Rinat Levy-Moskovitch, concurred in the decision, but the third judge, Menahem Lieberman, dissented. Lieberman thought that the defendant should have been convicted of murder, an offense which under military law is defined as intentionally causing death. Judge Lieberman took the position that the defendant's conduct demonstrated that he had come to the area to commit murder.</p> \n<p>Gelman was married and the father of two sons. He had completed his regular army service several months earlier and was in the reserves. He grew up in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba outside of Hebron and lived in Karmei Tzur, north of Hebron, at the time of his death.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Birds lay eggs, reptiles lay eggs, even some mammals lay eggs. But among all the amniotes, only birds lay eggs with colors – some quite eye-popping. Everyone else lays white eggs.</p> \n<p>We have known for years that some dinosaurs had colorful eggs too. The birdlike Heyuannia huangi, a stunted-winged beaked dinosaur found in China, laid blue-green eggs that look startlingly like those of the latter-day emu.</p> \n<p>So, scientists had already figured that color in eggshells originated in dinosaurs. Now a team writing in Nature explain how new findings demonstrate that pigmented eggshells evolved exactly once – among maniraptors, the type of dinosaur that would evolve into birds.</p> \n<p>A broad study of dinosaur eggshells from a range of types show that the eggs of non-maniraptor dinosaurs were unpigmented. In other words, white.</p> \n<p>What needed demonstrating was that birds inherited the ability to produce red, green, brown and blue eggshell pigments from their dinosaur ancestors, rather than evolving it separately by convergent evolution.</p> \n<p>Convergent evolution is when totally different beings separately evolve similar solutions. For instance, birds have wings and cockroaches have wings, and both can fly with their wings, but they do not have the same evolutionary origin.</p> \n<p>Feeling blue</p> \n<p>How can colors of extinct animals – feathers, skin or eggshells – be deduced anyway? Key to this theory was the eureka moment in which scientists realized what they were seeing under the microscope wasn’t fossilized bacteria but fossilized melanosomes.</p> \n<p>Melanosomes are subcellular organelles that contain melanin. Different colors of melanin give different colors to hair, feathers, skin and eyes. Crucially, different types of melanin are found in organelles of different shapes.</p> \n<p>For instance, melanosomes with the color red are shaped like little meatballs, while black melanosomes look like cocktail sausages, explains a 2015 paper on 50-million-year-old fossil bats, which turn out to have been reddish-brown.</p> \n<p>Regarding feathered dinosaurs, a turning point was the study of a spectacularly preserved banded 108-million-year-old feather found in Brazil. Microscopic examination found that its black stripes contained sausage-like melanosomes, while the white stripes had no melanosomic structures.</p> \n<p>This latest ovi-research group, headed by Jasmina Wiemann of Yale, used advanced spectroscopic analysis to study dinosaur eggshells from all major groups, seeking evidence of pigmentation. Pictures of garishly striped velociraptors are still more imagination than reliable fact, but this team definitely did show that bird eggs and maniraptor eggs both have red-brown protoporphyrin IX and blue-green biliverdin.</p> \n<p>Maniraptors are the group of small, bipedal dinosaurs, some of which generated the birds we love to watch and eat. Not only did the maniraptors have colored eggs: the patterns on their shells are akin to the speckling and spotting patterns we can see in today’s bird eggs.</p> \n<p>The scientists also demonstrated that ornithischian and sauropod eggs were colorless (i.e., white), and demonstrated that this was a true signal rather than an artifact of their fossilization. Famous examples of ornithischians are the triceratops and stegosaurus. An example of sauropods is the titanic long-necked brontosaurus and their ilk.</p> \n<p>It was not only the ancestors of birds among the maniraptors that had colored eggs. So did some non-avian maniraptors, and their color pattern diversity is like that of today’s birds.</p> \n<p>In other words, colored eggs evolved “deep within the dinosaur tree,” as the team put it. It happened long before birds evolved. Separate research also suggested that egg color evolved with open nesting habits in dinosaurs predating the split to birds.</p> \n<p>Among the dinosaurs found to have colored eggs were the Heyuannia, whose eggs – founds in the thousands – were blue-green; troodontids, small dinosaurs that looked like mean birds and had serrated teeth in their beaks; the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus antirrhopus, which might have been amusing if not for those talons that look like they could eviscerate a crocodile; the wee enantiornithine, very birdy though with a toothed beak too, and many more.</p> \n<p>One wonders why the maniraptors would evolve colored eggs. We do not know but can factor in the observation that bird-egg color has been demonstrated to adapt to changes in incubation strategy or climate, or even in mating behavior.</p> \n<p>This all leads to speculation that egg color evolved among animals that didn’t bury or somehow conceal their eggs, but laid them and left them exposed. White eggs stand out and are more likely to be eaten, but speckled eggs can be camouflaged.</p>",

        "text":["<p>As a teenager, Nadia Chahin, now 31, saw herself first and foremost as a citizen of Chile. Even if she supported the Palestinians fervently, that was mainly an emotional connection. Like many Chileans of Palestinian descent, she doesn’t speak Arabic. Her maternal grandparents arrived in Chile in 1920; her father’s family immigrated in 1948, but not as refugees. Everyone did well: Her father is a physician, her mother is a lawyer, and Shahin herself practices law.</p> \n<p>When she was 22, she made what she says was an impulsive decision to visit the West Bank and meet the part of her family that had remained there. She arrived via the Allenby Bridge crossing from Jordan on her own. And there, for a few hours, she ceased to be a free Chilean citizen and became a Palestinian subject to abuse.</p> \n<p>“I was very uptight,” she told me, when we met at Santiago de Chile’s Palestinian Club. “The girl at the border asked for my email password and entered it on her computer. I was left to wait on a chair in the corridor. No one spoke to me, other than a soldier who was supposedly looking after me. I was hysterical and felt very vulnerable. I had no idea what would happen to me. For 12 hours they let everyone else through, but I was left sitting on that chair. It was an awful experience. In the end they informed that I wasn’t allowed to enter Israel or the territories. They told me I would never get to the territories.”</p> \n<p>Did they explain why?</p> \n<p>“No explanation. They told me I was a liar. I felt I was being humiliated.”</p> \n<p>Did it have anything to do with BDS?</p> \n<p>“The anti-boycott law is only from the past couple of years. They knew we wouldn’t throw stones. They know that Christians have no connection with Hamas. By expelling me, they just wanted to send a message to the world that people who speak out against the occupation or are pro-Palestinian, will be stopped. If Israel sees itself as a democracy, it also needs to accept people who are critical of it.”</p> \n<p>Had you led opposition to Israel?</p> \n<p>“I was in a group of Chilean Palestinian students, but not as a central figure. I was just 22, I wasn’t the leader of anything. I was a hysterical, naive young woman at the crossing. It would have been smarter to come with my parents or with a friend, not alone. But I wanted to meet the family. My aunt has since died, and I never met her.”</p> \n<p>Those hours at the border were a watershed in Shahin’s life. “The experience made me more political than I had been. There, at the border, I felt Palestinian for the first time. I was always close to the Palestinians and to Palestinian history, but that was the first time I’d felt the fragility of being Palestinian, for 12 hours. That’s one of the reasons I chose to major in human rights in my law studies – because it’s relevant to the Palestinians, of course. My parents would have liked me to go into civil law, where the earning possibilities are better.”</p> \n<p>It’s hard to think of a place as far from the Palestinians, from Israel and from the common mud in which we’re mired, as Chile. But it’s precisely in Chile that the largest Palestinian minority outside the Middle East has formed. The roots of the community go back to the mid-19th century Crimean War, and immigration swelled at the beginning of the 20th century. Between 300,000 and half a million people with Palestinian roots live (happily) in a country with a population of 18 million. A local saying has it that in every small village in Chile you’ll find a priest, a policeman and a Palestinian. About 95 percent of the “Chilestinians” are Christians whose origins lie in the Jerusalem-area triangle of Bethlehem, Beit Jalla and Beir Sahour. Most of the families immigrated before the 1930s and with no connection to the creation of Israel. There are now more Palestinian Christians in Chile than within the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority.</p> \n<p>The main impulse for those early waves of emigration was the Ottoman conscription law. Christians were drafted at an early age and sent to the front, sometimes unarmed, to serve as cannon fodder in battles against other Christians, in the Balkan wars and in World War I. Since the Palestinians arrived in Chile with Ottoman papers, they were dubbed “Turks.” The epithet stuck even after 1918, when the papers they carried were from the British Mandate, and over the years, it became a derogatory term. On the other hand, the fact that they were Christians, like most Chileans, helped them integrate. In addition, the Middle East-like Chilean climate, despite its tendency to grayness, eased the immigrants’ longings for home.</p> \n<p>At first, the Palestinians sold goods in the streets. They saved up until they were able to open small stores, sometimes next to Jewish merchants. Later, they became dominant in local textile manufacture and in the real estate business; today people of Palestinian descent control a hefty slice of Chilean banking, again alongside Jews.</p> \n<p>By the second generation, the immigrants were enrolling in university. About 10 percent of the members of the National Congress of Chile, the country’s legislature, are of Palestinian origin – four times their proportion in the population. Although in the early decades, the Palestinians in Chile married within the community, these days, about 70 percent marry outside. Still, even those with only one Palestinian parent will generally consider themselves proud Palestinian Chileans.</p> \n<p>“After the 1970s, the mother who once would have forbade her daughter to marry a ‘Turk’ would now tell her she would do well to marry a rich Arab,” says Carlos Medina, a high-tech man and a Palestinian patriot whose father is Chilean and whose mother’s family is from Beit Jalla and Bethlehem. He, for his part, recently married an Ethiopian woman he met by way of an internet chat room.</p> \n<p>Last month, during what was a spring week in Chile, I met with many Chilestinians in their cafes and in the Palestinian Club – an impressive complex of conference rooms, caf&eacute;s, swimming pools, tennis courts and bowling alleys, that looks like it could be one of Donald Trump’s estates – and I even went to a soccer game in Santiago, where I rooted for the Palestino team.</p> \n<p>Vulgar though the comparison may be, it’s hard for an Israeli journalist not to juxtapose Chilestinians and Diaspora Jews, who sometimes outdo Israelis. The Chilestinians reminded me most of the warm Jews I met in France. Their idealization of Israel and their anger at and fear of the Arabs are quite similar to the Chilestinians’ love for Palestine and their fury at Israel and its actions. Everyone I spoke to in Chile expressed great interest in the fate of the Palestinians and was thinking about how they could help their distressed relatives.</p> \n<p>One of the principal, if minor, traits that sets apart the Chilestinians from Palestinians I know back home is the humor with which the latter talk about the conflict. A resident of the territories, even if he’s lost an arm in the struggle for independence, will almost always spice his comments with a sarcastic joke. The Chilestinians, by contrast, were very serious and gloomy.</p> \n<p>Of course, they are by no means monolithic in their views. Some believe in a Palestinian state alongside Israel, set within the pre-1967 borders; others advocate a one-state solution. There are those who back BDS but are afraid to admit it out loud, for fear they will not be allowed to visit their relatives in the territories. Others are against BDS, but are also afraid to say so, for fear of angering members of their community. But the overwhelming majority of the people I interviewed said they wouldn’t move to Palestine even if it were a free and independent state. Chile is the most economically successful and democratically stable country in South America today, and by now the Palestinians who live there are Chilean in every respect. It would be hard for them to integrate in Palestine. Arabic was lost to them a hundred years ago, and a course in the language offered this year by the Palestinian Club drew only a few dozen people from a vastly larger potential.</p> \n<p>Winning the Nakba Cup</p> \n<p>On October 6, Deportivo Palestino hosted the Universidad de Chile team in the semifinal of the Chile Cup, in the capital. Palestino, one of the leading teams in Chile’s Primera Division, was established about a century ago by Palestinian immigrants on an amateur basis. In 1955, three years after being officially registered as a professional club, the team finished first in the league, an achievement it repeated in 1978. In its glory years it was known as “Millonario,” as success made it a rich team. It’s almost impossible to talk about Chile’s Palestinian community without noting its pride in Palestino.</p> \n<p>At present, though, the team is in 12th place in a 16-team league, and is danger of being demoted to a lower league. If in the past the team consisted exclusively of Chilestinians, at the moment there isn’t even one Palestinian player. Still, management is Palestinian, and the team’s sponsor is the Dubai-registered Bank of Palestine. Despite the team’s poor showing this year, there was a merry atmosphere in the game I attended – everyone in the home stands waved Palestinian flags, and there were kaffiyehs and darbuka drums. I must have brought Palestino luck, because they beat Universidad, which is high up in the league, with a score of 2-0, and thus advanced to the finals.</p> \n<p>The story of Roberto Kettlun, 37, Palestino’s manager, is somewhat unusual. Unlike the majority of the Chilestinians, who generally love Palestine from afar, Kettlun, whose family left Bethlehem in 1909, lived in the West Bank for a time. The Palestinians were then trying to improve their national soccer team and were recruiting Palestinians from abroad. Kettlun was one of their finds. At the time, however, the team didn’t have a decent playing field that had been approved by FIFA, the international soccer body, so it played its home games in Amman and Doha. “We did pretty well,” he recalls. After becoming involved in a dispute with an Italian team he played for, he decided to move to Ramallah, where he began playing in the Palestinian league.Thus, the first time he trod on the soil of Palestine was in 2011, on the Hilal Al-Quds team, within the framework of the Al-Nakba Cup competition.</p> \n<p>We met in his office. Kettlun, relaxed in a hooded sweatshirt, told me that his children and his wife miss Tel Aviv. “All I knew about Palestine was from the news,” he related. “We heard about the occupation and about rubber bullets. The situation affected the Palestinian team. Why didn’t Ismail show up for the game? He was wounded by a rubber bullet. Where’s Jamal? He’s been sentence to prison for a few years. When I arrived, the Al-Aqsa Intifada had ended and the wall [the security barrier] was under construction, and there were plenty of checkpoints. But despite everything, we saw happy people. The restaurants were full, the crowd came to the games.”</p> \n<p>If there were an independent state and peace, could you see yourself living in Palestine?</p> \n<p>“Even without peace, if the Israelis would give me permits, I would move to Palestine tomorrow.”</p> \n<p>Because of your political identification?</p> \n<p>“I’m not interested in politics, my business is sports. It’s simply that the people in Ramallah are nicer and the food tastes better. The children there grow up with a different mentality and get an excellent education. My wife, who is Argentinian, really enjoyed living there. The only thing stopping me is that Israel didn’t renew my visa. I spent half a year without a visa, without leaving Ramallah. In the end I didn’t want to take the risk. They told me, ‘We know where you live.’ I was afraid they would come and take me. Even before that, they made problems for me every time I tried to enter [the West Bank] from Jordan, even if they were polite and offered me tea. Sometimes it took seven-eight hours [to cross the border]. One time I came with a six-month-old baby who needed a vaccination, and they didn’t want to let me in.”</p> \n<p>Some people were angry when you criticized Israel in the media during the last war in Gaza [in 2014].</p> \n<p>“I described only what I myself saw and experienced. Some people in the Jewish community here try to justify everything that Israel does. But Jews and Palestinians always did business together. Jews and Arabs also live together in Tel Aviv and Haifa.”</p> \n<p>Are you in favor of one state or of two states for two peoples?</p> \n<p>“Two states, of course.”</p> \n<p>But there’s a map of historic Palestine emblazoned on your T-shirt.</p> \n<p>“Listen, that’s no longer viable. We need to be realistic. Many Jews live there. Leave the West Bank, remove the settlers and we’ll make peace. There’s enough hummus and falafel for everyone. You have a nice port in Tel Aviv. Why quarrel?”</p> \n<p>‘They have startups there?’</p> \n<p>A new documentary film about the Palestino team, titled “Four Colors” (a reference to the colors of the Palestinian flag on the team uniform), encapsulates the team’s glorious past, integrates material about the political situation in Palestine and even has an interview with former Maccabi Haifa soccer team star Zahi Armeli, an Arab citizen of Israel. According to the film, one of Palestino’s high points was the minute of silence the players observed for the victims of the 1982 Sabra and Chatila refugee camps massacre. “Our goal with the team is to show that we exist in the face of the occupier who wants to erase us,” a female fan asserts in the film.</p> \n<p>The person behind the movie is Carlos Medina, 42, the high-tech person. Adding the historic map of Palestine to the uniform in 2004 was a shot in the arm for the team, he maintains. He’s unfazed when I point out that the map, with no borders, rattles even left-wingers like myself, who are struggling to achieve peace. “It’s just a map of historic Palestine, it has no other significance for us,” he explains. “What it says is that Jews, Christians and Muslims can live together peacefully, like before the [1947] partition plan.”</p> \n<p>Marcelo Diaz, 45, who terms himself a “serial entrepreneur,” is also trying to help the Palestinians from faraway South America, by assisting Palestinian companies in the territories. “There are carrot-and-stick people, I am totally a carrot person,” he says. His family, which is of English and German extraction on one side, and Palestine from the other, arrived from the Land of Israel before World War I so the men could evade the Ottoman draft. “If you’re Yuval Noah Harari,” he says, referring to the Israeli historian and bestselling author, “you see us all as having originated in Africa. But for me it was important to know my roots, so I did a DNA test. I’m really into the subject [of genetics]. Most of my blood is Arab, and four percent is Jewish.”</p> \n<p>Searching for his origins, Diaz visited Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 2013. “It was excellent,” he recalls. “They threw me a party and 350 people showed up, all of them my relatives.”</p> \n<p>Would you live in Palestine?</p> \n<p>Diaz: “No, my roots are in Chile. But I can help startups, which is what I know how to do. I met excellent entrepreneurs there, with good educations and a high technical level. But in contrast to startups here or in Tel Aviv, for example, they think locally, not in world terms. For example, they’re planning an app that will let people know when the local checkpoint is closed. I’m trying to get them to think about the global market.”</p> \n<p>How did it go at the checkpoints?</p> \n<p>“When I said I was helping startups in Ramallah, the soldier said, ‘Really, do they have startups there?’ He was enthusiastic. They weren’t rude to me, maybe because of what I do. Everyone I met in Tel Aviv was also nice.”</p> \n<p>With clients like these</p> \n<p>Before setting out, when I looked for information about the Palestinian community in Chile online, I found mainly horror stories related by people in the country’s Jewish community, which numbers about 16,000. There were grim accounts of tension between the groups and about growing extremism among the Palestinians. However, when I asked the Chilestinians I met about intercommunal relations, I was surprised to hear that, in contrast to the reports in the Jewish media, they believed that relations were very good.</p> \n<p>I met Pedro Bravo Lachsan, 50, in a textile plant with 1,560 employees in Santiago’s Patronato neighborhood. His forebears immigrated from Palestine at the beginning of the last century. “My grandparents came to Buenos Aires but didn’t like the climate, so they went on to Chile,” Lachsan, who is a marketing official in the company, relates. “Here they found soil like in Palestine, on which they could build a home. My grandfather started off selling door to door; in the end he got rich from selling equipment to mines. They always had good relations with the Jews. During World War II, my family organized a poker game to raise funds for Jewish refugees arriving in Chile. Relations are still excellent today. My uncle is married to a Jewish woman. In Chile, people are not taught to hate Jews.”</p> \n<p>I heard that there is tension.</p> \n<p>“We also read that in the newspapers and laugh. My clients are Rosenberg and Dery. The truth is that the Jewish children sometimes change all at once. After summer camp, they suddenly return as Zionists, and then there’s tension. But relations are good; there are always a few radicals. Some people claim that we support Hamas. That’s amusing. Listen, in Chile, there’s a Jewish fire station. During the 2010 earthquake they came around to people’s houses and asked everyone whether they needed anything. The Palestinians opened their doors to them and offered them coffee. In 95 percent of the cases, relations are good. There’s a Palestinian pita bakery that became kosher.”</p> \n<p>Lachsan’s testimony is seconded by Eli Magantzo, 57, a management engineer who’s helping to streamline the work in the textile factory and who’s associated with Jerusalem’s Aish Hatorah Yeshiva. “My father and I never had problems with the Palestinians here,” he says. “But maybe there’s more tension at a young age. The young people are more receptive to information from Israel, and that can cause problems.”</p> \n<p>“We always worked with Jews; there are special relations with Jews,” says Claudio Cassis, the Chilestinian owner of the textile firm, which bears his surname. “They always arrived in Chile with higher education, while the Palestinians arrived with no education. The educated Palestinians moved to Europe, not Chile. There are stories about Palestinian families such as the Siah family, which started out as shoe polishers and are now one of the strongest families in the Chilean economy.”</p> \n<p>Cassis visited the family home in the territories in 1989 and in 1998, and came away disappointed. “You feel the tension in the air there,” he says. “I came with expectations and I didn’t like what I saw. The towns are small and not very pretty. And I didn’t like the racism. The Israelis discriminate against the Mizrahim and the Ethiopians; the Palestinians in Bethlehem are disdainful of the people in [nearby] Beit Sahour, because they are villagers.”</p> \n<p>Casis and Lachsan are divided about how to resolve the conflict. One advocates two states, the other one democratic state. They’re in accord regarding BDS. Says Casis: “That’s a good way to conduct a nonviolent protest.”</p> \n<p>A gloomier picture is painted by Marcelo Isaacson, the executive director of the Jewish Community of Chile. “To be a Jew in Chile is not dangerous, but it’s also not easy,” he says. “I am not religious, but there are many stories about religiously observant people who are afraid to walk on the street in Chile wearing a yarmulke, because there are a great many Palestinians. The problem is that they are extremist activists. In the past there was quite a bit of cooperation between Palestinians and Jews. That changed eight years ago, because of the radicalization of the organization that represents the Palestinians. They identify with Hamas.”</p> \n<p>But they are Christians, and Hamas is a threat to them, too, not only to Israel.</p> \n<p>“Precisely.”</p> \n<p>The Palestinians maintain that you are an extremist organization, in contrast to most members of the Jewish community. And you say the same about them.</p> \n<p>“Our organization is extreme? No. We support Israel and believe in the solution of two states for two peoples. They are the extremists.”</p> \n<p>‘The food is an excuse’</p> \n<p>The Patronato neighborhood is considered Santiago’s Palestinian quarter. If you look for it, you will find a Palestinian flag flying in the neighborhood, and businesses like the Beit Jalla Cafeteria, but it doesn’t look like a stereotypical Palestinian neighborhood. There is a greater Korean presence, for example. Still, at the edge of the neighborhood there’s an intersection where three Arab restaurants are located. We opt for Jamila’s, because of the many balloons in the colors of the flag, which generate a feeling of a Palestinian bar mitzvah.</p> \n<p>If there’s one sure mistake you can make while traveling abroad, it’s to eat the food of your country and not the local food. Still, I have only good things to say about the stuffed vegetables at Jamila’s. Even though I hadn’t called ahead, the establishment’s owner, 43-year-old Jamila Jadue, came specially when she heard that an Israeli journalist was in her restaurant. She said that her father, Nicholas, was on the premises as well, and he soon joined us. He said that he’s proud that one of his relatives married a Jew. He was also delighted to hear me enunciate the Middle Eastern gutturals. Now 74, Nicholas arrived relatively late from Beit Jalla, in 1955, when he was 11. Even though his whole life revolves around Palestine, he hasn’t visited the homeland since he left for Chile.</p> \n<p>“The family is nostalgic, but I don’t want to go. I moved to Chile as a young boy and I’ve been here since then, that’s it.”</p> \n<p>Are you Palestinian or Chilean?</p> \n<p>Nicholas: “Palestinian. All my family and friends are Palestinians. And in Chile, it’s very easy to feel like a Palestinian.”</p> \n<p>Jamila, for her part, avoids traveling to the Palestinian territories because she’s afraid of how she will react. “I have to respond if I see violence or injustice,” she says. “I have an edgy temperament. I would have to intervene. So it’s best that I don’t go and get into trouble.”</p> \n<p>You make Palestinian food without ever having eaten in Palestine?</p> \n<p>“I learned from the women in the family. Believe me, the raw materials are better here.”</p> \n<p>For Jamila, the restaurant that’s named for her is an avocation. “Our aim is not only to sell food but to show that Palestine exists – the food is only an excuse. It’s a symbol of the homeland, of our identity. We inserted butterflies in the logo in the colors of the flag, because the butterfly is a symbol of freedom. I don’t want to get into politics, but Palestine needs to be free.”</p> \n<p>She’s proud that when Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas visited Chile half a year ago, he asked for food from the restaurant to be sent to his hotel. “He said that he hadn’t eaten Palestinian food this good in 70 years,” she says, glowing. “He went to the Palestinian Club, saw all the flags of Palestine and said that he felt like he was in Palestine, not Chile.”</p>",

He has not called for killing, and he has avoided explicitly anti-Semitic language.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But when tribalistic hatreds are tearing our country apart, he has chosen to play to the fears of Americans. Instead of offering real hope in a time of trouble, he has preferred to talk tough on immigrants, evoke the image of dissolute Hispanics storming our borders, and rant about &quot;globalists&quot; and George Soros as the puppet masters of an international economic conspiracy.</p> \n<p>As Congressional candidate Tom Malinowski&nbsp;has written, &quot;These words are like sparks to the gasoline of disturbed minds.&quot; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>If the president were doing his job, Americans would be turning to each other and not on each other. But instead, Mr. Trump has encouraged the crazies, and innocent Americans have been targeted and killed, Jews included.</p> \n<p>Aware as we are of the dangers that we face here, what should Jews - in America and around the world - be doing and expecting right now?</p> \n<p>We should expect violence against Jews to increase, and prepare accordingly.</p> \n<p>The overwhelming likelihood is that we will see more anti-Semitism in the years ahead, including Jew-hatred of the violent sort.</p> \n<p>America is beset by a series of economic and political challenges that have no simple answers. This is a dangerous time for our country. And to get through these times, America desperately needs a leader who will appeal to people’s hopes and not their fears.</p> \n<p>But Donald Trump cannot do what is needed. Whatever lingering hopes we might have had that he could rise to the occasion were smashed to smithereens by the events of the past week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Wouldn't domestic terror and assassination attempts on his opponents be the kickstart to make him try harder to be the president of all Americans?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Obviously not. Shooting Jews in a synagogue and blacks in a shopping mall didn’t matter. Sending bombs to former presidents didn’t matter. Apart from offering a few perfunctory acts of consolation, the president could not transcend the race-baiting, media-baiting, and immigrant-baiting for which he is known.&nbsp;He is the president of his base, and of his base alone.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And what of the upcoming election? While it is vitally important to the well-being of the country, when it comes to anti-Semitism, it will make little difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The country desperately needs a Democratic Congress and checks and balances in our government, but as long as Trump is president, the revival of anti-Semitism will continue apace.&nbsp;That is the American reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We should reconnect with our Christian friends, neighbors, and allies and rebuild a religious coalition against anti-Semitism in America.</p> \n<p>This coalition, of course, should also include Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and other religious groups.&nbsp;But Christianity is the numerically dominant religion in America, and ties with Christians must therefore be our first concern.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The anti-Semitism that we now see does not emanate from Christian sources, but if current trends continue, it will begin to seep into every crack and crevice of American life, and combatting it will be impossible without the strong backing of Christian leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In theory, religious alliances with Christians already exist in America, but only a relative handful of Jews and Christians engage in ongoing dialogue, and it is not a matter of significant importance to either religious community.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as some Christian leaders and scholars have&nbsp;already noted, it is simply a historical fact that a legacy of hatred of Jews has dominated Christianity for much of the last two thousand years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In light of this history, it would be best for Jews and Christians working together to take the initiative on fighting anti-Semitism before it spreads beyond extremist circles.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;We should take reasonable precautions to assure the safety of our synagogues without turning them into fortresses.</p> \n<p>A number of European Jewish leaders have already&nbsp;offered American Jews advice on how their synagogues and Jewish institutions can be turned into safe spaces. They propose setting up barriers, providing armed guards, and reconfiguring synagogue architecture to enhance security.</p> \n<p>Their intentions are good, but their advice is questionable. In most cases, what they are proposing just won’t work in America.</p> \n<p>Yes, doors can be locked during the week, volunteer guards can be recruited, and on special occasions, off-duty police can be hired for protection. But America is a big country, with literally thousands of synagogues, not to mention Federations, JCCs, and Jewish organizations of every shape and size.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The largest synagogues and major federations can afford to hire armed guards on a regular basis. But mid-sized and smaller synagogues do not have the resources to provide this kind of protection. And sprawling suburban synagogues are virtually impossible to protect without massive expenditures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What’s the answer?&nbsp;Commonsense suggests some modest adjustments to synagogue routine. But the simple fact is that attending synagogue in the future will entail a greater measure of risk than before, albeit a very small one. Most Jews will be prepared to take that risk, and in fact will be anxious to maintain the openness and welcoming nature of their congregations and communities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the same time, they will demand from the president two things: first, that he limit access to guns and stand up to the NRA &nbsp;- the real criminals’ lobby in our country; and secondly, that he provide full backing to the FBI and intelligence services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These services, in addition to local law enforcement, are essential to preventing domestic terror. Ironically, or not, in his two-year effort to destroy the Mueller investigation, these are the very people that the president has gone out of his way to attack, discredit, and embarrass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After Pittsburgh, we saw that our national law enforcement apparatus carried out its duties promptly and impressively. Keeping that apparatus intact should be a top priority for Jews and all Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We must do what is needed so that Israel and American Jews can stand together at times of crisis - and this means Israel must recognize Reform and Conservative Judaism.</p> \n<p>Enough! Even when Jews are lying dead on the floor of their Pittsburgh synagogue, Israeli Orthodox leaders are questioning their Jewish identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to the Israeli press, Israel’s chief rabbis refused to say that the massacre took place in a synagogue, because the synagogue is affiliated with the Conservative movement. Pittsburgh has now become yet another case of the so-called &quot;chief rabbis&quot; declaring to Reform and Conservative Jews that their Judaism is not Judaism and their rabbis are not rabbis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The relationship between Israel and American Jews is symbiotic, mutually supportive, and reciprocal.&nbsp;And shame on anyone who attempts to impair the vital link between the Jewish people’s two greatest communities.</p> \n<p>The Prime Minister said the right things here. And Naftali Bennett, the Diaspora affairs minister, proclaimed before boarding a plane to Pittsburgh that, &quot;as far as I’m concerned, every Jew is a Jew.&quot; Now, on the one hand, that is very nice. But on the other, why in heaven’s name should such a statement even be necessary?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If the Israeli government were to extend official recognition to Reform and Conservative Judaism, then what the “chief rabbis” say would be of no interest to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they have a personal opinion, so be it.&nbsp;I would be secure in knowing that the Jewish state – my homeland, too – recognizes my Judaism, and that would be enough.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But the Jewish state does not recognize my Judaism. And the result is that it has, unnecessarily, inflicted grievous wounds on many, many Jews whose love of Zion is deep and true.&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Michael Oren,&nbsp;writing in the New York Times, said that the time has come for Israel to extend such recognition. He is right, and the government of Israel should listen.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This week of Pittsburgh has been a disastrous week for American Jews. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Our president has once again disappointed us, fearing difference, shunning half of his own country, and refusing to make space in America for those who sing a different song.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Politicians of the right are once again all singing from the same songbook, unwilling to challenge the president on fundamental values.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And the gun industry continues to market its deadly products, this time to fanatic haters of Jews, producing bloodshed wherever it goes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But there is also hope.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Our Christian and Muslim neighbors console us, some of them promising to fight the good fight, to rebuild together our neighborhoods and our nation, and to revive the American spirit.</p> \n<p>And the State of Israel has comforted us, feeling our pain and terror. It has tightly embraced us. Yet it has yet to embrace us wholeheartedly, with an embrace that says we are one people. We await this fateful step.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And we American Jews, with the support of our people and our neighbors, intend to take on the Jew-haters, to go on the moral offensive, and to counter the bumper-sticker slogans and cheap platitudes of our political season. We are intent on striving for pluralism and mutual respect, even while the purveyors of hate dominate our talk shows and manipulate the media.</p> \n<p>We are determined to remember Pittsburgh - but not just as a slogan; to remember its dead - but not as passive, unrequited victims. We're determined to remember Pittsburgh as a battle for justice and coexistence - and a battle that we fought and won.</p> \n<p>Eric H.

        "text":["<p>The Ten Tribes living in the Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century B.C.E. practiced a mixed religion, but contrary to the conventional wisdom among biblical scholars, their main deity was Yahweh after all, not the Canaanite god El and his envoys, golden calves and goat-shaped demons.</p> \n<p>New excavations headed by Dr. David Ilan and Dr. Yifat Thareani of the Nelson Glueck School of Biblical Archaeology at the Hebrew Union College in Jerusalem discovered that Dan also housed Arameans and Phoenicians as well as Israelites. But the gigantic sanctuary, originally found over four decades ago, has the hallmarks of Yahwistic practice, not pagan ritual.</p> \n<p>&quot;Dan was ruled by Aram Damascus circa 830-770 B.C.E. We know this from both the Bible and from the Tel Dan inscription,&quot; says Ilan. &quot;The Aramaeans practiced their cult at Dan too. The question is whether Israelite worship was carried out concurrently during this time. We still aren’t sure but this is one of our research questions.&quot;</p> \n<p>Mainly based on the biblical narrative, scholars had thought that Yahweh became the main god in Israel only after that kingdom's obliteration by the Assyrians in 720 B.C.E. But new analysis of epigraphic, archaeological and textual evidence in Tel Dan, a key center of worship in the northern kingdom, strongly indicates that the people were worshipping Yahweh in an organized manner as early as the 9th century B.C.E.</p> \n<p>At the time, some 2,700 years ago, the land was split between the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south, which were rivals, occasionally bitter ones. Israel's capital was Samaria but its religious centers were Bethel and Dan, while Judah's capital and religious center was Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>While the priests in Israel and Judah may have devoted themselves to the &quot;one god,&quot; evidence of the people's unrepentent polytheism is rife.</p> \n<p>&quot;So he put out of business the foreign-god priests, whom the kings of Judah had appointed to make sacrificial smoke on the high places in the cities of Judah and the surroundings of Jerusalem, as well as those making sacrificial smoke to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations of the zodiac, and to all the army of the heavens&quot; - 2 Kings 23:5</p> \n<p>However, according to the biblical story, in the north, rivalry between the two kingdoms led to a sharp deviation from the path toward monotheism.</p> \n<p>Competing with Jerusalem</p> \n<p>It seems that Jeroboam, the first king of Israel from around 922 B.C.E. to 901 B.C.E. (the dates are arguable) had a beef with Rehoboam, son of Solomon and king of Judah.</p> \n<p>The priests and Levites sided with Rehoboam; fearful that his people would too, Jeroboam deliberately drove them to idol worship in the Kingdom of Israel's main cities, Bethel and Dan.</p> \n<p>On Jeroboam's predilection for paganism (&quot;the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods&quot; – Chronicles 13.8), the Bible says:</p> \n<p>&quot;The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the Lord when he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made.&quot; 2 Chronicles 14-15</p> \n<p>On why Jeroboam would push idolatry, the Bible says:</p> \n<p>&quot;If this people continues to go up to offer sacrifices at the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem, the heart of this people will also return to their lord, King Rehoboam of Judah… the king made two golden calves&nbsp;and said to the people: It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here is your God, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.&quot; – Kings 12</p> \n<p>God's severe view of Jeroboam's faithlessness is described in the Book of Kings 13:1-5 which evocatively describes his punishment: a withered hand.</p> \n<p>Mainly based on all this, some modern scholars have been assuming that a key distinction between Israel and Judah lay in fundamental beliefs: that the priests and people of the north, Israel, worshipped El and pagan idols while the Judahite kingdom was faithful to Yahweh.</p> \n<p>It's starting to look like the biblical account was heavily biased.</p> \n<p>First of all, Chronicles apparently dates to the 4th – 2th century B.C.E., so it was written hundreds of years after the events described. Also, it would have been written by scribes in Jerusalem, the capital of Judah. The ethics of writing history accurately did not exist then, and they may have had an interest in trashing their long-dead brethren of Israel. True, the writer acknowledges</p> \n<p>Now the new analysis of the evidence excavated under the late Avraham Biran at Tel Dan indicates that in fact, both kingdoms worshipped Yahweh, as well as pagan idols.</p> \n<p>Immadiyaw was here</p> \n<p>It is the preponderance of evidence that suggests Yahwistic worship in Dan, the archaeologists explain.</p> \n<p>Suggestive finds include seal impressions with Yahwistic names, temple architecture, and artifacts typical of Yahwistic temple rituals. They also found massive evidence of animal sacrifice at the Tel Dan temple, of species associated with Yahwistic worship at the First Temple in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;“The significance of what we have in the Tel Dan temple is probably greater than most people realize,” says Jonathan Greer, associate professor of Old Testament at Grand Rapids Theological Seminary and Tel Dan staff member who has recently reevaluated some of the evidence.</p> \n<p>The first clue to the northern kingdom's bent lies in the inhabitant’s very names.</p> \n<p>Yahwistic names were spelled differently by geography, due to differences in the dialects of north and south. In the south, the Yahwistic element was spelled “yahu” (yod-heh-vav), whereas in the north, it was spelled “yaw” (yod-vav) due to the contraction of the diphthong—both are shortened forms of YHWH.</p> \n<p>Seal impression with names that include the element yaw [yod-vav – a shortened form of YHWH] invoking the name of their protective deity abound at Dan. For example, stamped seals dating to the 9th and 8th century BCE, carrying the names Immidayaw and Zechariyaw have been found.</p> \n<p>If the primary tutelary deity they were worshipping was El, the personal name would have included the element El, and been Immanue-el and not Immida-yaw (meaning &quot;YHWH is with me&quot;).</p> \n<p>Of the two seal impressions with the name Immadiyaw, one was on the handle of a jar in a structure about 15 meters north of the altar room. Immadiyaw may have been an officiating functionary at the sanctuary, the archaeologists suggest.</p> \n<p>The spelling Immadiyaw is typical of the north; this same name spelled the southern way (Immadiyahu) was found on an ostracon from Horvat Uza in the Negev, Greer says, adding that it was almost certainly a completely different man.</p> \n<p>Immadiyaw parallels a similar name with an El theophoric, Immanu-el (Emmanuel), “God is with us,” Greer also adds.</p> \n<p>Another jar found in the royal storerooms was stamped with the name Zechariyaw (meaning &quot;Yahweh remembers&quot;). Some wonder if this might be King Zechariah of 2 Kings 14:29.</p> \n<p>The third potential Yahwistic name was on a sherd, in an 8th century B.C.E. context, with an inscription that read “[belonging to] Amoz...” but the sherd breaks right after the z. The name could have been “Amaziah,” another Yahwistic name (Amoz is short for Amaziah, just as Ben is short for Benjamin).</p> \n<p>Rival temple in Dan</p> \n<p>The city of Dan goes back at least 6,000 years. In the biblical period, Dan apparently posed competition to Jerusalem as a center for worship.</p> \n<p>The main discoveries at Tel Dan, also known as Tel Qadi, date back to 1966, when Biran found the sanctuary ruins. His excavations unearthed a large platform, small altars that were flat-topped and four-horned, seven-spouted oil lamps, perforated incense cups, and cult stands.</p> \n<p>Until the recent discoveries, the thinking had been that the sanctuary in Dan was used by idol-worshippers, because the Danites under Jeroboam were supposed to be pagan. But for one thing, the architecture of the sacred precinct is in keeping with biblical descriptions of Solomon’s Temple, including the proportions of the precinct and construction techniques.</p> \n<p>The archaeologists found a massive altar base, a huge 4.75 meters square, with one of the altar's four horns. They estimate that the altar itself stood 3 meters high (the altar in Solomon's Temple is said to have been 4.5 meters high).</p> \n<p>In view of the altar's height, some means of approach was essential. In fact Biran found two intact staircases, one facing the right-hand side of the precinct and the other the entrance (though the dating is still under investigation).</p> \n<p>The position of the staircases or ramps corresponds with the Bible's directives to priests when making burnt offerings at the altar. After slaughtering the animal, they would approach the altar from the right to arrange and burn the carcass (Leviticus 1:5,11; 4:4; 15:24). Then they would descend toward the entrance to deposit the ashes (Leviticus 1:16; 6:3).</p> \n<p>If anything, it seems that the position of approaches in the Jerusalem temple deviated from the biblical dictate. The approach to the Jerusalem altar was from the left, as some scholars reconstruct from later examples.</p> \n<p>Possibly the tradition of approaching the altar from the right was actually a northern Yahwistic tradition that ended up in the Bible, though most people assume the Temple traditions were created by southern Yahwists, centered in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>The altar kit</p> \n<p>Another discovery that shrieks of Yahwistic worship in Dan, as described in the Bible, was the discovery of an &quot;altar kit&quot; in one of the rooms.</p> \n<p>Excavators under Biran uncovered a bronze bowl, a pair of identical shovels, a long-handled shovel like those that held incense, a sunken pot filled with burned animal remains, and a long iron handle that may have come from a fork.</p> \n<p>&quot;What is remarkable is that these five elements—a bowl, pair of shovels, incense pan, ash pot, and fork—are listed, often as a group, in descriptions of sacrificial paraphernalia in the Bible such as in Exodus 27:3. We just don't get this sort of thing in archaeology too often (if ever!), where we read a list of items in the Bible that should be in an 'altar kit,' then dig them up right next to each other beside an altar like this,&quot; says Greer.</p> \n<p>&quot;Build an altar of acacia wood...Make a horn at each of the four corners, so that the horns and the altar are of one piece, and overlay the altar with bronze. Make all its utensils of bronze—its pots to remove the ashes, and its shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans&quot; - Exodus 27:1-3</p> \n<p>“Archaeological finds in the northern biblical city of Dan look like they came straight out the Bible's ritual checklist”, says Ilan.</p> \n<p>If the archaeologists are right about what it is, the bowl is extraordinary - the only example ever found of a “blood bowl” (mizraq) in excavation.</p> \n<p>By extension the bowl is potentially the earliest evidence for specialized rituals involving blood in Yahwistic worship. The sanctity of the blood was heavily emphasized in ancient Israel, and animal sacrifices, particularly those offered on the Day of Atonement, were typically in atonement for sin. The priests would pour the blood of sacrificed animals at the base of the altar and dab it on the altar horns (Leviticus 9:9). The high priest in Israel would also take a token portion of the blood into the Most Holy of the earthly sanctuary (Leviticus 16:14).</p> \n<p>Tell-tale toe bones and turtledoves</p> \n<p>Another discovery was thousands upon thousands of animal bones, found in the temple precinct. Many were in concentrated deposits, allowing the archaeologists to compare the area of deposits as well as the type of animal remains.</p> \n<p>They found a striking difference between the bone deposits in the western chamber, where the altar kit was found, and the room where the priests officiated.</p> \n<p>“My analysis of a series of concentrated animal bone deposits revealed several patterns of non-random distribution,&quot; explains Greer. . &quot;The strongest was that, looking at the bones from meat-bearing portions of hindlimbs and forelimbs from sheep and goats, I noticed that there were far more right-sided portions in the western chambers, an area associated with priests.</p> \n<p>&quot;This called to mind the biblical prescriptions for priests to receive right-sided portions as their priestly due from certain sacrifices such as in Leviticus 7:32-33.&quot;</p> \n<p>Israelites' offerings to Yahweh included bulls, rams, male goats, turtledoves, and young pigeons (Leviticus 1:3,5,10,14), The offerer laid his hand on the animal's head (Leviticus 1:4). The animal was then slaughtered and the blood, representing life, was sprinkled upon the burnt offering altar (Leviticus 1:5.11). The carcass would then be skinned and cut up into its parts, its intestines and shanks would be washed, and the head and other body parts were all placed on the altar (the officiating priests received portions).</p> \n<p>Furthermore, 88% of the toe bones (three small bones that extend into the hoof sheep or goats) that the archaeologists found were in the western chamber, which could be because of the payment of skins from the burnt offering to the officiating priests. Hooves would have been left attached to the hides.</p> \n<p>Pagan at heart</p> \n<p>Evidence of &quot;non-orthodox&quot; religious perspectives can be found all over ancient Israel and Judah, especially pertaining to the incorporation of the veneration of Asherah (or “the asherah”), a Canaanite goddess of fertility.</p> \n<p>The bible is scathing. 2 Kings 23:5, 8 mentions &quot;high places in the cities of Judah and the surroundings of Jerusalem ... from Geba [northern border] as far as Beer-sheba [southern border].&quot;</p> \n<p>At these high places, the Israelites made &quot;sacrificial smoke to Baal, to the sun and to the moon and to the constellations of the zodiac and to all the army of the heavens.&quot; They had houses for &quot;male temple prostitutes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the house of Yahweh&quot; and offered their children &quot;through the fire to Molech.&quot;—2 Kings 23:4-10</p> \n<p>But at Dan, these high places were likely dedicated to Yahweh.</p> \n<p>Archaeologists have found hundreds of figurines in Jerusalem and Judah, mainly in the ruins of private homes. Most were depictions of a nude female with exaggerated breasts. Scholars identify these figurines with the fertility goddesses Ashtoreth and Asherah, talismans to help conception and childbirth. In Tel Dan, a so-called &quot;Judahite Pillar Figurine&quot; was found next to the main platform.</p> \n<p>One can sympathize with the angry desperation of the embattled prophets, who clearly felt their &quot;orthodox&quot; position was a minority opinion.</p> \n<p>But cumulative evidence indicates that whether or not Jeroboam discouraged Yahweh worship while deifying golden bovines and demon goats, in Dan, at least some people also worshipped Yahweh.</p> \n<p>The seal impressions with Yahwistic names, the architecture, the artifacts, and the bones argue the case. Add the biblical descriptions of Tel Dan as an important pilgrimage site rivaling Jerusalem, and the prophets, regarding whom Yahwistic worship is assumed.</p> \n<p>&quot;It may suggest a more robust and comprehensive Yahwism in the northern kingdom, 'from Dan to Bethel,' if not in the whole of ancient Israel, 'from Dan to Beersheva'. We are used to thinking of the kingdoms as completely separate and writing the north off as a kingdom of idol worshipers due to a cursory read of the biblical accounts,&quot; Greer says.</p> \n<p>&quot;It is a shame that most tourist groups head to the sacred precinct at Dan to illustrate the idolatry of Jeroboam’s golden calf rather than as our best parallel to the First Temple, with evidence from animal bones, architecture, epigraphy, and artifacts to boot,&quot; he adds.</p> \n<p>In fact, the finds at Dan correlate so strongly to biblical texts, even more so – possibly – than the finds in Jerusalem, that a thought is begged, Greer says. Perhaps it was the Israelites of Dan in the north, not the Judahites in Jerusalem, who were the source of some Judaic traditions.</p>",

        "text":["<p>At the start of the week, Israeli political reporters were treated to a lengthy and interesting briefing by that magical entity that seems to be part prime minister and part “senior political source.” Fascinating things were said at the meeting. They were also quite different from the official talking points of the Prime Minister’s Office. The implication was clear: Benjamin Netanyahu will do his utmost to avoid another war in the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>The prime minister knows he is paying a certain political price for holding off on sending the army into the Strip on an extensive ground operation. But he has correctly identified the humanitarian problem as the most burning issue in the Strip, and is cognizant that the way to solve the critical shortage of functioning infrastructure in Gaza and to try to ease the severe economic crisis there is not by sending in tanks and troops.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is also aware that even if Israel were to ultimately retake the Strip, there is no one to give the keys to. The Palestinian Authority is not up to the task, Egypt isn’t interested and no local alternative to Hamas rule has yet arisen in the coastal enclave. Israel would very likely get stuck managing the day-to-day lives of 2 million hostile Gazans, all in the shadow of the guerilla warfare that Hamas would still wage. Even if the Hamas leadership is defeated and imprisoned, a terror infrastructure would still remain in Gaza that could wear down the army and inflict casualties for months, if not years, to come.</p> \n<p>That is why Netanyahu has repeatedly been willing to give an arrangement with Hamas another chance. While Israel officially has nothing to do with these contacts, it closely monitors every development in the talks with Hamas being conducted by Egyptian intelligence and United Nations Middle East Envoy Nickolay Mladenov. In practice, all of the parties involved know that Israel not only supports the Qatari-funded shipments of diesel fuel, which have already increased the number of hours a day that Gazans have electricity available, it would also happily support the arrangement reportedly taking shape whereby Qatar would pay for government workers’ salaries in Gaza. These are two critical demands for Hamas, and Israel’s new flexibility here marks an important turning point. The urgent summoning of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to Cairo Wednesday also indicates that the Egyptians are kicking things up a notch, though the hopes for an accord have been dashed many times in the past.</p> \n<p>Contrary to its rhetoric, Israel’s right-wing government is prepared to live for a long time with continued Hamas rule in Gaza. As Yaniv Kubovich reported in Haaretz this week, the government is not aiming to topple Hamas. Another consideration may be in play here. Netanyahu is pleased with the breakthrough he achieved last week with his visit to Oman. Those in his close circle believe more such opportunities in the Gulf states will come up soon. But it will be much harder to visit those places if Al Jazeera is airing nonstop images of Palestinian children killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza.</p> \n<p>The defense establishment now admits that notable progress was made in the talks last week. The ploy by Islamic Jihad, which altered its response policy and launched dozens of rockets in response to the deaths of five protesters by Israeli gunfire last Friday, definitely stirred things up. Israeli intelligence says Islamic Jihad challenged Hamas by outflanking it on the right and reimposing a hard line. Israel was compelled to respond to the rocket fire with a series of airstrikes, and the contacts were halted. The talks have since resumed but another obstacle awaits, as it does every week, with the Friday demonstrations at the border fence, where there is always a fear of casualties. Egypt took the unusual step this week of sending a delegation of intelligence officials to try to ensure that the Palestinians use restraint in the protests.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Israel vs. Gaza: The pendulum swings back toward renewed conflict&nbsp; ■&nbsp;Gaza fuse is getting shorter as Netanyahu risks losing control of the conflict&nbsp;■&nbsp;Pushing for war on Hamas, Israeli defense chief fails to rally security cabinet</p> \n<p>There is another interesting change in the cabinet’s thinking on Gaza. As is known, disagreement has arisen between Netanyahu and the top brass on one hand, and Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who has called for “pummeling” Hamas, on the other hand. Education Minister Naftali Bennett has also been talking about the need for harsher measures in the Strip. But perhaps because of the public’s aversion to possible military losses, both supporters of a more extensive operation and those who call it a last resort have made a point of stating that they are talking about an operation waged from a distance, without a real ground incursion.</p> \n<p>For years, there has been disagreement within the Israel Defense Forces over the efficacy of airstrikes and precise intelligence alone in halting rockets and mortar shells, the main weapons Hamas would employ (assuming that at least half of its attack tunnels have been discovered and destroyed). Previous Israeli attempts in the north, in 1993, 1996 and 2006, and the three operations in the Gaza Strip between 2008 and 2014, failed to prove that it can be done. Nonetheless, at least as far as public statements go, a new and unusual consensus is taking shape on this.</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON – A senior official in Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign asked an Israeli private intelligence firm to plan a “social media manipulation” effort against political rivals, including the usage of fake profiles and the spreading of false information. The contacts between Rick Gates, Trump’s deputy campaign manager in 2016, and Israeli company Psy-Group, were first reported on Tuesday by the New York Times. The services were likely not used for Trump's campaign eventually, the report says.</p> \n<p>According to the report, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating foreign interference in the 2016 election, is closely examining these contacts. His office, the report said, has interviewed workers from Psy-Group and collected documents from the company’s headquarters in Israel.</p> \n<p>Mueller is specifically interested in an alleged $2 million payment that the company’s founder reportedly received shortly after the 2016 election from George Nader, a senior adviser to the government of the United Arab Emirates.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The countless Israeli connections to Mueller’s probe of Trump and Russia | Analysis ■&nbsp;Who is Joel Zamel, the Australian-Israeli linked to Mueller’s Trump Probe?</p> \n<p>While the report states that it’s unclear if anything came out of Psy-Group’s offers to the Trump campaign, it indicates an opening of senior officials in Trump’s campaign to discussing the same kind of social media manipulation that was eventually carried out by Russia during the election.</p> \n<p>The report said that in March 2016, Gates heard about Psy-Group, a private intelligence firm that employed former Israeli intelligence officers, from a Republican consultant named George Birnbaum.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;There is no evidence that the Trump campaign acted on the proposals, and Mr. Gates ultimately was uninterested in Psy-Group’s work,&quot; the Times reported, citing a person with knowledge of Gates' communication with the Israeli firm.&nbsp;&quot;Psy-Group’s owner, Joel Zamel, did meet in August 2016 with Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Trump’s eldest son,&quot; the Times noted.</p> \n<p>The meeting took place at Trump Tower, and one other person who participated in it was Nader, the senior adviser to the UAE government.</p> \n<p>In the 1990s, Birnbaum helped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s successful campaign to become prime minister. He has remained close to political figures in Israel over the years. When he met Gates at the height of Trump’s battle to become the Republican nominee in the presidential race, Birnbaum recommended Psy-Group to Gates, who was interested in technological ways to hurt Trump’s rivals within the Republican Party.</p> \n<p>Birnbaum, the report says, put the two sides in touch. According to documents obtained by the paper (and according to the report, also by Mueller’s team of investigators), Psy-Group offered a social media manipulation campaign that would target Texas Senator Ted Cruz, at the time Trump’s main competitor for the Republican nomination. The proposed manipulation campaign was supposed to include fake social media profiles that would attack Cruz and discredit him in the eyes of Republican Party delegates, who eventually decide on the party’s presidential nominee.</p> \n<p>According to the report, Psy-Group also offered to provide the Trump campaign with “unique intel” that would come from “covert sources.” The Trump campaign eventually didn’t accept this proposal, it said.</p> \n<p>The Israeli company also offered the Trump campaign another project, aimed at using similar tactics against Hillary Clinton, who back in the spring of 2016 was emerging as the likely Democratic nominee whom Trump would face in the general elections. This proposal also included an unclear reference to “complementary intelligence activities” that would target Clinton.</p> \n<p>This firm also offered the Trump campaign services such as creating fake social media campaigns that would target Clinton, and specifically use “rifts and rivalries within the opposition.” This proposal wasn’t accepted. During the general election, it should be noted, fake social media accounts operated by Russia promoted left-wing messaging against Clinton, in an attempt to persuade left-leaning voters to either not vote, or cast their ballot for the Green Party.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The number of votes that the Green Party received in 2016 in the three states that decided the result of the election - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan - was larger than the gap between Trump and Clinton in those specific states.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to the report, a short time after the 2016 election, Nader paid Zamel $2 million. It is not clear what was the reason for that payment. A lawyer for Zamel told the NYT that his client “never pitched, or otherwise discussed, any of Psy-Group’s proposals relating to the U.S. elections with anyone related to the Trump campaign, including not with Donald Trump Jr., except for outlining the capabilities of some of his companies in general terms.”</p> \n<p>Gates, for his part, was indicted last year on multiple charges of financial fraud and tax evasion. He pleaded guilty to some of the charges, cooperated with Mueller’s investigation, and testified against Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, during his recent trial in Virginia, which ended in a guilty verdict last month.&nbsp;</p>",

Human rights are still a problem, the Kingdom remains closed, women are far from being equal, tribalism remains deeply rooted and corruption and nepotism is rife.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The response of MBS to the lack of investor enthusiasm to his plan and the resultant cash-flow problem was to round up Saudi businessmen and hold them captive at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton hotel, as part of a so-called anti-corruption probe. Confessions were signed after&nbsp;torture and under duress while&nbsp;billions&nbsp;of siphoned dollars were handed over to the Saudi authorities.</p> \n<p>In reality, this was a modern-day a&nbsp;political purge and money grab.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But it didn’t encourage foreign investors. In August 2018, ARAMCO’s estimated $2 trillion floatation for a 5% per cent stake in the company - which was essential to funding the crown prince’s grand vision - was abruptly&nbsp;called off.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;The Saudi Purge: The Real Reason Behind Mohammed Bin Salman's Unprecedented Crackdown</p> \n<p>Some of the other MBS disasters include doubling down in the Yemen civil war - which seems to have no end in sight, kidnapping and forcing Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri to resign only for Hariri to rescind his resignation upon his return to Lebanon, a failed boycott of Qatar which has utterly failed to convince Doha to align its foreign policy with the Gulf Cooperation Council, and an inability to prevent Iranian dominance in Syria with the looming victory of Bashar Assad.</p> \n<p>Despite harsh clampdowns on civil society and on domestic opponents of Turkey’s authoritarian President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey is – surprisingly - a relatively open place for those involved in Middle Eastern politics to work. That’s true for a heterogenous spectrum of activists: Iranian dissidents, Syrian exiles and Hamas members.</p> \n<p>It seems that the thought of an increasingly critical Khashoggi, who split his time between the U.S. and UK, also partly basing himself in Turkey, a country which has been on the opposite end of MBS’s policies - it supported Qatar during last year’s crisis and seems to have come to an understanding with Iran over Syria - was simply too much for MBS to bear.</p> \n<p>Tensions are already simmering between Turkey and Saudi over Ankara’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (against the Saudi-backed President Sisi) and in general competes with Saudi Arabia for influence, status and leadership in the Sunni Muslim world.</p> \n<p>Although still waiting for the results of the investigation to unfold, President Erdogan has already indicated that he is&nbsp;taking a personal interest in this case.</p> \n<p>If investigators conclude that Khashoggi was murdered on Turkish soil, Erdogan will take it as personal affront. The firebrand Turkish president is not known to take kindly to insults (and never misses an opportunity for point-scoring either) and will no doubt go on the offensive against Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, it is highly unlikely that Turkey will receive any meaningful support, especially from the West.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Western powers seldom vocalize official opposition to Saudi policies. There was an important exception last summer when&nbsp;Canada issued a condemnation in Arabic of the Kingdom’s abysmal human rights record and its poor treatment of dissidents.</p> \n<p>The response was swift and severe. Canada’s ambassador was given 24 hours to pack his bags. Riyadh future declared trade deals and bilateral investments cancelled.</p> \n<p>Ottawa received little international backing. Its powerful neighbor to the south washed its hands of the matter. U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said it was up to the Saudi and Canadian governments&nbsp;to resolve their differences. Similar sentiments were echoed across Europe.</p> \n<p>MBS can rest comfortably knowing that President Donald Trump seems to like Saudi Arabia, and European nations need Saudi oil to continue to flow at a reasonable price. Meanwhile, U.S., British and French&nbsp;arms deals&nbsp;with Saudi are worth billions of dollars. Germany’s and Italy’s are worth hundreds of millions. With billions at stake the Western nations might do is voice a silent displeasure, a whisper in a thunderstorm.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Instead, get ready to witness the spectacle of Turkey, whose security services - since the failed 2016 coup - have abducted as many as 100 members of the Gulen movement overseas and implemented a purge that has netted hundreds of thousands of critics and jailed over 100 journalists, condemn Saudi Arabia for its overseas misdeeds and treatment of dissidents.</p> \n<p>That’s right, two of&nbsp;the world's biggest suppressors of the freedom of expression are about to go at it over each country’s violation of fundamental freedoms. To make matters worse, President Erdogan and Crown Prince Mohammed probably won’t even get the irony.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Dr Simon&nbsp;A.

        "text":["<p>Benny Gantz is the wild card in the next election campaign. The former army chief of staff is maintaining his characteristic ambiguity but the poll numbers encourage him to run, foretelling an impressive vault to the center of power as the head of his own party. If these forecasts are borne out, by joining the race Gantz will guarantee Benjamin Netanyahu’s reelection to a fifth term as prime minister. And if he wins enough Knesset seats, Gantz will return to his old workplace, military headquarters: this time as defense minister, handily leapfrogging over his rivals for the post, cabinet ministers Nafali Bennett, Yoav Galant and Avigdor Lieberman.</p> \n<p>Gantz is seen by politicians and the general public as a man of the center-left, whether due to his looks or perhaps senior officers’ inclination toward the old Laborite combination, a la Yitzhak Rabin, of being hawkish on defense but moderate on the peace process. It doesn’t matter: A party headed by Gantz would be the Netanyahu-led right’s most valuable asset, because it would smash the “left-wing bloc” into a salad of mediocre parties, none of which would threaten Likud’s dominance.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;To beat Netanyahu in the next elections, his rivals should party like it's 1999 | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu would only have to choose his new coalition partners. Gantz has already made it clear that he’s in, declaring a few months ago: “Likud is a Zionist party, and from my standpoint, anything that is Zionist is legitimate.” It wouldn’t be a rerun of Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the chief of staff who, two decades ago, stepped down and announced he was going into politics to save the country from Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>Gantz’s critics mock him as “gray” and “boring.” There’s no doubt that throughout his career Gantz avoided saying anything controversial or engaging in any disputes under the media’s gaze. But in the next election, this will be his most important asset. Gantz sounds like a “Good Old Land of Israel&quot; song by Arik Einstein.</p> \n<p>He will present a platform that embraces Zionism, security, unity, with photographs showing him looking at sheaves of wheat at harvest time. His rivals are tainted by hatred and slander — Yair Lapid vs. the Haredim and the left, Avi Gabbay vs. Netanyahu, Moshe Kahlon vs. Gabbay, and Netanyahu vs. everyone. Gantz has no enemies — nor, as far as anyone knows, any friends to whom he owes favors. This will be his story: the soldier who re-enlists for the sake of the country, this time in the political trenches.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu certainly understands the new candidate’s potential. First of all, a Gantz party would free Likud from Bennett’s embrace and give Netanyahu a more moderate and comfortable coalition partner. The former military chief would lend the government an aura of dignity, with his impressive military record, valuable boosts to its image ahead of the decision on whether or not to indict the prime minister.</p> \n<p>Gantz won’t need any training before going back into the war room to approve sorties and operations. He is also very familiar with the U.S. defense establishment, from his time as military attach&eacute; in Washington. The most he may need to do is learn a little Russian, in light of the changes in the region since he left military headquarters.</p> \n<p>Under these circumstances, Netanyahu will avoid attacking Gantz. The prime minister is maintaining strict campaign discipline, avoiding mudslinging fests with future coalition partners. He wants them to do well at the polling booths, even to take a few Knesset seats from Likud, so long as they recommend him for the job when the president consults them after the election. That’s how Netanyahu treated Lieberman in 2009, Lapid in 2013 and Kahlon in 2015. In denying leaks intimating that he offered Gantz the post of foreign minister in the current government, Netanyahu sent a clear signal of his willingness to cooperate with his former army chief of staff.</p> \n<p>The decision now lies with Gantz. The question is how he will handle the dilemmas that always arise in politics, and whether he can stand up for himself against Netanyahu and present independent positions, as he did when he successfully came out against bombing Iran.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When I was in sixth grade, my father received a gift from his work, a book entitled “It was Top Secret: 30 Intelligence and Security Affairs in Israel,” by military historian Yosef Argaman. It wasn’t a Classical work of literature, to put it mildly, but it did make a strong impression on me. I bet I've read that book something like 20 times.</p> \n<p>I was a skinny weakling, a noodle of a kid, destined to be an army office clerk in the future. The words “top secret” already told me I would never be a part of that closed world, reserved for the strong and the suitable. I was fated to look on from the outside at Israel's superheroes – the idols of youths who admired generals, spies, undercover agents posing as Arabs, members of reconnaissance units and all manner of assassins. And if I didn’t feel like assassinating anyone? Never mind, it will come.</p> \n<p>The book jacket was replete with shades of greenish fog-of-war, and bound as if it were a for-your-eyes-only military document. Brave soldiers peered out from the fog. The cover hinted that the content was volatile: The abduction of Syrian generals! The assassination of Colonel Hafez! The extrication of Khomeini from Tehran! An SS man – an IDF officer! The head of the Mossad going to Munich! Almost 500 pages of affairs, some of which were “published for the first time&quot;! How could one resist? After all we were excellent students of the military indoctrination disseminated by the state school system. We were raised on stories of heroism and daring. We were commanded to enlist and continue the path of early Zionist war hero Joseph Trumpeldor and legendary Israeli army commander Meir Har-Zion.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;What Netflix's thriller 'The Angel' gets wrong about the Mossad and its top spy&nbsp;■&nbsp;'7 Days in Entebbe' fails to grab critics in Berlin&nbsp;■&nbsp;How 'Fauda' has romanticized the most repugnant aspects of Israel's occupation</p> \n<p>Even when it was our turn to enter the Israel Defense Forces meat grinder, we thirstily imbibed every shred of information and historical anecdote, and the more “top secret,” the more we would puff out our chests while little erections sprouted and grew. I read the above book and felt that at last it was as if I were one of them. After all, we had the same goals – saving Israel from our enemies, no less and no more.</p> \n<p>I imagined myself disguised as a blond woman, which Ehud Barak had done. Together with Amiram Levine and Yoni Netanyahu and the soldiers of the elite Matkal and Shayetet 13 units, we faced-off against Fatah leaders in Beirut during the 1973 &quot;Spring of Youth&quot; operation. Ehud led; Amiram covered him. Muki Betzer took out the Black September operations officer. I tossed two grenades. The force encountered resistance. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak set off explosive charges. The building collapsed. We came home safely. Thanks to our calm and cool actions, we received the Medal of Valor. And the blood on our hands? You get rid of it with liquid soap.</p> \n<p>I’m not in sixth grade anymore and old army stories just don’t do it for me. The years have gone by and I understand, or should understand, that the stories they told you did not exactly represent reality – what’s worse, they distorted them, presenting one side only: the winning side. It’s obvious that tales of victory are much more interesting than tales of defeat. I came, I saw, I conquered. What else is there? Where is the moral conflict? Where are the weak points? Will we make do with hollow propaganda? Imagine Woody Allen wearing white overalls, with a Beretta tucked into his pants, standing on the wing of the Sabena plane? I prefer his nasal delivery, neurotic and insecure. If you put a Beretta in his hand, he would drop it on the floor. Woody Allen can’t be an undaunted hero out of the best sellers by Mishka Ben-David – and that’s a good thing.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'Yoni Netanyahu’s mistake nearly led to disaster': U.K. historian sets the record straight on Operation Entebbe&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;■&nbsp;New film on Operation Entebbe 'likely to anger Prime Minister Netanyahu'</p> \n<p>But just as Israel has helped to inculcate the term &quot;muscular Judaism,&quot; it has invented the fable of the Long Arm of the IDF and the wondrous tales starring our excellent boys from the Mossad and the Shin Bet security service. The weak little Jew-boy had died of his feelings of inferiority. The embers saved from the fire had morphed into men’s men, in every sense. There was a time when the Jewish mother dreamed that her son would be a doctor or a lawyer. Today the espionage agencies and commando units are the fantasies. If you haven’t tied up a Palestinian in a banana hold, painted yourself in camouflage colors and crossed enemy lines, or planted a listening device in the cellphone of a Revolutionary Guards officer – you’re just not part of the celebration of manhood and power. You will make do with a marginal role, looking on from the sidelines as an obsessive fan. Most of us are doomed from childhood to be cheerleaders of the Zionist myth and ethos.</p> \n<p>But now we’ve managed to turn the whole world into a cheerleader that jumps and waves her pompoms in the name of the dramatic potential embedded in a few of the affairs from our magnificent and cruel past. Over the years the word “Mossad” has been whispered in action movies and dramas as a code name for the ultimate Israel, embodying a model that was a mixture of admiration and caricature. We provided in supporting roles inarticulate tough guys who spoke with heavy accents, in the likes of “Don’t Mess with the Zohan” (about a Mossad agent who becomes a hairdresser), and in pretty ludicrous Golan-Globus movies and Spielberg’s “Munich.”</p> \n<p>No longer! Our long arm has reached Hollywood and Netflix now. We're deep into 2018 and it’s as if American cinema and television have become part of the Israeli Intelligence Heritage Center. Bibi can be as proud as all get-out: The new big thing is to be a Mossad agent or an Israeli military man. Spiderman – out; Rafi Eitan – in. In recent months we’ve seen films about Operation Entebbe (“Seven Days in Entebbe”); Eichmann’s capture (“Operation Finale”); and “The Angel,” the new Netflix movie about the double agent Ashram Marwan.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'Fauda': Just entertainment or art reflecting the damage of the occupation?</p> \n<p>A television version of John Le Carre’s “Little Drummer Girl” is in the works, about the Mossad hunt for PLO terrorists in Europe. HBO is developing a series with Israel's Keshet network, based on journalist Ronen Bergman’s book “Rise and Kill First,” dealing with Israel’s history of assassinations. And of course, there’s the less important, global history that's been made by the two seasons of “Fauda”: The TV series has turned Israeli undercover agents disguised as Arabs into agonized yet determined superheroes, and the thwarting of terror attacks into a contemporary local response to the Russia-United States power struggles that existed during the Cold War. Once it was actor Dolph Lundgren in the role of the Soviet boxer Ivan Drago in “Rocky 4.” Now it’s the commander of the &quot;Fauda&quot; crew, Doron Kabilio, facing off against the Palestinian terrorist Al-Makdasi.</p> \n<p>And going back to Netflix, they’re working on a series dealing with the capture of the Israeli spy Eli Cohen, to be played by Sacha Baron Cohen. Apropos Cohen, this year he portrayed in the series &quot;Who is America?&quot; the character of Col. Erran Morad, a former Mossad agent and an anti-terror expert. Morad is a silly inarticulate, comical figure, and maybe because he’s so inarticulate, he is quite believable. Certainly more believable than some of the mustachioed Mossad characters with their 1970s' outfits who appear in the above-mentioned flicks and shows. Cohen's Morad exposes and mocks Israeli militarism and machismo, Republican conservatism and hypocrisy, and the American passion for strongmen. In one of his programs in the series, he meets senators and National Rifle Association officials and makes a film clip with them, whose purpose is to encourage 3-year-olds to use guns. You fall down laughing and then you recall Israeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan’s gun reform scheme, and you understand that the distance between us and the Americans is not that great. Erran Morad could easily be appointed defense secretary in President Donald Trump’s administration or defense minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet. Bibi, as we will recall, declared a few months ago that Mossad agents had recovered the Eli Cohen’s lost watch from “an enemy country.” What will they do with this watch? Maybe they’ll use it as a prop in a Netflix series.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Trying to woo Israelis away from Netflix, book sellers use steep discounts</p> \n<p>This is the way our lives serve as props for movies and series that glorify Israel’s intelligence and espionage history. To the outsider, it’s easy to forget that these are horrific stories. Onlookers are swept off their feet by the action and the drama. As in the “Real Crime” series, a terrifying and murderous reality has been turned into a sweeping action story that's largely stripped the heroes of their humanity and obviated the pain of the victims.</p> \n<p>Thus makers of the various Mossad movies prefer to ignore social context. The film and television industry wants new heroes. It isn’t able to invent the new James Bond, so it uses existing narratives, worked over and distilled to suit a simplistic worldview that has sex appeal and cinematic rhythm. But the agents who carried out the abductions and assassinations are not just evidence of resourcefulness and courage, but also of political feebleness. Today it’s hard to remember, but like their victims, the PLO terrorists also had families and loves and plans for the future. For every fearless Mossadnik there are cowardly, blind and recalcitrant leaders who prefer the way of force and violence.</p> \n<p>What about a film on peace talks and a historic conciliation? That wouldn’t be exciting enough for Netflix.</p>",

        "text":["<p>PRISTINA, Kosovo – It’s one thing to lose a husband and a father. But it’s another to lose him to the long arm of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his hunt for so-called “G&uuml;lenists” around the globe.</p> \n<p>On March 29, Yasemin Karabina’s husband, Yusuf, was one of six Kosovo-based Turkish nationals snatched by the Kosovar intelligence agency, in a covert early-morning operation.</p> \n<p>The men – all of whom worked at schools linked to the G&uuml;len movement – were extradited and flown back in a private jet to Turkey, being tortured en route according to a lawyer affiliated with the men’s families.</p> \n<p>Erdogan blames U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah G&uuml;len and his followers for a failed military coup attempt in July 2016.</p> \n<p>The men – Cihan Ozkan, Hasan Huseyin Gunakan, Kahraman Demirez, Mustafa Erdem, Osman Karakaya and Yusuf Karabina&nbsp;– were accused of belonging to what Turkey derogatorily refers to as the Fethullah Terrorist Organization (FET&Ouml;), helping G&uuml;lenists flee Turkey for Europe and the United States. Photos of the six were widely distributed in Turkish media, which described them as members of FET&Ouml;.</p> \n<p>Nearly six months on from what some local media dubbed a “kidnapping,” the charges relating to alleged terror activities still make no sense to the men’s families or their colleagues in Kosovo, where soul-searching about the country’s relations with Turkey continue.</p> \n<p>“Kosovo has forgiven Turkish interference too easily,” was the headline of a recent Op-Ed by Kosovar journalist Nektar Zogjani. But not everyone has.</p> \n<p>“Our friends are blamed as part of the coup attempt,” says Nazmi Ulus, the director of Mehmet Akif College, a G&uuml;len-affiliated school in Lipjan, near Prishtina. “How is this possible?” he asks. “It sounds ridiculous.”</p> \n<p>Over 100 abductions</p> \n<p>It doesn’t seem ridiculous to Erdogan, reelected in June as president for another five-year term. Recent months have seen similar abductions of G&uuml;lenists in Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Gabon, while an attempted abduction by Turkish security services was foiled at the very last moment in Mongolia.</p> \n<p>Last month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl&uuml;t Cavusoglu boasted that at least 100 alleged members of the G&uuml;len movement have been abducted by Turkish intelligence agents abroad and taken to Turkey in the past two years.</p> \n<p>Karabina, Feyza G&uuml;nakan and Olcay Demirez all had their husbands snatched away that Thursday morning in March, and are now seemingly powerless to do anything. Their stories are reminders that Erdogan’s global hunt for G&uuml;lenists comes at a human cost.</p> \n<p>At the school in Lipjan where her husband Yusuf was deputy director, Yasemin Karabina recounts the events of that morning. Driving with Yusuf and the couple’s 15-year-old son, their car was stopped by what looked like police forces. They asked Yusuf for documents.</p> \n<p>Yasemin Karabina says that after a few minutes, she and her husband grew suspicious; they knew about abductions of so-called G&uuml;lenists in other parts of the world. Not seeing any evidence that the men were actual police officers, Karabina says, they started the car again and prepared to drive away.</p> \n<p>That was when the men pounced, says Yasemin Karabina. Video from a nearby surveillance camera shows them being dragged from the car – including their teenage son, who Yasemin says was hurt in the encounter. The footage shows her panicking and trying to flag down passing cars, to no avail.</p> \n<p>Yasemin Karabina recalls yelling “They’re not cops!” to other drivers. But her husband was gone. “The last contact I had with him was in the car,” she says.</p> \n<p>Children without fathers</p> \n<p>Karabina’s son wasn’t the only child left without a father. Olcay Demirez has a 3-year-old son with her husband Kahraman; both taught at a G&uuml;len-affiliated school in Gjakova, a city in western Kosovo.</p> \n<p>According to Olcay Demirez, her husband went to school before 8 A.M. to help prepare students for a field trip. The students were hanging around the schoolyard, waiting for buses to arrive, she says.</p> \n<p>A while later, she continues, three police cars came to the school. Her husband walked over to meet them, shaking hands with the officers. “He had a good relationship with the police,” Olcay Demirez says.</p> \n<p>The police told him there was some issue with his identity papers and, according to Demirez’s wife, said they needed to take him to the police station. “They gave a signal to handcuff him, in front of the students,” she says, teary-eyed, “and forced him into a car.”</p> \n<p>She hasn’t seen her husband since that morning. “As a mother, as a woman, I’m deeply offended by this situation,” she says tersely.</p> \n<p>The four children of Feyza G&uuml;nakan, who has lived in Kosovo with her husband Hasan H&uuml;seyin G&uuml;nakan for 13 years, are also without a father. Their youngest is 4 years old.</p> \n<p>At home when the kidnappings took place, Feyza G&uuml;nakan was called from the school with the grim news. But that was only the first shock. Following reports in the Turkish and Albanian media, she soon learned that her husband had been kidnapped by mistake: A man with a similar name was apparently the real target. Yet her husband still languishes in Turkey, awaiting trial.</p> \n<p>Although some commentators are suggesting that such brazen Turkish actions won’t happen in Kosovo – or in other countries in the region – again, the “fear of Erdogan” has been struck into Turkish nationals living in Kosovo.</p> \n<p>According to recent media reports, several dozen Turkish nationals in Kosovo have already applied for asylum in the country. Meanwhile, the family of one of the men, Mustafa Erdem – principal of the Mehmet Akif College in Lipjan – reportedly fled Kosovo several months ago and applied for asylum in Germany. Earlier this month, officials in Prizren, southwestern Kosovo, even demanded the closure of a “G&uuml;len-linked” kindergarten.</p> \n<p>“We still worry about what can happen,” says G&uuml;nakan. “We have doubts here.”</p> \n<p>Kosovar Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj has tried to assuage those fears. According to Yasemin Karabina, Haradinaj told her that “nothing like this will ever happen again.”</p> \n<p>After the kidnappings, Haradinaj claimed he hadn’t been informed about the operation. The following day, he dismissed his interior minister and intelligence chief – and later fired a shot at Erdogan, saying the six Turkish nationals “were not deported, they were stolen.” But Kosovo’s president, Hashim Thaci, initially appeared to justify the abductions, telling local media two days after the incident that the men were involved in “illegal actions” and posed a threat to the country’s “national security.” (He later walked back those comments.)</p> \n<p>Anger at home and concern abroad still simmered following Haradinaj’s actions. G&uuml;len, for his part, referred to the events as a “hijacking” in a video he released on the incident.</p> \n<p>Whatever they are called, the families remain deeply frustrated that the kidnappings were able to happen. “We cannot understand,” says Yasemin Karabina. “It’s a pity that Kosovar politicians have connections with that guy in Turkey.”</p> \n<p>“That guy in Turkey” certainly wasn’t pleased with Haradinaj’s comments. Erdogan, who enjoys good relations with Thaci, sounded off in a tone usually reserved for a scolding parent.</p> \n<p>“My question to Kosovo’s prime minister is: Under whose instructions did you undertake such actions?” Erdogan said a day after the firings. “How can you [defend] these people who attempted a coup against Kosovo’s brother country, Turkey? You will answer for this.”</p> \n<p>Economic clout</p> \n<p>Whatever Kosovo and its leader think of Erdogan’s style of rule, Turkey may not be a friend the Balkan state can afford to lose. Alongside being a strong advocate for its international recognition and eventual accession to the European Union and NATO, Turkey also has considerable economic clout there. (It was also the one of the first countries to recognize Kosovo after it unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia in February 2008.)</p> \n<p>According to Esin Muzbeg, general-secretary of the Kosovo-Turkey Chamber of Commerce, Turkey is set to be Kosovo’s third-largest source of foreign direct investment as a share of GDP for 2018.</p> \n<p>Turkish firms run Kosovo’s sole international airport and the country’s electric grid, and are building billions of dollars-worth of new highways. State agencies such as Turkey’s official development assistance organization have also been very active in restoring Kosovo’s Ottoman-era heritage. Meanwhile, a large, new, Turkish-funded mosque is planned for downtown Pristina in an ostentatiously Ottoman style.</p> \n<p>But Erdogan has also tried to exert pressure in other ways. A few years ago, Kosovo’s government revised its history textbooks under Turkish pressure to paint Ottoman rule more positively. And in 2016, while the attempted military coup was in progress, Kosovar journalist and editor of Gazeta Express, Berat Buzhala, wrote a satirical post on social media calling on Kosovars vacationing in Turkey to back the coup. As a result, Buzhala told Haaretz, Turkey’s ambassador in Kosovo called for his arrest.</p> \n<p>And critics don’t have to be public figures to feel the heat. In February, the Pristina premises of a self-described “tiny socialist commune” were searched by Kosovar police after they announced a Kurdish music night in solidarity with the defenders of Afrin – the Kurdish-held town in northern Syria that was under attack from the Turkish army at the time.</p> \n<p>But there are many Kosovars who see Turkey in a much more positive light. Abdulhadi Krasnic, for instance, is eager to promote the many shared cultural ties between Kosovars and Turks: Nearly 20,000 Kosovar citizens are ethnic Turks and Krasnic is mayor of Mamusa, the country’s only Turkish-majority municipality.</p> \n<p>“Whoever is in power over there, a strong Turkey can only help Kosovo,” Krasnic says.</p> \n<p>Krasnic supported the arrests of the six men – they were Turkish citizens linked to an organization that tried to overthrow the elected Turkish government, he says – but does not think the abductions and deportations were carried out legally.</p> \n<p>Despite the pledges of support from Haradinaj and others, the wives and families of the deported six men still fear for their futures.

The panel declined to comment on Monday's award.</p> \n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly called climate change a hoax, and last year announced that he would withdraw the United States from a global pact to combat it reached in 2015 - calling the deal's demands for emissions cuts too costly.</p> \n<p>Nordhaus, a Professor of Economics at Yale University, was the first person to create a quantitative model that described the interplay between the economy and the climate, the Swedish academy said.</p> \n<p>&quot;The key insight of my work was to put a price on carbon in order to hold back climate change,&quot; Nordhaus was quoted as saying in a Yale publication this year. &quot;The main recipe ...is to make sure governments, corporations and households face a high price on their carbon emissions.&quot;</p> \n<p>BIG GLOBAL QUESTIONS</p> \n<p>Nobel&nbsp;committee chair Per Stromberg told Reuters Monday's award was honouring research into &quot;two big global questions&quot;: how to deal with the negative effects of growth on the climate and &quot;to make sure that this economic growth leaves prosperity for everyone.&quot;</p> \n<p>Romer had shown how economic forces govern the willingness of firms to innovate, helping some societies grow many times faster than others. By understanding which market conditions favour the creation of profitable technologies, society can tailor policies to promote growth, the academy said.</p> \n<p>Romer's career has taken him outside the academic world. While on leave from the Stern School, he served as chief economist and senior vice president at the World Bank until early this year.</p> \n<p>His work on endogenous growth theory is not universally admired.</p> \n<p>Fellow&nbsp;Nobel&nbsp;economics Laureate Paul Krugman told the New York Times in 2013 that too much of it involved &quot;making assumptions about how unmeasurable things affected other unmeasurable things&quot;.</p> \n<p>Monday's award of the last of the 2018&nbsp;Nobels took place less than a month after the 10th anniversary of the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers.</p> \n<p>That triggered an economic crisis from which the world's financial system is arguably still recovering.</p> \n<p>Interest rates remain at or close to record lows in many major economies, including Sweden, where they have languished below zero since early 2015.</p> \n<p>Worth 9 million Swedish crowns ($1 million), the economics prize was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of five awards set out in Swedish industrialist AlfredNobel's 1895 will.</p> \n<p>The physiology/medicine, physics, chemistry and peace prizes were awarded last week.</p> \n<p>This year's proceedings have been overshadowed by the absence of the literature prize, postponed to give the Swedish Academy time to restore public trust after a sexual assault scandal.</p>",

There are hundreds of asylum seekers in Israel from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was known as Zaire under a military dictatorship in 1971-1997.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, Interior Minister Arye Dery made the policy change after the Foreign Ministry determined that there was nothing preventing sending back migrants to the DRC. Officials at the Population and Immigration Ministry said that individuals from the DRC in Israel should make preparations to leave the country within 90 days, meaning no later than January 5, 2019.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;As a result, the population authority is not granting Congolese nationals residency permits extending beyond that date and has made it clear that it will take steps to deport those remaining in Israel beyond that.</p> \n<p>For its part, the Population Authority said in response: &quot;First of all, the announcement was posted on the Population Authority website in the languages relevant to the target population and as far as we know is seen by thousands of users and is certainly not 'confidential.' It is an official channel of communications and is therefore used to release announcements to the public. We wish to make clear that asylum requests from Congolese are examined on an individual basis, as are all asylum requests and this has no connection with the lifting of group protection. Beyond that, the decision [to lift the group protection] is based on a professional opinion carried out by the Foreign Ministry and any claim to the contrary is baseless.&quot;</p> \n<p>Until now, asylum seekers from four countries – Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – had been given temporary protection against deportation. The protection was conferred upon the Congolese nearly two decades ago due to fighting in their country. Elections are due to be held in two months in the DRC, which could result in civil war at a time when violent clashes and even war crimes are being committed there and where there have been repeated outbreaks of the Ebola virus.</p> \n<p>The DRC has for decades been suffering from conflict between rebel groups, which massacres killing over 200 civilians this year in and around the city of Beni, where health workers' efforts to combat a deadly Ebola outbreak are based. According to authorities, there have been 130 confirmed Ebola cases, including 74 deaths, since the outbreak was declared on August 1.</p> \n<p>Insecurity is a major challenge to health workers. Several armed groups roam the heavily populated region near Uganda, carrying out attacks and causing an estimated one million people to be displaced in North Kivu province alone.</p> \n<p>The World Health Organization, which last week announced that the risk of Ebola’s spread over Congo’s border was “very high” after cases were confirmed near Uganda, now says the outbreak is at a “critical point.” The WHO director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has expressed concern about the virus’ spread into inaccessible “red zones” where armed groups have control.</p> \n<p>Human Rights Watch on Thursday said more than 235 people have been killed in the Beni area this year in attacks with guns, axes or machetes. More than 165 others have been kidnapped. In the past four years more than 1,000 people have died. The country's next general elections are scheduled to be held on December 23, over two years after they were supposed to occur.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Current reports from the United Kingdom's immigration authorities state that opponents of the Congolese regime are in real danger of persecution by government authorities. The reports noted the systematic use of rape as a military tactic in areas of conflict and the risk of forced enlistment of women and girls. Last week, Dr. Denis Mukwege, a Congolese gynecologist who has treated tens of thousands of women who were victims of sexual violence during the Second Congo War, which broke out in 1998, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work. Mukwege is a harsh critic of the current regime.</p> \n<p>Joseph Kabila, who has been president of the DRC since 2001, during the Second Congo War, is not running in December's upcoming election, but the opposition in the country is concerned that the candidate running from his party will do his bidding and that in practice, Kabila's regime will remain in power.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Hotline for Refugees and Migrants said it deems the Population Authority's decision to lift the collective protection provided to Congolese in Israel as &quot;another failure,&quot; and claimed that the agency has been dragging out the process of considering the asylum requests of 208 Congolese nationals &quot;and now it is demanding that they return to a dangerous country where the situation has still not stabilized.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.&nbsp;</p>",

Haley will leave by the end of the year and her successor will be named within two or three weeks, Trump told reporters.</p> \n<p>The president added that&nbsp;he hopes Haley will return to the administration at some later point, and that he told her she could choose what position to be appointed to.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 13 times Nikki Haley stood up for Israel at the UN (and AIPAC)</p> \n<p>Haley thanked Trump and said it was “the honor of a lifetime” to serve as his UN ambassador.&nbsp;She denied rumors that she was planning to run against Trump in the Republican primary in 2020. “I’m not running,” she said.</p> \n<p>Trump said that Haley had told him about six months earlier that she intended to leave after serving in the role for two years.&nbsp;He called her a “great person” and someone who is “very special to me” and said his administration&nbsp;“hates to lose” Haley.</p> \n<p>Addressing U.S. goals she tried to advance at the UN, the envoy said during her joint announcement with Trump that one of the things she was glad were achieved during her tenure is that the U.S. proved it could &quot;put our embassy where we want.&quot;</p> \n<p>Moments after reports regarding Haley's alleged resignation surfaced, Trump took to Twitter to say that he will make a big announcement with his &quot;friend&quot; Haley.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Haley has emerged over the past year as one of the most popular officials in the Trump administration, particulary among supporters of Israel. She has repeatedly defended Israel’s government from criticism, and criticized the Palestinians many times. Haley spoke twice over the past 18 months at the annual AIPAC conference, where she received strong applause from the crowd.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Haley's defense of Israel and criticism of the UN and Palestinian was reflected in Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon's response to her resignation. &quot;Thank you, Nikki Haley!&quot; Danon wrote on Twitter. &quot;Thank you for standing up for the truth without fear, thank you for representing the values common to Israel and the United States. Thank you for the support you gave Israel, which led to a change in Israel's status at the UN. Thank you for your close friendship. You will always be a true friend to the State of Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>Education Minister Naftali Bennett also took the opportunity to praise Haley, writing on Twitter: &quot;Dear Amb @NikkiHaley, on behalf of the Israeli people: Thank you for what you've done for Israel. We will not forget.&quot;</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also chimed in.&nbsp;&quot;I would like to thank Ambassador Nikki Haley, who led the uncompromising struggle against hypocrisy at the UN, and on behalf of the truth and justice of our country,&quot; he said on Twitter.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Why AIPAC just loves Nikki Haley | Opinion</p> \n<p>Haley did come under some criticism early in her tenure, however, for blocking former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad from being appointed to the position of the UN’s special envoy for Libya. Fayad is considered a moderate leader with close ties to former Israeli and American officials, and Haley’s actions against him were seen as too harsh by some mainstream supporters of Israel in the United States.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>In 1947, when the War of Independence was raging in Jerusalem, a single shell struck a house on Nablus Road, north of the Old City. It smashed the entrance door and when the owner of the home, the photographer and Swedish consul in Jerusalem, Lars (Lewis) Larsson, came home, he found that his greatest treasure had been looted — his private photo collection.</p> \n<p>Other photo collections also later mysteriously disappeared from Jerusalem — the large collection of brothers Najib and Gamil Albina and that of photographer Lars Lind, who like Larsson were members of Jerusalem’s American Colony.</p> \n<p>These losses, along with political and personal conflicts, led to the disappearance of much of the most important photographic archive in the history of Jerusalem and the whole country: the collection of the American Colony Photo-Dept.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since 1966, some of the archive has been discovered and published in Israel, the United States, Sweden and other countries, but the location of many of the photographs is still unknown.</p> \n<p>For the past 12 years, Rachel Lev, curator of the American Colony archive collections, has been trying to piece together the fate of the photographs and make order in this unique and valuable cultural asset.</p> \n<p>Recently, she found another important part of the puzzle: Although Larsson left the colony’s photography department in 1930 and lost most of his collection when his home was broken into in the late 1940s, she managed to reassemble an important part of his collection, only to discover that it wasn’t created only by Larsson.</p> \n<p>Over the years, the colony’s photographers sent their pictures to a London press agent named Harold Shepstone. In the 1950s, after the collection was lost, Larsson asked his son, Theo, to turn to Shepstone in an attempt to reconstruct some of the lost photographs.</p> \n<p>Theo spent several days in Shepstone’s attic in London, and returned to his father with 600 photographs, some created by the American Colony Photo-Dept. photographers and some to the Matson Photo Service that belonged to Eric Matson, who gained control of the department once it was disbanded. Larsson went through the photos and wrote on their backs the details he knew about their origin.</p> \n<p>Jerusalem syndrome</p> \n<p>The American Colony is known as a prestigious boutique hotel in East Jerusalem, a meeting place for journalists, diplomats and politicians from Israel, Palestine and abroad. The historic structure belonged to a group of Protestant utopian Christians from the United States who settled in the Old City in the 19th century.</p> \n<p>The turning point for the group came when 120 new members, most of them Swedes, joined them in 1898. That’s when the large building now the American Colony Hotel&nbsp;&nbsp;— located in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood —&nbsp;was rented and the members of the group took up photography.</p> \n<p>The colony’s photography department was first associated with two carpenters. The first, Ferdinand Ludwig Vester, was a master carpenter who had a shop on Jaffa Road, one of the first places where the photos were sold at the end of the 19th century. The second, Elijah Meyers, was a Jewish convert to Christianity from Bombay, who was struck with Jerusalem Syndrome. “He would wear a huge turban&nbsp;and a silk cloak, and he believed he was the reincarnation of Elijah,” Lev says.</p> \n<p>As the group grew, they sought new businesses. Vester, whose son joined the group, suggested they open a photography business. Meyers, who was also a talented self-taught photographer, began to teach photography to the colony’s young men. In less than two years, the young photographers got the chance to prove themselves during German Kaiser Wilhelm II’s historic visit to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>The photos of the imperial visit became famous worldwide, as did the new American Colony Photo-Dept. In the years that followed, American Colony photographers became the most methodical and expert in their profession anywhere in the Middle East. The approximately 15 photographers took journalistic and documentary shots as well as artistic, scientific and tourist photos. In the archive are pictures of daily life in the colony alongside events from World War I. For example, in 1917, Larsson accompanied Jerusalem’s Mayor Hussein al Husseini on his famous search for a British officer to whom he could surrender the city.</p> \n<p>The colony’s photographers also documented the bloodshed between the city’s Jews and Arabs as well as the leaders of the Zionist movement alongside the mufti, Emir Abdallah of Transjordan and the heads of the British administration. The collection also contains careful scientific documentation of the country’s flora and fauna, which are used to this day for research abroad. The best-known of these is a hand-colored close-up of the life cycle of the locusts that attacked the country in 1915.</p> \n<p>The colony’s photographers also highlighted the people of the country, sometimes in staged scenes meant to evoke the biblical and Orientalist tropes popular at the time. They perfected the technique of expert hand-coloring that created spectacular color pictures combining photo and painting.</p> \n<p>Purchasing American Colony photos was part of every tourist and pilgrim’s visit to the country in the early 20th century. The colony’s documents show that they sold some 20,000 photos during the tourist season. According to Lev, “this is what sustained them until they started an automobile import business in 1920.”</p> \n<p>Unfortunately for curators and researchers, most of the photographs were signed by the collective “American Colony Photo Department,” making it virtually impossible now to reconstruct which of the photographers took which shots or series of shots.</p> \n<p>The photo department remained in operation until 1930, when some of the members left, including department head Larsson, who purchased a house not far from the American Colony and continued his photography career while serving as the Swedish consul.</p> \n<p>The credit battles</p> \n<p>No one knows how many photos made up the original collection. Lev points out a 1905 letter from Larsson in which he wrote that during a two-month visit to Egypt he photographed more than 800 glass negatives. It may be assumed that the original collection, created by 15 photographers over more than 34 years, was much larger than what we know of today.</p> \n<p>The best-known collection is the Eric and Edith Matson collection in the U.S. Library of Congress, which has been digitalized and is available for free use on the Library of Congress website. The Matsons were among the colony’s photographers.</p> \n<p>In 1930, a few years after the death of the unopposed leader of the colony, Anna Spafford, the group splintered. Many of the photographers left, including Larsson. The Matsons remained in the colony and continued photographing until 1934, when they also left. In the property division agreement between the Matsons and the Colony, they received the photo archive, including the glass negatives. The rare photo-album collection remained with the Colony and is publicly available for view in the American Colony Archive, in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>After Eric Matson received the collection, he began publishing many of the photos, sometimes with a stamp indicating he was the photographer. In 1939, after protest by his former partners in the Colony, he was asked not to use the trademark name of the American Colony Photo Department and he changed the name of the studio to the Matson Photo Service.</p> \n<p>In 1946, the year before Larsson’s house was bombarded and looted, the Matsons left the country for the United States. They took thousands of nitrate negatives (a kind of celluloid) with them and they hid the heavy glass negatives in the basement of the YMCA building in Jerusalem. In 1966, Matson donated the collection to the Library of Congress and in 1973, representatives of the Library of Congress came to Jerusalem to take possession of the glass negatives. Unfortunately, many had been damaged when the basement was flooded a few years before.</p> \n<p>The collection was catalogued in the Library of Congress, and was listed under its donors’ name, as is customary. Thus, when the collection was delivered, it appeared as if Matson was responsible for the photography department’s body of work, including the footage from the German Kaiser’s visit, which was taken when he was eight. In interviews given while delivering the collection, Matson said that with the deteriorating state in Jerusalem, many negatives in the collection were lost.</p> \n<p>In the late 1990s, Swedish journalist Mia Grondahl asked the Library of Congress to change the photos’ catalogue and give colony photographers, chief among them Larsson, their due credit. Her petitions were ignored at first. It was only after Grondahl came to Washington and registered as a reader that she was able to locate the manager of the photography collections department, who agreed to discuss the matter with her. Twelve years ago, she published a book which included the photographs she had collected from the Larssons and other sources.</p> \n<p>The library’s database now makes the distinction between the work of the American Colony photography department and the work of the Matson Photo Service which inherited it. In addition to the negatives, the collection includes around 1,000 prints. “It’s clear the collection under Matson’s name does not reflect the body of work of a collective that operated for 34 years, and that it was created by 15 photographers,” Lev says.</p> \n<p>Parts of the collection are scattered around the world, and copies of the same photographs are kept in more than one collection. The Whiting Collection, donated to the Library of Congress a decade ago, includes 28 photo albums, most of which were taken by American Colony photographers.</p> \n<p>The national library in Jerusalem holds 20 albums. Research institute Yad Ben Zvi has is a collection of 2,000 glass slides, while the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam keeps 1,200 hand-painted glass slides. The ethnographic museum in Stockholm holds an important collection of 264 hand-painted photographs purchased in 1916. The Windsor Palace collection has the photo album of Jerusalem’s surrender to Allenby, and private collectors worldwide own albums, photographs, slides or additional negatives which originate from the collection of the photography department.</p> \n<p>Lev believes that additional footage from the American Colony collections will be uncovered in the future, and that each photograph encodes layers of complex historical information and real-time analysis. The German Kaiser’s visit, which marked the beginning of the photography department’s work, led to the creation of another project: the construction of the church-hospital complex Augusta Victoria, inspired by the design of German palaces, on Mount Scopus. In 1914 shortly after the building works were completed, Larsson set out to photograph the immense structure. The magnificent, hand-painted photograph is kept in Sweden.</p> \n<p>“He photographed Augusta Victoria from the northwest, surrounded by the natural scenery of the Jerusalem Mountains and the eastern side of the Jordan River,” says Lev. “The building, blending with its surroundings, looks like a pearl on the Mount Scopus ridge. On the front plane of the photo, Larsson includes a big fruit orchard with a figure of a fellah standing and gazing at the monumental structure. Suddenly I realized the comparison he was making between the natural scenery and the citadel was a critical observation.” Still, she says, lacking a complete image of the collection, “it is difficult to understand the depth of its meaning. It contains encrypted stories which cannot be deciphered without a broad perspective, it’s like seeing a piece of a puzzle whose boundaries you can’t grasp.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>It may just be the result of a scheduling necessity that German Chancellor Angela Merkel began her visit to Israel, including bilateral cabinet consultations, on October 3 - but it certainly is a remarkable historical coincidence.</p> \n<p>Ever since 1990, as the Berlin Wall fell, that date has been known as the &quot;Day of German Unity,&quot; and has become synonymous with a country finally regaining its unity in a freedom it had not enjoyed for more than a half-century. Since reunification, extensive festivities are held every year on this day, celebrating Germans peacefully overcoming their country’s dark past and opening the way for a brighter future together.</p> \n<p>It would seem only fitting that also on this day, Chancellor Merkel would leave for what is essentially another display of unity, this time with the Jewish state. What better symbol could there be for a Germany that has left behind all its authoritarian and anti-Semitic tendencies?</p> \n<p>What might at first appear like a steady march towards enlightenment has however taken a worrying turn over recent years. On this October 3, I am sad to say that Germany’s much-praised Einheit [unity] has never been in shorter supply.</p> \n<p>While difficulties have made themselves felt long before, the violent demonstrations in the southeastern city of Chemnitz this summer have shone a painfully bright light on the extensive societal divisions Germany faces today while also showcasing how disruptive a reinvigorated radical right can be, if it so chooses.</p> \n<p>And even though some reports may have gone somewhat overboard in their coverage of the events, it seems safe to say that at least for a time, Chemnitz was in effect under mob rule. A small group of far-right protesters even attacked the city’s only Jewish restaurant, injuring its owner and chanting &quot;Jewish pigs, get out of Germany.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some commentators have elected to chalk all of this up to the vivid history of neo-Nazism in the former East and particularly the state of Saxony, which Chemnitz is in. While this interpretation is certainly not wrong, it conveniently, and in my opinion wrongly, absolves the old &quot;West&quot; of any wrongdoing.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;My Grandfather Was Executed as a WWII War Criminal. I Know Why Germany Still Has a Nazi Problem&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>The sad truth is that today, the far-right Alternative for Germany party – whose members and functionaries marched alongside known neo-Nazis in Chemnitz – can count on considerable electoral support all throughout the country. It easily entered the Bundestag last year and is settling in second spot in the national polls today; and this month it is poised to enter the last two state parliaments in which it has no current representation, including in my native Bavaria.</p> \n<p>The polarization wrought by this openly radical-right party continues to poison our public discourse and pit the citizens of our country against each other. This rift is unlike any other the Federal Republic has ever seen, in that it goes deeper and is much more fundamental.</p> \n<p>In the past, Social and Christian Democrats always bickered about policy, but they were united in the liberal, pro-Western, democratic consensus of post-war German democracy. Between these traditional parties on the one side and the AfD on the other, however, there is virtually no common ground.</p> \n<p>What can there even be to talk about when one side seeks to maintain the liberal status quo and the other is dominated by vile, conspiracy theory-peddling kooks who detest liberalism and praise countries like Hungary and Russia as role models for a nationalistic, ethnically pure and more-than-slightly authoritarian Europe?</p> \n<p>One should note that not every problem the AfD addresses is necessarily made-up. For instance, there is no denying that Germany’s efforts at integrating its sizable Muslim population has not been a success story, starting long before 2015. The notorious anti-Semitism rampant within many Muslim communities today is part of that problem.</p> \n<p>The AfD’s ethno-nationalist &quot;solutions&quot; are surely the last thing that will alleviate the situation, but they hold an appeal for those who panic about an impending &quot;Islamization.&quot; This sadly even includes some Jews who have joined the Alternative’s ranks and are, this Sunday, intending to create a &quot;Jews in the AfD&quot; platform.</p> \n<p>The AfD’s Jews (and pseudo-Jews)’ PR coup notwithstanding, the vast majority of Germany’s Jewish population, myself included, can only rub their eyes in wonder at those Jewish individuals who would look the other way when AfD officials march alongside neo-Nazis; who stay silent when the party chairman describes the Nazi era as a &quot;speck of bird shit in German history&quot;; or who will bend themselves into pretzels trying to explain how every single one of Germany’s problems allegedly boils down to Muslim immigration.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;When the Fear of Muslims Leads Jews to Whitewash the Far Right&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>It does not seem to matter that the AfD’s idea of Germany would not allow for much of a Jewish presence, either. The Bavarian AfD already calls for a ban on circumcision and ritual slaughter. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>I have lived in Germany all my life, and I would not wish to live anywhere else. Germany is still a strong, wealthy, and politically stable country – something we should keep in mind at the time of such a resonant national holiday as this.</p> \n<p>However, as a German and as a Jew, it pains me to see how far the divisions have progressed in our society. Once more, I am witnessing the rise of a party on the far right, and I see anti-Semitism on the rise again, not least because of it.</p> \n<p>Germany is a long way from &quot;unity in freedom&quot; today.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Born in Munich in 1932, Charlotte Knobloch survived the Holocaust by hiding on a farm in northern Bavaria.

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and two key ministers have decided that the state will no longer grant so-called humanitarian status to asylum seekers from Sudan’s Darfur region, sources told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Instead, the state is examining whether the situation in Sudan has improved to the extent that deportation is possible.</p> \n<p>Over the past year and a half, Israel has granted humanitarian status to 800 asylum seekers from Sudan, a status equivalent to refugee status. It lets asylum seekers work and receive benefits such as health insurance; they are also allowed to exit and re-enter the country.</p> \n<p>Over the past two weeks two meetings have been held to discuss the Darfuris; Netanyahu and the other two ministers responsible for the latest decision – Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked and Interior Minister Arye Dery – were on hand. Also present were the attorney general, the head of the National Security Council and the director of the Population and Immigration Authority.</p> \n<p>The meetings were held ahead of a High Court hearing due Monday on petitions requesting the granting of humanitarian status. There are currently around 3,500 Darfuris in Israel; some 2,300 have requested asylum, but all but one have waited for years without receiving a response.</p> \n<p>The state has told the High Court of Justice that it has not responded because of a staffing shortage and problems finding a person to head a committee dealing with refugees.</p> \n<p>Over the past year and a half the state has said that it has not yet taken a formal stance on the matter. Attorneys Carmel Pomerantz and Michal Pomerantz have demanded that the state be ordered to respond to all asylum requests by Darfuris.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, a petition by attorney Tomer Warsha requests that all Darfuris in Israel receive temporary-residency status, at least until their cases are reviewed. Last December the state requested an extension so that it could craft a policy on the issue.</p> \n<p>It now says that each case will be examined individually, along with requests by asylum seekers from the Nuba and Blue Nile regions. Since each case is now under individual review, the state argues that the awarding of humanitarian status is no longer applicable. It says the situation in Sudan will be re-evaluated based on a British Home Office report.</p> \n<p>Last week, The UN News reported that though security had improved in Darfur, intercommunal tensions were still high amid clashes over land and livestock. The website cited the head of the joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission.</p> \n<p>In Israel, a High Court hearing was held last December; the justices said the state was foot-dragging in developing a policy on the Darfuris. The court’s president, Esther Hayut, demanded a timetable but received none. The state’s representative, attorney Hadas Eran, has apparently stalled, saying the issue is under investigation.</p> \n<p>Hayut said this has been going on for two years and asked Eran for a detailed timetable. As long as there was no policy, the state would have to consider the asylum requests, Hayut said.</p> \n<p>“Why aren’t you formulating a policy, even though that’s your excuse for not discussing the asylum requests?” she asked.</p> \n<p>Eran replied that hundreds of Darfuris had been awarded temporary status, thus some action had been taken.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the past week, America and the world have witnessed the metastasization of Trumpism.</p> \n<p>The process has been on-going since even before the U.S. president was elected, but it accelerated once he assumed office. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>We saw it in the first attempts to bar refugees from the United States on the basis of their religion. We saw it when white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia. We saw it when the people of Puerto Rico were denied the full support of their federal government in the wake of a devastating hurricane - and the president’s history of anti-Latin racism was clearly a contributing factor.</p> \n<p>We have seen it in the president’s active support of ethno-nationalist leaders and regimes from Israel to Eastern Europe. We have seen it with the Republican Party’s active embrace of voter suppression targeting black and Latino voters. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>But this week, days before a potentially pivotal American mid-term election, we have seen an acceleration not only of the president’s hate-and-fear-mongering, but of its devastating consequences in American society. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>We have seen a bomb plot without precedent in U.S. history in terms of it scope - targeting two former presidents, a former vice president, a former secretary of state, a former director of national intelligence, a former CIA director, a former attorney general, senators, congresspeople, a prominent philanthropist, an activist movie star and CNN. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>We have seen a double homicide in Kentucky in which the shooter had sought to enter a predominantly black church moments before, presumably with mayhem in mind. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>And we saw the bloodiest act of anti-Semitism in American history, one that claimed 11 lives at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p> \n<p>While none of these acts came at the direct instigation of the president or the leadership of the GOP, it is undeniable that they were manifestations of a changed climate in America of which the current U.S. president is the most prominent author. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Indeed, in the same week they took place, the president and those closest to him in his party, held rallies at which the fury of crowds was deliberately stoked with chants targeting two of the targets of the bombing, Clinton and CNN. The president’s own rhetoric targeted others, like Representative Maxine Waters and George Soros.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Soros, CNN, Obama and the Clintons: Trump's Incitement Turns Into Real Threats</p> \n<p>The mention of Soros is, of course, part of an anti-Semitic trope that is heard across Europe, these days, with Soros standing in for past Jewish bogeymen like the Rothschilds in the eyes of conspiracy theorists. So too, are attacks on &quot;globalists,&quot; one of which came from Trump just moments after the pipe bombing case was wrapped up. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>The week also saw the president returning to his anti-Latino fear-mongering with him ginning up reports of a &quot;caravan of migrants&quot; &quot;threatening&quot; the U.S. southern border.</p> \n<p>Trump defenders, hearing the attacks on the president for creating the mood that led to these attacks, responded lamely with defenses that ranged from false-equivalencies (&quot;Sure, the bomber was a rabid Trump supporter who drove a van plastered with Trump photos and slogans, but Democrats were uncivil too…for example, when they treated Republican officials rudely in restaurants&quot;) to the most flaccid and hackneyed of responses regarding the president stoking anti-Semitism (&quot;His daughter and son-in-law are Jewish and he moved the embassy to Jerusalem&quot; - as weak rejoinders go, just a stone’s throw from &quot;Some of my best friends are Jewish.&quot;)</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;The Trump Civility Debate Isn't New. In the 1930s, America Debated Whether It Was Civil to Shun the Nazis</p> \n<p>There is no denying that Trump has sought to inflame divisions in America as no president before him.</p> \n<p>He is the president who said that there were &quot;very fine people&quot; among the neo-Nazis who chanted &quot;Jews will not replace us&quot; in Charlottesville (and reportedly declared that being pressured into &quot;cleaning up&quot; his remarks were &quot;the biggest fucking mistake I've made.&quot;)&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He is the one who called Mexicans rapists, embraced &quot;America First” as his slogan despite its anti-Semitic past, recently declared himself a &quot;nationalist&quot; despite its echoes with very dark chapters in world history. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>The GOP under his leadership has refused to repudiate such statements. Indeed, they have supported it. That has included everything from statements like House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s now deleted tweet suggesting that Soros, businessman Tom Steyer and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg were trying to &quot;buy&quot; the upcoming election, to GOP Representative Steve King’s recent endorsement of a neo-Nazi Canadian politician - just the latest example of King’s ugly embrace of anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>Trump surrounded himself with aides equally dedicated to the marketing of hate for political gain, like former top strategists Steve Bannon, and mastermind of the president’s draconian border policies, Stephen Miller. He refused to repudiate the support of white supremacists. He made the politics of over-the-top personal attacks on television and via Twitter his political signature.</p> \n<p>Trump did not put the bombs in the mail or pull the trigger in Pittsburgh or Louisville, but he has contributed to a mood in which anti-Semitism has soared in America under his leadership, with anti-Semitic incidents rising 57 percent in 2017 alone, according to the Anti-Defamation League. That is the largest year-on-year increase in over four decades. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>He has made institutionalizing discrimination against people of color, whether at the border, or by making it harder for them to vote, a centerpiece of his administration’s policies.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Even if, as appears the case, the Pittsburgh shooter suspected Trump, too, was under the thrall of the Jews, it is the behavior of Trump and those around them that has given permission for the haters to step out from the shadows, and into a more visible role in American public discourse.</p> \n<p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dispatched a minister to Pittsburgh and decried the attack, no doubt both out of sincere outrage - but also to show solidarity with Trump, and help defuse the inevitable attacks that lay responsibility for the current American mood at Trump doorstep. But the effect of his support to those who are aware of the facts, may be the opposite of what is intended.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Because it is clear one of the reasons Trump and Netanyahu have bonded is that both have ridden waves of hatred to political success, both have shamelessly vilified &quot;the other&quot; within their societies, both have sought to institutionalize the divisions their supporters seek, and both have capitalized on tensions at their borders even as they have inflamed them. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>In other words, to those that who are paying attention, Bibi’s embrace of Trump does not absolve the president of blame, but instead confirms the flaws in Trump’s character that have brought America into this dark chapter, because those very same flaws have done the same in Netanyahu’s Israel.</p> \n<p>David Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and host of the Deep State Radio podcast</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Jewish community in Ethiopia, labeled in the past as Falasha or Beta Israel, is perceived in Israel as a traditional-religious community which, while in Ethiopia, conducted its life in isolation from its inimical neighbors and from the processes unfolding around it, with all its aspirations focused on immigrating to Israel.</p> \n<p>A new study, which I conducted, reveals that men and women in this community were political activists and members of Marxist underground movements during the revolutionary years and civil war in that country (from the 1970s until 1991). Acquaintance with the role of Ethiopian Jews in these movements may change the commonly held image of this community in Israeli eyes. (The study is published in the Hebrew book, “The Other Journey: Life Stories of Ethiopian Jews, Activists in the Ethiopian Civil War 1974 – 1991.”)</p> \n<p>In the first half of the 1960s, it seemed that the Ethiopian empire was more stable than ever. Emperor Haile Selassie and his right-hand man Aklilu Habte-Wold charted the state’s path through the troubled waters of African politics, navigating the rivalry of the superpowers as well as the upheavals in the Middle East. The fact that an Eritrean struggle for independence, a string of local uprisings in other areas of Ethiopia and a coup attempt in 1960 did not manage to shake the throne contributed to an almost mythic view of Haile Selassie, indicating that he may rule for many years to come, contingent on his health.</p> \n<p>Things began to change dramatically starting in the mid-1960s, when students at the Haile Selassie University (later the Addis Ababa University) began organizing and protesting against the ossified regime. Gradually, under the influence of students who had studied at foreign universities (mainly in Western Europe and North America), they started taking interest in Marxist ideas, subsequently becoming more radical. Their demands included education for all, democratization, equality and the right of self-determination for diverse ethnic and linguistic groups, a demand which conflicted with the imperial policy of giving supremacy to Amharic. They also demanded the distribution of land to farmers who were working them in practice (in contrast to a quasi-feudal control of the land which was common in many areas in the days of the emperor), as well as other demands.</p> \n<p>From 1968 these protests gathered steam, becoming larger and more tumultuous after revelations of famine in northern districts of Ethiopia in 1973. This was exacerbated by a serious economic crisis caused, among other things, by the rise in oil prices that followed the embargo imposed by Arab states following the war with Israel that year. The students started organizing into parties, with the aim of leading Ethiopia into a post-imperial future. The most prominent party at the time was the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Party (EPRP), which by setting up small and secretive cells and by the distribution of manifestos and newspapers managed to recruit hundreds of thousands of men and women. However, despite the EPRP’s and the student movement’s dominance it was (mainly) mid-rank military officers who set up a revolutionary council, called the Derg, and took control of the state. They ousted the emperor and slowly began consolidating their rule.</p> \n<p>Members of the EPRP refused to accept the Derg’s dominance and began a conflict with the military regime. The response of Derg, headed by Mengistu Haile Mariam, was particularly harsh: a “red terror” campaign lasting until 1978 led to the deaths of tens of thousands of promising young Ethiopians. Attempts by the EPRP to wage a guerilla campaign failed, and the party disbanded in 1980.</p> \n<p>At the same time, another underground movement started operating in 1975. This was the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, the TPLF, which gradually acquired military experience, in collaboration (which saw ups and downs) with the veteran Eritrean underground movement, the EPLF. It started scoring victories against the more numerous and better-armed Derg forces, who were equipped by the Soviet Union. In 1991 the victorious TPLF forces entered Addis Ababa, marking the beginning of a new era in Ethiopia. This was accompanied by the breaking away of Eritrea as an independent state.</p> \n<p>The saga of Ethiopia’s revolutionary period, led by students, and the ensuing civil war, still occupy the minds of Ethiopians. However, one story was missing in the discourse and memories of this period and that was the part played by Beta Israel communities in these historic events. Reading the copious literature about this community before it came to Israel, one gets the impression that its members played no part in the political struggles and prolonged fighting, focusing only on their own livelihoods, their spiritual-religious life and their desire to go to Zion-Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>But this was not the whole picture. Male and female members of the community, mainly the young ones, joined the EPRP and TPLF when these operated in Gondar and Tigray, respectively. They participated in all the activities these groups carried out at the time: they joined their non-Jewish compatriots in secret cells, read revolutionary texts and discussed them, recruited new members, wrote and disseminated propaganda, tried to win hearts among the rural population and participated in the armed struggle against their enemies, mainly the Derg.</p> \n<p>In interviews with veterans of these underground movements now living in Israel, it’s clear that they, like many among their cohorts in Ethiopia, were swept up by the Marxist ideology of equality, progress, justice and democracy (in its revolutionary version). They were willing to sacrifice everything for these goals. Like their non-Jewish friends, Jewish members of the EPRP fled to Sudan after their organization disbanded in 1980. There they became active in Jewish and Israeli organizations trying to bring Ethiopian Jews to Israel, before immigrating themselves. TPLF members typically continued to work for that organization until 1991, after which they served in the Ethiopian army, partly in administrative jobs. They were later demobilized and came to Israel.</p> \n<p>It’s difficult to assess how many members of the community were involved in the struggle (this becomes more difficult given that the issue of who is a member of the community is a complex and controversial one in itself), but there is no reason to assume that the proportion was lower than in the rest of the population, as described by one of the women interviewed for this study: “It was the fate of all young people then…there was no difference between Christians, Muslims and Jews. It was the fate of everyone.”</p> \n<p>The conventional wisdom regarding the community and its life in Ethiopia includes these ingredients: their isolation from the hostile Ethiopian (mostly Christian) surroundings; their spiritual/mental/intellectual world that was limited to holy scriptures; their only political aspirations were the ancient ones of going to Yerusalem, their name for Jerusalem. Ostensibly, such a historical narrative should have worked in their favor. It should have helped them blend in with the national ethos of the host society. But there’s a fly in the ointment: It fixed their image as a pre-modern religious community, isolated from current ideological and political currents. This narrative did portray the community as a Zionist one, but at the same time as one which was frozen in time. A disconnect between the community and its history joined other elements that enfeebled the community in Israel. The story of those Jews who were partners in contemporary revolutionary movements undermines this image and presents a richer and more complex picture, thereby empowering the community.</p> \n<p>Dr. David Ratner is a sociologist and historian studying contemporary events in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa. He recently published a book on Ethiopian Jews and their part in the revolutionary struggle in that country.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The name Caroline Tess doesn’t mean much to most Israelis or Americans. Born in 1979, after a career in government as aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and assistant to U.S. ambassadors to the UN Susan Rice and Samantha Power, in 2014 she was appointed senior director for legislative affairs on the National Security Council, under President Barack Obama. In this position, Tess coordinated all the legislative perspectives relating to the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPA) and its approval by the U.S. Senate and House.</p> \n<p>Haaretz has uncovered that Tess was a target of the Israeli commercial intelligence firm Black Cube, during its private investigation into members of the Obama administration.</p> \n<p>The Haaretz investigation relies on sources that work or worked in the intelligence company, and internal documents that reveal the broad, comprehensive operation Black Cube conducted against senior Obama administration officials, as well as its objective and its funder.</p> \n<p>Last May, the Observer newspaper and New Yorker magazine published articles on the espionage operation against senior Obama administration officials. At their center were Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes and national security adviser to the vice president, Colin Kahl. Black Cube had contacted both under different covers, in order to discuss Iran. The operation failed and was exposed.</p> \n<p>But another operation was supposed to ensnare Tess.</p> \n<p>The most difficult part of Black Cube’s work is to lure the target into meeting with them. Given the nature of the job, wealthy businesspeople, company directors and senior members of governments are highly suspicious of any potential meeting with a stranger.</p> \n<p>Black Cube prepared a document regarding each of its targets. This mapped their occupational history, their residences, parents, siblings, spouses, children and hobbies, in order to identify points of interest through which they might open a conversation.</p> \n<p>The research on Tess revealed that she had a pastime: scuba diving. A picture of her from a 2016 diving trip to Cuba was found on the Facebook page of a women’s diving club called Diving Divas. Another website displayed reviews she wrote of diving sites around the world. Black Cube reached the conclusion that the most effective way to get to Tess was through diving.</p> \n<p>They built a website domain for an Argentine diving club called New Porto Ocean Club. The address they selected, 557 Bouchard, was that of an office building on the bay in Buenos Aires.</p> \n<p>“Hello Ms. Tess,” the bogus Black Cube email began. “My name is Beatriz Ruiz and I am the president of the New Port Ocean Club, a non-profit diving club located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I came across the 'Diving Divas Club' Facebook Page and got curious about the potential for cooperation.</p> \n<p>“We are a non-profit and all our trips are sponsored and we'd love to possibly work with the club. I was hoping we could arrange to speak on the phone and you could give me some information, we'd also be happy to offer you a trip with us for the help in any case! Feel free to check out the website below.</p> \n<p>“I look forward to hearing from you.”</p> \n<p>Tess did not respond to the fake email.</p> \n<p>A private Mossad</p> \n<p>Black Cube has been the subject of much attention in recent years, since being founded in 2010 by Dr. Avi Yanus and Dan Zorella.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Last February, Black Cube moved into new offices – an entire floor of the luxurious Bank Discount Tower on Yehuda Halevy Street and Herzl Boulevard in Tel Aviv. Visitors to the office are confronted with a plain black entrance with no writing on it.</p> \n<p>Former employees report that the company operates like a secret spy organization. This is partially for actual needs, and partially to project a certain image. Office doors open only with fingerprint door locks. The office of general director Zorella features a collection of the most expensive bottles of whiskey and cognac in the world, for guests to drink. This isn’t by accident: The reception room of the Mossad espionage agency at Glilot, north Tel Aviv, greets visitors with a similar bar, featuring the best the world has to offer. Black Cube wants to give its clients the impression they are getting a private Mossad, for any purpose.</p> \n<p>The structure of the company imitates that of Israel’s intelligence agencies: “There are different teams and each one is responsible for a different objective,” says one former employee. “As an analyst, you don’t know the portfolio itself. You receive SEI (Specialized Essential Information) [terminology imported directly from intelligence units], that just tells you what intelligence we need to obtain. What X will say about Y, for example. Afterward, you think, ‘If this information needs to be obtained, who will know it? What is his incentive to talk?’ But we as analysts don’t know who the client is.”</p> \n<p>Given that many of Black Cube’s operations are undercover, analysts are tasked with the initial invention of the cover story. “For instance, buying a SIM card and foreign telephone account that fits the chosen cover story,” says the former employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Whoever answers the call will be, in most cases, in an office in Israel. Acquiring a domain for all this requires a credit card that is not connected to the company, so that the transaction cannot be traced back to it. There is a logistics team whose job it is to take care of operation logistics.”</p> \n<p>The ‘actives’</p> \n<p>Agents are the tip of the company’s spear. In the “Weinstein affair,” an agent named Stella Penn, who lived in Jaffa, was exposed as targeting Americans. In the professional lingo, they are called “actives.” Their salaries are the highest – much more than the 45 to 65 shekels ($12 to $18) per hour that junior staff make, according to former employees. “I was surprised to see how some clients enjoy this, and not particularly because of the final results. I will tell you a secret: Many times, the final result isn’t so great,” says one former employee.</p> \n<p>“Actives” were supposed to get Rhodes, Kahl and Tess to talk, after establishing initial contact, and to extract valuable information from them. After the operation became public last spring, fingers were pointed at the Trump administration and its allies. That was because the assumption was that Black Cube’s objective was to get information that would support the public campaign to cancel the Iranian nuclear deal.</p> \n<p>But the documents Haaretz has obtained point to a different objective.</p> \n<p>Chasing damages</p> \n<p>On April 9, 1995, a suicide bomber from the Islamic Jihad group drove his booby-trapped vehicle into a bus packed with soldiers, near Kfar Darom in the Gaza Strip. Seven soldiers were killed, along with a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, Alisa Flatow, who was studying in Jerusalem. Her father, Stephen, an American attorney from West Orange, New Jersey, began a campaign against Iran. At the time of the attack, foreign countries had complete immunity from being sued in U.S. courts. In the wake of Flatow’s campaign, Congress passed a law in 1996 called the “Flatow Amendment,” which permitted lawsuits against countries financing terrorism.</p> \n<p>In 1998, a ruling was handed down: A federal district judge ordered the Iranian government to pay $247.5 million in damages to the Flatow family.</p> \n<p>The ruling opened the door for a series of further lawsuits. On February 25, 1996, a suicide bomber from Hamas blew up a number 18 bus on Jaffa Road in Jerusalem. Among the 26 victims were two Americans, Matthew Eisenfeld and Sara Duker. Their families sued Iran and in 2000 were awarded $327 million. American families also sued over the Hezbollah attack on the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 and were awarded $1 billion. The sum total of these judgments is now in the tens of billions of dollars.</p> \n<p>Iran, of course, does not recognize these rulings and does not pay the victims’ families. In a sense, then, these lawsuits are a modern treasure chest: A group of attorneys hold court bills worth billions, and whoever succeeds in finding Iranian assets can claim nice percentages on them.</p> \n<p>Commercial intelligence firms like Black Cube specialize in locating assets around the world to help pay these legal judgments, and these kinds of challenges prove particularly alluring to them. Even small percentages of Iranian funds that are frozen in different parts of the world&nbsp;could yield potential profits of millions of dollars, for negligible cost.</p> \n<p>Funding the operation</p> \n<p>Pursuing asset forfeiture is actually an independent business initiative of Black Cube. No specific entity &quot;ordered&quot; this operation – but it had a funder.</p> \n<p>His name is Nobu Su, a Taiwanese shipping tycoon who previously retained Black Cube in relation to his legal conflicts. Su, who is said to be friendly with the company’s managers, invested money from his own pocket – and his return is part of Black Cube’s percentage of the forfeiture.</p> \n<p>Black Cube loves to market itself as the smartest and boldest commercial intelligence business of them all. While its competitors engage in classic asset location, Black Cube will go further and try to get senior government officials to reveal those assets or leads.</p> \n<p>In the world of commercial intelligence, there is an unwritten law: “You don’t mess with the Americans.” As a result, many companies refuse to conduct this type of operation in the United States – and certainly not with former senior administration officials.</p> \n<p>Black Cube broke this law. As far as it is concerned, as long as the attorneys allow it, it will take any job.</p> \n<p>The background document for the project, which Haaretz possesses, establishes that the pursuit of Rhodes, Kahl and Tess was supposed to yield intelligence that would then enable a number of legal operations.</p> \n<p>The first was the location of unknown Iranian assets, such as bank accounts in the Gulf states or the Far East. The second was assistance to Iran in hiding its assets in violation of U.S. or international law. If it turned out that a certain bank helped Iran hide assets, Black Cube believed it would be possible to sue it. The third was assistance to Iran in shifting money in violation of American or international laws.</p> \n<p>At the time of the operation, many months before Black Cube was exposed, Zorella bragged to cronies about the Iranian forfeiture – because he would soon be in possession of major and dramatic information.</p> \n<p>If it were possible to prove that the Obama administration officials acted illegally – an allegation that has never been proven – in a case like this, you could sue the banks or the U.S. government in order to get Iranian money. Banks and governments are classic targets of lawsuits because they have deep and bottomless pockets. The Black Cube background document includes mention of “gathering intelligence leveraging the banks to disclose information on Iranian assets.”</p> \n<p>The Omani bank affair</p> \n<p>The primary focus of the investigation was the “Omani bank affair.” Iran had an account with Bank Muscat in Oman, where it banked payments for oil it sold. By 2015, the sum at the bank had reached $5.7 billion, but in Omani rials. The Iranians sought to convert the money into euros – but because Omani currency is linked to the dollar, no bank would agree to convert such a large sum. For this, an American bank would need to agree to convert the money from rials to U.S. dollars, and thence to euros. However, despite the nuclear agreement, Iran has yet to gain access to the banking network in the United States and therefore needed the help of the Obama administration.</p> \n<p>The affair ultimately reached Congress, which opened an official investigation whose findings were published last June. According to the probe, senior Obama administration officials worked with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control – which is responsible for enforcing sanctions – to allow it to permit the currency exchange, in spite of sworn statements that Iran would not receive access to the banking network. In the end, Wells Fargo Bank and J.P. Morgan refused to participate in the exchange due to concerns about legal liability.</p> \n<p>Black Cube also conducted its own investigation into the affair with that huge sum in Oman proving impossible to ignore. The intel firm earmarked a series of senior officials at the two bank as potential targets, and their names are recorded in the Black Cube document, as well as the managers at the Omani bank.</p> \n<p>Profiles were prepared of some of these bankers for the agent approaching them to use, including occupational history, addresses, phone numbers, email accounts, etc. At least two profiles were prepared for bankers whose jobs related to sanctions enforcement. Ultimately, this also failed to produce anything.</p> \n<p>A suspicious message</p> \n<p>After the Weinstein affair was made public last November, it soon became clear to Kahl that a Black Cube operative had also approached his wife, Rebecca Kahl, under a false identity – using the cover of a representative of a fund involved in education who sought to donate money to their daughter’s school. The fund cited was Reuben Capital Partners, the same name as the one used when a Black Cube agent approached actor Rose McGowan during the Weinstein operation. Rebecca Kahl referred the operative to school staff, as she had insisted on speaking only with her, and then stopped answering the operative’s emails completely.</p> \n<p>But the approach to Rebecca Kahl only took place after Black Cube had first approached Kahl himself. In order to reach him, they used an agent impersonating an emissary, who sent the following email:</p> \n<p>“Greetings Professor Kahl</p> \n<p>“Following the presidential election in France, and in anticipation of the upcoming parliamentary elections, The Neri Foundation is looking to organize a conference in conjunction with the IFRI and IRIS research institutes here in Paris.</p> \n<p>“The goal of the conference is that we have experts in the fields of international relations and national security participate, along with former government national security officials, in order to contribute their experience and perspectives on the problems facing Europe in general, and France in particular.</p> \n<p>“In our research your name featured prominently as an experienced academic as well as a government figure. I'm arriving in Washington D.C., in the second half of June, to meet with a number of others who have confirmed their participation in the conference I have attempted to reach you through email as well as leaving voicemail with the hopes of being able to meet you while I'm in town.</p> \n<p>“With the assumption that you are interested, I was hoping that you might be able to tell me when you can set some time aside for us to meet while I am in D.C. so I can explain to you in more detail what we are looking to put together.</p> \n<p>“It goes without saying that, on top of a speakers fee, the foundation is willing to cover all expenses associated with your participation in the event. While the date for the conference has yet to be finalized, we expect to hold it towards the end of the summer.</p> \n<p>“I look forward to hearing from you.</p> \n<p>“Sincerely, Emile Neri”</p> \n<p>Kahl was suspicious. He responded via email: &quot;I will be traveling with family from mid-June to mid-August, so I won't be in DC to meet.</p> \n<p>“Can you give me a better sense for the conference agenda, whether there are other sponsors, and who else has been invited?&quot; The two arranged to talk by phone, but that never happened. Neri's website soon went offline.</p> \n<p>Black Cube said in response to this article: “Black Cube policy is never to discuss its clients with any third party, and never to confirm or deny any speculation about its work. Black Cube only works to gather evidence in the biggest litigations in the world and not in other cases.</p> \n<p>“It should be stressed that Black Cube always acts in accordance with the law, in any country it's working in, and in accordance to the legal counsel by the leading law firms in the world.”</p> \n<p>Nobu Su did not respond to an inquiry from Haaretz.</p>",

Either they go overseas, or they go to jail. It will be a cleanup the likes of which has never been seen in Brazilian history.&nbsp;Jair Bolsonaro, 21 October 2018&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Unbelievable: A presidential candidate asks the people to conform to what he thinks or pay the price: Jail or exile. Reminiscent of other [past] times.&nbsp;Former Brazilian president&nbsp;Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 23 October 2018&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By the time it ended in 1985, Brazil’s military dictatorship was a last remnant of an once-rampant political ideology rife with fascist influences. The recent success of Brazil’s far-right presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, predicted to win the second and final round on 28 October, indicates that South America's biggest country is on the cusp of joining a global backslide towards those&nbsp;ugly decades. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Is Brazil About to Elect the Far-right Executioner of Its Democracy?</p> \n<p>It is also a sign of the return of a repressive and nationalistic understanding of the state and its foreign policies that came to a head in pre-war Nazi Germany, spread west to the United States, and was pushed by successive U.S. administrations as a strategic necessity for South America.</p> \n<p>First gaining prominence as a staunch defender of the legacy of Brazil’s military dictatorship, which gained power in a 1964 coup, Bolsonaro’s anti-LGBQT, racist, and misogynistic platform is part of his general disdain for democracy. He has&nbsp;advocated sterilization for the poor to stave off &quot;chaos.&quot;</p> \n<p>Less than 15 years after the end of the U.S.-supported dictatorship that tortured and killed thousands of leftists, the then-Congressman declared in a&nbsp;public interview that, if ever elected president, he would &quot;begin the coup&quot; on his first day in office.</p> \n<p>In 2015, Bolsonaro ran afoul of more&nbsp;controversy after posing for a photo with a Nazi sympathizer dressed as Hitler who had been invited to speak at a Rio de Janeiro City Council session by his son, Carlos.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When another of Bolsonaro's&nbsp;&nbsp;sons, Eduardo, tweeted out a photo of himself posing with the ubiquitous Steve Bannon this August, declaring that the two share the same &quot;worldview,&quot; people started asking&nbsp;questions about how far the interconnected revivals of the international far right would go.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bannon, Bolsonaro’s son said, is &quot;an enthusiast of Bolsonaro's campaign and we are certainly in touch to join forces, especially against cultural marxism.&quot; Strangely, weakly, Bolsonaro Sr later denied Bannon’s connection to the campaign. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Bolsonaro’s implacable opposition to the political left is not the only critical fuel for his worldview. One other key strand, for which Bannon is a key evangelizer,&nbsp;is the role of geopolitics and its use by far-right movements throughout the twentieth century.</p> \n<p>While most people do not give a second thought to the term &quot;geopolitics,&quot; perhaps no idea has greater explanatory value, nor had a greater historical impact, on the region’s political climate. To fully grasp how the culture wars are playing out today in Brazil, it helps to gain perspective on geopolitics itself.</p> \n<p>The term &quot;geopolitics&quot; was coined by the Swedish geographer Rudolf Kjell&eacute;n in 1899. It was intended to reflect the understanding of political geography developed by his German peer, Friedrich Ratzel, who embraced the conservative nationalism of his day. A veteran of the Franco-Prussian War, Ratzel understood the state as an organic collective of national culture and civilization, spreading naturally - as an empire&nbsp;and as an expression of inner greatness - into larger territories, usually on their border regions and beyond.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ratzel’s understanding of those &quot;Gros&szlig;raum&quot; (large spaces) influenced Karl Haushofer, a friend's son, who joined the military and took an observational post in Japan. After serving as an officer during WWI, Haushofer came to identify with the populist far right, took Nazi Rudolf Hess under his wing, and tutored Hess and Adolf Hitler, himself, in geopolitics during the time they were incarcerated at Landsberg after the failed 1923 Beerhall Putsch.</p> \n<p>Haushofer introduced Hitler to Ratzel’s books, and to geopolitics in general, influencing the Nazis’ turn toward the desire to conquer &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (&quot;Living space&quot;) in the East. He further helped develop the Nazis’ pact with Japan and smooth over the Munich Agreement that facilitated Germany’s expansion into the Sudetenland. He was delighted when the Nazis ironed out the infamous non-belligerence pact with Russia, producing the Eurasian space that he believed could defeat North Atlantic hegemony.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Intoxicated by his own success, Haushofer flamboyantly signed his name, &quot;L’inventeur du ‘Lebensraum’!&quot; anointing Hitler and Hess the heirs of Valhalla, and calling for the resettling of Baltic Germans. Yet his plans fell apart when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. At the end of the war, his legacy in ruins, Haushofer and his wife committed suicide together.</p> \n<p>Opposed as a pseudoscience by prominent geographers in academia like Richard Hartshorne and Isaiah Bowman, geopolitics was all but abandoned after the war - but it did not die out completely.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While escaped Nazi war criminals found shelter in Brazil, Bolivia, and Argentina, the South American military establishment openly&nbsp;embraced the ideas of Ratzel and Haushofer and relied on them for some of their most oppressive policies.</p> \n<p>Golbery de Couto e Silva, the strategist behind the 1964 military coup in Brazil, outlined the ideas put into effect through the feared National Security Doctrine in his 1966 book, &quot;Geopol&iacute;tica do Brasil.&quot; Then-Professor of Geopolitics at the Chilean War Academy, Augusto Pinochet, studied Golbery’s text closely and applied its teachings to his own government after leading the U.S.-supported Chilean coup of 1973.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Geopolitics had gained some currency in the U.S. during the 1960s through the Cold War strategizing of Saul Cohen, but it was&nbsp;Henry Kissinger who brought the term back into vogue with his 1979 tome, &quot;The White House Years.&quot;</p> \n<p>It should come as no surprise, then, that the same U.S. state department wonks who adamantly supported the Latin American dictatorships, as part of a continent-wide strategy of anti-leftist counter-insurgency known as&nbsp;Operation Condor, would help bring about the return of geopolitics.</p> \n<p>The next year, the leading U.S. scholar on Latin American geopolitics,&nbsp;Lewis Tambs, helped draft the Santa Fe Document, a 1980s Latin America strategy for the Reagan administration that explicitly advocated geopolitical positions.</p> \n<p>The &quot;War on Drugs&quot; and involvement in bloody civil wars - from Guatemala to El Salvador to Nicaragua - would follow, with the&nbsp;full support of Evangelicals like Pat Robertson, whose&nbsp;American Center for Law and Justice helped spread the far-right gospel in Brazil after the dictatorship.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Later, Tambs would pen the forward for one of the only Haushofer texts translated into English - a 1939 edition of a book on the Asia-Pacific region that extolls the Nazi Party.</p> \n<p>Soon, the&nbsp;International Institute of Geopolitics would open in France, boasting an English-language journal supported by the likes of Zbigniew Brzezinski, William F. Buckley, Jr, and Samuel Huntington. Geopolitics was back, and while its advocates converged around debates between &quot;Realists&quot; and &quot;Idealists,&quot; amid the growth of the neoconservative movement, the advocacy of geopolitical thought provided valuable oxygen for the rehabilitation of Haushofer and Ratzel by more radical forces.</p> \n<p>The return of geopolitics in the 1980's and ’90s accompanying the dissolution of the Soviet Union, became part of the triumphal narrative of North Atlantic supremacy, but its advocates rarely examined its roots in radical conservatism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While the renascent geopolitics accommodated geo-strategy and more liberal understandings of international relations, those who proclaimed geopolitics in its&nbsp;original form largely came from the so-called&nbsp;Nouvelle Droite, a network of far-right ideologues committed to reproducing the conditions for the re-emergence of fascism in Europe.</p> \n<p>It was in these circles that the Russian fascist, Alexander Dugin, learned about geopolitics while residing in Western Europe, injecting its fundamental precepts into Russia’s chaotic political environment through his 1997 text, &quot;Foundations of Geopolitics.&quot; In his strange book that advances occult myths of an Aryan super-race, Dugin concluded that geopolitics tended toward his own brand of fascism.</p> \n<p>Happy to turn a blind eye to its fascist core, Dugin’s ideology was spread with the aid of his numerous connections, from the General Staff of the Russian Armed Services to &quot;Orthodox oligarch&quot; Konstantin Malofeev, one of the major backers of the international far-right Christian network, the World Congress of Families.</p> \n<p>While Steve Bannon’s notorious&nbsp;2014 speech to far-right zealots held in the Vatican associated with the World Congress of Families did not name Dugin, it outlined his fascist worldview - a fixation on geopolitics that Bannon claims to have studied &quot;intensively.&quot; Last year, a magazine supported by the Vatican presciently accused Bannon of &quot;apocalyptic geopolitics.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Brazil's Bolsonaro, who is Catholic but attends Baptist services, has made a&nbsp;populist effort to span denominations, and&nbsp;receives broad support from Brazil’s growing, urban evangelical movement, including boosters associated with the World Congress of Families.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro was baptized in the Jordan River into the Assemblies of God, which has been pouring money into far-right politics in Brazil and around the world. The Assemblies of God are deep drivers of the U.S. Evangelical movement, including some of the most important partners of the World Congress of Families.</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro’s richest Evangelical supporters, like the Assembly of God’s head and Pentecostal televangelist Silas Malafaia, have partnered up with WCF allies at the Pat Robertson-founded American Center for Law and Justice, and at&nbsp;the Brazilian Center for Law and Justice, which promotes – as does WCF - a transnational movement against LGBT rights.</p> \n<p>Adjusting traditional far-right politics to the characteristics of Brazil’s middle-class, Bolsonaro has become a fighter in the global culture wars, seeking to deliver on a patriarchal mandate that has gained the support of conservative U.S. publications like the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal (for being a &quot;Brazilian Swamp Drainer&quot;), in a country that has, ironically, for the last 15 years, has helped anchor a region-wide leftist movement with its own strong ties to Russia.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro’s candidacy and likely ascendance to the presidency is a sign of a growing geopolitical union of far-right forces forming the backlash against liberalism and the left, and the rehabilitation and glamorizing of military power and authoritarianism. It's a symptom of a greater crisis of democracy that is both producing - and the product of - a system-wide transformation of international relations.</p> \n<p>Alexander Reid Ross is a Lecturer in Geography at Portland State University.

        "text":["<p>On Sunday, millions of Brazilians will set out for the sixth time in their brief history as citizens of a democracy to elect a new president. In 1985, Brazil emerged from a 21-year military dictatorship.</p> \n<p>Some observers are casting it as a vote for the country’s soul and a battle for its future as a democracy. Whether or not this is true, Brazilian society is deeply divided, as is, in fact, the Jewish community. Brazilians do not recall a more a highly charged election in the history of Latin America’s largest country.</p> \n<p>Leading in the polls is the first-round winner and leader of the Social Liberal Party, Jair Bolsonaro, a Christian conservative who served in the army during the dictatorship. Not a liberal by any standard, Bolsonaro styles himself as a Mr. Fix-It for the country’s woes.</p> \n<p>The Western media, and some of his opponents, bill him as the Donald Trump of the tropics. But to many Brazilians, the former army captain simply represents the antithesis to the leftist Workers’ Party, whose reputation has been sullied in a major corruption probe.</p> \n<p>In the polls, Bolsonaro is currently ahead at 59 percent, leading the Workers’ Party’s Fernando Haddad, a former education minister under Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, the celebrated ex-president recently jailed on a corruption conviction. As late as early September, before the courts rejected his request to run, Lula was leading in the polls from his prison cell.</p> \n<p>Haddad’s early campaign ads, hoping to capitalize on Lula’s popularity, portrayed him as a kind of proxy for the former president. That strategy was dropped once he came in far behind Bolsonaro in&nbsp;the first round of voting on October 7. Both he and the party have since distanced themselves from the imprisoned leader.</p> \n<p>In contrast, Bolsonaro’s ads portray him as a kind of evangelical superhero. Clad in army fatigues with a pistol in hand, he stands in the rain under pale city lights amid the slogan “Brazil before everything, and God above all.”</p> \n<p>His promise to put Brazil first, along with firebrand rhetoric and a rapid rise out of political obscurity, solidifies the tropic Trump tag. Sure enough, in August, Bolsonaro’s youngest son Eduardo posted a photo of him and Steve Bannon on Instagram, calling the architect of Trump’s 2016 victory an “enthusiastic” supporter of his father.</p> \n<p>The younger Bolsonaro said in an interview that Bannon would help the campaign with “internet tips, sometimes an analysis, interpreting data, those kinds of things.” His father denied the connection and knowledge of the meeting with Bannon.</p> \n<p>‘Fake news’ and sexual violence</p> \n<p>Much has been written about Bolsonaro’s rhetoric on minorities, whether ethnic or otherwise. He once said he would rather have a son die in a car crash than come out as gay. He advocated corporal punishment for boys considered “effeminate.” In a conversation at the Hebraica Club of Rio de Janeiro, Bolsonaro talked about the appropriation of Native American lands for their wealth and dismissed the country’s Quilombola minority, Afro-Brazilian descendants of escaped slaves, as “useless.”</p> \n<p>In 2003, during a televised argument with Congresswoman Maria do Rosario, Bolsonaro told his fellow lawmaker he wouldn’t rape her, “because you don’t deserve it.”</p> \n<p>His supporters filter this out or dismiss it as “fake news.” They cling to his promises to eradicate crime and corruption. Alice Bulus, a Lebanese-Brazilian teacher who voted for Bolsonaro, says his comments on gay people and women have been misinterpreted.</p> \n<p>“It’s not a matter of prejudice but of putting the country in order,” she told Haaretz, adding that “he’s a good person, not the monster that the media shows. My gay and black friends vote for him … Many women support him.”</p> \n<p>In September, a woman in the southern city of Porto Alegre, draped in an LGBT flag and wearing an anti-Bolsonaro sticker, was savagely beaten in the street. Her attackers then carved a swastika into her skin with a knife, Brazilian media reported. Bolsonaro came out against such acts, but said he can’t control the actions of his supporters.</p> \n<p>“If a guy wearing one of my T-shirts goes too far, what can I do?” he was quoted by the BBC as saying.</p> \n<p>Niraldo Nascimento, a researcher at the University of Brasilia, says violence against minorities has increased during the election campaign, particularly by police and Bolsonaro supporters. “I’m afraid to go out alone walking in the street wearing a button or a T-shirt with slogans or symbols supporting the leftist candidate,” he told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the first round of voting, Capoeira Master Moa do Catende was stabbed to death by a Bolsonaro supporter&nbsp;in Salvador, northeast of Sao Paolo. The attacker admitted to police the attack was political.</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro even managed to incite violence against himself when in September he was stabbed during a rally by a man who claimed he was on a mission from God.</p> \n<p>“His rhetoric resonates with people who actually practice violence within their families, which is not so uncommon in a poorly educated population such as ours,” said Sergio Storch, the founder of a Brazilian group of progressive Jews.</p> \n<p>But since Bolsonaro’s strong showing on October 7, he seems to be easing up on the acrimony, saving it mainly for the Workers’ Party. Earlier this month, he rebuffed an endorsement from former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, who said Bolsonaro “sounds like us.”</p> \n<p>Brazilians are “the most beautiful and mixed race people in the world,” Bolsonaro tweeted, suggesting that “for consistency, [supremacist groups] support my adversary the candidate of the left party, who loves to segregate the society.”</p> \n<p>On October 22, Bolsonaro ramped up his vitriol against the left. In a fear-mongering speech, which he streamed from his home in Rio as he recovered from the stabbing, Bolsonaro promised to “cleanse” the nation of its left-wing “outlaws.”</p> \n<p>The Jewish vote</p> \n<p>For all his conservative politics, violent supporters and populist polemics against the left, it’s Bolsonaro’s effusive praise for the United States and Israel, replete with a pledge to move the Brazilian Embassy to Jerusalem, that has earned him the backing of not just evangelicals but also large sectors of the Jewish community.</p> \n<p>“Bolsonaro is good for the Jewish people,” said Fernando, a Brazilian Jew currently living in Israel who requested that only his first name be used. In the first round, Bolsonaro won the vote among Brazilian Jews in Israel and is expected to do the same Sunday.</p> \n<p>Pro-Israeli Jews in Brazil, frustrated by what they consider an imbalanced Brazilian debate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, also rally behind him. “He seems to be friendly with Israel, he’s very conservative in his ideology, but his treasury minister is liberal,” said Mordechai Ancelevicz, a Jewish-Brazilian supporter of Bolsonaro.</p> \n<p>“What’s happening in Brazil is that the middle class is tired of seeing its money going to corruption. The PT was never a real party but more of an organization seeking to stay in power,” Ancelevicz added, referring to the Workers’ Party. “People are expecting him to be different.”</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro has also said his first presidential trip would be to Israel, promising to buy irrigation technology for Brazil’s arid northeastern regions.</p> \n<p>Nascimento of the University of Brasilia calls this plan dubious. “I went to a conference on water resources and talked to various professors, researchers and experts on the subject,” he said. “The answer they gave me is that this is a great technology for Israel whose high-value-added fruit-and-vegetable production justifies the high costs [of water technologies] but wouldn’t be applicable in Brazil.”</p> \n<p>Storch, meanwhile, says that “Bolsonaro shows up as a friend to Israel, and many in the Jewish community truly believe it, not understanding he may actually be a friend of the Israeli arms industry. Our Jewish community is by and large naively taken in by Netanyahu’s hasbara and lacks critical thinking,” he said, using the Hebrew word for propaganda.</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro has indeed echoed Israeli right-wing talking points; he once asked: “Is Palestine a country? Palestine is not a country, so there should be no embassy here.”</p> \n<p>Speaking to the JTA news agency right after the first vote, representatives of the Jewish community praised him for his pro-Israel positions. Ary Bergher, president of the Rio Jewish federation, told JTA that Bolsonaro’s “victory in the first round made us very joyful and hopeful due to his friendship, love and bonds not only with the State of Israel but with the whole Jewish people. He will be a great president by having Jewish ethics and morals as his pillars.”</p> \n<p>Israel’s honorary consul in Rio, Osias Wurman, said Bolsonaro “stood out among the many candidates for including the State of Israel in the major speeches he made during the campaign.” Wurman added that Bolsonaro “is a lover of the people and the State of Israel.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, Storch says that “many Jews oppose him fiercely,” noting that nearly 10,000 people signed a document by the movement Judeus contra Bolsonaro.</p> \n<p>A Brazilian-Jewish pro-democracy movement that Storch is a member of released a statement condemning the use of the Israeli flag at Bolsonaro rallies, saying it symbolizes everything that Bolsonaro is against.</p> \n<p>“It’s unacceptable that it should be used to legitimize anti-democratic movements that spread hate speech against minorities, as is happening in the 2018 Brazilian electoral campaign,” the group said in the statement.</p> \n<p>As Storch puts it, Bolsonaro’s “insistence on using symbols such as the Israeli flag are oriented more toward the fundamentalist Christians. Jewish votes aren’t relevant at all. There are only 100,000 Brazilian Jews, but the fundamentalists’ votes are in the tens of millions.”</p> \n<p>Storch sees the Jewish community as split about 20 percent on the left, 40 percent on the right and 40 percent that he defines as liberals.</p> \n<p>“But even many who are left-leaning follow rather blindly the Israeli right-wing hasbara, since even the liberal guys” in Jewish groups omit or ignore critical information about the Israeli government, he said.</p> \n<p>‘Worse than Israel and Gaza’</p> \n<p>Of all his campaign promises, it appears it’s Bolsonaro’s pledge to wage a war on crime that has won the support of Brazil’s huddled and impoverished masses.</p> \n<p>Bulus, a Maronite Christian who volunteers at the Lebanese consulate in Rio, says she feels like she’s living in a prison.</p> \n<p>“We don’t have security …. Here we are all the time at war. All day, day by day, second by second. Here it’s worse than Israel and Gaza … and I think that Bolsonaro would try” to bring peace to Brazil’s embattled streets, she said. “I don’t have a gun to protect myself. But I go into the streets and all the terrorists have guns,” she added, referring to drug dealers who run vast swaths of Brazil’s cities.</p> \n<p>Bulus talks about an electoral dichotomy that mirrors the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “Among Lebanese, Maronites are with Bolsonaro. Muslims are with PT,” she said, referring to the Workers’ Party. “Bolsonaro comes in on the Christian bench, next to the evangelicals and Israelis. We’re being compared to the Zionists, but we only want order and progress. PT represents Sodom and Gomorrah, vandalism, atheism.”</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro’s legislative record is modest given his 26-year tenure in Congress and low on social interests. The vast majority of his 171 proposed bills over that period were related to military and public security concerns. The two that passed were modest economic ones, but he took great pride in blocking legislation to put literature against homophobia in schools. He also sought to abolish abortion in cases of rape.</p> \n<p>The left in general sees Bolsonaro as a harbinger of fascism, and he often mentions the days when Brazil had safety, order and security – under its military regime.</p> \n<p>“He isn’t a true leader, but his speech has filled the sails of the military community that believes that the solution for the country is the military regime; that is, a return of the dictatorship,” Nascimento said.</p> \n<p>Others dispute the narrative that Bolsonaro will turn Brazil back into a dictatorship.</p> \n<p>“The army is smarter than that; they don’t need martial law,” said a diplomatic source active in South America. “I think [the army is] behind him, they’re pulling the strings. So they’ll dictate the policies they want.”</p> \n<p>According to the source, this means a fatter defense budget and more authority, especially in the fight against the country’s deep-seated drug world and the culture of violence it has embedded into the country’s social fabric.</p> \n<p>“In the city of Rio de Janeiro, more people die every year than in all the wars and terrorist attacks in Israel over the past 70 years,” the source said. “People are fed up. It’s an emotional reaction. They feel they were abused by the PT.”</p> \n<p>But Brazil doesn’t really have a fascist movement, the diplomat said, adding that “it’s not that the people are adopting a fascist worldview.”</p> \n<p>“Most of the people in Brazil are liberal. And they’ll continue to be liberal, I think. I don’t expect there to be a big change,” the source said.</p> \n<p>“I think the people who admire him are saner than him. They won’t let him run wild, because otherwise Brazil would fall apart. And they won’t let Brazil fall apart. It’s an important country. Important to the Americans, important to its neighbors. It’s not that easy to dismantle a democracy and tear down all its institutions,” the source added.</p> \n<p>“But maybe I’m just daydreaming that it will all be all right. Let’s talk again in a month.”</p>",

Eyewitness reports said he was heavily armed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Two hours before the attack, an account on the social network Gab under Bowers' name posted an attack on HIAS, a Jewish-American organization that helps refugees in the U.S. and around the world.</p> \n<p>Bowers wrote: “HIAS likes to bring invaders that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics. I’m going in.”</p> \n<p>Speaking about the shooting, Trump told reporters who accompanied him on the way to a political event that the attack could have been avoided if the synagogue had armed guards present.</p> \n<p>&quot;If they had protection, the result would have been far better,&quot; Trump said after being asked by a reporter if he thinks the synagogue should have had an armed guard.</p> \n<p>He later wrote on Twitter: &quot;This evil Anti-Semitic attack is an assault on humanity. It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of Anti-Semitism from our world. We must unite to conquer hate.&quot;</p> \n<p>First Lady Melania Trump also tweeted in response to the incident. &quot;My heart breaks over the news out of Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the attack, writing on Twitter: &quot;I condemn the terror attack against a Pittsburgh synagogue and extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and to the American people. Turkey unequivocally condemns all forms of terrorism in all parts of the world regardless of their targets.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel stands with Pittsburgh in face of 'anti-Semitic brutality'</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahau also commented on the shooting. In a video statement issued on Saturday evening, the premier can be heard saying: &quot;I was heartbroken and appalled by the murderous attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue today. The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead.&quot;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu said Israel &quot;stands together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh. We stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality, and we all pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded.&quot;</p> \n<p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, expressed his condolences on Twitter: &quot;Today the residents of Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill community are in mourning in the aftermath of a terrorist shooting attack shattering Tree of Life synagogue’s Shabbat services. We are heartbroken and pray for the victims and their families, including the brave police.&quot;</p> \n<p>The European Union condemned the attack in a statement, saying it &quot;shows the magnitude of a wave of antisemitism and racism that is spreading in many countries.&quot;</p> \n<p>The statement expressed solidarity with the community of the synagogue of Pittsburgh and with &quot;all the Jewish communities around the world in this moment. The EU reaffirms its strong condemnation for anti-semitism as well as for any incitement to hatred and violence. We have experienced on our continent the devastating and unforgivable consequences of antisemitism and hatred that can never be forgotten.&quot;</p> \n<p>The statement concluded with a promise to&nbsp;protect &quot;the fundamental right of belief, wherever it’s questioned or attacked.&quot;</p> \n<p>Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of the synagogue, said in an interview with KDKA that &quot;like most religious institutions, we have an open door ... On a day like today, the door is open, it's a religious service, you can walk in freely, only on the High Holidays is there a security person at the door.&quot;</p> \n<p>Eisenberg said he had been heading to the synagogue when the shooting began, and the police on the scene told him to leave.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Eisenberg said that the synagogue leaders had undergone training and preparation for active shooter situations, though he said that the synagogue had never received any threats of violence.</p> \n<p>He said he had spoken to the synagogue's maintenance man, who was in the bathroom during the shooting, and had escaped through exit doors, which had been purposely made easier to exit in order to prepare for such a situation. The doors were adjusted on the advice of Homeland Security experts who had briefed synagogue leaders on ways to prepare for security threats. That advice, and the adjustments to the doors, he said, may have saved lives by allowing congregants to escape.</p> \n<p>&quot;Moving forward, we need to learn from this. You want to be pro-active ... this will be a catalyst for more security in the future in many religious institutions,&quot; Eisenberg said, adding emotionally, &quot;I know everyone in the building. I almost don't want to know, but I am going to have to know&quot; what occurred inside.</p> \n<p>In Israel, President Reuven Rivlin also extended his condolences to members of the Jewish community, saying: &quot;Our prayers and deepest concerns are focused on what is happening in Pittsburgh, Pennsilvaniya. Our hearts and thoughts are with the families of those who were slain and we are praying for the speedy recovery of the injured. I am certain that security forces and U.S. law enforcement will investigate the appalling incident thoroughly and bring the murderer to justice.&quot;</p> \n<p>Jewish Agency Chairman Isaac Herzog echoed such sentiments in his own statement: &quot;Horrible shooting during Shabbat Service at Congregation Etz Chaim in Pittsburgh. We at the Jewish Agency are in pain and mourning with the Pittsburgh Jewish community, and will assist in any possible way. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.&quot;</p> \n<p>Education and Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett departed for Pittsburgh hours after the attack took place. He is slated to visit&nbsp;the scene of the attack, meet the local community and participate in the funerals of those killed.</p> \n<p>&quot;The State of Israel and the Israeli Government are shocked and pained to receive the reports of the terrible attack on the Jewish community in Pittsburgh,&quot; Bennett said in a statement before departing.  “We are following the news with concern, and I have instructed the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs to prepare to assist the community in every possible way.&nbsp;Our hearts go out to the families of those killed and injured. May the memory of the murdered be blessed,&quot; his statement read</p> \n<p>Yizhar Hess, executive director of the Conservative movement in Israel, spoke about the loss the community suffered, “It is a tough evening, and to all those who accuse us of not being Jews or not being Jewish enough, here is yet another proof, written in blood,&quot; Hess said.</p> \n<p>The Consulate General of Israel in New York, which is also responsible for Pennsylvania, wrote that it &quot;stands in solidarity and heavy mourning with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh for the terrible murder of Jewish worshipers this morning.&quot;  Consul General of Israel in New York, Dani Dayan, also released a statement. &quot;Today, murderous anti-Semitism has reached our borders, and the State of Israel stands with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh, shoulder to shoulder.&quot;</p> \n<p>American-Palestinian Women's March leader Linda Sarsour wrote on Facebook:&nbsp;&quot;This is absolutely devastating and so scary.

Some 40 percent of its residents are Jewish. It is a rare phenomenon: an urban American neighborhood that has maintained the Jewish heart of its city for over a century.</p> \n<p>During Shabbat services on Saturday morning, a gunman entered the synagogue, purportedly shouted, &quot;All Jews must die.&quot; He opened fire, killing 11 members of the congregation.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;11 killed in Pittsburgh synagogue shooting; gunman yelled 'All Jews must die'&nbsp;■&nbsp;Rabbi of neighboring PIttsburgh synagogue recounts trauma&nbsp;■ Group that enraged Pittsburgh synagogue shooter says work more critical than ever&nbsp;■ U.S. Jews' despair over Pittsburgh atrocity is compounded by Trump's complicity and Netanyahu's hypocrisy | Analysis</p> \n<p>“Here it is utter shock and disbelief. We are only two blocks away and all morning we've been hearing police cars and helicopters,” said Sara Stock Mayo, a Squirrel Hill resident familiar with people who attend the Tree of Life synagogue.</p> \n<p>A community begins to react: ‘We have to become our own leaders’</p> \n<p>“Within a few hours span we have gone from emotionally devastated to total shock. We are living in challenging times. But the outpouring from Muslim and Christian friends, who have reached out to say 'We are here for you,' has been tremendous,” says Stock Mayo,&nbsp;a fourth-generation Squirrel Hill resident who moved back with her husband from New York to raise their children here.</p> \n<p>She says that as the aftermath of this massacre unfolds, the Jewish community will take comfort in the interfaith and other support they are receiving from around the city. “We have to keep remembering we do live in a special space, and recognize that there are people who really have our backs and want to show us their support and love.”</p> \n<p>Mayo says she was disturbed by President Donald Trump’s reaction to the attack. His words, suggesting that if the synagogue had hired armed guards the massacre would not have occurred, failed to comfort her and her teenage children, she said.</p> \n<p>“He’s not saying the right things and I knew he wouldn’t. I know who he is and I think for my right-wing friends who thought Trump was good for Israel, this will maybe be an interesting wake-up call for them,” she says.</p> \n<p>“Our leadership doesn’t really care about us right now. So we have to find a way to make things happen. We have to become the leaders,” she added.</p> \n<p>A Mr. Rogers kind of neighborhood</p> \n<p>It doesn't just feel like a &quot;Mr. Rogers kind of neighborhood&quot; – it was Mr. Rogers' neighborhood. Fred Rogers, the iconic children’s television host lived here, and the church he attended was located across the street from the Jewish Community Center.</p> \n<p>“It’s a really hamish place,” says Mayo, using the Yiddish word for friendly or homey. Residents describe a cooperation and connection between leaders and community members across the spectrum of Jewish identities – Lubavitch Hasidic, Modern Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist&nbsp;– that is unique in American-Jewish life.</p> \n<p>Recently, it has also become home to a growing Asian population with Chinese and Taiwanese restaurants opening up next to longtime pizza places and ice cream parlors. Over the last few years, the JCC has been hosting a parade for Chinese New Year.</p> \n<p>In Squirrel Hill, homes were built close together and whole families can usually be seen walking together to the JCC or to one of the four synagogues located within a four-block radius. Everyone seems to know everyone else, neighbors stopping to chat on wide sidewalks.</p> \n<p>There’s a movie theater that dates back to 1931 and independently owned businesses, including a pizza place and shoe store, that have been around for about 50 years.</p> \n<p>Nate Scher, 80, grew up here and never left. “I love walking down the street and saying hi to 18 people within a block and still shopping at stores that have been there since I was kid,” he said.</p> \n<p>He has been a member of The Tree of Life synagogue for the past 40 years. As a professional videographer, he says he filmed dozens of weddings and bnai mitzvot there over the decades.</p> \n<p>“I just love the neighborliness of it, feeling a community environment but still being in a city,” says Beth Grill, 54, a policy analyst who moved to Squirrel Hill from Detroit with her husband to raise their three children. “It’s a very easy place to live. Everyone knows everyone. It feels like a big small town.”</p> \n<p>Grill’s children went to a Jewish day school in the neighborhood. There are also Orthodox schools, yeshivas and even an arts school.</p>",

        "text":["<p>What made you decide to study the history of drugs?</p> \n<p>It was by chance. I’m not a pothead. The world of drugs intrigued me, possibly because it’s alien to me. Doing my master’s degree, I found myself in Munich on a particularly generous scholarship. I was looking for a thesis subject and realized that drugs and Nazis could be quite an interesting connection. Subsequently, my doctorate dealt with the history of drugs in Germany and the United States, from the beginning of the 19th century until 1945, the end of World War II. Afterward, I did a postdoc at Harvard and also decided to leave the academic world. A few years ago, I published my book, “Drugs in Germany and the United States, 1819-1945: The Birth of Two Addictions” [published in English in 2017].</p> \n<p>So, was Hitler a junkie?</p> \n<p>Really, now.</p> \n<p>I’m kidding. In the first sentence of your book, you say that everyone who hears about your area of research immediately asks whether Hitler was an addict.</p> \n<p>That claim is older than I am. Every few years some historian or journalist tries to hitch a ride on that allegation.</p> \n<p>Let’s first try to understand the broader context. What sort of narcotic drugs were rampant in the period you studied?</p> \n<p>The drug of drugs then was morphine, both in Germany and in the United States.</p> \n<p>Hard to believe that it was legal, that in Germany you could buy narcotics at any pharmacy, that Bayer, the pharmaceuticals company, manufactured and sold heroin.</p> \n<p>There was a tremendous demand for them. Over and above their function as painkillers, drugs also relieved other problems, such as coughing, digestive difficulties and so on. However crazy it may sound today, in the 19th century you could buy top-quality cocaine in drugstores very inexpensively. For a long time, you didn’t even need a doctor’s prescription.</p> \n<p>The profile of the addicts was also completely different: physicians, nurses, upper-middle and upper classes.</p> \n<p>You know, that’s one of the most interesting points. Despite the permissive policy, the consumption of drugs in Germany wasn’t high, compared to the United States, as far as the comparison can be made. The Germans report an almost negligible proportion of addicts.</p> \n<p>We also know about a stimulant called Pervitin, a methamphetamine – like crystal meth in our time, say. It’s known that it was widely sold and that it was so prevalent that it became known as the “housewives’ drug.”</p> \n<p>Yes. It was legal. “Housewives’ drug” was just a marketing term. Look, in Germany, drugs weren’t perceived as something so awful. The Nazis, too, didn’t change that attitude.</p> \n<p>To the best of your knowledge, is it true that every social class used Pervitin?</p> \n<p>I know that it existed, that it was widespread. How widespread? I don’t know. There are data: how much was manufactured, how much of that was earmarked for civilian consumption and how much for military consumption.</p> \n<p>It’s known for certain that 38 million Pervitin tablets were sent to the front for the invasion of France [in 1940].</p> \n<p>It’s known that the army bought 38 million Pervitin tablets. I find it difficult to be impressed by that number. How many Wehrmacht soldiers were sent to the front? Two million. Let’s assume they took the tablets during the invasion itself, which lasted six weeks. Thirty-eight million tablets divided by two million soldiers for six weeks. How many tablets is that per soldier? Not many.</p> \n<p>What about all the stories regarding drug consumption among the Nazis’ top ranks?</p> \n<p>I’m not interested in stories. I only know what I read, in archives or in studies. At the dry factual level, only one top Nazi was a drug addict.</p> \n<p>Hermann Goering.</p> \n<p>Yes. And we also know why. [Luftwaffe chief and leading political figure Goering was wounded in the Nazis’ attempted putsch of 1923, was treated with morphine and developed an addiction.]</p> \n<p>Three years ago, the German journalist Norman Ohler published a book, “Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich.” The book made a lot of noise, in part because Ohler claims that Hitler was a junkie. I would guess that you don’t buy that theory.</p> \n<p>I think his argument is esoteric.</p> \n<p>You know that he did in-depth historical research. That he examined, for example, the prescriptions of Hitler’s private doctor, Theodor Morell, and that his finding was accepted by leading historians, such as Anthony Beevor and Ian Kershaw.</p> \n<p>I knew about Beevor, but regarding Kershaw – you surprise me. Most German historians maintained publicly that Ohler is a liar. In my view, he truly is a liar. There is something very important to notice about this book: There’s a difference between the English version and the German version. In the German version, Ohler writes, in the introduction, that he fills in the lacunae in the prescriptions to the best of his understanding.</p> \n<p>What do we know for certain?</p> \n<p>We know that Hitler met with Dr. Theodor Morell.</p> \n<p>Met? Morell treated him on a daily basis.</p> \n<p>He was his close personal physician, like many leaders have. Unfortunately for us, Morell was not a very meticulous physician and did not keep an orderly record of the many and varied substances that were administered to Hitler. One of the substances he gave him was Pervitin. How much? I don’t know. In what dosage? I don’t know. Norman Ohler doesn’t know, either.</p> \n<p>We know that Hitler received injections.</p> \n<p>That’s true.</p> \n<p>Many. Hundreds, actually, and those are only the documented ones.</p> \n<p>True.</p> \n<p>We don’t know what the injections contained. There’s a host of accounts – about stimulants, vitamins, probiotics, hormones, steroids.</p> \n<p>Only in some of the cases does documentation of the substances themselves exist. Morell didn’t bother to record what exactly he gave. There is an absolute consensus that Hitler took many medications for gas.</p> \n<p>And they say that Germans don’t have a sense of humor. Have you seen Morell’s prescriptions?</p> \n<p>Yes, but they didn’t interest me. It’s just a curiosity to me. It’s not important.</p> \n<p>What is important?</p> \n<p>Hitler was an important person. An important person, but one person. He is not the main thing. There is a whole apparatus that is doing things. There’s a general staff, generals, divisions, soldiers. There are countless&nbsp;people and countless processes that are taking place in parallel. So it’s true that he exerted an influence – and, by the way, toward the end, even that’s not so true, because he was ignored or was lied to, etc. But never mind, let’s say Hitler was addicted to drugs. What then? It’s a curiosity. It’s nice. It helps sell books. What does it tell me about the history? And if I told you that Churchill took drugs, too? His personal physician gave him stimulants. Does that change your perception of him now?</p> \n<p>Some draw a connection between the drugs that Hitler received or took and his decision-making.</p> \n<p>As Kershaw writes in his biography of Hitler, Hitler’s personality did not change after he met Morell, so it’s difficult to prove that the drugs actually influenced his personality. He was always an aggressive person. He was anti-Semitic years before he came to power. Moreover, let’s say he really was a drug addict. What does that contribute to our knowledge? Every military historian will tell you that to link his military failures to his drug habits is simply unfounded and ridiculous. Would he have behaved differently if he hadn’t taken drugs? That’s doubtful. He believed that another world war was inevitable and he believed that he would lead Germany to victory in that war.</p> \n<p>Let’s say it really isn’t important. What do you think? Was he addicted?</p> \n<p>Define “addicted.” Define “addiction.” I’ve been preoccupied with this subject for many years and I’ve read innumerable studies. To begin with, the concept of addiction is relatively new. If you’d gone to a doctor 200 years ago and told him that you were addicted to alcohol, or to opium, he wouldn’t have understood what you were talking about. He’d have advised you to talk to a priest about it.</p> \n<p>In other words, the concept was that addiction did not belong to the realm of the clinical but to the moral or ethical realm.</p> \n<p>What kind of sickness is it, if the only indication you have for it is the patient’s testimony?</p> \n<p>What do you mean? Heroin addiction has physical symptoms.</p> \n<p>Why? Let’s say you’re addicted to heroin and I lock you in a room for two weeks. You will experience withdrawal symptoms and then they’ll stop. What kind of sickness is that?</p> \n<p>So you refer only to the physical dependence on drugs. What about all the psychological mechanisms of addiction? What about the mental dependence?</p> \n<p>That too is a relative question. I have no understanding of psychology. I understand history. Historically, addiction is a new phenomenon. More than that – what is a drug, actually? I used to ask my students what an illicit drug is. In the end, somehow, they would all arrive at one definition: A drug is something that affects the brain. Well? Sugar also affects the brain. So does alcohol. In the end, it’s the law that determines what a drug is. And the law is enacted by people for political reasons. I take pseudoephedrine [Sudafed], because I have allergies. Why is that legal, but Ecstasy isn’t? There’s no clinical or scientific tool that decides for us and says: This is a drug and this isn’t. I suggest not opening the new D.S.M. [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders] or searching the World Health Organization’s website to find out what addiction is. You’ll emerge very confused.</p> \n<p>What about the destruction of the body caused by the use of hard drugs? What about overdosing? Isn’t that an indication that the drug is a drug?</p> \n<p>No. It’s poisoning. And you can also become poisoned from taking a lot of Acamol [paracetamol]. That’s no indicator. I understand that this sounds very peculiar, and the reason it sounds very peculiar is that for a great many years we’ve been told a tale about drugs and about what drugs are, and it’s an American story. It didn’t exist elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Such as in Germany, for example.</p> \n<p>Indeed. The American narrative, which is also our narrative now, draws a link between morality and drug use. Long before the invention of political correctness, addiction to drugs or alcohol was considered a moral disease. The Americans invented that term: “moral disease.” In 19th-century America, physicians refused to treat drug addicts who came to them for help. Furthermore, drugs were identified with race – the Chinese with opium, blacks with cocaine and later with crack cocaine, Hispanics with marijuana. Who entered that vacuum? The law. Anyone who dealt with drugs went to jail. In Germany, which in the 19th century was at the vanguard of the medical sciences, addiction was considered a sickness. If an addict came to a physician, the physician would say: I will treat you.</p> \n<p>Is that a threat or a promise?</p> \n<p>Yes, today it sounds a bit cruel. It was cold-turkey treatment: The individual was locked in a room for a week and allowed to go berserk while the body excreted all the toxins, and then he emerged a new person. As far as the Germans were concerned, he was healthy. We aren’t mentioning the word “mental,” because they didn’t mention it, either. It simply didn’t exist.</p> \n<p>How convenient.</p> \n<p>By the way, to be able to do this, the Nazis took the trouble to change the law. Until they came to power, the law, which was enacted in 1872, stipulated that a sick person did not bear criminal responsibility. A sick person, for this purpose, is also one who’s sick with conditions relating to the use of morphine or alcohol, and the like. That was a problematic clause, and many attempts were made to amend it, but the German governments, until the Nazi regime, simply weren’t strong enough. In the winter of 1933, the Nazis passed a law allowing them to place drug addicts in coercive hospitalization, at the public’s expense. I think that even today there aren’t many countries that are willing to treat drug addicts with such generosity.</p> \n<p>Hats off.</p> \n<p>I wasn’t being facetious. Think about it: Doctors treated addicts, and the state prosecution followed the progress of the treatment. That was so rare at the time. Maybe it still is. In my eyes, it changes something about our perception of the Nazis.</p> \n<p>Because they treated drug addicts? I’m not sure I understand.</p> \n<p>In my opinion, they truly thought they were going to make the world a better place – if you examine their actions, in the mirror of their understanding of humanity in biological terms only, in the mirror of their ambition to carry our purification in order to enhance the nation.</p> \n<p>The race.</p> \n<p>It’s one and the same to them. The race is the nation. Take note of which diseases they chose to treat, and how they treated them. For example, they chose to treat drug addicts, and at public expense, whereas people with other diseases – including alcoholics, by the way – were castrated or coercively sterilized.</p> \n<p>Because the tendency to alcoholism is genetic?</p> \n<p>Yes. But at the time it wasn’t called that, it was called a hereditary disease. The treatment is actually a derivation of the disease. Hereditary diseases, from their point of view, are not treatable. Only by extinction. In contrast, they do want to treat nonhereditary diseases, and are even willing to invest public funds for that. So, through the biological spectacles of inheritability, it’s possible to understand why some groups were perceived as enemies, while others were left alone. Let’s take a moment to make a list of all the Nazis’ enemies.</p> \n<p>Jews.</p> \n<p>What’s the problem there? What makes you a Jew?</p> \n<p>Heredity. Ditto for Gypsies, let’s say. What about communists? That’s not hereditary, as far as I know.</p> \n<p>True, but the communists aspire to equality. That’s their ideal.</p> \n<p>Equality between all the races. Heaven forbid. What about gays?</p> \n<p>Homosexuality is actually an interesting point, because homosexuals weren’t really considered a serious enemy of the Reich. The legislation against them was enacted long before the Nazis were in power. Ernst Roehm [leader of the SA Storm Troopers] was Hitler’s good friend, and Hitler had no problem with his being an open homosexual. The problem started when he needed to get rid of him. And then, after the Night of the Long Knives [June 30, 1934], persecution of homosexuals began, but again, relative to their proportion of the population, the numbers of homosexuals who were executed weren’t all that great. But the persecution of homosexuals also has a simple biological explanation: They don’t reproduce.</p> \n<p>And that’s something the Nazis didn’t like.</p> \n<p>Absolutely not. There are two more small and negligible groups that were persecuted because of loyalty problems – Freemasons and Jehovah’s Witnesses – but that’s a problem evident in many dictatorships, which don’t like secret societies. By the way, after the Jehovah’s Witnesses swore allegiance to Hitler, there was no longer any problem with them. Hereditary or not hereditary – that’s the story. If it’s hereditary, we’ll kill them; if it’s not hereditary, we’ll treat them. Drugs were never a big deal for the Germans. All the drug laws in Germany are the result of outside pressure.</p> \n<p>I think the first policy revisions occurred in the wake of World War I.</p> \n<p>That war is of vast importance in regard to drugs. Cocaine was needed as an anesthetic for performing surgery in the field. Morphine was also needed, of course. So there were immense quantities of drugs, and the countries [at war] were apprehensive that civilian consumption would deny soldiers access to the reserves of drugs. As a result, England, France and Germany passed laws to prevent the diversion of drugs to the civilian market – but the usage itself wasn’t considered criminal, at least not in Germany. In 1912, a first international agreement against drugs was signed at The Hague. Germany saw to it that without its ratification the agreement would not come into effect, and of course did not ratify it. Germany was forced to ratify it retroactively, as part of the Versailles Treaty, when the Americans and the British took advantage of Germany’s defeat to force it to diminish its role in the international drug trade.</p> \n<p>Germany, as the world’s largest drug manufacturer at the time, clearly had no interest in being part of these agreements. By the way, I found a letter in a German archive in which the country’s interior minister, Wilhelm Frick, simply reproaches Hitler and explains to him that Germany must go along with the international agreements against drugs, in order to placate the surrounding countries.</p> \n<p>So there was a certain awareness that their policy on drugs was exceptional.</p> \n<p>Yes. Of course. Look, from my point of view, one of the most jolting findings of my research is that all the drug addicts who were treated by the Nazis or by the German health authorities during the period of the Third Reich, survived.</p> \n<p>Define “survived.”</p> \n<p>The accepted method was to place addicts in a six-month treatment regimen and then release them. Everyone who underwent cold-turkey treatment remained alive at least until 1945. They survived the war and remained alive at a time when the mortality rate was particularly high. I examined a very large number of cases. In fact, all the records in Bavaria, Berlin and Brandenburg survived the war, and with the exception of one case, which wasn’t documented properly, I found no instance in which an addict was put to death by his physicians as part of the plan [Aktion T4, the Reich’s euthanasia program]. Effectively, the addicts had a higher chance of survival than any other Germans. The authorities really didn’t persecute them and didn’t kill them, but treated them.</p> \n<p>You know, even if we accept your argument that Hitler’s drug consumption was of no significance, there’s a certain importance attributable to the fact that a person who preached clean living so ardently was actually a drug addict.</p> \n<p>Hitler was an ascetic. He was proud that he stopped smoking by his own willpower, as can be read in the conversations recorded by his private secretary, Martin Bormann. Nazi Germany tried to reduce tobacco consumption among its citizens and in fact was the first modern state to begin enacting laws restricting smoking among young people. But Hitler didn’t think of imposing a total ban and he also expressed his desire to import tobacco from abroad after the war. Naturally, Nazi propaganda made use of that, juxtaposing the strong, modern, nonsmoking leaders, such as Mussolini, Hitler and Hirohito, to the obsolete, fat leaders who smoked endlessly – like Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill. That’s propaganda, not a program. During the war, Germany even supplied cigarettes to its soldiers.</p> \n<p>We in the 21st century, having been brought up on American ideology, think of drugs as something dirty, used by people on the fringes of society. That American perception was simply nonexistent in Germany. Drug addicts weren’t considered “antisocial,” not even under the Nazi regime, though [security chief Reinhard] Heydrich made a brief, unsuccessful attempt to categorize them that way. The important point is that drugs were never considered a dirty substance in Germany, so that whole question is really out of place.</p> \n<p>You know, you chose to study a very specific question, one with sensational potential. What did you learn from that question about the big picture, about German society and the processes that unfolded in it?</p> \n<p>When a comparison is drawn between the drug policy of Nazi Germany, which by any account was an appalling dictatorship, and the drug policy of the United States, the model of liberal democracy, we see that the Germans, during all periods, treated addicts better than the Americans did. Whereas the Americans simply incarcerated them, and in large numbers, the Germans chose to treat them. That stems from their different worldview. The Americans viewed addicts as immoral people who had to be imprisoned; the Germans viewed them as sick people who could be cured.</p> \n<p>Again, because the source of the addiction isn’t biological or hereditary, [the Germans felt] it should be treated. If it had been biological or hereditary, it would have been the Reich’s obligation to destroy it. Effectively, it was the Nazis’ worldview that spared the addicts’ from being exterminated. I began this research with the prevalent assumption that the Nazis persecuted drug addicts. I discovered that it just wasn’t so. For me, that sharpened the distinction between those whom we wish to help and those whom we wish to isolate and at a certain stage possibly also eliminate. That’s the key.</p> \n<p>As a result, I started to look at them a little more seriously. It’s very easy to say that the Nazis were crazy. They were not. Tens of millions of people don’t get up one morning and decide to go crazy. They were not crazy. They were human beings. This was their worldview, and appalling as it was, they believed in it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>For the first time in months, the quiet in the Gaza Strip this weekend looked like the real thing. Egyptian pressure on both sides led to a significant reduction in violence along the border during the weekly March of Return demonstrations.</p> \n<p>Many things could still go wrong, and some undoubtedly will. But for now, at least, the Egyptians have managed to move events in the right direction.</p> \n<p>The gradual reduction in violence allows for measures to improve Gaza’s dire economy. Qatar has been recruited to&nbsp;pay the salaries of Gaza’s civil servants. Islamic Jihad is sitting on the fence – and not playing spoiler as it did a week earlier. It’s even possible that the Palestinian Authority will stop trying to thwart a deal in Gaza. All this explains the Israeli government’s willingness to continue a policy of restraint even though it might do damage politically.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Why Netanyahu is willing to pay a political price for keeping Gaza talks alive | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Egyptians took an unusual step this weekend. Egyptian intelligence officials, headed by a senior general, came to Gaza and patrolled the sites of the demonstrations. An Egyptian official also came to Israel.</p> \n<p>On Friday Hamas, under the guests’ watchful eyes, deployed its security forces a few hundred meters west of the border fence to prevent the demonstrators from getting near it. The Israel Defense Forces also evidently exercised greater restraint. Unusually for the past several months, no Palestinians were killed and only a handful were wounded by sniper fire, though dozens suffered from tear gas inhalation.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, all the Palestinian factions are due to meet in Gaza to discuss the Egyptian proposals. Hamas’ demonstrated desire to reach an agreement may also be linked to the fact that Islamic Jihad challenged it by firing rockets and mortar shells at Israel a week ago, and afterward by holding demonstrations outside the homes of senior Hamas officials. If Hamas doesn’t seal a deal soon, it could lose control of events.</p> \n<p>For now, Islamic Jihad isn’t openly opposing the emerging agreement. The organization that’s openly opposing any deal with Israel, even an indirect one, is the relatively small Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.</p> \n<p>Arab media outlets have begun reporting details of the agreement, though Israel’s government has offered no information about it to its own citizens (and has even denied any involvement). The goal is a three-year cease-fire. The reduction in violence would enable more significant measures to improve Gaza’s economy, including expanding fishing zones, opening the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, and allowing more Palestinians to enter Israel.</p> \n<p>The Palestinians have once again raised an old idea – letting 5,000 Gazans work in Israeli communities near Gaza. This proposal was raised after the 2014 Gaza war, but was vehemently opposed by the Shin Bet security service for fear that it would be exploited to carry out terror attacks. Thus it’s hard to believe it will actually be implemented now, and certainly not in the agreement’s first stage.</p> \n<p>Later on the deal also calls for large infrastructure projects like a port and airport, the news reports say.</p> \n<p>These reports have upset the families of the two Israeli soldiers whose bodies are being held by Hamas. On Friday, Lt. Hadar Goldin’s parents met with IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot and released a statement that claimed to quote him. The IDF was forced to take the unusual step of issuing a semi-denial.</p> \n<p>The family said the IDF opposes the deal. Eisenkot’s position is almost the diametric opposite. He considers an agreement desirable but thinks its final stage – large infrastructure projects – shouldn’t be implemented without resolving the problem of the soldiers’ bodies and the missing civilians held by Hamas.</p> \n<p>Qatar has emerged as a key player because any deal depends on its agreement to finance civil servants’ salaries in Gaza and buy fuel for the territory for a substantial period of time. The Qataris may be hoping to reap an additional benefit from this.</p> \n<p>For more than a year, Qatar has been under blockade by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But Qatar’s assistance in Gaza may spur the United States and Europe to pressure the Saudis, who are already in deep trouble over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, to resolve the quarrel that led them to impose the blockade.</p> \n<p>The IDF has drawn three main conclusions from the events of the past weekend. First, when Hamas wants to, it can stop the violence. Second, Hamas indeed is interested in a deal right now. And third, there is now an opportunity to restore the situation along the Gaza border to what it was before March 30, when the March of Return demonstrations began.</p> \n<p>From a military standpoint, even though residents of communities near Gaza feel that their security has been eroded, the army has basically fulfilled its mission. Masses of Palestinians didn’t succeed in breaking through the border fence, and no Israeli civilians were hurt due to the demonstrations. (One Israeli soldier, Staff Sgt. Aviv Levi, was killed by Palestinian sniper fire during the protests.)</p> \n<p>But from a strategic standpoint, the outcome may well look very different. If Hamas achieves an agreement as a direct result of the diverse types of violence it has employed – from firing rockets to trying to send masses of Palestinians across the border – it will have significantly improved its position. Not only will the blockade of Gaza be eased, but Egypt, the United Nations, Qatar and effectively the entire international community will have begun treating it as a legitimate partner rather than demanding that anything done in Gaza be done via the Palestinian Authority.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When Maya Zinshtein was named winner of an Emmy award last month for her debut film “Forever Pure,” she was fast asleep. The Israeli filmmaker was so certain she wouldn’t win that she’d decided not to fly to America for the ceremony. She even put her phone on silent. The next morning, when she sleepily reached for her phone and saw two messages congratulating her on the win, she rubbed her eyes in disbelief.</p> \n<p>“It seemed very unlikely that we’d win the Emmy,” she says with a laugh. “I admit that the thought of traveling all that way just to hear ‘no’ is what led to my decision to stay home, because in Israel we didn’t receive an Ophir Prize,” she notes, referring to the Israeli equivalent of an Oscar. “And even though ‘Forever Pure’ was nominated in eight categories by the Israeli Documentary Filmmakers Forum, we ultimately didn’t win anything. The fact that I went to sleep just goes to show how much I was trying to protect myself.”</p> \n<p>“Forever Pure” looks at the relationship between the Beitar Jerusalem soccer club and its hardcore group of fans called La Familia, known for aggressive and racist behavior. The film has been acquired by Netflix and by numerous broadcasters around the world, screened at festivals and awarded a prize for documentary editing at the Jerusalem Film Festival. It has also brought much attention to its creator. But Zinshtein was still keeping expectations low. “We were up against some major films [such as the Frontline documentary ‘Bannon’s War’], but in the end, when I won the Emmy I was sleeping.”</p> \n<p>“Forever Pure,” Zinshtein’s debut film (the title is taken from a slogan of the team’s fans) brings to the screen a concentrated dose of racism. It follows the 2012-2013 season during which the owner at the time, Russian oligarch Arcadi Gaydamak, brought in two Chechen Muslim players, Zaur&nbsp;Sadayev&nbsp;and Dzhabrail Kadiyev. Their arrival spurred a violent response. Beitar fans from La Familia shouted racist epithets, rained curses on team captain Ariel Harush, and protested outside the home of the team’s chairman Itzik Kornfein, cursing him and his wife. When Sadayev scored a goal for Beitar, the fans got up and left the stadium. Then they boycotted the team’s matches and set fire to the club headquarters in the Bayit Vegan neighborhood of Jerusalem, and drew many followers.</p> \n<p>The film follows all of these events as the season unfolds, tracking what happened to those who supported the club and its Chechen players, in tandem with the rise of a player who supported La Familia and its protest. Zinshtein also lets Gaydamak’s voice be heard. The oligarch, who bought an ownership share of the club in 2005 and held it for five years, later admitted he had done so to bolster his chances of being elected mayor of Jerusalem. In the film Gaydamak says that he knew that signing the Muslim players would cause an uproar and claims he did so deliberately in order to reveal the racist face of Israeli society.</p> \n<p>The La Familia organization was not born in the 2012-2013 season, though it has admittedly gained notoriety in recent years for its prominent presence at right-wing demonstrations and violent actions at sporting events.When Gaydamak purchased the club in 2005, La Familia was already a violent, far-right organization even for the highly political Beitar. Still, Zinshtein captured La Familia at a particularly sensitive moment, when its influence began spreading from the soccer playing field to the national political playing field.</p> \n<p>The kernel of the film started with a segment for the investigative reporting program “Uvda” (“Fact”). Zinshtein, who was working for the show then, was assigned to follow the Chechen players for a few hours on their first day in Israel. She almost turned down the assignment because the pay was so low. After four days of filming, and after a friend, director Ido Haar, advised her to keep following the story “and stop working for others and start working for yourself,” she decided to make the film. “I spent four days there finishing the segment. It was aired, but I knew that the story was just beginning. I went to [club chairman] Itzik Kornfein and I said to him, ‘Something big is happening here, I think a movie should be made about it.’ He said, ‘That’s an interesting idea. Can you recommend anyone?,” she laughs. “I recommended myself. It was a real lesson – Life sometimes gives you opportunities and you have to grab them. Then Itzik Kornfein asked me, ‘OK, so what are the conditions?’ and the journalist in me said: ‘Total openness.’ Then he asked, ‘When do I get to see the film?’ And I said, ‘At the premiere.’ He took a little time to think it over and then he agreed, but told me I would have to convince the Chechens.”</p> \n<p>I imagine you had to convince La Familia too. </p> \n<p>“No, because in this season I had to choose sides, and I chose from the start to be with the club. The side of the fans and the side of the club were opposed, and it was never meant to be a film about fans. But still it wasn’t like Kornfein gave me the okay and then I could walk right into the locker room. In the film it seems like they just opened the doors to me and I walked right into Beitar. That’s because I believe that the viewer doesn’t need to know about all the problems I had behind the scenes. In reality, I showed up with approval from Itzik Kornfein but the coach Eli Cohen looked at me and said, ‘What are you doing here?’ So I kept returning time after time.”</p> \n<p>Getting back to La Familia. That was obviously not an easy experience.</p> \n<p>“There was something unbelievable in the level of hatred, in the emotions that it brings out in people, and yes the verbal violence. And standing among this group are also young children who are shouting these same things. I think that stunned me more than anything. Seeing the youth that are part of this thing. It scares me because that’s our future as a society. That’s one reason I’ve been taking this movie to schools and after each screening there’s a discussion with the students. Because ‘Forever Pure’ is an amazing lesson on how racism can break up a group or a society from within. These are very powerful encounters, because it’s not so unusual for some of the teens to be involved with La Familia. And the discussion with them is fascinating and shows that a shift in mindset is possible.”</p> \n<p>In 2013, Zinshtein was still far from this insight. After four months of documenting the season from the vantage point of the club whose fans rose up against it and determined who would play for the team and who wouldn’t, she wasn’t sure where she would go from there. “And then the Chechen players left,” as La Familia had demanded, “and I was left with all this material but I didn’t yet know what I had there, if I really had anything.”</p> \n<p>Influence of The Guardian</p> \n<p>It’s a little odd to hear this from someone whose film tells its story with the power of a punch to the gut, but Zinshtein apparently wasn’t fully aware of her film’s potential impact. In late 2015, while working on the editing, with expenses getting hard to bear, she and her production partner Geoff Arbourne decided to start a crowdfunding campaign. In order to promote it, they agreed to a proposal from the British newspaper The Guardian to broadcast a 10-minute edited excerpt. Zinshtein says this turned out to have a major unexpected effect on the film and on her life.</p> \n<p>“I was in the midst of editing, in the midst of chaos, we felt stuck, but we’d made the commitment to The Guardian so we had to do it and we thought it could aid the fundraising campaign,” she says. “We edited the film in London and I remember the editor said to me, ‘You know, you’re a brave woman,’ and I replied, ‘Tomorrow we’ll see whether I’m brave or stupid.’ I thought about a million terrible scenarios that could happen, about the subjects and how they might react. I braced myself, but still I really never thought that La Familia would go nuts about me. Before the movie was out at all, I didn’t really understand how volatile this stuff is. I know that sounds hard to believe, but maybe if I’d realized it then it wouldn’t have happened.”</p> \n<p>The short clip went on The Guardian home page and stayed there for one day. It got two million views and became the most-read story in the left-leaning paper known for its criticism of Israel. Zinshtein thought it wouldn’t get much attention in Israel, and figured that the story of the Chechen players was old news by then. She was mistaken.</p> \n<p>She soon began receiving threats from fans associated with La Familia. She ignored them until, one evening, she received a different type of letter. “The person who wrote it had done very thorough background research on me; he cited old articles that I’d written. The text was: ‘You don’t know us Beitar fans. You are one and we are many and soon you will learn the power of the many. If you’re lucky, your life will end suddenly.’ It was horrible.”</p> \n<p>The letter writer, Avi Agam -- a fitness trainer who was later convicted of threatening Zinshtein and, in a plea bargain, sentenced to do community service -- also inundated Zinshtein and her mother with phone calls and threatening text messages, forcing her to leave her home for several days. “I was in total hysteria. I wasn’t a public figure of any kind and suddenly I was thrust to center stage. He didn’t stop calling for three days straight.”</p> \n<p>Zinshtein ultimately decided on a surprising response to the threats. She returned to Israel and through Barak Cohen, the lawyer for the organization, requested a meeting with the fans. “I met with the group of La Familia fans that led the protest shown in the film. It was an incredible meeting on several levels. Suddenly there was a dialogue and I learned from them.”</p> \n<p>What did you learn? </p> \n<p>“There are things that got into the film, in its current version, because of that connection. I told them from the start that I wasn’t taking anything out of the film, but that if I was mistaken about something, or if I missed something, I’d be glad to add to it. An amazing discussion ensued. One thing that came up was the sign that was held up in the stands in protesting the signing of the Chechen players: ‘Beitar Forever Pure.’ That moment when the sign was held aloft was a key moment and that’s where the title of the film came from. And one of the fans said to me: ‘That sign wasn’t new. It had been held up in the past and no one made a big deal out of it.’</p> \n<p>“That was a real shock for me. Turns out the sign had been waved in 2008, five years before the Chechen players arrived. The fan had no trouble finding a picture of it and for weeks we tried together to figure out which game it was at, to try to find video of the sign from then. It was a little research project we did together. I felt it was important because it was a way to show how the ‘No Arabs’ thing was already quite rooted in Beitar years before and how the story of the Chechens just brought it out. I still think it’s one of the strongest bits in the film.”</p> \n<p>This first meeting led to a series of encounters that took place at various screenings of the film. At a screening at the Tel Aviv cinematheque, a group of fans arrived all charged up and left in a different mood. The way Zinshtein handled the encounter was admirable. Despite the aggressive tone directed at her, she came across as fearless. “This happened after a lot of preparation. I met with people and spoke with people -- there was a serious effort,” she says. “I had a lot of fear and there were conversations where I told them that they’d gone crazy, and how could they threaten my mother. It was a journey and a huge lesson. You have to come with humility if you aim to make movies about worlds that you’re not a part of. You have to be humble and come and listen.”</p> \n<p>So that’s how you stopped being afraid and learned to love the La Familia fans? </p> \n<p>“Even if in the end these people didn’t find their way into the film, I saw that there is a whole spectrum of people who are connected to La Familia, and some of them changed over the years.”</p> \n<p>From the outside it tends to seem that they’re all the same.</p> \n<p>“I don’t want to relate to the fans as a single bloc, or to the members of La Familia. They are made up of a whole mix of people, with a wide range of occupations and social backgrounds, and this organization gives them all a strong sense of belonging. For teenagers, it can sometimes be like the Scouts, only cooler. And that’s the big danger, of course. You have to be very strong to pull yourself out of it and change direction. So there are still many who despite a good deal of discussion have kept the same views, and then there are those whom I could see were changing. Before they were uncompromising and now they’ve started to ask questions and even to change their views about whether Arabs or Muslims can play for Beitar.</p> \n<p>“I think that for me, what happened in these meetings was that the human mass called La Familia became names and faces. I had long talks with some of them and I discovered people with life stories that I could find points of identification with. I’m certain that this seeped into the movie and made it more complex. By the way, looking back on it now, I think there was something justified about the fans’ anger over after the segment in The Guardian. The segment wasn’t good. It wasn’t complex enough.”</p> \n<p>Still, there’s a reason why La Familia has such a notorious reputation. It’s an ideological group that chose a sports team and not vice-versa.</p> \n<p>“In the course of my research for the film, I met with Dr. Yair Galili [a professor of applied sociology and communications], trying to understand the story I was telling. We met near the end of the filming, at a point when it was clear that La Familia was going to score a big victory over the club, and he said it would be very interesting to see what they made of this victory going forward. There’s a sociological theory that says sport is not a mirror of society but rather an early reflection of a society’s path. Go to the soccer field and you’ll see what’s about to happen to a certain society. What happened is that in wake of their victory over the club they set their gaze beyond the field too. “And then we saw their support for Elor Azaria,” says Zinshtein, referring to the Israeli soldier who was convicted of shooting to death an incapacitated Palestinian assailant. “We saw La Familia shirts at every right-wing demonstration, and at demonstrations against the alternative Remembrance Day [a joint Palestinian-Israeli ceremony of bereaved families from both sides]. These are the same people, in soccer and in politics. In this sense, that season was significant as a before-and-after watershed moment.”</p> \n<p>A lot of La Familia’s messages seem to have gained a kind of acceptance in recent years.</p> \n<p>“There has been an increase in extremism and I truly believe in the idea that sports anticipates the direction of the country. It’s hard to say what feeds what. Is it that after the prime minister warns that ‘Arabs are going to the polls in droves,’ the guy from La Familia feels that it’s okay because even the prime minister is saying this sort of thing. Or is it that after the atmosphere becomes more extremist, the prime minister echoes the same messages. I think it’s a reciprocal process, with the messages echoing in both directions.”</p> \n<p>Freedom of expression in Israel</p> \n<p>Even now – when she is at work on a second film, also on a sensitive subject, one that straddles the seam between religion, big money, politics and foreign influence – Zinshtein still keeps a Beitar scarf at home, and it’s hard to imagine a more incongruent item in her wardrobe. Red-haired and attractive, she likes to dress in clothes that harken from another era. Watching her, in a puffy dress, discussing soccer with diehard fans at that screening in Tel Aviv, was visually as well as ideologically jarring. She is 37 and her family made aliyah when she was ten. They came from Nizhny Novgorod, Russia’s third-largest city, straight to Kibbutz Beit Hashita.“The funny thing is that Gaydamak also ended up there. Like the song says, we two are from the same village.”</p> \n<p>After the army she worked as part of the team that set up the Russian-language Channel 9. She produced three movies and a series there. Then she became a producer at Haaretz before going on to become a researcher for Uvda – which led to “Forever Pure,” a film she initially financed herself.</p> \n<p>Culture Minister Miri Regev didn’t call to congratulate you on the win?</p> \n<p>“No, and it’s a little insulting, not nice even. She has an amazing ability to get the things she wants done -- she’s a bulldozer, she never stops.”</p> \n<p>The Loyalty in Culture Law she recently passed pretty much explains why she hasn’t called, doesn’t it? What did you think about it? </p> \n<p>“Well, first of all – any attempt to paint ‘Forever Pure’ as an anti-Israel film is ridiculous. The movie received a commendation from Yad Vashem! It said it was an important movie that documents ‘dangerous forces that threaten Israel’s Jewish and democratic values.’ And that’s just the thing. Judging everything on the basis of ‘you’re either with us or against us’ is so simplistic. I have a lot of friends in Russia who are always envious of me that I live and work in a country in which freedom of expression is one of the strongest values. In Israel there is a multitude of voices, and even if I don’t agree with them all, I want to live in a country where these voices can be heard. I want to keep on working and creating here and keep telling stories that look reality right in the eye. I don’t think it’s the government’s job to draw those kinds of boundaries for us.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Winter in prehistoric southeastern France was brutal and the living was not easy for Neanderthal children. Their growth was constrained in the cold months, apparently by sheer illness, and on top of that they were exposed to lead, a groundbreaking analysis of their teeth has concluded.</p> \n<p>“Decades of research have shown that there is no safe level for lead in humans and other animals,” the researchers observe in Science Advances.</p> \n<p>The last half-million years have been marked by extreme swings between freezing glacial troughs and warmer periods, called interglacials. During one of these interglacials 250,000 years ago, as primitive pre-sapiens hominins reached Britain over land bridges, Neanderthals were thronging Payre, a site in the south of France.</p> \n<p>Daytime and summer temperatures may have been balmy. But the winters were onerous and made the children, if not everyone, badly sick, archaeologists have concluded from the analysis of teeth from two Neanderthal minors.</p> \n<p>The study published in Science Advances broke ground in analyzing prehistoric tooth enamel to reconstruct climate, chemical exposure and nutrition. They could do this because teeth, just like trees, have growth rings. During childhood a new layer forms every day, using the chemicals available in the body, the food and the air. Like tree rings, our teeth can tell a story about previous conditions during childhood development.</p> \n<p>Take oxygen, for instance: In warm weather, lighter oxygen-16 isotopes evaporate more readily than heavier oxygen-18. The enamel on our teeth builds up using the seasonally varying isotopes – so we can infer when a given layer was laid down.</p> \n<p>Barium is another telltale mineral. Teeth from Homo sapiens kiddies and captive macaques, whose dietary history is known, have shown that barium distributions accurately reflect the transition from breast to solid food.</p> \n<p>So: One of the French Neanderthal children seems to have nursed heavily for a year and a half, then to have been gradually weaned until eschewing the breast entirely at 2.5 years.</p> \n<p>A separate study had tested a 100,000-year-old Neanderthal infant found in Belgium and concluded that it nursed for about a year and two months. But the Belgian baby did not have the hallmarks of gradual weaning (a progressive decline in enamel barium) like the French children did. The Belgian baby seems to have abruptly been transferred to solid foods, so the Payre child seems more indicative of the Neanderthal norm.</p> \n<p>In that, modern humans seem akin to Neanderthals. Preindustrial modern humans also nursed the kids for about two and a half years, says the paper, which was written by an international research team with biological anthropologists, archaeologists, earth scientists and environmental exposure experts.</p> \n<p>Despite the theories that Neanderthals were spectacularly evolved for the cold, in fact, they didn’t live in particularly cold areas – and the story of the Neanderthal children’s teeth suggests that they got horribly sick, and/or starved. One of the children suffered heightened skeletal remineralization during the heart of winter, a hallmark of extreme weight loss.</p> \n<p>The lead exposure wouldn’t have caused defects in enamel layering that the scientists found. But severe illness could.</p> \n<p>Also, the exposures to lead were both brief and clearly associated with cold weather. Either that or the Neanderthals consumed contaminated food or water, which can happen; or they inhaled lead molecules from fires. (It has not been proven that Neanderthals knew how to make fire purposely, but they did know how to utilize it.)</p> \n<p>“Traditionally, people thought lead exposure occurred in populations only after industrialization. But these results show it happened prehistorically, before lead had been widely released into the environment,” said one of the study’s lead authors, Dr. Christine Austin, assistant professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.</p> \n<p>The isotope analysis of the enamel layers also led to the postulation that at least one baby had been born in spring – a time in which many a mammal procreates because the living is easy, and so on.</p> \n<p>The team also deduced that both kids did badly in winter. They got sick. One had a marked developmental defect in the enamel that persisted for a week, during the height of winter. The other had two defects, created in winter and fall.</p> \n<p>The researchers admit their study size of two is a tad small to make generalizations, but the results are intriguing.</p> \n<p>Separate research has indicated that in contrast to our direst suspicions, humans didn't kill off the Neanderthals. It was, after all, climate change leading to cold drought, and at most, we moved into the caves they vacated with their demise.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some 248,000 years after the Neanderthals lived in France and breathed or ate lead, the same metal would be speculatively fingered as a cause for the collapse of the Roman Empire. Not realizing its toxic properties, the ancient Romans not only made face powder from it, but medicines and water pipes – efficiently poisoning themselves, the theory goes. It remains to be proven that the lead was a key cause. Meanwhile, the levels to which these French Neanderthals were naturally exposed were much lower, yet still discernible.</p>",

In the spirit of Yom Kippur, lingering after the gates have closed, I want to acknowledge my responsibility here.</p> \n<p>Let’s start with the Kotel, a place that should unite - not divide - all Jews. Several key leaders here today met with me for four years. The agreement we reached at that time reflected compromise on all sides.</p> \n<p>But change is hard, and the Kotel, which symbolizes so much, both religiously and historically, took on the weight of the very definition of Jewishness.</p> \n<p>Today I am announcing that my government will institute the negotiated agreement, as approved by my cabinet. The message is simple: Let there be &quot;One Wall for One People.&quot;</p> \n<p>I cherish my political brit with the Haredi parties. They have been my political partners and I hope that relationship will continue, but I believe we reached a fair compromise regarding the Kotel - and I believe the Haredi parties will accept my decision, if I remain firm in its implementation.</p> \n<p>A prayer space along the southern part of the Wall will be fully accessible and visible to all. A pluralistic oversight council will ensure all Jews will be able to pray there, and rejoice in a Jerusalem that lives in all our hearts.</p> \n<p>We will work closely with our Reform and Conservative partners, the Federations, and the Jewish Agency. And we won’t stop there. Conversion, freedom to marry, and equitable funding for all the streams of Judaism will be next.</p> \n<p>It simply makes no sense that the only nation disenfranchising the largest segment of practicing Jewry in the world is the Jewish state.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Divorcing the Diaspora: How Netanyahu Is Finally Writing Off U.S. Jews</p> \n<p>Perhaps we have something to learn from the religious streams, and from you. Let’s not forget that halakhah itself was refined in the ancient, revered academies in Babylon at a time when Jewish life in the Diaspora thrived.</p> \n<p>Contrary to, shall we say, the ill-advised pronouncements of members of my cabinet, Jewish life in the Diaspora is thriving today, especially in North America.</p> \n<p>Now, on to the issue of democracy.

It’s Terrifying</p> \n<p>I believe this law is an important one that expresses the recognition by all of us that Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people. I also know, however, that there are many concerns among Israelis, North American Jews, and other friends and allies. Let’s re-examine the law and clearly anchor the principle of equality in the basic laws of Israel, recalling our own Declaration of Independence that guarantees minority rights.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And, let me say something about BDS. We are a strong enough people to handle criticism and open dialogue. In this spirit, I’ve ordered security forces to prevent entrance to Israel only when a security threat is clearly present. Our open borders are the best answer to the evil trend of BDS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Thank you for your partnership in the struggle against this movement and against its delegitimization of the Zionist ideal.

        "text":["<p>It’s an irresistible narrative. The young and liberal-minded scion of a despotic regime comes to the throne with exciting ideas for opening up the kingdom he is about to inherit. Only it almost never quite works out that way. Power is almost never given up voluntarily and the deceptive ease of conducting state affairs without the need for consultation or due process almost always entraps the heir.</p> \n<p>Since this piece is being published while details of Jamal Khashoggi’s apparent killing and dismemberment (not necessarily in that order) in the Saudi Kingdom’s Istanbul consulate are still emerging, the above description could apply to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, whose men were allegedly involved in the inconvenient journalist’s demise. But it is equally apt for describing the acclamation for another thirty-something who came to power in the Middle East, holding on to his father’s coattails and the very slow awakening to his true nature.</p> \n<p>The Dauphin of the House of Assad was just as eagerly awaited when he came to power in Damascus at the age of 34, just one year older than MBS is now. He was the Western-educated doctor who had studied ophthalmology in London, who apparently chose to be an eye doctor because he hated the sight of blood. He also - get this - used the internet. Bashar Assad wasn’t just young and hip, he had a beautiful wife, lionized in a gushing interview (since expunged from the web) by Vogue as a “Rose in the Desert.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Khashoggi's dismembered body lands at Trump's White House&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Why the Khashoggi murder is a disaster for Israel&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>No matter that there were no tangible signs of any meaningful easing of repression in Syria under Assad Junior, he continued to be described in Western media as “reform-minded” and hosted by world leaders, together with the glamorous Asma, for nearly eleven years, until the blood-soaked suppression of the Syrian revolution became impossible to ignore.</p> \n<p>Even then, when over a quarter of a million corpses had piled up in Syria, some Westerners tried to make excuses for him. As late as December 2015, in an interview with the New Yorker Magazine, U.S. State Secretary John Kerry still surmised that poor Bashar had been forced by his mother and brother to crack down on the protestors.</p> \n<p>The forlorn hope of Western politicians and journalists that incoming hereditary absolute dictators will be more enlightened rulers than their fathers was based on no more evidence than the fact that they’re younger, better-educated and can make small-talk in English. This narrative isn’t just a product of Orientalism. There were ostensibly good reasons to hope for an improvement under kings and presidents who had a better idea of the advantages of an open, freer society.</p> \n<p>Explained:&nbsp;Will the Khashoggi 'murder' bring down Saudi’s Crown Prince?&nbsp;| Explained:&nbsp;Behind the Saudi Crown Prince’s carefully managed image lurks a dark side</p> \n<p>It wasn’t a foregone conclusion that under MBS’ suzerainty, repression of dissidents would swiftly intensify. Or that in just seven years of civil war in Syria, Assad Junior’s forces would butcher far more of his country’s citizens than his fearsome father Hafez had murdered in three decades. But there was no reason to believe it was impossible either. Genocidal tyrants are humans too. Stalin’s love of Hollywood movies and Hitler’s vegetarianism didn’t curb their bloodlust any more than Kim Jong-Un’s NBA obsession has led to him to improve the lives of his subjugated people.</p> \n<p>But as with Kim, there was an expectation that the new generation of despots - crown-princes who had spent time living in the West - would somehow blend what they had learned at their father’s knee with more moderate practices. In conjunction with the elevation of MBS to rank of Crown Prince, not yet the ultimate ruler but in charge in all but title, a generation of crown princes has come to the fore in the Middle East. By and large, they haven’t ushered in a new era of even relative democracy.</p> \n<p>Most of the region is now ruled by university educated crown princes with a Western orientation, but this hasn’t changed their style of rule. Only the PR has improved.</p> \n<p>MBS didn’t invent anything with his, now squandered, charm-offensive. He had his recently elevated neighboring Persian Gulf role-models: the similarly acronymized MBZ - Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi, since the de-facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, and his rival Tamim bin Hamad, the 38-year-old Emir of Qatar. Both have been engaged in their own PR campaigns in the West, using their nations’ oil wealth to build up a facade of cultural and academic enterprises in partnership with the most prestigious institutes in the West. These academic institutions are all happy to accept the Gulf money and disregard the total lack of democracy and the consistent human-rights violations. And then of course there’s the Emirati and Qatari investment in top European soccer clubs.</p> \n<p>Occasionally, the bleak reality is seen through the cracks. A case in point is the reports on the hundreds of deaths of Asian laborers toiling under inhumane conditions to build the stadiums and hotels for Qatar’s grandiose FIFA 2022 tournament. And while it’s the Saudis who have attracted most of the criticism for the conduct of the bloody war in Yemen, it is infrequently mentioned that the UAE is their partner there. This week, Buzzfeed published an investigation into the hiring of American mercenaries by the UAE to fight in Yemen. But these are exceptions to the rule. In general, MBZ and the Emir know how to keep a lid on the more unpleasant aspects of their regimes. MBS still has to learn from them how not to overstep.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, the crown princes of Jordan have also managed to stay in the good books of the West, without making meaningful reform. King Abdullah of Jordan has shown he is no less of a survival artist than his father King Hussein. For all the talk of a “democratization” process and “constitutional evolution” in Jordan, Abdullah has relinquished none of the power in his kingdom, the elected parliament is largely a sham and while the security forces have not suppressed demonstrations with violence, it is partly due to the protestors knowing their limits. They protest against the “government”, not the king, and go home quietly after a couple of hours. Meanwhile, Abdullah’s 24 year-old son, the next Crown Prince Hussein, is being groomed and constantly presented to his subjects by his father’s side. Recently, an action-packed video was released, with Abdullah and Hussein, in slick combat fatigues, bursting out of a car, blazing away with assault rifles.</p> \n<p>Another young(ish) king putting on a good show of “democratizing” is Mohammed VI of Morocco. In the first years after the Arab Spring of 2011, he announced “constitutional reforms” followed by elections in which the Islamists won. He even spoke of power-sharing, but didn’t actually relinquish much of that power. If the continuing violent protests on the streets of Casablanca and the thousands leaving by sea in the hope of reaching Europe is anything to go by, not much has changed in Morocco either. But he still gets points for being a reformist.</p> \n<p>Even non-monarchical countries in the region have their dysfunctional political dynasties. Lebanon’s Saad Hariri, son of the martyred Rafic, may have avoided assassination, and unlike Khashoggi, emerged in one piece after being incarcerated in Riyadh last year on MBS’ orders, but he is prime minister of Lebanon only in name. He has had no functioning coalition since the parliamentary election five months ago, and his country is effectively ruled by the Lebanese army and Hezbollah. That didn’t stop him from being described for years in the media as “Lebanon’s future.”</p> \n<p>It’s tempting to blame Donald Trump, a ruler with his own Crown Princess Ivanka and Crown Prince Jared, of having acted as MBS’ “enabler.” The administration’s foreign policy, such as it is, has certainly been based on the Saudis' to an unprecedented degree. But none of his predecessors, or any other Western leaders for that matter, have remained any different. They all bought in to the myth of the reforming heir and that myth will persist. No one can resist the glowing testimonials of these Western-minded young men (of course, they’re always men). You can bet that pretty soon a great fuss will be made over the suave Berat Albayrak, Turkey’s 40 year-old Finance Minister and more importantly, the son-in-law and by all signs heir apparent of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Did you hear he got an MBA at an American college?</p> \n<p>Assad went too far. He will be shunned for his war-crimes for the foreseeable future, though thanks to Iran and Russia, he is secure in his palace. And MBS will have to take a time-out, while the West goes through a thorough ritual condemnation of Khashoggi’s murder. But no one is about to seriously mess with a kingdom that can tomorrow drive the price of oil up to 400 dollars a barrel. In a couple of years, perhaps sooner, the Crown Prince will be back and we’ll be reading serious columnists on how he’s “grown up” and learned his limitations. All he has to do is wait a bit and learn from his colleagues that to maintain the reformer’s myth, you just need to repress your subjects with a bit more subtlety.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Zionism developed as a colonialist movement. Today it is forbidden to speak of it, but that was not always the case. I’m not talking about a few bleeding-heart liberals who raised “The Hidden Question” on the dispossession of the Arabs, but about the main leaders of Zionism who wrote of it in simple terms and saw it as an unavoidable necessity. David Ben-Gurion, writes Tom Segev in his new biography of the first prime minister, claimed in a meeting of the Provisional Executive Committee for General Zionist Affairs in 1919, “There is no need at all for Mustafa to know Hebrew. … In practice, he doesn’t care at all if the Jewish farmer who is exploiting the Arab worker knows Arabic, nor whether the Arab who kills the Jew knows Hebrew.” (From “A State at all Costs – The Story of David Ben-Gurion, page 156, in Hebrew)</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel is a Settler Colonial State - and that's OK&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>And here is how the young Moshe Dayan writes about the brawl that broke out between the young men of Nahalal and the those of the neighboring Bedouin tribe, during which a young Bedouin man named Wahed, who was a friend of Dayan’s, hit him in the head: “For generations the Bedouin have habitually grazed their flocks in these wadis and watered their sheep in the springs that have now become our property. As far as I’m concerned this was redemption of the land, but in Wahed’s eyes things looked differently. They were told to remove their tents from the wadi where their fathers and ancestors lived.” (Mordechai Bar-On, “Moshe Dayan: Israel’s Controversial Hero,” page 25, from the Hebrew)</p> \n<p>Alexander Yakobson and Amnon Rubinstein write ironically against the historians who see Zionism as colonialism: Zionism was a colonialist phenomenon in every way, similar to other colonialist phenomena – except for it being a national movement which was not motivated by an aspiration for economic gain, one that stemmed from Jewish distress and was fulfilled by people who could be described as refugees because the settlers did not have a colonial motherland, and the connection with the Land of Israel was part of the historic and traditional identity of the Jewish people.” (“Israel and the Family of Nations: The Jewish Nation-State and Human Rights,” page 96, from the Hebrew.)</p> \n<p>But they are twice mistaken. First, in not differentiating between the colonialism of the powers (the British Empire, for example) and colonialism of settlement; and second, because they assume one “pure” colonial model, and then they claim the local model is inappropriate. But in practice, in various nations – the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Algeria, Rhodesia and other countries – the colonialism of settlement had different points of origin, different motivations and different ideologies. What is shared by all of them is the arrival of settlers from the outside, with a story of chosenness and purpose that leads to the dispossession of the local population.</p> \n<p>Zionism may have been a national movement that gave birth to a colonial project, and not the opposite, but if we divert our view for just a moment from the justifications and internal logic of that process, the outlines of the colonialism of settlement are exposed. In all of the well-known cases – beyond the ideological justifications, the nature of the group and the type of connections with the imperial regime – the settlement groups had aspirations to establish a sovereign political entity of their own, in which the natives would not have a part. The justifications and ideological underpinnings, as strong and ancient as they may be, do not change the patterns of relations and the practical reality. The natives expelled from their land do not care about the justifications of those dispossessing them, even if they are brilliant. The fact that Zionism was other things too, for example a movement of anti-colonial national liberation against the British, as historians such as Derek Penslar stress, did not aid the Palestinian natives.</p> \n<p>There is nothing new in any of this. Critical historians and sociologists have claimed this at least since Gershon Shafir’s book, “Land, Labor and the Origins of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, 1882-1914,” came out in the late 1980s, and have debated the counterclaim, that the Zionist case is different and unique. But if that is the case, why is such a claim still taboo in the Zionist discourse? Why does saying it make you an outcast? This is not a rhetorical question. Every book of American history begins with the recognition of the colonial past of the United States. For example, the new book by historian Jill Lepore, “These Truths: A History of the United States,” opens with the following statistics: Between the 16th and 19th centuries, 2.5 million people from Europe immigrated to the American continent, they brought with them, by force, 12 million Africans, and in doing so caused the deaths of some 50 million natives in various ways. This does not prevent the book from celebrating America’s achievements – the rule of the people, a revolutionary constitution and battle for freedoms – and becoming an overnight best-seller read by countless American patriots (who, one can assume, will remain patriots even after they read the chapters on colonialism).</p> \n<p>So why not here in Israel too? The reasons is not only the time that has passed; after all, we are willing to argue about other episodes of oppression that occurred 50 and 60 years ago. Neither is it a question of the refugees, because it does not involve the issue of 1948 at all and is not about a specific solution either, but is about the very essence of recognizing the injustices done to the local residents from the beginning of Zionist settlement.</p> \n<p>The issue here is not in the historical minutia and not in the exposure of the original sin or the efforts of delegitimization. It is about our future. If there is something we have learned from the struggles of excluded groups, it is that the path to rectification and reconciliation comes through recognizing the injustices.</p> \n<p>The reason for the denial is to be found elsewhere: In order to recognize the colonial past, we need to see it as the past, in other words to write about it in a different spirit, more inclusive and equal. The recognition of American colonialism was written from within the awareness that we live in a different world today, with a different spirit of equality of citizenship (a damaged and problematic equality, we know, but what is important in this context is the philosophy itself). To be able to speak about the colonial past we need to recognize the injustices and strive to correct them.</p> \n<p>A country is not the direct continuation of a national movement. It can adopt an ethos of equality and inclusiveness. But in Israel this ethos of differentiation and dispossession continues – and is even strengthening – thus the feeling is that every expression on the early period of Zionism will pull the rug out from under the Jewish state. So, in the country of the nation-state law, of half a million settlers, of Judaizing the Negev and Galilee, how is it possible to speak about the colonialism of settlement as something that belongs to the past? What civil, egalitarian ethos could make it history?</p> \n<p>It is clear why we all need to cooperate with the concealment and silencing. Why do everyone – diplomats, historians, teachers and parents – need to lie all the time, forever, to our students, to our children, and most of all to ourselves.</p> \n<p>Zionism began as a colonialist movement. This does not determine its fate – that matter is in our hands.</p> \n<p>Prof. Ishay Rosen Zvi is the head of the Talmud and Late Antiquity section in the Jewish Philosophy Department at Tel Aviv University.</p>",

        "text":["<p>On Friday evening, at the very same time that Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democrat Joe Manchin were crushing the last hopes that Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court might be blocked, Israel’s Channel 2’s weekly news show screened a report about the detention, interrogation and sometimes expulsion of visitors whose activities – and views, apparently – are deemed by Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to be “dangerous.&quot;&nbsp; It was a classic case of what Carl Jung called “synchronicity”: events that have no causal connection to each other but are nonetheless related in a meaningful way.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;U.S. Senate confirms Kavanaugh to Supreme Court despite sexual assault allegations</p> \n<p>The report by Channel 2’s well-regarded Yigal Mosko, focused on visitors to Israel who had been detained and questioned at Ben Gurion Airport but, unlike at least 20 others, were ultimately allowed to enter the country. These included the vice president of the New Israel Fund and former San Francisco Jewish Federation CEO Jennifer Gorovitz, anti-occupation activist Simone Zimmerman and Atlantic correspondent, CNN commentator and my former Haaretz colleague Peter Beinart.</p> \n<p>There was nothing new in the report – at least not for readers of Haaretz – but it was gut-wrenching nonetheless. Citing “security interests” and acting under authority of the 2017 law that bars visitors who have “publicly called” for a boycott of Israel “and any area under its control,” the government, through the Border Police and the Shin Bet, is targeting, isolating and branding as potential accomplices to terror people of a certain leftist political persuasion, including supporters of Israel who oppose the occupation. Their quarry, based on empirical evidence, includes not only Jewish and non-Jewish tourists and visitors but also Jews seeking entry via the Law of Return and, most ominously, Israeli citizens.</p> \n<p>The detentions at Ben Gurion airport may be damaging Israel’s reputation among liberals, which it increasingly ignores anyway, but they have a hidden bonus: The political filtering at Israel’s gate sends a chilling message, which delegitimizes opposition to the government’s policies inside Israel itself. Moreover, at the speed that they are plummeting down the proverbial slippery slope, it may be just a matter of time before Benjamin Netanyahu and his ultra-right wing coalition partners convince themselves – and their followers – that the same rationale that justifies detaining suspected subversives who haven’t entered the country is doubly valid for those already living in it.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The trailblazing Israeli movement that predated #MeToo</p> \n<p>After all, the task of protecting Israel from harm doesn’t stop at the country’s gates. If ascertaining ties not only to BDS groups, but to George Soros, the New Israel Fund, Israeli civil society dissenters such as B’Tselem and Breaking the Silence and other groups protesting Israeli policies in the occupied territories makes Israel safer - why stop there? Why shouldn’t resident Israelis deemed suspect by some mid-level Shin Bet operative also be subjected to random detention and interrogation about their political views, support for Netanyahu and nefarious activities against the occupation, like some of those detained at the airport? Is that not the next logical step?</p> \n<p>I am sure that many viewers of the Channel 2 news report – though possibly just a minority – felt a deep sense of shame, mixed with despair, laced with dread. For leftist and liberal Israelis, for all those who have yet to be swept off their feet by the ugly tide of Jewish ultra-nationalism and general incitement against the left propagated by Netanyahu and his cohorts, the thought of where we’ve come from, where we are now and where we seem to be going is nothing less than devastating.</p> \n<p>Which is why, despite the fact that Israel’s detention policies and the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh are completely unconnected and oceans apart, Netanyahu’s critics in Israel and Trump’s opponents in the U.S. formed a unique bond over the weekend, albeit one that neither side is aware of. The Israeli left, and a chunk of its center, have been living for many years with the same kind of indignation and outrage that many Americans must have felt when Collins and Manchin gave the GOP the votes needed to get Kavanaugh confirmed, despite Christine Blasey Ford’s un-refuted allegations that Kavanaugh tried to rape her in high school.</p> \n<p>Liberal Israelis can easily empathize with their American counterparts’ disgust, dismay and disillusionment with politicians who prefer expediency to principle, a legislature that willingly surrenders its supervisory role and becomes a rubber stamp, a Supreme Court that is getting packed and bent out of shape with right wing appointments, a public that seems oblivious to the erosion of its democracy, the rights of minorities or the status of women and a leader who ignores established norms and constantly and dangerously incites against the media, the elites and his political rivals. They too have watched with anguish as conspiracy theories gradually vanquish facts and as a cult of personality eclipses ideology and renders leaders immune to charges of violating the law and the constitution. Israelis, perhaps more than any other people on earth, can feel the liberal American pain. They live with the fear that worse is yet to come.</p> \n<p>The big difference is that most Americans who oppose Trump are still astonished that he was elected in the first place and are still in shock that his tenure so far is a bigger nightmare than they could have ever imagined. They still can’t believe – or grasp – that their fellow citizens would allow their country to come to this. Israelis, on the other hand, have lived under Benjamin Netanyahu’s rule for the almost nine straight years, including the last four, in which he has shed past pretenses and seems hell-bent on undermining the legitimacy of dissent and on entrenching right-wing hegemony for many years to come. Israelis have had ample time to digest that their leader wields his unchecked power over the public and its representatives in the Knesset by relying on the fanaticism and threatening intimidation of his ethnocentric, foreigner-hating, democracy-disdaining so-called “base.”</p> \n<p>This is why Israeli leftists react today with sad resignation to the kind of developments and trends that make American liberals’ blood boil. They have ridden the roller coaster of dashed hopes and smashed expectations so often that their determination has been replaced by despondence and their fighting spirit supplanted by dejection and sorrow. They no longer harbor hopes that new elections, which are expected to be called soon, can yield anything other than another resounding Netanyahu victory, a renewed mandate for his authoritarian-minded coalition and a reinvigorated drive to stifle leftist criticism and activism, which could make the detention of suspects at Ben Gurion Airport seem like child’s play.</p> \n<p>American Democrats and liberals, on the other hand, are all fired up and raring to go. Trump’s election as president, despite his loss of the popular vote, along with his unresolved reliance on Russia, disdain for America’s allies, perverse romance with Kim Jong Un, abandonment of America’s traditional role as the world’s policeman and moral preacher, outrageous invective, perceived corruption, more than 5,000 lies and falsehoods documented by the Washington Post and general infatuation with himself have infuriated and inflamed his critics and opponents. The Kavanaugh debacle has confirmed their worst apprehensions, but may also prove to be the final catalyst that sends Democrats and other Never-Trumpers to the polls on November 6 “in droves,” as Netanyahu said of Israeli Arabs in 2015.</p> \n<p>This is why the impending vote for Congress is so pivotal, and not only for the future of the Democratic Party and arguably for American democracy itself. Unlike most previous midterm elections, which used to garner mostly yawns in the international arena, this time the whole world is watching. A Republican upset would signal that America is with Trump, but a Democrat victory - in the House of Representatives, at the very least - would spark hope that the march of Trumpism has been arrested and that its traumas might soon be a thing of the past. A Democratic triumph, especially one that is sweeping and unequivocal, could even inject renewed fighting spirit into otherwise dejected Israelis, who have all but given up hope.</p> \n<p>Israeli history, however, provides a note of caution. Netanyahu’s Israeli critics have experienced the same kind of determined enthusiasm that seems to be enveloping Trump’s opponents. That was in May 1999, when peace-loving, democracy-cherishing Israeli voters emphatically rejected Netanyahu after his first term in office and replaced him with Ehud Barak. Their celebrations, however, were short-lived.&nbsp; Twenty years later, given Netanyahu’s triumphant return and seemingly permanent lock on power, they seem naive and shortsighted.</p> \n<p>The lesson for their American brothers and sisters in arms is that a battle won does not preclude a war that’s ultimately lost. That perception could change if liberal America proves, after its expected November 6 gains, that it is persevering despite inevitable setbacks and disappointments. Israeli spirits might be lifted, in sublime synchronicity, if American liberals prove true to Revolutionary War naval hero John Paul Jones stirring and defiant response on September 23, 1779, when asked by the captain of the British vessel pursuing his ship, The Bonhomme Richard, whether he wished to surrender: “I have not yet begun to fight.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Police questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;in two of his corruption probes for five hours on Friday morning – the 12th time he has been questioned in relation to the various probes. The questioning on Friday revolved around the so-called Case 1000 and Case 2000.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Case 1000 alleges Netanyahu and his wife received lavish gifts from Israeli Hollywood entertainment magnate Arnon Milchan and Australian businessman James Packer as bribes for beneficial legislation and personal favors.</p> \n<p>In Case 2000, Netanyahu is accused of offering Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper publisher Arnon Mozes advantageous government media policy in return for favorable news coverage.</p> \n<p>In February, Israel Police&nbsp;announced it was recommending Netanyahu be indicted&nbsp;for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in the two cases.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Netanyahu may have gotten rid of Israel's police chief, but not of his corruption | Analysis</p> \n<p>Friday was the first time Netanyahu was questioned regarding the two cases since confidant Nir Hefetz signed on as state's witness. The move strengthened suspicions against the prime minister, and releaved Arnon Milchen mediated between Netanyahu and Yedioth Ahronot publisher Arnon Mozes in 2009.</p> \n<p>Since the case passed on to the Public Defender's Office in February, supplementary investigations have been conducted. After the economic and tax crimes district attorney formulated a recommendation, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit decided to unite the three probes as one case in light of similarities between the cases, the repercussions of Case 2000 on Case 4000, which also pertains to positive coverage of Netanyahu, mutual witnesses and overlapping timelines.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu was last questioned in August, with officers interrogating the prime minister for four hours in&nbsp;Case 4000, in which he is suspected of providing regulatory benefits to media mogul&nbsp;Shaul Elovich&nbsp;in return for favorable coverage on his Bezeq-owned Walla! News site. Case 4000 is considered the most solid of the three, according to legal sources familiar with the probes, with Mendelblit expected to accept the police's recommendation to indict Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>After being questioned, Netanyahu proclaimed the probe has &quot;finally collapsed.&quot;</p> \n<p>Officials close to Mendelblit have so far posited decisions will be made on the cases in early 2019, around the time early elections are expected to be called.</p> \n<p>Despite the consensus in the Justice Ministry regarding Mendelblit's decision to indict Netanyahu, the hearings are expected to take place following the elections, with the final verdict dragging out to 2020.</p> \n<p>In August, the Tel Aviv district attorney for economic and tax crimes said it will take “months” before the investigations would be completed. Liat Ben Ari was heard saying that while the team she heads works quickly and with resolve, State Prosecutor Shai Nitzan and Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit delay their decisions for many weeks. For example, Ben Ari wanted to question a certain public figure and Mendelblit only made his decision after two months.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to Ben Ari, as quoted by a source, this conduct is unintentional, the result of the heavy work load of senior Justice Ministry officials. Nevertheless, she expressed frustration with the pace of progress in the investigations.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The threat on Talia Sasson’s life came two days after she was appointed president of the New Israel Fund, in July 2015. It arrived via the NIF’s email account: Someone wrote of his intention to come with an M-16 to kill her and all of the organization’s other employees.</p> \n<p>“Do you know how much that email cost us? An awful lot of money,” Sasson told Haaretz, in an interview anticipating the end of her tenure, later this month. “We had to post a guard, and installed closed-circuit television and security doors, and who knows what else.”</p> \n<p>Sasson, 67, mentioned that episode in an offhand way during our second meeting. In fact, in recent years no fewer than five organizations receiving NIF grants also needed to adopt security measures, in the wake of threats. “I don’t want to name them,” she said. “But when these sorts of problems affect organizations we support, then we share the financial burden [of beefed-up security] with them.” Such unforeseen expenses undoubtedly come at the expense of other Fund projects.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, Sasson did not want or ask for a personal security detail, not even after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attacked the organization in April (making specious accusations about the NIF’s imagined involvement in derailing an agreement with Rwanda to take in Israel’s African refugees), or when his attacks were followed by an aggressive campaign by the right-wing Im Tirtzu organization against both the NIF and Sasson personally. The security issue “was raised in a certain manner,” she noted evasively, and then added, “God in heaven. I simply hate periods like this in my life.”</p> \n<p>“Periods like this? In the plural?”</p> \n<p>Sasson preferred not to elaborate, but did relate something of what she has gone through. A few threats were aimed at her in the 1990s, when she worked at the State Prosecutor’s Office, and she had to have a “panic button” installed in her home. In 2004, then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon commissioned Sasson to write a report on illegal West Bank outposts. The meticulous report, covering 343 pages, exposed the deep involvement of government ministries and other official bodies in the establishment and financing of more than 105 unauthorized settlement offshoots. Thanks to that assignment, Sasson became a household name, familiar well beyond the circles of jurists and lawyers who had known her until then as an honest person and business-like attorney, one loyal to the system and to the institutions of the state, as one of them put it.</p> \n<p>“It is the state authorities and public authorities that have violated the law, the rules and the regulations determined by the state itself,” she wrote in the legal opinion she submitted to Sharon in March 2005. And then, for the next seven months, a security cordon surrounded her home in Moshav Beit Zayit, outside Jerusalem. “It was a real nightmare. There was constant police presence here. Several times a day.”</p> \n<p>Were threats made against you?</p> \n<p>“I don’t know. Based on my own familiarity with the authorities, they usually don’t tell the individual that threats have been made against him.”</p> \n<p>So we can conclude that there were.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know how many and why, but it was a very unpleasant time. Anyone who comes to see you is checked, and is obligated to identify himself, and that goes for whoever is coming to see you and who left and who came back, and your children. And I had two daughters at home... It certainly has a negative effect on your sense of privacy and your private life.”</p> \n<p>When she worked at the State Prosecutor’s Office – first in the Jerusalem District and subsequently in the national office – Sasson learned that “when you are acting as part of your job, you need to lower a screen over yourself. You don’t like and you don’t hate. You’re not a friend and you’re not an enemy. You do the best you can to fulfill exactly the role that you undertook to fulfill.”</p> \n<p>Did the ability not to mix the personal with the professional become second nature? How did it feel when you were called a traitor – how did you react to the violent billboards that Im Tirtzu erected against you in public earlier this year?</p> \n<p>“There is a difference between the external response and the internal response. The external response is that I am sorry about this, but is it something that will divert me from my path? Will it change anything? Definitely not. Internally, which is a much more interesting question, the first time I saw it, I said to myself: ‘Do they mean me?’ I recognized myself, realized that they meant me, but I had a hard time internalizing it. It’s not an intellectual thing, it’s psychological. People are saying that you are against Israeli soldiers, basically against the country, and for someone like me, that is a sensitive point. Are you talking about me? My whole life has been devoted to the State of Israel, no matter how you look at it. Including right now, when I am president of the New Israel Fund. For me, the State of Israel, the legacy of my Zionist family, is the most important thing in my life, after my family. To come and say to me, ‘You are a traitor’ – where did that come from? And that you are against IDF soldiers? My daughters served in the Israel Defense Forces. And what service they did!”</p> \n<p>What service did they do?</p> \n<p>In response, Sasson began to laugh. “I don’t want you to write this,” she said, and again we agreed that she would speak off the record. She spoke with maternal pride about what one of her daughters did in the army, to which I said, Uh Ah, faintly expressing my strong reservations. She then told me what her other daughter did, before returning to the label of traitor that the Israeli right had assigned to her. “I’ve sat next to prime ministers, next to Rabin and Peres and Sharon, and I’ve provided legal counsel to the most senior members of the defense establishment. How did I become a traitor? And then comes that moment when you create some distance from the situation, when you say to yourself, ‘That is not me at all. What do they know about me, these people? They don’t know a thing. It’s only your face over there [on the billboard], Talia. What do they know? Nothing. Drop it.”</p> \n<p>Not only do they not know about “Talia,” they mainly do not know about the NIF, she continued: “The NIF does a colossal amount of work of which the public is unaware. There isn’t a single person who is not affected by the NIF’s activities.</p> \n<p>Thanks to the activities of the organizations supported by the NIF during the past 39 years, says Sasson, about 500 laws have been passed that have improved life and reinforced human and civil rights in Israel. Even those who are not subject to the propaganda of the right against the NIF would be surprised at the scope of its activities and its accomplishments. Here is a partial list of the latter, from which I have deliberately omitted what relates to the human rights of Palestinians on both sides of the Green Line, and to the struggle against racism:</p> \n<p>The Adva Center, a social-justice policy center, promoted the Mandatory Pension Law, which obligates every employer to set aside pension payments for its employees. For about 20 years, Adva cautioned against erosion of health services, until in 2016 it was decided that the basket of government-subsidized medications would be doubled to 550 million shekels a year (roughly $150 million), within five years. Adva has also worked to increase awareness of and rectify gender inequality in government budgets. The National Coalition for Direct Employment, composed of a number of organizations that receive NIF funding, launched a campaign that resulted in a preliminary vote by the Knesset in favor of a law that bans the Ministry of Education from hiring teachers as contract workers. The Biton Committee (to Empower the Heritage of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in the Education System) and some new annual cultural events are direct outcomes of the activity of the Libi Bamizrah (My Heart Is in the East) coalition. Working to expose institutional discrimination against Mizrahi culture in Israel, the coalition comprises some 20 groups, several of which receive financial backing from the NIF. Lawyers for Tmura, the Israeli Antidiscrimination Center, won the case of Michel Malka, when a judge ruled he had not been accepted for work at Israel Aerospace because of his Mizrahi background. The Public Housing Forum, another umbrella organization, has worked to promote legislation that would ban the evacuation of residents of public housing.</p> \n<p>This partial list does not include many other NIF-related accomplishments in areas such as environmental protection, secular burial, rights of sexual assault victims, or equality for members of the LGBT community and for women, including those belonging to religiously observant communities.</p> \n<p>‘Terrible delegitimization’</p> \n<p>When I asked Sasson about the attacks on the NIF because of its support for the “Traitors of Breaking the Silence,” as I allowed myself to say mockingly, she became visibly upset: “First of all, I wholly reject that phrase.”</p> \n<p>Even said in jest?</p> \n<p>“In jest, and certainly in seriousness. I think that they have undergone a terrible process of delegitimization in the Israeli public, at the hands of the right. We are speaking of individuals who served in the IDF and who were excellent soldiers.”</p> \n<p>Some of them now understand that they made a mistake by serving.</p> \n<p>“That may be, but we are not speaking of shirkers, nor of people who are anti-Israel. These are people who served the country wholeheartedly, who followed the orders they received.”</p> \n<p>And who then found out that they were partners to war crimes.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know if ‘war crimes’ is the right term, and I am not certain that every one of them was a partner to war crimes. But they left with one conclusion that they understood well: that the co-option of youth, through the IDF, into the occupation regime in the territories, is a bad thing that goes against the good of the country. They want to talk about their experiences there. They think the occupation is a bad thing that should be ended. These individuals ‘break the silence,’ but they are not doing what people accuse them of: being against the State of Israel and being anti-patriotic.”</p> \n<p>‘The blanket is too short’</p> \n<p>Jewish-American dominance of the NIF is built-in. Most of the money the organization receives comes from Jewish donors in the U.S. A new president is elected every three years, alternating between the two nationalities. The president, who is unpaid, also chairs the board of directors, which meets twice a year and, among other things, determines the organization’s policy. Since its establishment in 1979, when it undertook to be “committed to advancing the values of human dignity ensconced in Israel’s Declaration of Independence, which it views as the key to its long-term security and survival” – the NIF has never had an Israeli president who was not Jewish. The current CEO (a professional position), Daniel Sokatch, lives in the U.S.; subordinate to him is the director-general, Mickey Gitzin, in Jerusalem. There are many more Ashkenazi Jews on the board and on the NIF’s international council than Mizrahi Jews or Palestinian citizens of Israel. Moreover, among the salaried employees, the number of Palestinians and Mizrahim is relatively small, as Sasson herself confirmed.</p> \n<p>“The NIF,” she said, “is an American organization, and the American law that applies to it states that the majority [on the board of directors] must be American. So it is that there is an Ashkenazi majority, no surprise there. There are also representatives from Australia, Britain, Canada and Switzerland, and they are more or less the same sort of people. The remainder are members of the board from Israel. We try hard to diversify the board, so that it reflects all sorts of sectors and the population. So maybe there are not a lot of Mizrahim. I accept that we should put more Mizrahim on the board.”</p> \n<p>Is that a subject that comes up in your conversations?</p> \n<p>“We try hard, but there are a lot of organizations that you would call Mizrahi, that the NIF supports. Without any connection to the number of members of the board of directors. It never occurred to me to support organizations based on the question of whether they are Mizrahi or not.</p> \n<p>“Look, when the NIF was established, a large proportion of its activity and its contributions were directed at what is called social justice. But in the past seven years, the focus has been more on creating tools to reinforce Israeli democracy. To withstand the erosion [of democracy], as we see it. If in the past, we were busy, for instance, making public places accessible to the disabled, today that sort of thing is taken for granted. Now we try harder to focus on the democratic issue due to its weakened status in Israeli society, as a result of government policy.”</p> \n<p>What does that mean? That there will be less money available for the Public Housing NGO and for the Kav La’oved Hotline for Refugees and Migrants?</p> \n<p>“The blanket is too short to cover everything. Not only is our blanket too short, but many foundations that were once active in Israel have left it. The countries that were once interested in the subject of peace here, and that allocated all sorts of budgets to organizations have ceased operations here, and that has greatly increased dependence on the NIF. That is a heavy burden for us.”</p> \n<p>Considering the success the right has had in delegitimizing you, by spreading lies, are you considering ways to convince the public that these are lies?</p> \n<p>“We are certainly thinking of that. Every consultant tells us: Present the good things that you are doing. That is as opposed to the bad things we are doing – ‘bad’ in quotes – like supporting for B’Tselem, Breaking the Silence, Yesh Din (Volunteers for Human Rights). The good acts are support for the periphery and for the poor, but they are not the only ones. At the end of the day, the media, of which you are part, says to us, ‘What – you want us to write a public service announcement about you?’ As if to say something positive about us is a public service announcement. The public wants to hear only bad things. It is a paradox, but it is very difficult to explain to the public how, when all is said and done, that you are actually the good guy in the story.”</p> \n<p>The NIF allocates two types of grants to the organizations it supports: One type, determined by the NIF board, is called “core grants,” and directly reflects the organization’s priorities. On average, these grants total some $4 million to $4.5 million annually; in the past few years that sum has been allocated to about 70 organizations. The second type, “donor-advised grants,” come from donations from individuals who have earmarked them for specific objectives and organizations. These total between $15 million and $17 million per year. In 2017, 260 such grants were made.</p> \n<p>The NIF’s priorities, as reflected in its 2017 core grants, were: human and civil rights and democratic infrastructures – $1,050,000; strengthening of democracy – $800,000; social justice – $500,000; shared society and struggle against racism – $470,000; Arab society in Israel – $500,000; freedom of religion – $400,000; emergency needs – $348,000.</p> \n<p>The NIF website shows all the funds that were allocated (both from core grants and private sources) in 2016. The list is headed by the Fund’s flagship grantee, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel ($640,000); Breaking the Silence ($470,000); and B’Tselem ($415,000). At the top of the list of recipients that promote social and economic justice are Adva ($162,000) and Achoti (My Sister) ($138,000). The organizations serving Arab society include the Injaz Center for Professional Arab Local Governance ($170,000), followed by Adalah: The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel ($70,000).</p> \n<p>One may wonder why it is – among organizations funded by NIF that “promote democratic discourse” – that the highest sum ($286,500) went to the Council for Peace and Security. This group, formed by former senior members of the defense establishment, has been behind billboards that stoke Israelis’ fears of the Palestinians, erected in 2015 (“With BibiBennett, we’ll be stuck with the Palestinians forever”) and in 2017 (“What’s bothering Yisraela?” which mocked Mizrahim). The preceding year, in 2015, the group received $780,000 from the NIF, which offered this explanation for the allocation: “We supported the Council with a general support grant. These campaigns were funded through designated Donor Advised Grants, and not through the NIF grant. We are not involved in the campaigns of our grantees, as long as they adhere to our guidelines (in other words, as long as they do not deviate from them).”</p> \n<p>While allocation of funding is carried out in conjunction with and in consultation with various officeholders at the NIF, Sasson added, much weight is accorded to the desires of the donors, who are mainly American. “It is much more difficult to solicit contributions for social issues than for democracy. The donors view them as domestic Israeli problems, which America has, too. This issue of diversity-based discrimination in society is not a hot-button issue for which funds can be raised. In general, we have to understand that the NIF must take into account the source of the funding – cautiously, through a fine Israeli filter, with the consent of all, but you also have to take into account the desire of the Americans.</p> \n<p>“Before the attacks on the NIF [which began about a decade ago], who even knew about us? The NIF is a body that was not looking to grab anything for itself, not a name and not headlines. It was not rushing to publicize what it does throughout Israel. It gave financial support to organizations, in order to help the State of Israel. Wholeheartedly. It’s Jews. Here in Israel we would call them Zionists. I don’t think they would want us to call them by that specific name, because the interpretation of Zionism today in the U.S. is not to the benefit of Israel. But it doesn’t matter. Israel is the apple of their eye.”</p> \n<p>What is the interpretation of Zionism over there?</p> \n<p>“There are some people who view Zionism through the prism of the occupation. American Jews with whom I am in touch support Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. Otherwise they’d be giving their money to Rwanda. And they support a democratic State of Israel. For them, these two things go together. There cannot be one without the other; there is no such thing, not in my opinion and not in theirs. It is this kind of Israel that they wish to support, and anything that is antithetical to this principle – they oppose. They are against the occupation. They want two states for two peoples because they think that’s apparently the only possible solution that exists here, but they want the State of Israel to remain the nation-state of the Jewish people, and a democratic country.”</p> \n<p>As NIF president, Sasson has become acquainted with “different sorts of Jewish communities around the world. In the U.S., from coast to coast in Australia, in Canada, Switzerland, in Europe in general.” She has come to understand that for many donors, the NIF is a link between progressive Jewish communities and Israel. “The sense that they can have influence in strengthening Israeli democracy and strengthening social justice is what motivates them most.”</p> \n<p>And don’t you feel a weakening of this connection?</p> \n<p>“I think there is an extremely difficult crisis in world Jewry in general, and in the U.S. in particular, toward Israel today. The policy of the right-wing government is very very hard for significant parts of progressive American society.”</p> \n<p>Some people are discovering that even the Israel that they thought was ideal was not ideal. They have “discovered” 1948.</p> \n<p>“I would not presume to speak for them. There is no doubt that the image of Israel was very much one of a vision – that there was a mingling of the vision with the reality. The vision of the nation-state of the Jewish people that is democratic and egalitarian, that would be a model society. The realization of the reality, which has grown much sharper during the long period in which we’ve had governments of the right, is very difficult. The sobering-up process has been very difficult. I do not want to predict what will happen next. But I do think that the government is taking us to a very very bad place. The continuation of the occupation is bad for Israel and is a disaster for its image, the image that young American Jews see.”</p> \n<p>The young people are discovering that the problems began even before the occoupation in 1967?</p> \n<p>“I wouldn’t pretend to know. I am telling you the things that I do know about how there is a rupture among young American Jews, who do not want to identify with the State of Israel because in their eyes it seems to be a racist country – that I can say to you. It disturbs each one of the people sitting on our board of directors. Everyone is afraid that his or her children will not follow in their path.”</p> \n<p>‘Democratic disability’</p> \n<p>In the course of our conversations, Sasson emphasized at least 20 times, in one way or another, her faith in a Jewish and democratic state. No doubt this has been her position for many years, without connection to with the NIF or the attacks on it from the right. In turn, I expressed my opinion that there is a vast distance between the reality and the pretense of democracy in a Jewish state with settler-colonial characteristics.</p> \n<p>Sasson cut me off: “I will explain. I agree that in terms of theoretical philosophy, damage is being done here to the right of equality. The right to immigrate to Israel and to obtain citizenship, for all Jews in the world, is a right that no one else has, no other nationality in the world, and that causes harm to the principle of equality. Democracy means application of the principle of equality, and equality is equality for all. But I would only say to you that I think that the history of the Jewish people justifies this deviation: And I am willing to accept our having a certain democratic disability. And still I think that the principle of equality can apply at all levels as soon as you have entered the country and become a citizen of it.”</p> \n<p>The Palestinians born in this country also have a history. Hasn’t the time come to take that into account, too?</p> \n<p>Sasson said she recognizes the pain and injustice caused to Palestinians in 1948, “But I will tell you something. My sights are focused on Israel. Not on [non-citizen] Palestinians. I support them having a state, it serves the Israeli interest, and I only wish that Gaza and the West Bank would be linked together in a treaty with Israel. And still, I belong to that part of Israel that is not prepared to condition the existence of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people and as a democratic state on the acceptance or non-acceptance of the Palestinian people to the establishment of their own state. I think you have to distinguish between the two things. It may be that they cannot establish a state at all. But the separation [between Israel and the Palestinians] is something that has to happen, and the evacuation of the settlements is something that has to happen. I do not know about evacuation of the army. I am not prepared to forfeit the territory, and security, to the good graces of residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.”</p> \n<p>In the early 1990s, while she was working in the State Prosecutor’s Office, it was Sasson’s job to weigh every request by the army to confiscate land for military needs and to pave bypass roads to settlements for the purpose of realizing interim agreements with the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>“At the time,” she recalled, “there was a sense of spiritual uplift, there was a sense that the country was moving toward peace. And I remember myself leaving the cabinet conference room and saying: ‘When you stand here, you are feeling the beating of the wings of history.’”</p> \n<p>During the six months before the murder of Yitzhak Rabin, in 1995, “I met with him once every two weeks. A very good relationship developed. I would meet [first] with the army generals, who would be saying: ‘Look, we agreed with him on confiscation of land for this road or whatever.’ And I would ask them, ‘What are the other options and what would you be harming?’ You have to strike a balance between the demands of security and human rights. My sense was that what motivated Rabin was an enthusiasm for a new era in Israel.</p> \n<p>“It was a difficult period. I remember the incitement, I remember a cabinet meeting I attended, maybe three weeks before the assassination. Rabin began the meeting but did not follow the agenda. Michael Ben-Yair [the state prosecutor] was sitting next to me, I think. Rabin said to us: ‘Yesterday I saw a guy on television.’ It turned out to be [far-right provocateur] Itamar Ben Gvir [at the time a far-right activist, today a lawyer who represents many right-wing activists]. ‘He [Ben Gvir] said: We got to his [car’s] insignia, we’ll get to the man.’ And then Rabin said: ‘You folks in the State Prosecutor’s Office aren’t doing a thing.’”</p> \n<p>I thought Rabin didn’t relate great importance to the incitement.</p> \n<p>“On the contrary. He said to us: There is incitement and you folks aren’t doing a thing. I remember it.”</p> \n<p>Increase in support</p> \n<p>Returning to the present, Sasson said that, apart from the need to protect the NIF offices in Jerusalem, “I received tons of WhatsApp messages from people who were concerned about the prime minister’s attacks on us, or those from Im Tirtzu. And most important, we saw a significant increase in contributions made to the NIF – from Israel. We have over 3,000 new supporters since Netanyahu attacked us, who contributed a total of 1.3 million shekels [roughly $360,000]. There were those who gave 10,000 or 20,000 shekels, or 100 or 50 shekels as fixed monthly contributions. Some people made automatic charitable monthly deductions. But you do see an increase in support.”</p> \n<p>As a result of the attacks on the NIF, it has also adopted some new red lines when deciding which bodies it will support. For instance, support for the Women’s Coalition for Peace has been suspended. The group has been conducting ongoing research called “Who Profits from the Occupation?” in which it publishes details of Israeli and international companies investing in Israeli projects and institutions in the occupied territories. According to Sasson, the women’s coalition supports the BDS movement, and for that reason it cut off allocations for it.</p> \n<p>“Not that there was any specific pressure vis-a-vis this organization,” she explained. “But there are red lines that our donors are not prepared for us to cross. They think that BDS is against the State of Israel. They do not want us to support refusal to serve in the army, or to be party to the submission of material to the International Court of Justice in the Hague.”</p> \n<p>They are living in the ‘70s, in terms of the belief that the occupation is a temporary malfunction, and that it’s possible to influence Israeli society from within. Isn’t it your job to explain to them…</p> \n<p>“Are you arguing with me over what my job is? You haven’t sat in the NIF for a single day and you haven’t met a single donor. I am telling you that raising money from individuals for a public endeavor in Israel is not a simple thing. You have to take into account the desires of a lot of people.”</p> \n<p>Perhaps they don’t sufficiently understand the reality, the downward spiral?</p> \n<p>“I don’t think that’s the case. They understand it. Everyone sees it a little differently.”</p> \n<p>So it was the donors who set the red lines?</p> \n<p>“The board of directors set them. The big donors sit on the board of directors. And the red lines are: calls for a boycott, submitting evidence against Israelis to the International Court of Justice, and refusing to serve in the army.”</p> \n<p>There are many Jews in the United States who are proud of having refused to enlist in the Vietnam War. Refusal to serve is a democratic right. Why isn’t that the case here?</p> \n<p>“You can argue about each red line. I wasn’t around when these rules were set. But I can accept them, I can oppose a call to refuse to serve in the military because it crushes the foundation of state authority.”</p> \n<p>Even according to your way of thinking, things have deteriorated. You called your book from 2015, “On the Brink of the Abyss.” Even you are subjected to incitement and to the tarnishing of your good name as a “traitor.” And still, the human rights organizations are committed to operating with the same tools that served them in the ‘70s and ‘80s. How are you going to convince Israelis now, with the old tools that have not worked until now, that the continuation of our presence in the occupied territories is bad for the country?</p> \n<p>“I don’t know how I will convince them. I think Israelis have been subjected to brainwashing for many years, to the effect that they think the current situation is to their benefit. I think that a great deal of them do not understand that we are digging our own grave. If they would understand that, they would want to get out of there. Most Israelis, in my opinion, want exactly what I want: a nation-state of the Jewish people, a democratic state, with equality for all its citizens. That’s what I think. I think that they are afraid. They are not yet feeling the price the current situation is costing them. They do not feel it. Maybe when they do, it will be too late.”</p> \n<p>If we’ve failed from within to explain to Israelis how dangerous it is then…</p> \n<p>“There is no such thing as, ‘We have failed.’”</p> \n<p>You yourself say that perhaps in another 20 years it will be too late.</p> \n<p>“Possibly.”</p> \n<p>So why not take advantage of international tools?</p> \n<p>“What tools?”</p> \n<p>Turning to international legal tribunals. So that they will intervene.</p> \n<p>“That’s nonsense. There is no world that will intervene, and I still believe in Israeli democracy. And in the country’s citizens. And I think that we are the only ones who can come up with a solution, us and no one else. The moment you go to the International Court of Justice, you’ve lost faith in the ability of Israel as a democratic country to solve its problem on its own.”</p> \n<p>What will bring Israelis out of their brainwashed state?</p> \n<p>“A change in the situation.”</p> \n<p>They need to lose something because of the occupation. In the meantime, they are profiting from the occupation.</p> \n<p>“Correct.”</p> \n<p>How will they lose something?</p> \n<p>“I don’t know.”</p> \n<p>How can the Israelis be persuaded that the occupation is contrary to their interests?</p> \n<p>“I am prepared to accept that you think differently than I do. My conclusions are that there are additional, new ways that should be sought, perhaps new ideas we haven’t thought of yet. But these would involve internal actions within Israel, using what I believe are the inherent powers of Israeli society. You would like to force your positions on the state by means of a mechanism known as the International Court of Justice.”</p> \n<p>So, organizations that are in need of your grants to exist know that they are forbidden to develop new tools.</p> \n<p>“Heaven forbid. The red lines of the NIF are important to it, in order to enable it to operate in Israel, in order not to act in an all-out manner against the entire public opinion in Israel, and also in order to live in peace with its donors. That is not a matter of personal opinion. The NIF is a reflection of some sort of porridge, a mass both of its donors who live in the U.S. and of people living in Israel, and together we have to reach some sort of plan of action that will be more or less in the consensus. It isn’t easy. It’s really hard. I am trying to present a perspective that portrays the organization as representing a compromise of sorts. There is no other way.”</p> \n<p>You were saying that you have to take into account Israeli public opinion. But it’s moving to the right.</p> \n<p>“Correct.”</p> \n<p>And the NIF has to adjust itself to that shift?</p> \n<p>“It will stick to the values on which it was founded, even if I don’t know what way the weather vane hovering over the Israeli public is going to move. The NIF has proven in its 40 years that it can remain steadfast to its principles, to its values; it is not a weather vane, it does not move right and left. It can change its opinion when something happens, in accordance with the circumstances, but not its values.</p> \n<p>“I am certain that many people like me, from among the volunteers of the NIF and its donors, are people who believe that the more we are able to strengthen Israeli democracy – to protect human and civil rights, the rights of the minority, the independence of the judicial branch – the more we will be able to work toward advancement of the country, and perhaps we will succeed.”</p> \n<p>Perhaps.</p> \n<p>“What do you know and what do I know? You seem to know who has been granted the power of prophecy.&quot;</p> \n<p>In 2004, Sasson had a feeling of missed opportunity when she was not offered the position of state prosecutor. “At the time, I thought, perhaps mistakenly, perhaps arrogantly, that a person like me could bring about change in the direction that I have supported throughout the years. To represent the state in a fair manner.”</p> \n<p>If you were offered the position today, would you take it?</p> \n<p>“No. Today, I do not think that they should be asking me. Today, as opposed to 2004, I am a person who is very politically identified, whereas the state prosecutor should not have a connection politics, having kept his or her distance from it throughout their life.”</p> \n<p>Let’s erase your history since 2004. And let’s say that you did get the call. Would you take the position?</p> \n<p>“I hope that I would say no.”</p> \n<p>Why “hope”?</p> \n<p>“It could be something tempting. But it’s no longer appropriate for me.”</p> \n<p>I am speaking of the government as it is today.</p> \n<p>“If it’s the government as it is today, end of discussion, but even with a different government. I am in a very different place than I was when I was in the State Prosecutor’s Office. It’s a question of perspective. I learned about the State of Israel’s problems from perspectives that I did not have when I was a government attorney. The answers to Israel’s problems are not going to emerge from the judicial system. Not from the State Prosecutor’s Office and not from the Supreme Court. They weren’t intended for that.</p> \n<p>“In my social and public activity, I act from within myself. I am not dependent on someone paying me a salary. On the contrary, as a member of the board of directors, I am expected to contribute to the NIF, and I am doing what I believe in. So I am actually representing myself every day. Being in the State Prosecutor’s office, you have to represent the state, with all of the obligations that come with that. And I want the freedom. After you’ve had the taste of freedom, it is extremely difficult to let it go.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>If you don't know how to behave in a certain situation, if you need friendly advice but you've already driven all your sane friends away or you've got the kind of embarrassing question that can only be asked anonymously, send an email to: mechlak.musar@gmail.com.</p> \n<p>My answers will be generous and honest – but shouldn't be seen as a replacement for professional consultations. Obviously.</p> \n<p>Dear Haaretz,</p> \n<p>I live in the Sharon area north of Tel Aviv. I’m secular, leftist, and I oppose the occupation. My wife’s relatives live near Beit She’an to the northeast. Each year, traffic jams make the car trip to their home more difficult. At the end of August, a drive of 120 kilometers (75 miles) took two and a half hours, mainly spent in three exhausting bottlenecks.</p> \n<p>On the eve of Rosh Hashanah we drove to see them again, and this time I decided to heed Waze and went through the West Bank. The journey took under an hour and a half and most of the roads were empty.</p> \n<p>I’m wondering if it’s ethical to drive though occupied territory solely so that my trip will be less exhausting. Doesn’t such an act grant legitimacy to the occupation? On the other hand, whichever route I take won’t alter reality. What should I do?</p> \n<p>Right Lane</p> \n<p>Dear Right Lane,</p> \n<p>This is the first question I’m responding to with my name attached to the story, so I’ve chosen a decidedly political subject so I can finally stand behind the truism: The settlement enterprise is immoral from its foundations to the rafters. One may surmise that you’re aware of this as well, and you’re only wondering if there are holiday-time discounts for Jews. After all, you’re a leftist, the roads are already paved, your time is limited, and you have lots of work to do.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have good news for you. Your leftist intuition is well honed and you know that it’s not okay. And this isn’t only because it gives legitimacy to the occupation, a theoretical matter of sorts, but because its specific use of stolen resources and the exploitation of disproportionate rights in a regime that promotes segregation on an ethnic basis. (There’s a word for this in Afrikaans that’s considered bad form to say out loud.)</p> \n<p>You may think that you’re driving on an asphalt road, but basically you’re traveling along the length of a crafty means of land expropriation, rights violations and embittering people’s lives in general. As noted in a 2004 B’Tselem report, “It is hard to find one road that Israel built in the West Bank that was not planned to serve and perpetuate the settlements.”</p> \n<p>The West Bank’s roads are not wanting in their darker aspects. First, they were paved on land expropriated from Palestinians. As this breaches international law, Israel made the claim that the (civilian) roads serve military purposes, or that the roads were intended for the general population, including the Palestinians, whereas the reality is the absolute opposite.</p> \n<p>Second, the roads in the West Bank weren’t only planned according to the needs of the settlers, but also as obstacles meant to restrict expansion of Palestinian towns and villages. In addition, these roads were intended to encourage the relocation of Israelis to settlements, as stated in the master plan for settlement in the early 1980s.</p> \n<p>But hey, all that’s history, right? As you noted, the roads are already there, and driving on them will neither prolong nor end the occupation. But the use of stolen property to make things easier for yourself is a pretty dubious act, and traveling on these roads constitutes enjoyment derived from the privileges of the present-day ethnic segregation.</p> \n<p>It’s no coincidence that these roads are so empty. One reason is that the passage of Palestinians is restricted by roadblocks and checkpoints deep in the West Bank, making it harder for them to get to work or school, or to receive medical care. Thus you enjoy empty roads on the way to a meal, while others aren’t allowed to use them for essential needs.</p> \n<p>As opposed to taking a drive in the West Bank with the aim of opening your eyes and getting acquainted with the realities of the occupation, your objective is to shut your eyes as tightly as you can. Is such travel legitimate? I believe no, and in this instance you can refuse to take part in a slight injustice while paying a particularly low price.</p> \n<p>Borrowing from Kant</p> \n<p>Dear Haaretz,</p> \n<p>I used to be religious, but I occasionally host religious relatives. My kitchen isn’t kosher, but my relatives trust that when they come I’ll make food in separate pots and pans or in disposable items, and that I’ll observe the laws of kashrut. My question is whether there’s an ethical problem of cutting corners in keeping kosher for them; for example, cooking in unkosher pots. As long as they don’t know, their conscience is clear, and in terms of divinity, the sin would be mine.</p> \n<p>Apostate Baker</p> \n<p>Dear Apostate Baker,</p> \n<p>It’s not my place to know if there’s a God. But you’re coming to me as a secular arbiter of justice, to consider the matter distinctly from He who dwells in the heavens. So let’s examine the issue from this point of view, moral autonomy, under which people choose the principles with which they’ll comply, instead of these principles stemming from an external source such as God or the laws of the country. Moral autonomy is closely associated with 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant.</p> \n<p>To Kant, moral will is by definition free will – a choice to adopt certain rules emanating from intellectual analysis. Therefore, moral autonomy requires us to respect others, because after all, they, like us, are free and rational creatures.</p> \n<p>From here stems Kant’s formulation of the categorical moral imperative, to act in accordance with the dictum, “Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a&nbsp;universal law.” In other words, do unto others .....</p> \n<p>The question, of course, is not if you’d be prepared for your relatives to serve you unkosher food, but if you’d be prepared for them to lie and cause you to eat something that went against your principles (you might be a vegetarian or scrupulous about a certain diet). It doesn’t matter the extent to which the beliefs or dietary preferences of others you find ridiculous; you can’t lie and take on others’ right to their free choices.</p> \n<p>Lies in which the liar believes that he knows better than the recipients of the lie, and is only acting for their own good, are called paternalistic lies because they’re usually lies that parents tell their children. But in this case, we’re talking about adults, and when you hide information from them you grant yourself power at their expense and see yourself as smarter and more important.</p> \n<p>This sort of paternalistic lie is more similar to deception of a minority by a hegemony that conceives of the minority as lesser beings, such as in populating a country’s outskirts by employing fraud and wielding power. It goes without saying that serving unkosher food fraudulently is less severe, but the patronizing logic is the same.</p> \n<p>But I think the most troublesome thing is the harm done to your relatives and your relationship with them. First, even if they don’t know and even if God doesn’t exist, you’ll know you lied. Lies have this thing about them; in real time we don’t realize the weight they’ll place on our souls. Often it turns out that a lie told to loved ones forges deep lesions of guilt.</p> \n<p>Second, you have no way of knowing that the lie won’t be found out. It’s hard to imagine the pain that such a discovery would cause your relatives, not to mention the sense of betrayal of their trust, which could destroy the relationship.</p> \n<p>You left the religion and you don’t fear divine punishment. But the human responsibility not to harm one’s fellow man is no less significant, and the burden is on your shoulders to choose good – not out of fear of punishment, but out of compliance with an internal moral imperative.</p>",

Two other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct decades ago. Kavanaugh has denied all the allegations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One of those women, Debbie Ramirez, a classmate of Kavanaugh's at Yale University in the 1980s, issued a statement on Saturday saying that as she watched the Senate debate.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;I feel like I'm right back at Yale where half the room is laughing and looking the other way. Only this time, instead of drunk college kids, it is U.S. senators who are deliberately ignoring his behavior,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Moments after Collins pledged to back Kavanaugh, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who is in a tough race for re-election in West Virginia where Trump is popular, also declared his support, leaving little doubt of a Republican victory.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Senators then endured a rare all-night session to satisfy the requirement of 30 hours of debate following Friday's vote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As the debate entered its final hours, the divisions between Republicans and Democrats festered.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Republican Senator Deb Fischer described Kavanaugh as &quot;one of the most thoughtful, preeminent judges in our nation.&quot; The sexual assault allegations, Fischer said, led the Senate confirmation process into &quot;a shameful spectacle and a disservice to everyone involved,&quot; adding that there was no evidence Kavanaugh was the perpetrator.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Democratic Senator Edward Markey countered, saying Kavanaugh has been a &quot;rubber stamp for a far right-wing agenda.&quot; Referring to the judge's sworn response to Ford's testimony, Markey said, &quot;We heard anger. We heard belligerence. We heard evasiveness. We heard disrespect.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Senate Republicans, except for Lisa Murkowski, stood by Kavanaugh in a move that could resonate, particularly with women voters, in the midterm elections to determine control of the Senate and House of Representatives.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Even before the sexual assault charges surfaced, Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate were fighting hard to stop Kavanaugh, saying his conservative judicial philosophy could result in rolling back abortion rights, gay rights and protections for immigrants.

        "text":["<p>A new social storm burst out in the country following the wedding of a Muslim Arab woman and a Jewish man. The Hebrew-language media is full of commentary about it, from condemnations steeped in racist epithets reminiscent of dark periods in history, to hearty congratulatory wishes to the new couple that has exited the closet of anonymity to enter the world of matrimony with bells and whistles.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Firstly, we must say in this context that when it comes to personal matters, there’s no difference at all between Israel, the Arab countries and the rest of the Muslim world. A few months ago Tunisian President Bejin Caid Essebsi threw a reverberating social bomb in the Arab world by proposing to revoke constitutional laws that discriminate against women, and replace them with laws that confer full equality between men and women. Among his proposals was an amendment to permit a Muslim woman to wed a non-Muslim man. As we know, all Arab and Muslim countries forbid marriages between Muslim women and men of other faiths.</p> \n<p>There was an outcry from Islamists throughout the Arab world, from the Al Zahar Institute, a central religious establishment for Sunni Islam and all the bearded men who claim to be preserving purity of the seed. They all came out as one (one man) against the Tunisian president’s initiative, basing their arguments on Islamic religious law.</p> \n<p>I ought to point out that Islamic law does permit Muslim men to wed Jewish or Christian women, despite their being “heretics” from the standpoint of Islamic faith, but it bars Muslim women from marrying non-Muslim men. The reasons for this, according to religious explanations, may be divided into two categories: Pure male chauvinism, for the Muslim religion views the man’s status in the family as greater than that of the woman; and theological chauvinism based on a concept that views Islam as the superior religion over all other faiths.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;What’s So Bad About Assimilation?&nbsp;|&nbsp;Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Mixed Marriages Don't Necessarily Create Assimilation&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>Appeals are often made to the Islamic wise men on the subject by Muslims living in Western countries. The clergy reiterate time and time again to men and women who make these appeals that it is completely forbidden for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man.</p> \n<p>Lucy Aharish’s marriage to Tzachi Halevy, which drew the seed purists from their hideouts, exposed the simple truth about matters of relationships between men and women – that Israel is no different than the surrounding Arab region.</p> \n<p>It must be said that everyone, including Jews and Arabs, are sailing in the same racist ships that come from the same factory of monotheistic faith. But it seems that the Jews and the Arabs sail through parallel seas. For while the Hebrew-language media is full of reports about the matter from every imaginable angle, local Arab media have barely mentioned this widely reported wedding.</p> \n<p>Hebrew-language media, in all their variety, including this newspaper, are making a mistake in their failure to relate to the utter silence on the issue on the part of Arab lawmakers.</p> \n<p>Arab lawmakers, who generally lunge at cameras and microphones, have frozen in their tracks. None of them says a word. They who know to take advantage of every opportunity and every single tweet to expose the anti-Arab racism of the Jews, and attack it from the left and from the right. For some reason, on this issue it’s as though the earth has swallowed them alive.</p> \n<p>I tend to believe that their failure to relate to the wedding is due to one simple reason: their fear of exposing their true faces. For on this issue, they are no different than Dery, Lapid or Bennett. If that’s not the case, then the burden of proof lies with them.</p>",

This conduct is not in keeping, in an understatement, with the thesis that the she's an undercover boycott activist,&quot; he continued.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Interior Ministry has openly admitted that it does not have any evidence of the appellant's engaging in boycott activity since April 2017, except for mysterious 'indications' whose essence hasn't been clarified and regarding which no evidence has been submitted,&quot; Neal noted.</p> \n<p>&quot;The material submitted regarding the appellant's activity in the SJP organization shows that even at that stage the boycott activity was minor and limited in character,&quot; Neal added. &quot;There's no doubt the SJP cell indeed supported boycotting Israel – and this position must be roundly condemned. It is also presumable that the appellant, who played a role in the cell and for three years was one of its few members, was partner to this unworthy activity. However, it is impossible to ignore the cell's sporadic and relatively minor character. In itself, it certainly was not one of the prominent boycott organizations and it is doubtful whether the appellant could be seen as filling the criteria [required in the law?] even when she had a position in it.&quot;</p> \n<p>Neal continued, saying that &quot;alongside the random indications of the appellant's involvement in BDS activity during her studies, it is impossible to ignore the testimonies of her lecturers about her complex approach, the curiosity she displayed toward Israel and Judaism and her readiness to conduct an open, respectful dialogue – which is in stark contrast to the boycott idea.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;The struggle against the BDS movement and others like it is a worthy cause. The state is permitted, not to say obliged, to protect itself from discrimination and the violent silencing of the political discourse. It may take steps against the boycott organizations and their activists. In this case, preventing the appellant's entry does not advance the law's purpose and clearly deviates from the bounds of reasonability,&quot; Neal concluded.</p> \n<p>Justice Anat Baron said that &quot;there was no place to deny the appellant the entry visa she had been granted, because clearly she doesn't now and hasn't for a long time engaged in boycotting Israel, not to mention engaging in 'active, continuing and substantial' work in this matter. The decision to deny the appellant's entry visa is unreasonable to the extent that it requires intervention.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Since the appellant's deeds do not constitute sufficient cause to ban her entry to Israel, the inevitable impression is that her visa was denied due to her political views. If this is indeed the case, then this is an extreme, dangerous step, which could lead to the crumbling of the supporting pillars on which Israeli democracy is built,&quot; Baron said.</p> \n<p>&quot;The appellant's very desire to be part of the academic studies in Israel is contrary to the idea of imposing a boycott on Israel, not to mention an academic boycott. This decision itself could even cause damage to Israel's image, thus attaining the opposite goal of the one intended by the legislator,&quot; Baron continued.</p> \n<p>&quot;We don't know what's in anyone's heart in general and what's in the appellant's heart in particular and how she'd act in the future, and after she returns to her country. But these considerations are irrelevant to our case, because according to the law we must focus on the appellant's acts in the present – and not on her opinions, thoughts or speculations about her future,&quot; Baron concluded.</p> \n<p>Justice Uzi Vogelman said that &quot;a call to boycott Israel was published by the SJP organization, of which the appellant was a member, and not by the appellant herself.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;The law was intended to ban the entry of people expected to spread the boycott doctrine during their stay in Israel…the appellant's case does not qualify for this clause, since there's no argument that she has ceased her activity in the SJP,&quot; he continued.</p> \n<p>&quot;It appears that in the concrete circumstances of this case the appellant's studies in the Hebrew University will help to bolster Israeli academia's struggle against the boycott,&quot; Vogelman concluded.</p> \n<p>Alqasem's attorney, Yotam Ben-Hillel, told Haaretz that the &quot;The Supreme Court’s decision is a victory for free speech, academic freedom, and the rule of law. Israel has the right to control its borders, but that right does not give the [sic] Ministry of Interior unchecked power to turn away anyone it deems unwanted.&quot;</p> \n<p>Ben-Hillel said that by taking a stand, &quot;Lara has ensured that no one else should be denied the right to enter Israel based on sloppy Google searches and dossiers by shadowy smear groups. We argued that the state’s decision is a gross misapplication of the law, and the Court agreed. Lara’s case proves that thought-policing has no place in a democracy.&quot;</p> \n<p>Erdan lamented the ruling, calling it &quot;a great victory for BDS,' and added it nullified the law forbidding boycott activists from entering Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The strategic affairs minister said the court's decision &quot;attests to a lack of understanding of the modus operandi of the BDS organizations, and has harmed the State of Israel's ability to fight boycott activists who harm all of us.&quot;</p> \n<p>According to the verdict and the logic of the judges, Erdan said, &quot;Omar Barghouti, the founder of the international boycott movement who studied at Tel Aviv University and today spreads hate all over the world against Israel, was supposed to have become our passionate supporter simply by studying at an Israeli academic institute.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Once again, the Supreme Court castrates the substance of Knesset legislation and the intention of the legislator and takes authorities which are in the hands of the executive authority,&quot; Erdan said, claiming that the court underestimated the extreme and anti-Semitic nature of the organization in which Alqasem had a senior role.</p> \n<p>&quot;It ignored that she erased and hid her activity on social media before coming to Israel and opened a hatch for all boycott activists worldwide to come to Israel and plead they 'currently' do not support a boycott so they may enter,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>Erdan asserted the ruling will &quot;not loosen our grip and we will examine the necessary changes in the law and the criteria to close the aperture opened by the Supreme Court. The principle that must be maintained is that whoever acted to harm the State of Israel and its citizens should not enter its gates.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;The ban on Lara Alqasem is a gift for BDS, and a disaster for Israel&nbsp;■&nbsp;Dare to know Lara Alqasem&nbsp;■&nbsp;Official documents prove: Israel bans young Americans based on Canary Mission website</p> \n<p>Tourism Minister Yariv Levin called the court's decision &quot;shameful&quot; and said it continued to &quot;act against democracy and against the clear legislation of the Knesset, when they create a 'green route' for boycott activists to enter the country and continue to harm the state.&quot;</p> \n<p>Levin called on the Hebrew University to retract their support of Alqasem, and cancel her enrollment.</p> \n<p>The Hebrew University welcomed the verdict, releasing a statement saying it is &quot;Happy Lara Alqasem will join thousands of students and begin her studies in the in the Master's Program in Human Rights and Transitional Justice in the Faculty of Law.&quot;</p> \n<p>Interior Minister Arye Dery called the &quot;decision to keep in Israel the student who openly acts against Israel is a disgrace. Where is our national dignity? Would she have dared to act against the state and demand to stay and study there in the United States as well? I will look into ways of preventing such an incident from happening again.&quot;</p> \n<p>Meretz chairwoman Tamar Zandberg said that&nbsp;&quot;this is an important victory in the struggle for Israel as a liberal democracy, free of the thought police. Sanity has triumphed today over those who tried to run with their heads into the wall without looking sideways. This is an important ruling that strengthens Israel and Israeli academia, proving to the whole world that Israel isn't being run by Erdan's hysterical craziness.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;I've been following Alqasem from her first day in Israel, and it was clear that this entire legal and public saga could have been avoided had Erdan chosen the good of Israel instead of his own political gain,&quot; Meretz MK Mossi Raz said. &quot;Israel's government is wasting resources on legal procedures that damage our good name. Regrettably it appears we are in store for many of them. I commend the Supreme Court's decision. There are judges in Jerusalem.&quot;</p> \n<p>Erdan said Alqasem can enter Israel on the condition that she renounce her support of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. Erdan has also claimed that Alqasem is not being detained because she is free to return to the United States.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments on the request to hear Alqasem's appeal. Alqasem's lawyer Yotam Ben Hillel asked Justices Neal Hendel, Anat Baron and Uzi Vogelman to consider the student visa originally issued to her by the Israeli consulate in Miami.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The justices asked Ben Hillel if his client currently supports a boycott of Israel and whether she is committed to refrain from calling for a boycott. Ben Hillel said that his client had explicitly stated at earlier proceedings in the case that she is not a BDS activist, and would not call for an anti-Israel boycott.</p> \n<p>Last week, the Tel Aviv District Court rejected Alqasem's appeal, saying it could not justify intervening in the case and that the government's decision to detain her was reasonable, echoing a similar decision previously made by an administrative appeals court.</p> \n<p>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where Alqasem was accepted as a graduate student, asked to join the appeal in an unusual step&nbsp;taken by the university.</p> \n<p>A representative for the university told the court Wednesday that the university &quot;chose to&nbsp;join the appeal&nbsp;because of the importance we place on taking in foreign students and researchers,”&nbsp;and raised the possibility that barring Alqasem from Israel “would play into the hands of those who claim that we are an unenlightened country.”</p> \n<p>The university senate had called on Erdan and Dery to allow her into Israel. Erdan said the senate's support of Alqasem was &quot;another politicization of the Israeli academia for the sake of someone who actively works to harm the State of Israel and its citizens.&quot;</p> \n<p>Also on Thursday, the university's senior faculty met to discuss possible moves to protest if the Supreme Court rejects her appeal. “Let’s not delude ourselves. They’ve declared war against us – against us as an institution and what we represent,” said Prof. Tallay Ornan of the university’s archeology and art history departments. “This is not a personal issue. This is a declaration of war on what we are working for: to broaden knowledge, freedom of information, recognizing the other, and enlightenment.”</p>",

According to them, the presented building plan includes a large library and events hall, which the protestors take as evidence that the space is intended for use by ultra-Orthodox Yeshiva students.</p> \n<p>The protestors rallied under the slogan, &quot;Rishon Letzion will not become Beit Shemesh,&quot; and carried signs that read &quot;Anxious about the future of the neighborhood&quot; (in Hebrew, the words for &quot;anxious&quot; and &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot; are spelled the same). Counter-protestors, many of them religious, stood nearby and could be heard shouting phrases like &quot;scum&quot; and &quot;anti-Jewish&quot; at the protesters. Police arrived at the scene and separated the two sides.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to the protesters, they do not object to the construction of a synagogue, but rather to the dedication of the space to the activities of Yeshiva students. Mayor Dov Zur described the space on Facebook a month ago, he spoke of a synagogue alone.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, the objectors planned to protest in front of Zur's home, but the protest did not take place following a message from the entrepreneur responsible for the project, who told the residents he would withdraw his application and open up a dialogue with them. According to the protestors, he has not contacted them since.</p> \n<p>One of the organizers, David Vogel, who lives across the street from the site of the proposed synagogue, told Haaretz, &quot;I'm not against the construction of a two-story synagogue, but the original plan was for a 380 square meter building, and it received a building allocation for a 1,500 square meter building. It will change the character of the neighborhood. As we protested this morning, vehicles full of Shas members immediately arrived to harass us.&quot;</p> \n<p>The chairman of Shas in Rishon Letzion, Rabbi Arye Cohen, confronted the protestors and said afterward, &quot;This is about the elections. They're trying to arouse the secular public to gather votes. They are looking for provocation to get people to the polls. I, unlike them, was born and raised in this city, and know it well. The religious and secular people have always lived here in brotherhood, peace and friendship.&quot;</p> \n<p>Zur said in response that &quot;Rishon Letzion has always been a city free of religious tensions due to open communication between all sectors of the community. It's a shame that misguided politicians are simply seeking ammunition.&quot;</p> \n<p>Zur ascribed the motivation behind the protest to upcoming elections, saying, &quot;This is a cynical political attempt by a candidate facing upcoming elections who is trying to inflame voters' passions, over nothing, through false and irresponsible manipulation.&quot;</p> \n<p>The mayor claims that the project managers and developers held many meetings with representatives from the community, and made changes based on their requests. Zur added, &quot;The synagogue includes a women's section and a mikveh, answering many real needs of the community.&quot;</p>",

Who generates more respect, the diplomat or the human rights activist? Which of the two disgraced Israel with his words and who retained some of its humane image? Who told the truth and who lied? Whom does the world believe – excluding Nikki Haley, the only true collaborator in the hall – and whom can the no world no longer believe?</p> \n<p>They sat opposite each other at the Security Council – two Israelis of the same age, born here, army veterans, with totally different worldviews and conflicting moral standards. Their values are contradictory and their information on what’s happening under the occupation is divergent. One relies on the lies of Israel’s propaganda machine while the other’s views are based on the investigative efforts of an organization whose work couldn’t be more reliable and professional.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Head of Israeli human rights NGO B'Tselem to UN Security council: Time has come for action</p> \n<p>El-Ad reminded the world of something the world still clings to, the belief that there is still a difference between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Danon tried to erase the difference with his pitiful response: “IDF soldiers protect you and you come here and slander them. You should be ashamed, collaborator.”</p> \n<p>Danon is a faithful representative of the majority in Israel. His appearances are important – he reminds the world that the illusion of the “only democracy in the Middle East” must be dispelled. On the day the world realizes that Danon is Israel and El-Ad represents not just a negligible minority but one muzzled by an aggressive majority, maybe its forgiving attitude toward Israel will change.</p> \n<p>The reactions in Israel only intensified the damage wrought by Danon. Not only the right pounced on El-Ad with viciousness – the center-left took part in the fascist revelry as well. There was Yair Lapid, as could only be expected. There were Zionist Union Knesset members such as Ayelet Nahmias-Verbin (“these are one-sided texts deserving every condemnation”) and Eitan Cabel (“hateful words and an abomination”). Their words attested to the urgency of dispensing with this party and its rotting ideas. None of their colleagues came to El-Ad’s defense – how shameful. There is no alternative to the rule of the right.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; I'm not allowed to speak to children in Israeli schools. Even more worrying, these people can | Hagai El-Ad, Opinion</p> \n<p>El-Ad showed the truth – naked, ugly and disturbing. Anyone calling him a snitch actually admits to this truth and is ashamed of it. It’s not only El-Ad’s right to behave this way, it’s his obligation. The occupation is not and cannot be an internal Israeli matter. The abuse of people without rights under a military tyranny in occupied territory is an international crime.</p> \n<p>Anyone seeing these crimes must report them to the authorities. If you see a man striking a woman or abusing a child or some other helpless creature, you have an obligation to report it to the police. If you see a tyrannical government abusing another nation for decades, killing, destroying, causing hunger, imprisoning people and blocking medical aid, you are obliged to report this to the United Nations, to The Hague and to other international institutions.</p> \n<p>El-Ad fulfilled his civic and moral duty. The chorus of his detractors knows this, which is why it’s so vicious and strident. If Danon really believed his own hollow speeches at the United Nations, he wouldn’t be alarmed at one Israeli speaking out differently. But Danon and Cabel, Benjamin Netanyahu and Miri Regev know that not one word in the restrained and to-the-point speech by El-Ad wasn’t truthful. This is why their reaction was so aggressive.</p> \n<p>El-Ad was modest, as is his wont. He said he was no traitor or hero; the Palestinians are the true heroes. He’s right, of course. Every demonstrator along the Gaza border is far more courageous than any Israel sniper shooting him from a distance. Every shepherd at the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar exudes more justice than the entire chorus of those attacking B’Tselem.</p> \n<p>But El-Ad too is a hero; he’s the ambassador of Israel as it should be, a public relations officer of an alternative Israel, a beautiful and just one. Now we have to be concerned about his safety. He has been marked as a target and must wear a bulletproof vest. If he comes to harm we’ll remember those who are to blame: Not just people on the right, but also the sanctimonious hypocrites on the center-left – Lapid, Cabel and Nahmias-Verbin, the spokespeople of Israel’s shameful and imaginary opposition.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s understandable why in Palestinian parlance it’s common to describe the Palestinian conflict with Zionism and Israel not as a national conflict but as an anti-colonialist struggle. Portraying the Palestinians not as a side in a national conflict but as a people fighting against colonialism holds two advantages: According to the rules of postcolonial discourse, the Palestinians are in the right by definition and are never responsible for anything. But these advantages, and the forgoing of any serious attempt to understand the nature of the other side and its motives, come at a heavy price.</p> \n<p>If you don’t have a good understanding of whom you’re dealing with, it will be hard to predict the other side’s behavior and responses (this applies to both sides of the conflict, of course). The Palestinians’ ongoing refusal to accept that they are confronting a people and a rival national movement, and the illusion that this confrontation can be won using methods suited to the colonialist paradigm, have been disastrous for the Palestinian people.</p> \n<p>The anti-colonialist struggles of the 20th century succeeded even though the colonial powers were always much stronger than those who fought them. The colonialist power ultimately gave up the fight and retreated – in most cases without a battle, and in several famous cases only after a military struggle. In any case, the fight was not perceived as vital enough to justify the investment of resources necessary to keep it going.</p> \n<p>The essence of a colonialist situation is that perpetuating colonial rule is a luxury of sorts and not a vital need for the colonial power. It matters much less to it than liberation from foreign rule matters to those fighting it.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Before Herzl, there was Pastor Russell: A neglected chapter of Zionism&nbsp;■ A century before Herzl: The gentile who preached Zionism ahead of his time&nbsp;■ Repulsed by aggressive Jewish nationalism? Reviving the Bund is no answer | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Of course, to the colonial settler, perpetuating colonial rule isn’t a luxury, but he isn’t the one who determines the fate of the struggle. At the same time, he has somewhere to return to: the colonial mother country. This is what, to their dismay, European settlers in Algeria, French citizens (though not all of French background), did when the French Republic decided, contrary to their wishes, to leave Algeria.</p> \n<p>Nowhere to return to</p> \n<p>At some point, the settlers may disconnect from the mother country and create a new nation – and from this moment, they have nowhere to return to, and this is no longer a colonial situation.</p> \n<p>In Haaretz over the weekend Ishay Rosen-Zvi asserted that “Zionism began as a colonialist movement.” At the same time he admits that this was a national movement of a persecuted people whose ties to the land have been part of their identity and culture, and that the people who came here left behind them not a colonial mother country on whose behalf and under whose auspices they were acting, but rather Czarist Russia, anti-Semitic Poland or Nazi Germany. Applying the term “colonialism” to such a situation empties this term of most of its moral and analytical significance.</p> \n<p>It is indeed important to understand that in the Arabs’ eyes, the Zionists’ arrival was perceived as a colonial phenomenon. Anyone who has read Ze’ev Jabotinsky’s “The Iron Wall” knows that there was no lack of understanding this fact in the Zionist movement. But since when is one side’s point of view the last word in assessing the nature of a conflict? It's a pity that the leaders of the Arab national movement in Palestine did not make an effort to understand how the Jews perceived themselves, their situation and their connection to this land.</p> \n<p>The declared anti-colonialist fight against Zionism before 1948, and against Israel thereafter, was based on the assumption that the founding of the Jewish national home, in the conditions of the 20th century, and the State of Israel’s continued existence, have been a luxury of sorts for the Jews – something akin to conquering a colony and retaining it. By this logic, the Jews could be made to give up their hope for a state, and later give up Israel itself, just as the governments in London and Paris were once “persuaded” to give up their overseas colonies.</p> \n<p>Someone who displays such a degree of blindness toward the other side’s fundamental character is likely to bring disaster on his own people. The use of anti-colonialist rhetoric against Israel reached a peak in the ‘60s, before the 1967 occupation, in parallel to the successes of the anti-colonialist movements in Asia and Africa. The Palestinian organizations, with Fatah at the forefront, developed a doctrine of a “popular war of liberation” for the liberation of Palestine. The Fatah terror attacks carried out from Syrian territory were part of the process of escalation that led to the war in June 1967.</p> \n<p>The “anti-colonialist” blindness in relation to Israel fostered an expectation that Israel would crumble from within. After all, this wasn’t a real people and a real nation-state, but some “invented” artificial entity. If we pressure and threaten it enough, it will collapse like a house of cards, the thinking went.</p> \n<p>Colonialist aspects</p> \n<p>Israeli rule in the territories and the settlement project certainly have colonialist aspects. The settlers do have a mother country, and it sent them to a territory under military occupation populated by people without civil rights. But there too the main essence of the situation is a national conflict between two peoples that both see the entire land on both sides of the Green Line as their homeland.</p> \n<p>If the occupation were fundamentally colonialist, it would have ended long ago. No country fights for a colony for 50 years – it’s just not that important. Even Israelis who want Israel to leave the West Bank know all too well that the Palestinians view Israel within the ’67 lines as part of their homeland – ruled by a colonialist entity, not by a rival national movement and another people for whom this land is also their homeland.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>But the pleasure some take in defining Israel this way comes with a cost. Those who promote anti-colonialist rhetoric against Israel as such and against Zionism from the start are helping convince Israelis that withdrawal from the territories will only result in a continuation of the “anti-colonialist” struggle to be waged mere kilometers from Ben-Gurion Airport. No people in the world would think otherwise under similar circumstances.</p> \n<p>When someone discusses the colonial roots of the United States, or when in the West, some Coptic activists claim that the Arab-Muslim conquest of Egypt was a colonial conquest (in Egypt they don’t dare say that), this does not raise the question whether America’s critics have accepted its existence or are determined to go on fighting it, or whether the Coptic world has finally come to terms with the existence of Muslim Egypt. The situation is different when Israel is defined as an inherently colonialist entity in the context of an ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict.</p> \n<p>Defining Zionism as a national movement does not give it or the state that it founded any immunity from criticism. National movements and nation-states are capable, particularly in a situation of national conflict, of actions certainly no less brutal than those of colonial regimes. Even Arab nationalism itself has not been entirely devoid of brutality throughout its history. Someone who seeks to contribute to peace between two peoples should not adopt one side’s slogans of war and of denying the other.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Avraham Fisher, 25, from Moshav Beit Gamliel; flying to France</p> \n<p>Hello, where are you flying to?</p> \n<p>I’m off to do wwoofing: volunteer work on [an organic] farm. You find it mainly in Europe. Lodgings and food can be expensive, but if you work on a farm for only five hours a day, you get a place to stay and meals, and weekends are free.</p> \n<p>What will you do during the five hours?</p> \n<p>Pick chestnuts.</p> \n<p>How did you find out about this?</p> \n<p>I heard about it from a friend. I always travel alone. That way you meet the most people, and encounter opportunities. You don’t have any limitations. I was bogged down with work. I have a business that runs food stalls at events. There’s cotton candy, crepes, hot corn.</p> \n<p>How did you get into that?</p> \n<p>When I was 6, I went with a friend to some happening in the moshav. Someone was selling cotton candy. We told each other that when we were big – 11 or 12 – we’d buy a cotton candy machine and also make money. That didn’t happen. But in the 10th grade, a new kid came along who already had a machine. I told myself that if he could do it, so could I. I took all the money I had and bought a machine, and every year I bought another one, before Independence Day. When I was 18, I began renting them out, I got a VAT exemption before I went into the army, and I kept the business going. When I completed my service in Lotar [a counter-terror unit] about two years ago, I found part of a business that someone was selling on the Yad 2 site for 10,000 shekels [about $2,500], and that was that.</p> \n<p>Lotar – in the tunnels?</p> \n<p>Yes, in the Gaza tunnels.</p> \n<p>What does a day in Lotar look like?</p> \n<p>During my period of service, there was activity every few weeks, but you have training every day, and that takes up most of your time. A new squad arrives, you give them three weeks of training, and they leave. I chose that – after I didn’t make it into the submarines – because I had been a group leader in Bnei Akiva [a national-religious youth movement]. I thought I would like the personal connection. But I wouldn’t do it again; it’s grueling to give the same course over and over.</p> \n<p>What did your service in the unit do to you as a person?</p> \n<p>I can go from zero to 100 pretty fast, without getting stressed out. We learned how to get into a Krav Maga mode straight from being asleep, in clothing that’s suitable for any activity. And on the other hand, I can also chill out from 100 to zero.</p> \n<p>Where do you get your adventurism?</p> \n<p>I always liked to travel. My first trip abroad was in 12th grade, to Uman, in Ukraine [to visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman]. An interesting experience. Flying alone was scary, and I wasn’t even 18. I tried to turn everything into a business. Some people bought a SIM card and sold phone calls at a dollar per call. On Rosh Hashanah, I prayed and then went off to do business. (Laughs)</p> \n<p>Were you in India, too?</p> \n<p>Yes, and I was really lonely there. These days I don’t feel lonely, though. I hooked up with groups in India – it’s hard traveling alone there. What else? Ahh, half a year after I finished my service, I was an extra in a British movie about Entebbe. I played a fighter in Sayeret Matkal [elite commando unit].</p> \n<p>How did they find you?</p> \n<p>There’s an association of former members of the unit, and someone in the production had connections to it ... The shoot was in Malta and it was incredibly cool. I ruined the scene where they disembark from the plane. Four vehicles come out of a Hercules aircraft, and I burst out laughing. I downloaded the movie and I’ll have time to see it in France. I don’t watch movies or TV; there’s so much to read, talk about and do.</p> \n<p>What else is there to do?</p> \n<p>I think a lot about what to do. About what I’ll be up to in five years. I’ll do a master’s course in diving and I’ll be a yoga teacher. I learned Arabic on my own with a book and a CD, and I spent a month in Egypt. Now I want to go to the Bedouin, to live with them, learn about them. I like the culture and the language. I’m right-wing in my views, but people are people.</p> \n<p>Daniel Grinberg, 29, from Tel Aviv; arriving from New York</p> \n<p>Hi, where are you coming from?</p> \n<p>All kinds of places. I flew to Burning Man, and then did a road trip from San Diego. California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, New York.</p> \n<p>Have you been to Burning Man in Israel?</p> \n<p>I’ve been a few times in Israel. This wasn’t a completely new experience, but it really was terrific.</p> \n<p>Is Burning Man really a hippie thing, but expensive, like people say?</p> \n<p>I’m stingy, so I managed to save some money. The entry ticket costs $500, and with all the expenses it can reach $1,000. Some people spend more, let’s say if they come with a trailer. That’s how I got there: I drove a trailer for someone who was afraid to drive, in return for the lift.</p> \n<p>And how was it?</p> \n<p>It’s a place where you see great openness; it brings out the best in you. You do things there that you wouldn’t do anywhere else. You just feel comfortable in a non-judgmental environment.</p> \n<p>How long does it take to shed the everyday and connect with that place inside you?</p> \n<p>It takes a lot of time, if it happens at all. They say you shouldn’t come with too many expectations. It’s a life-changing experience, for some people, but I’m generally pretty indifferent.</p> \n<p>Can you compare Burning Man abroad and the Israeli version?</p> \n<p>You shouldn’t compare. They’re supposed to be based on the same principles, and it also looks the same, but it’s a lot bigger there and they invest huge amounts in the exhibits. Israel is more conservative, it seems. I remember that the first time I went here, the police required that they install cameras. The production people said, “That’s not going to happen,” and in the end they reached a compromise – I don’t remember what it was, exactly. The truth is that I can’t really make a comparison with Burning Man in the United States, because I’m not familiar with the behind-the-scenes there.</p> \n<p>What do you do when you’re not in the desert?</p> \n<p>I’m a master’s student in computer sciences.</p> \n<p>Wow, that’s impressive. What’s your thesis subject?</p> \n<p>That’s a sensitive point.</p> \n<p>So you went away to think a little.</p> \n<p>You saw where I came from now.</p> \n<p>How did you choose where to go on the road trip?</p> \n<p>I had made a list of places, based on friends’ stories and from movies. After seeing all that nature I wanted a break, so I stopped in Vegas. I parked at a McDonald’s next to some sort of drug den and then wandered along the Strip, which is the main boulevard in the city. The first two days were great, nice, but nothing wild. I felt that I hadn’t had a Vegas experience, so I went to a party with a German woman. That was a pretty crazy night.</p> \n<p>Can you give us a taste?</p> \n<p>After we left the party, we went to a construction site, where there was a small tractor with a key in the ignition, and we drove it around a little.</p> \n<p>How did you know what to do?</p> \n<p>I played with the buttons.</p> \n<p>Was the woman impressed?</p> \n<p>Yes, but she had a boyfriend.</p> \n<p>What did you do in New York?</p> \n<p>I met a Saudi friend. He knows Hebrew, but keeps it a secret from his family, and that’s how we met. We met on a walking tour in London. We spent two hours talking. Since then we’ve been in touch on the internet. We spent a week together in New York. He’s a really interesting guy, he even sends a postcard to all his friends on their birthdays. That made me feel special, but when I got to his place, I saw a stack of postcards. He’s in high-tech, but he’s torn between life in New York and his family in Saudi Arabia. They want him to marry in a more traditional way.</p> \n<p>Maybe in the end we get along with those who most resemble us.</p> \n<p>We talked a lot about that in New York. My opinion is that you should live for yourself, and not for your family. But today my friend, in contrast to when he was younger, tends more to try and please his mother.</p>",

Merkel will later meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin.</p> \n<p>&quot;Almost 80 years ago, in the night of the pogroms of November 9th, the Jewish people in Germany were faced by hatred and violence of an unexpected scale,&quot;&nbsp;Merkel said at Yad Vashem. &quot;But what followed then were the unprecedented crimes of the Shoah, a breach of civilization. This is why it is Germany's everlasting responsibility to commemorate this crime and to oppose anti-Semitism, hatred and violence.&quot; The chancellor wrote the same words in the Yad Vashem visitor's book.</p> \n<p>Merkel also placed a wreath in the Hall of Remembrance.</p> \n<p>Later Thursday Merkel received an honorary doctorate from the University of Haifa at a special ceremony at the Israel Museum, where she met with students. The museum staged an innovation exhibition that Merkel and Netanyahu are expected to tour together with businesspeople from Israel and Germany.</p> \n<p>After a student asked Merkel if Germany would support a settlement between Israel and Hamas which would include the Israelis held in Gaza, she replied: &quot;When [Gilad] Shalit was imprisoned we made many efforts. Now we are making efforts but I would rather not elaborate.&quot;</p> \n<p>Merkel denied reports that she conditioned her visit on Israel not demolishing the contested West Bank village of Khan al-Ahmar.</p> \n<p>&quot;That's entirely not true,.&quot; she said. &quot;Again and again it was claimed set it as a condition for our visit. We never discussed it in the government.&quot; According to Merkel, &quot;the information that claimed we may not come to Israel came from Israel, and it's untrue. This is an Israeli decision and our visit has nothing to do with it.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;You can disagree with the settlements policy, and I definitely have some criticism on that, since I believe in the two-state solution,&quot; she said. &quot;But… we are two democracies and we can exchange opposing view, even here with the prime minister. Yet canceling the trip was never an option at any stage. I heard about it before the trip and I thought, 'Thank God, in half an hour we are taking off and then they'll believe us that we're coming. Really, sometimes it's like tilting at windmills.&quot;</p> \n<p>The chancellor also spoke about the situation in Syria, saying that &quot;the conflict between Iran and Israel has become more serious because of Syria.&quot; According to Merkel, &quot;that's why it's very good that Russia ensured&nbsp; an Iranian withdrawal from the Israeli border.&quot;</p> \n<p>Regarding the Iran nuclear deal, Merkel said: &quot;The question is whether the agreement with Iran is the right way to prevent it from [obtaining] a nuclear weapon, or if it's too weak. That's part of our ongoing discussion with Netanyahu.&quot;</p> \n<p>In the afternoon Merkel will meet with&nbsp;President Reuven Rivlin&nbsp;and later sit with Netanyahu privately, after which the two will hold a press conference.</p> \n<p>Merkel arrived in Israel Wednesday evening&nbsp;for bilateral cabinet talks aimed at discussing economic, security, scientific and cultural cooperation. After her arrival, Netanyahu and his wife had dinner with Merkel at the Prime Minister's residence in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Merkel wants to talk high-tech in Israel, but Iran and Palestinians may dampen mood&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The visit comes amid the imminent demolition of the West Bank Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar despite German calls to block the eviction. This is the seventh time such a meeting has been held between the two governments in the last decade.</p> \n<p>Merkel and Netanyahu are expected to discuss Iran and the escalation in Gaza. Merkel is also expected to issue a protest against Israel’s activities in Area C of the West Bank. Later on the ministers of the German and Israeli governments will meet with their counterparts, to be followed by a joint meeting of both cabinets. Merkel is set to return to Germany Thursday night.</p> \n<p>Merkel will not go to Ramallah or meet with Palestinian representatives during this visit. “The focus of the visit is on relations with Israel and she will meet with Israeli representatives,” the German Embassy in Israel told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>With reporting by DPA</p>",

        "text":["<p>Last week, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, emerged from a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sissi with lavish praise for his economic policies. “Egypt’s economy is showing strong signs of recovery, and its economic growth is among the highest in the Middle East,” she cooed.</p> \n<p>Depending on your political perspective, Lagarde is either a one of the responsible adults of the global financial system, ensuring that chronically mismanaged economies like Egypt don’t become disasters, or she is a sock puppet for the global plutocracy bent on capitalist profits, regardless of suffering caused to the Third World masses.</p> \n<p>Actually, both sides have a case. The fact is that the Egyptian economy has made remarkable progress in the last three years – at least by the measures that most concern the IMF and international investors. GDP growth exceeded 5% in the fiscal year ended in June, its strongest in a decade.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the government has cut its debt from 103.5% of GDP in fiscal 2017 to 86%, which is one reason why Moody’s (another grown-up or evil sock puppet) is optimistic about the country’s outlook. Egypt’s budget deficit fell below 10% for the first time since Hosni Mubarak was toppled in 2011 and the economy went into a tailspin.</p> \n<p>This was achieved with the help of a $12 billion loan the IMF granted Egypt in 2016, which moved Sissi to undertake a series of badly needed reforms. He cut energy subsidies, raised taxes, let the pound float freely and is introducing a raft of laws to make it easier to do business -- all things designed to please global investors, who have at least until recently been ready to buy Egyptian debt. Alas, Egypt had no choice about addressing their interests, because it so desperately needs their capital.</p> \n<p>Suffering in enforced silence</p> \n<p>For ordinary Egyptians, though, Egypt’s turnaround hasn’t been quite as dramatic. Quite to the contrary it’s caused a lot of suffering.</p> \n<p>The pound’s free float caused it to depreciate by some 50%, sending inflation soaring and pressuring the country’s poor and middle class. Inflation has slowed from a peak of more than 30% annually in the summer of 2017 but as of August, it was still a hefty 14.2% and looks to be heading higher again.</p> \n<p>Just as the pound sank, subsidy cuts required by the IMF have sent transportation costs up 50% and electricity reforms introduced in July are expected to boost power costs by 25%.</p> \n<p>Unemployment has fallen – to 9.9% in the second quarter, &nbsp;a level that many economies only experience at the depth of a recession. The fact is that Egypt’s economy isn’t growing fast enough to create jobs, especially for the young, among whom the jobless rate was close to 25% last year.</p> \n<p>Egypt's economic situation today echoes the years before 2011, when high economic growth failed to trickle down. The IMF crowd has learned nothing. It calls for inclusive growth but is more concerned with balancing the books.</p> \n<p>What rioting can't achieve</p> \n<p>Whether Egypt’s bifurcated economy endangers Sissi’s rule is harder to say. The president has made sure that discontent gets squashed. Last March’s presidential race was a one-man show. Laws restrict the activity of nongovernmental organizations. Scores of websites have been taken down, a law on “fake news” has gone into effect, and journalists and other critics have been jailed.</p> \n<p>If Egyptians are angry, they can’t blog about it or elect an Egyptian version of Donald Trump. The only alternative Sissi offers them is to take the streets. The bar is high for something like that, but once it’s surmounted, the probable outcomes are all horrendous. A thriving liberal, democratic, high-tech economy isn’t likely to be one of them.</p> \n<p>Worse still, even the changes lauded by Lagarde are themselves at risk.</p> \n<p>Egypt’s debt burden remains high, and a huge chunk of its budget is eaten up repaying it. With interest rates rising globally, emerging market economies like Egypt are going to have to pay even higher rates to lure lenders to buy its debt. Too much of Egypt’s growth is reliant on government spending, including development of a new capital in the desert east of Cairo, but the government will have fewer and fewer resources to keep up the spending.</p> \n<p>The revival of tourism, which has been another source of economy growth, could be reversed by a single high-profile terror attack, just as the bombing of a Russian plane full of tourists did in 2015. The Sinai remains a battleground between the regime and ISIS-affiliated groups.</p> \n<p>On top of all that, Saudi Arabia’s clampdown on foreign workers will send a lot of the Egyptians there home, depriving Egypt of billions of dollars in remittances and increasing the labor supply at a time when the jobless rate is close to double digits.</p> \n<p>Egypt’s troubles are Israel's troubles. Mubarak’s exit came dangerously close to turning Egypt into an Islamic republic and if Sissi were to meet the same fate history could easily repeat itself. Even without such an apocalyptic scenario, Israel needs a strong and stable government to keep order in Sinai and help manage Gaza.</p> \n<p>Last week brought the gas pipeline deal: Israel will be exporting gas found in its territorial waters to Egypt.</p> \n<p>So Israel has an economic stake in Egypt too. The pipeline deal alone is slated to generate $15 billion in exports for Israel over 10 years, but the more importantly Egypt is now emerging as the most promising conduit for exporting Israeli natural gas. This has huge economic implications for the years ahead: A popular revolution on the Egyptian street would probably tear up the paper the contract is written on while tearing down Cairo.</p>",

A day later, a third announced it had raised $50 million.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>In the biggest of the deals, Tapingo, which enables students on 150 U.S. campuses to order meals, was acquired by the U.S. company Grubhub. Upstream Commerce was bought for a reported $50 million by Indian online retailer Flipkart to help it deliver real-time pricing and product analytics to their sellers. Forter, an Israeli-American startup whose products protect online retailers from fraud in real-time, secured $50 million in new funding.</p> \n<p>Why are foreign companies and investors so interested in Israel retail tech?</p> \n<p>The answer, in a word, is Amazon. The U.S. company has built a seemingly unconquerable global retail empire by using technology that gives it insights into shoppers’ wants and needs and delivers their orders in increasingly less time.</p> \n<p>For Amazon’s rivals to stand a chance of keeping or increasing their market share, they have to match it with technology that is at least as good. That’s why Flipkart, which was acquired by the U.S. retailing giant Walmart in August, wanted Upstream Commerce and says it is on the hunt for more Israeli startups.</p> \n<p>“Israel isn’t the savior of the retail world, but there’s quite a bit of interesting activity here,” explained Daniel Cohen, a general partner at Viola Ventures.</p> \n<p>Flipkart is in a pitched battle with Amazon for the hearts of Indian consumers and is counting on Upstream Commerce to deliver real-time pricing and product analytics to its third-party sellers. The Upstream Commerce team will continue to work out of Israel and form one of the company’s global centers for data science research.</p> \n<p>Retailers have no choice but to confront Amazon. Online shopping grew by nearly 25% last year to $2.3 trillion, or nearly a 10th of all shopping. eMarketer, a research house, predicts that by 2020 e-commerce will reach no less than $4 trillion.</p> \n<p>Many companies lack the financial resources to go head-to-head with Amazon on technological innovation, and those that often don’t have the time or the luxury to develop it in-house. Israeli startups are a tempting shortcut to provide them with everything from shipping and packaging technology to automated pricing and drone delivery systems.</p> \n<p>The strength of Israeli technology is demonstrated by the fact that not only Amazon, but China’s Alibaba and eBay all have research and development centers in Israel. So when other companies buy and invest in Israeli companies, it’s also about getting control of Israeli human capital; by acquiring Upstream Commerce, for example, Flipkar acquired an Israeli R&amp;D center.</p> \n<p>And when Alibaba paid $15 million for Israeli company Visualead 10 months ago, it not only acquired the startup’s computer vision technology but also took on its core engineering team to create a DAMO (“discovery, adventure, momentum and outlook”) office in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Last year, Israel’s Flytrex partnered with AHA, Iceland’s largest instant delivery platform, to have drones pick up orders from restaurants and stores on one side of Reykjavik and fly them to a drop-off point in the suburb of Grafarvogur. Flytrex develops autonomous, drone-based delivery systems.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The sins of Israel’s business elite | Opinion</p> \n<p>Another innovator is CommonSense Robotics, whose technology is designed to help online grocers speed up fulfillment and delivery. Earlier this year it raised $20 million The CommonSense’s system utilizes robots to shelve products and bring them to human packers. The robots work in dedicated warehouses or microfulfilment centers small enough to be located in urban areas close to customers.</p> \n<p>According to Startup Nation Central, a nonprofit that promotes and surveys Israel’s high-tech industry, Israel currently has 419 startups specializing in retail tech. Nine have been acquired this year for a combined $392 million, while 20 others have raised $230 million.</p> \n<p>“The world of e-commerce innovation is divided into two areas — startups that provide solutions for players trying to compete with the big ones, and those that build a shop from scratch. For example, the acquisition of Upstream enables a large retail player like Wal-Mart to become significant and add technologies that make it competitive,” said Cohen.</p> \n<p>Viola, along with Qumra Capital and Jerusalem Venture Partners, is one of the leading funds investing in e-commerce technology. Viola has also invested in e-commerce companies themselves, such as GlassesUSA, which delivers prescription eyewear to the buyer within 48 hours, and Brayola, which sells lingerie online.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israel avoids trade wars, but keeps Chinese and Russia tech companies at arm’s length</p> \n<p>Israel is also home to The Shelf, an incubator for online retail technologies.</p> \n<p>“We built a platform that provides services for big retailers, who pay us to help them link up with the right startups for them in Israel,” said Managing Partner Ilan Leiferman. “We began two years ago to create an Israeli ecosystem, Then the hype was around fintech and cybersecurity. Ecommerce wasn’t on the funds’ agenda. But Amazon, Alibaba and eBay began to build Israel R&amp;D centers and things began to change.”</p> \n<p>Ironically, the Israeli shopper rarely benefits from all this tech. “We’re a small market, and the big players aren’t here, and the logistics infrastructure is also not available,” Cohen said. “There are things that work well, like supermarket delivery, but there’s still a lot of work to do.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Germany has always had a “special relationship” with Israel, in effect a long, long note of apology for the Holocaust.&nbsp; That’s very much to Germany’s credit. Few countries would take on a historical burden like that and truly act over a period of decades.</p> \n<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel, in an explanatory video before flying off to Israel this week, naturally made reference to the relationship, but tellingly she devoted much more time to discussing other interests.</p> \n<p>One is to step up Israeli-German stepped-up cooperation in research and development. The German leader arrived with a large delegation of businesspeople to explore deals in information technology and cybersecurity. “And, of course, we will also talks about the complicated political situation,” Merkel added.</p> \n<p>The media&nbsp;of course, are far more interested in the political situation, by which they mean the Palestinians and Iran.</p> \n<p>However, this media focus on the Palestinians is based mainly on force of habit. In the hard world of international relations in 2018, so long as the Palestinians aren’t causing trouble, the only way they can get the world to pay attention is to play the moral card, and that isn’t going to get them far.</p> \n<p>In 2018, technology has taken over our lives. We use it to manage our social lives. It is the conduit for consuming information. We use technology &nbsp;to shop, and soon it will be doing our driving for us and (if artificial intelligence lives up to its promise) much of our thinking, too. Tech companies dominate business and the economy, and now they are coming to the fore in diplomacy and international relations.</p> \n<p>A half century ago, no country could claim to be a leading economic power if it wasn’t industrialized. Now the rule is that no country can become a leading power unless its economy not only uses high-tech products and services, but knows how to develop them. Innovative prowess is essential: it can’t be outsourced.</p> \n<p>China is case study No. 1, of a country that knows the new rules and is working feverishly to ensure its leadership and even surpass America in key areas like artificial intelligence. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>America is case study No. 2: Donald Trump isn’t just worried about America’s trade deficit with China but about Beijing’s technology ambitions.</p> \n<p>Where Germany lags&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Merkel also frets about Germany’s place in an emerging global power structure where technology is so critical.</p> \n<p>In 20th-century terms, Germany is at the top of the economic heap – one of the world’s leading industrial powers and home to some of the world’s best-known companies.</p> \n<p>But in 21st-century terms, Germany’s and Europe’s situation isn’t nearly so enviable.&nbsp; Back from a trip to China earlier this year, where she observed China’s high-tech drive first hand, Merkel is now trying to develop a strategy to put Germany in the forefront of AI, the technology that is widely expected to pace all other tech developments in the foreseeable future. Germans do high-quality research, but they have trouble turning it into commercial products.</p> \n<p>In that context, if we were to draw a map of how the world looks in terms of AI prowess, Germany looks like a second-string player.</p> \n<p>A report by the German consulting firm Roland Berger found that the United States has the greatest number of AI startups: 1,393, or 40% of the world’s total. &nbsp;China was next with 383, or 11%.</p> \n<p>All of Europe has less AI startups than America, at 769. Also, as the report noted, “No individual European Union state achieves critical mass.” &nbsp;Germany was home to just 106 AI startups.</p> \n<p>And what about Israel? Unfurl your blue-and-white flags, because we had 362, almost as many as China and the third-largest assemblage the world.</p> \n<p>Germany has now gotten on the same line as China, India and Japan, among others, seeking to become best, best tech friends with Israel. We’re a country that has more innovation resources than it can even begin to exploit on its own. And it’s not just AI, it’s also cybersecurity, autotech and even retail-tech.</p> \n<p>Technology has put Israel into a place in the world pecking order unimaginable a decade or two ago.</p> \n<p>Nakba II</p> \n<p>For the Palestinians, these developments are tantamount to Nakba II (or maybe III, if you count Trump’s election), a setback of historical proportions in their quest for a state.</p> \n<p>There was a time when Israel was such a small player in the global economy that it could be pushed around: boycotted by the Arab world and much of world businesses. Israel was shunned diplomatically and the object of lecturing by Europe.</p> \n<p>No more. Merkel may talk about the “political situation” and Europe may occasional administer a symbolic wrist slap, but Israel has become too important for anyone to upset critical technology relations.</p> \n<p>Israel may squander its assets by under-investing in its tech sector through poor schools and niggardly university budgets. Right now, however, I’d be more concerned about Netanyahu is exploiting Israel’s strong hand.</p> \n<p>The prime minister is very cognizant of the value of Israeli technology to the world, but he is beholden to the interests of settlers and the Kulturkampf being orchestrated by the right. Alas, rather than using Israel’s growing power to defend globalism and the liberal order, he’s using it to ignore the Palestinians and allow the assault on Israeli democracy to go on, unimpeded by foreign criticism.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Just when you think Donald Trump can’t go any lower, he digs deeper into his bottomless pit of slander and slime. Just when you start to believe Trump’s reaction to the Brett Kavanaugh imbroglio has been relatively restrained, he lets loose with an ugly, demeaning tirade against Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine Basley Ford. Just when you're convinced that you’re all out of outrage, you find yourself once again indignant and incensed that this vulgar, amoral and misogynistic man is President of the United States.</p> \n<p>The first and immediate assumption is that Trump’s vile bile against Ford at a Tuesday night rally in Mississippi is connected to the concurrent publication of the momentous New York Times exposure of his blatant lies about the wealth he inherited from his father, Fred, and the potential tax crimes he may have committed in acquiring it. If there was a Nobel Prize for Journalism – and perhaps there should be – the Times’ meticulous and detailed report would justify giving it the inaugural award. The Times deserves a medal of valor for the newspaper’s courageous willingness to stick it directly, and potentially dangerously, to the Commander in Chief. It stands to reason that Trump’s intent was to divert attention away from the Times’ 13,000 damning words. Judging by Wednesday morning’s headlines – including this column - he certainly seems to have achieved at least partial success.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Despite Flake, the Kavanaugh-Ford hearings showcase the death of truth and decline of democracy in Trump’s America&nbsp;■&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;Trump, Kavanaugh and the rape culture of the American jock&nbsp;■ Analysis:&nbsp;Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony Is a historic achievement for the #MeToo movement</p> \n<p>It might also be the case that Trump was simply being his own obnoxious self, using his delinquent mouth to tear down the facade of measured reaction imposed on him by advisers and spin doctors. Whenever Trump seems restrained or contrite - as he was, for example, in his so-called “apology” in October 2016 for the infamous “grab ‘em by the pussy” Access Hollywood tape - he looks like a hostage deadpanning his kidnappers’ message. It’s a look that Trump can’t keep up for more than a few hours, let alone the many days that have passed since Ford's accusations first surfaced, without getting antsy.</p> \n<p>So he used the first venue in which he found himself unfettered and unmonitored – and possibly apprised of the probable inconclusive findings of the FBI investigation into Ford's accusations - to let loose about what he really thinks. And what he really thinks is that Ford’s allegations of a sexual assault that occurred 36 years ago are so ridiculous that they warrant a reprise of his shocking November 2015 imitation of physically impaired New York Times reporter Sergei Kovaleski. Given the fact that Trump was elected President despite the pussy tape, the shameful mimicking of a disabled reporter and the endless list of his other scandals and provocations, he may believe, perhaps correctly, that he can get away with dissing Ford as well.</p> \n<p>Trump went on to add insult to indecency by making clear that Ford’s allegations of Kavanaugh’s attempted rape in high school didn’t make him any more sympathetic to sexually assaulted females or empathetic to the hell they are forced to endure when they decide to tell of their travails. Trump certainly wasn’t bothered by the “rape culture” he encouraged with his Access Hollywood tape or by the “white male privilege” flaunted by the 11 Republican men on the Senate Judicial Committee.</p> \n<p>On the contrary, what troubles Trump is that &quot;It's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of,” as he told Mississippians. He had nothing to say about the men - young, middle-aged or old, like him - who are guilty more often than not but escape unscathed and unpunished for their crimes because their accusers risk exposure to the kind of jeering disdain with which Trump enthused his cheering fans in Mississippi.</p> \n<p>After all, Trump himself has been accused by close to 20 women of various acts of harassment, molestation and general debauchery. In his narcissistic mindset, however, he is the victim, unfairly maligned, and they are the perpetrators, out to besmirch what he seems to think is his good name. By sticking up for Kavanaugh and by publicly undermining Ford’s account Trump, as always, is looking out for number one.</p> \n<p>And then there is the possibility that Trump’s offensive assault on Ford was actually a calculated political maneuver in advance of the November 6 Congressional elections. Faced with a possible trouncing by Democrats, at least in the House of Representatives, Trump decided to double down on the divisive formula that brought him to the White House in the first place.</p> \n<p>Rather than try to win back moderate Republicans, especially women, who are appalled by the Kavanaugh affair and may jump the GOP’s ship in the Congressional elections, Trump is actually pushing them even further away, in an effort to whip up his core base – white men – and the substantial number of women who stand with them, against their own gender. So he threw his right-wing base the kind of red meat it cherishes.</p> \n<p>By casting doubt on Ford’s testimony, Trump cements the Lindsey Graham narrative of a nefarious Democratic/liberal conspiracy against Kavanaugh, and, by extension, against himself. By invoking the plight of supposedly persecuted young men, he is reminding his fans of his pledge to “Make America Great Again,” which apparently includes a return to the days when men were men and girls were there to make them feel like it. By whipping up his base to frenzy, by catering to their paranoid delusions, by insinuating that Kavanaugh is just another victim of the Criminal Deep State and its liberal agents, Trump is trying to bridge the pronounced gender and enthusiasm gaps between Democrats and Republicans detected by pollsters in recent weeks. So he deploys the same kind of abusive rhetoric against his long list of enemies - everyone from immigrants to intelligence officers – in order to put his base on notice that the liberal/minorities are at the gate, and Ford is their Trojan horse.</p> \n<p>Trump’s gambit seems like a losing proposition. His base, even when extended to its maximum potential, is hardly enough to stop a Democratic wave comprised of dedicated Trump-haters and reinforced by moderate disillusioned Republicans. On the other hand, this is more or less what all the experts said on the eve of the Presidential Elections, and the rest is the history that has brought America down to Trump’s obscene, women-hating hell.</p>",

He appears on the controversial Canary Mission website, which publishes online dossiers on pro-Palestinian professors, students and campus speakers, and has been referenced by Israeli officials when refusing activists entry to the country.</p> \n<p>His most controversial moment came in 2015 when he attempted to teach an honors tutorial outside his academic field called “Perspective on Zionism.” The course was to have included as a central text “The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine” by Israeli historian and anti-Zionist Ilan Pappe, according to a report in the Columbia Daily Tribune that quoted Smith as defining his position as wishing “not for Israel’s Jewish population to be expelled,” but “an end to the discriminatory regime in Palestine.” He is opposed, he said, to “Jewish ethnic sovereignty over other peoples.”</p> \n<p>Following protests by university alumni, pro-Israel student groups and an outcry by pro-Israel advocacy groups, his course was canceled, the cancellation attributed to “a lack of enrollment.”</p> \n<p>That controversy, however, has not deterred Smith from continuing to speak out.

        "text":["<p>Update: Russia showcases S-300 missiles' arrival in Syria</p> \n<p>The September 16 attack by the Israel Air Force in Latakia, at whose conclusion Syria’s aerial defense system downed a Russian intelligence-gathering aircraft, came at the end of a particularly sensitive day in the Syrian arena. A few hours earlier, in Sochi, Russia, the president of that country and Turkey had agreed on details of an arrangement which, for the time being, is delaying a major airstrike by the Russians against the tens of thousands of rebels and nearly three million civilians who are trapped in the Idlib enclave. That area, located in northern Syria, is the last central bastion remaining to opponents of Syrian President Bashar Assad after seven-and-a-half years of civil war.</p> \n<p>The Assad regime had intended to seize control of Idlib in the same way that it has restored its rule over two-thirds of the country’s territory in the past few years – via murderous pommeling with the aid of Russian bombers, at the end of which the rebels hoist the white flag. However, the Russians and Syrians have discovered that the battle for Idlib will be different from the one waged in Aleppo and elsewhere. For the first time, the Russians have encountered limits on their use of power in Syria.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion: Thank you, Mother Russia, for imposing boundaries on Israel&nbsp;■&nbsp;'Putin made a move, but it's a big playing field': Israeli official addresses 'challenge' of S-300 in Syria</p> \n<p>Foreseeing strong resistance in Idlib, the Assad regime had deployed for the extensive use of “neutralizing” chemical weaponry, chlorine gas (while, concomitantly, reports appeared in the Russian media about plots among the rebels to fake a chemical attack against them). However, Turkey has insisted on backing the rebels, who are situated close to its southern border, while the United States and France have threatened to use force against Syria’s regime if it resorts to use of chemical weapons again.</p> \n<p>Under such circumstances, the Russians, in two meetings – in Tehran and afterward in Sochi – decided to come to an agreement with Ankara on freezing the status quo. The region south of Idlib is to be declared a demilitarized zone, Turkey will be responsible for ensuring that the rebels’ heavy weapons are removed from the enclave, and Turkish and Russian forces will enforce the cease-fire. At some point, Moscow could well violate the agreement, when it’s convenient for it, but in the meantime Idlib will remain a stick in the regime’s craw, along with the U.S. troops stationed at the Tanf airbase in southern Syria, and the Kurdish-held areas in the northeast. At this stage, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin is being forced to rein in his ambitions. The agreement was reached to the chagrin of President Assad, who had counted on another lethal show of force by the Russians.</p> \n<p>As that agreement was being hammered out, a convoy of trucks in Latakia, Syria, was preparing for another smuggling mission from that country to Lebanon. According to the Israel Defense Forces, this time the goods, whose delivery was organized by Tehran, included means of production for improving the level of accuracy of rockets being used by Hezbollah. In preparatory meetings held by the IDF General Staff, an attack on those goods was deemed essential and urgent.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;With Russia's S-300 in Syria, Israel will have to think twice about the next strike</p> \n<p>The attack proceeded like dozens and hundreds of previous strikes in recent years. Four F-16s took off from an IAF base in the south, flew north, and when they reached a high altitude east of Cyprus, released their munitions at the targets in Latakia. In the IDF debriefing, details of which were also presented to the Russians, the time that appears for the firing of the munitions is 9:42 P.M. According to the army, the Russians were given an advance warning at 9:38, four minutes before the start of the firing. The munition itself hit the target at 9:50. (Russia maintains that it got a warning of only one minute.) At the time the munitions were dispatched, a Russian Ilyushin aircraft was in the skies of northern Syria, about 200 kilometers east of the Israeli planes. For a reason that the Russians are not explaining, the plane did not have an identification system (known as “identification, friend or foe”), which would have enabled the Syrians on the ground to recognize that the aircraft belonged to their ally.</p> \n<p>The Ilyushin continued westward. At 9:52 P.M., Syrian air defenses started to go berserk, firing 27 missiles every which way. At 10:05 P.M., the Russian plane was hit by a missile fired by an S-200 battery. By this time, the Israeli planes were near Haifa, on their way to landing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel has vehemently rejected a Russian claim that one of the F-16s hid behind the Ilyushin. The two aircraft were flying in different areas, at different altitudes and at different speeds. It’s possible – and if so, it would reveal a particularly low level of professional capability – that the Syrians mistakenly identified other Israeli planes as a result of the IDF’s use of electronic warfare, which is routine operational behavior according to foreign media reports. The Russians, in any case, should have known where the Israeli planes were. Israel is convinced that the radar image published by the Russians in their debriefing of the incident is simply fabricated – the F-16s were not in the place that the Russians claim they were when the Ilyushin was hit.</p> \n<p>The downing of the plane was another serious blow to the Russians, following the compromise forced on them with respect to Idlib. Moscow, and notably its chain of command in Syria, has been extremely unhappy about the ongoing series of Israeli attacks in recent years, and believe that they have sometimes endangered its personnel in the field. Russia’s defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, has led the hawkish line, under the influence of top officials in Syria. The Kremlin has other concerns, too, focusing on the Trump administration – including the United States’ withdrawal from the nuclear agreement with Iran and the 12-point list of demands on Iran of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, which for the first time constitutes exertion of heavy pressure on the Iranian regime, together with continuation of the U.S. campaign against ISIS and Al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>Like Moscow, Jerusalem, too, believes that Washington holds the key to the termination of the crisis in Syria. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday, after speaking with U.S. President Donald Trump on the fringes of the UN General Assembly meeting in New York, that he got from Trump “everything I asked for” and that the president “gave explicit directives on the subject.”</p> \n<p>In the meantime, at Putin’s request, the first S-300 missile systems will arrive in Syria as soon as early next week. The Russian move, which Jerusalem has protested and the United States condemned, will constitute a new obstacle to future Israeli moves against Iran in Syria. To date, Israel views these as a success: Iran has not realized its ambitions at the pace and the scope it had planned. A considerable proportion of its attempts to smuggle advanced weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon have been thwarted. Nor will Iran have a naval or air base in Syria at the end of 2018 (the Assad regime refused to allow this, under Russian pressure), and it has not deployed 100,000 Shi’ite militiamen in Syria, as planned. Iran has also been forced to vacate its military compound at the Syrian T-4 airbase, adjacent to Homs, against the background of repeated Israeli attacks. In the civilian realm, however, the Iranians are moving ahead. This is reflected in a heavily funded program for Shi’ite indoctrination of Syria’s Alawite minority, which is identified with the regime, and includes the takeover of institutes of education and academia under the nose of President Assad.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Russia says S-300 air defense systems have already been delivered to Syria</p> \n<p>The assessment of Israeli intelligence is that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards are determined to continue their efforts to achieve military consolidation in Syria and will not desist, despite the demurrer of President Hassan Rohani. In these circumstances, the political and military consensus in Israel is that the IDF will have no choice but to continue to attack Iranian targets in Syria, and that to call off the strikes would be an abdication of responsibility in the realm of security.</p> \n<p>In what appears to be an outbreak of exaggerated optimism, Israel hopes that Russia will ultimately get over its anger at the downing of its aircraft. Much of that depends on the position Trump will take. As of this week, the president’s advisers have been able to persuade him to leave some 3,000 American soldiers in Syria – at Tanf and in the Kurdish region. Moscow wants the Americans out, but the United States insists that its departure is contingent on Iranian military personnel leaving Syria.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There seems to be an opportunity here for a comprehensive settlement in Syria, but that depends, as usual, on the scale of the interest and seriousness to be demonstrated by the Trump administration. Some will say that the likelihood that the opportunity will not be realized is already built into the wording of the question.</p>",

        "text":["<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel landed in Israel on Wednesday evening for a traditional bilateral cabinet consultation between the two governments. The German leader attended an official dinner at the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem and signed the guestbook.</p> \n<p>The visit takes place as the West Bank Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar faces imminent demolition, despite calls from Germany to block the eviction.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>During the visit, which takes place almost every year, alternating between Berlin and Jerusalem, the leaders of the two countries meet and there are also discussions between the ministers and joint sessions of the two cabinets.</p> \n<p>Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi greeted Merkel at the airport and said: &quot;The strong ties between our countries continues to tighten!&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;The Germans will ignore Israeli apartheid again</p> \n<p>This event was first proposed by Merkel during the term of former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and is aimed at highlighting the close relationship between Germany and Israel.</p> \n<p>To mark the visit, Bedouin children in the West Bank village of Khan al-Ahmar demonstrated Tuesday with pictures of Chancellor Merkel and called for her to help stopping&nbsp; the demolition of the village.</p> \n<p>One of the students, Iman Abu Dahuk, said that the schoolchildren and the residents expect Merkel to work with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli government to prevent the evacuation and demolition: &quot;For the past two and a half months we have been living in inhumane conditions and we are constantly afraid that the bulldozers may enter any moment. I hope that Mrs. Merkel will succeed in getting the message out and prevent the demolition.&quot;</p> \n<p>The ultimatum issued by the Civil Administration to the residents of Khan al-Ahmar to evacuate on their own officially expired at the beginning of the week.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>None of the residents has demolished his home, however, and therefore Israel is expected to implement the demolition orders as stated in the notice given to residents on September 23. The demolition and evacuation will not take place while Merkel is in Israel due to diplomatic sensitivities. She is expected to raise the issue during her meeting with Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The eviction of Khan al-Ahmar stinks up to high heaven&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>Earlier on Tuesday, members of Israeli and German opposition parties met – Meretz, led by MK Mossi Raz and the German Alliance 90/The Greens, led by Bundestag member Omid Nouripour – and they formulated a joint statement calling for “Ending the occupation, stopping the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar and halting the trend of the strengthening of the far right both in Germany and in Israel.”</p> \n<p>Also attending the meeting was former MK Colette Avital, member of the Meretz Executive Uri Zaki, and a political adviser to the Greens, Michael Hack.</p> \n<p>According to Raz, “The evacuation of Khan al-Ahmar is a war crime that contravenes international law. I hope the international community will mobilize to help stop the demolition of the community and put pressure on the Israeli government.” Nouripour claimed the Palestinians &quot;need a lot of help, as there is a sense of despair among the Palestinian public in the territories.&quot;</p> \n<p>Speaking of the cash-strapped agency UNRWA, Nouripour added that &quot;the German government is determined to ensure UNRWA’s continued work&quot;, adding &quot;We also hope that the destruction of Khan al-Ahmar will be stopped.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The Khan al-Ahmar demolition will be ugly&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>The Combatants for Peace movement also issued a letter calling on Merkel to prevent the evacuation and demolition of Khan al-Ahmar. “While you, the honorable chancellor, will dine with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and take part in the discussions at the Israeli Knesset, you must know that only half an hour from Jerusalem there are people who live in constant fear of losing their homes. In the coming days, a village of hundreds of Palestinian Bedouins and a school of over 100 students will be destroyed and evacuated by force,” the movement’s members wrote.  Merkel is staying at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. On Thursday morning she will first visit Yad Vashem and place a wreath in the Hall of Remembrance. She will then receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Haifa at a special ceremony at the Israel Museum, where she will meet with students. The museum is staging an innovation exhibition that Merkel and Netanyahu will tour together with businesspeople from Israel and Germany.</p> \n<p>Lunch on Thursday will be with President Reuven Rivlin and at 2 P.M. she will meet with Netanyahu privately, after which the two will hold a press conference. The two are expected to discuss Iran and the escalation in Gaza, with Merkel is expected to issue a protest against Israel’s activities in Area C of the West Bank. Later on the ministers of the German and Israeli governments will meet with their counterparts, to be followed by a joint meeting of both cabinets. Merkel will be returning to Germany Thursday night.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The Germans will ignore Israeli apartheid again&nbsp;|| Opinion</p> \n<p>Merkel will not go to Ramallah or meet with Palestinian representatives during this visit. “The focus of the visit is on relations with Israel and she will meet with Israeli representatives,” the German Embassy in Israel told Haaretz.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 2017 Merkel canceled the intergovernmental meeting. The official reason was the election in Germany, but German and Israeli officials said another reason was German dissatisfaction with the law allowing the expropriation of private Palestinian land passed by the Knesset at the time.</p> \n<p>In June Netanyahu met Merkel in Berlin during a visit to Europe that included stops in London and Paris.</p> \n<p>Merkel said then at a joint press conference that Iran’s plan for ballistic missiles had to be dealt with. “The issue of Iran’s regional influence is a very worrying one … which is why we believe we must make every effort we can to address the ballistic missile program.”&nbsp; She added, however, that Germany still believes that the Iran nuclear agreement will prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>",

It lifted secrecy on and published a list of 20 organizations whose members would be denied entry into Israel.</p> \n<p>According to Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan, entry into Israel would be denied to activists on the basis of &quot;de facto promoting the delegitimization of Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; When Israeli patriotism exceeds rationalism and the good of the state | Analysis&nbsp;■ Lara Alqasem and Israel's anti-constitutional revolution | Opinion</p> \n<p>Interior Minister Arye Dery, whose ministry is charged with carrying out interrogation, detention, and deportation of activists, backed Erdan, declaring: &quot;These people are trying to exploit the law and our hospitality to act against Israel and to defame the country. I will act against this by every means.&quot;</p> \n<p>Let's assume, for the moment, that they're right, that activists whose words and deeds delegitimize, isolate, and blacken the image of Israel should be stopped at the border, grilled like drug mules, and put on the next plane out.</p> \n<p>It's high time, then, that we who are concerned for Israel's welfare went after the worst of its de-legitimizers. It's time we barred entry to the most influential and effective of the ringleaders of demonization, those who contribute the most to the criticism of Israel as a repressive, illiberal regime.</p> \n<p>Here, then, is a draft of the new blacklist.</p> \n<p>1. GILAD ERDAN – As minister for public security, strategic affairs and, incredibly, hasbara, or Israeli public relations, Erdad did enough to make the delegitimization list last year when,&nbsp;among other outrages,&nbsp;he rushed to declare that Negev Bedouin Israeli teacher Yakub Abu al-Kiyan, killed by police during the demolition of his home, was a &quot;terrorist&quot; apparently motivated by ISIS.</p> \n<p>Erdan, who later quietly walked back the charge, has spearheaded the effort to deport American student Lara Alqasem, who received a visa to study for a masters at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, only to be detained now for weeks at Ben-Gurion Airport over spurious allegations that she supports BDS and represents a threat to Israel.</p> \n<p>The judicial handling of the case, so amateurish and biased as to have caused the expression &quot;kangaroo court&quot; to take on the colors of an undeserved compliment, has acted to further delegitimize Israel, a particularly flagrant example of the Netanyahu government's bizarre, internally bickering and fundamentally self-defeating efforts to &quot;fight&quot; boycotts.</p> \n<p>Erdan has further delegitimized Israel by casting himself as both the martyred saint and the hero in the case, blaming criticism of his actions on unnamed &quot;leftists&quot; out to get him. Erdan failed to mention that among those who have strongly criticized his and Israel's handling of the case are the conservative, strongly pro-Israel New York Times columnists Bret Stephens and Bari Weiss, who decried the &quot;paranoid policy&quot; under which Alqasem was detained. &quot;Societies that shun or expel their critics aren’t protecting themselves,&quot; they wrote. &quot;They are advertising their weakness.&quot;</p> \n<p>If that were not enough, right-leaning former Israeli Ambassador to Washington Michael Oren declared last week that &quot;the policy that is being implemented now is clearly causing us political damage,&quot; urging&nbsp;“a re-examination of Israel’s policy in order to protect ourselves and our image as a democratic and enlightened society.”</p> \n<p>2. CANARY MISSION – The con artists who supplied to Erdan and Deri's people the disingenuous, simplistic and misleading accusations which led to Alqasem's detention, Canary Mission&nbsp;is a cowardly, anonymous, clumsily childish parody of McCarthyite crusaderism in bogus &quot;pro-Israel&quot; form.</p> \n<p>A back-room online &quot;organization&quot; lavishly financed through fleecing of Jewish institutions and a super-hush-hush-donor network, Canary Mission has played the Israeli system all the way up to conning Erdan's super-hush-hush-we're-playing-spies multi-million-dollar cash cow / pork barrel / budgeted-at-$72 million boondoggle &quot;non-profit anti-delegitimization corporation&quot; known as Kela Shlomo, or Solomon's Slingshot.</p> \n<p>Canary Mission's methods, its cultivation of its own non-transparency, the lies it tells, the blacklist it promotes, the reputations and lives it seeks to ruin, have already done more serious harm to Israel and the Netanyahu government than has anyone Canary Mission has – often entirely unfairly – named.</p> \n<p>3. MIRI REGEV – Netanyahu's culture minister, who rose to prominence by branding Sudanese asylum seekers in Israel as &quot;a cancer in our body,&quot; is now pushing for passage of a bill known as the &quot;Loyalty in Culture Law&quot; or, simply, the &quot;Miri Regev Law.&quot;</p> \n<p>The law aims to expand on two previous measures which have served to delegitimize Israel, the Naqba law (meant to penalize observance of the Palestinian experience in the wake of Israel's 1948 war of independence, during which some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced to flee their homes) and the&nbsp;boycott law.</p> \n<p>If the new bill is passed, Regev would have the power to silence artists by cutting funding for art that criticizes Israel and/or the Netanyahu government – including, for example, denying that Israel is a democracy.</p> \n<p>4. KOHELET FORUM – For initiating, promoting, and driving to passage the nation-state law, the single most damaging law to Israel's image – and future – as a democratic state, the little known, hugely influential neo-conservative Kohelet Forum think tank may have done more to harm Israel than any other single organization.</p> \n<p>Soon after the law was passed in July, for example, State Attorney Harel Arnon said the government planned to use the measure as the constitutional basis for&nbsp;retroactively legalizing settlement outposts&nbsp;that even Israel had seen as illegal.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the far-reaching nation-state law may be just the beginning. Kohelet Executive Director Meir Rubin has been quoted as boasting, but with good reason: “We run the Knesset”</p> \n<p>5. OREN HAZAN – The Likud lawmaker last week effectively attacked the concept of Israel as a state where Jews and Arabs live in equality and co-existence by issuing a scathing and stridently bigoted public attack&nbsp;on Israeli Arab news anchor Lucy Aharish for having married Jewish Israeli&nbsp; actor Tzachi Halevy, &nbsp;known for his role in the series Fauda.</p> \n<p>“I don’t blame Lucy Aharish for seducing a Jewish soul with the goal of harming our country and for preventing more Jewish progeny from continuing the Jewish dynasty, on the contrary she is welcome to convert.” Hazan also assailed &quot;his brother&quot; Halevy for &quot;Islamizing.&quot;</p> \n<p>6. YARIV LEVIN – The Likud tourism minister – the nation-state law's legislative whip, and among those who insisted that the word &quot;equality&quot; not be included in the law - this week took a further step toward delegitimizing Israel when he dismissed the murder of a Palestinian woman in the West Bank, possibly at the hands of stone-throwing Israeli settlers, as no more than a &quot;cast-off snippet of an incident.&quot;</p> \n<p>7. AVIGDOR LIEBERMAN – Where to begin? Perhaps at the end – the defense minister's decision, against the advice of his own generals and senior civilian security officials, to collectively punish&nbsp;all residents of the Gaza Strip for incendiary balloon and kite arson attacks against neighboring Israeli towns, kibbutzim and moshavim.</p> \n<p>Lieberman has touted his cutting-off of fuel supplies to Gaza – already crippled by a&nbsp;humanitarian disaster&nbsp;in which drinking water and electricity are in dangerously short supply – to burnish his tough-guy image ahead of elections.</p> \n<p>8. ARYE DERY – As interior minister, Dery has overseen the detention at the border of a lengthening list of suspected enemies of Israel. Among them: Jennifer Spitzer (formerly Gorovitz), former head of the San Francisco Jewish Federation, detained for questioning at the airport over her current role as vice president of the New Israel Fund; pro-Israel philanthropist Meyer Koplow, chairman of the board of Brandeis University; Simone Zimmerman, a prominent American Jewish anti-occupation activist who lives and works in Israel, whose interrogation included her opinion of Netanyahu; and noted U.S. author and commentator Peter Beinart, who had come to Israel to attend his niece's bat-mitzvah.</p> \n<p>9. U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL DAVID FRIEDMAN – For harming Israel by alienating and enraging American Jews, when he stated that the vast majority of them, those who advocated a two-state solution, were &quot;worse than kapos&quot; and that J Street and its supporters were &quot;just smug advocates of Israel’s destruction.&quot; And for refusing to apologize until he was forced to do so, on pain of not being confirmed to the ambassadorial post.</p> \n<p>10. ISRAEL AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON RON DERMER - The onetime Republican Party operative turned Netanyahu whisperer,&nbsp;for harming Israel by&nbsp;boycotting and refusing to meet with&nbsp;</p> \n<p>J Street and other left-of-center but avowedly pro-Israel groups of American Jews. At the same time, he has delegitimized Israel and undermined traditionally bipartisan support by unashamedly favoring Republicans and Donald Trump, for whom he helped draft an address to AIPAC during the 2016 campaign.</p> \n<p>11. YAIR NETANYAHU – For harming Israel by promoting anti-Semitism, by using anti-Semitic imagery in &quot;defending&quot; his father the prime minister against suspicions of corruption – an effort praised by onetime KKK leader David Duke.</p> \n<p>12. BEZALEL SMOTRICH – For harming Israel by a continuing series of statements expressing unconditional hatred of Arabs and gays. The coalition legislator has distinguished himself by stating, for example, that Israeli maternity wards should be segregated because &quot;it is natural that my wife would not want to lay down next to someone who just gave birth to a baby who might want to murder her baby in another 20 years.&quot;</p> \n<p>13. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU – For delegitimizing Israel by promoting anti-democratic legislation and by alienating and enraging Reform and Conservative Jews, reneging on specific agreements and selling out to Orthodox pressure on the key issue of egalitarian prayer at the Western Wall. For harming Israel by promoting anti-Semitism, praising authoritarian world leaders who have fomented hatred of Jews and have vilified philanthropist George Soros as an avatar for a world Jewish conspiracy. For harming Israel by exploiting the Holocaust to pursue political goals.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",

The Supreme Court ruled that a child whose father was a Jew was a Jew as far as the Population Registry was concerned.</p> \n<p>The religious parties, led by the National Religious Party, threatened to break up the governing coalition. Golda Meir, the prime minister at the time, gave in to the pressure and in early 1970 Knesset members began legislating a new version of the Law of Return, which stated that only someone whose mother was Jewish would be allowed to immigrate, thus basing Jewishness on Jewish law.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The bill, once it passed its second vote in the full Knesset, led to a protest that many people joined at the initiative of the League Against Religious Coercion in Israel. The peak was a demonstration by thousands in February 1970 that reached the gates of the Knesset. Reform Rabbi Tovia Ben Chorin, author Dahn Ben-Amotz and Shalom Cohen, a representative of news weekly Haolam Hazeh, took part.</p> \n<p>The main claim was that the State of Israel is meant to serve as a refuge for any persecuted Jew. Nazi Germany’s Nuremberg Laws from 1935 defined Jewishness based on the father’s side as well. At the demonstration, the claim was made that if Israel had been founded in 1938 – not 1948 – and if the religious parties’ opinion held sway, hundreds of thousands more Jews would have been sentenced to death at Auschwitz.</p> \n<p>This protest convinced Meir to ask for the advice of her justice minister, Ya’akov Shimshon Shapira, who forced the religious parties to accept a stipulation saying that anyone defined as a Jew by the Nazis (except those who had converted to another religion) would be granted Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and receive the benefits granted to new Jewish immigrants. But to keep the peace within the coalition, they would not be recognized as Jews!</p> \n<p>This applies to some 200,000 to 300,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union; they have Israeli citizenship but are not recognized as Jews. Thus, people who are Jews based on the Bible – from the seed of Abraham – have been left behind. Soon enough, the achievement of the League Against Religious Coercion enabled the mass immigration from behind the Iron Curtain.</p> \n<p>The current nation-state law revokes a section of the Law of Return in stating that the state “will be open for Jewish immigration and the ingathering of exiles.” This law is a Basic Law and cannot be amended without a special majority in the Knesset. Saying that “Jewish immigration” is ensured means preventing immigration by anyone not Jewish based on Jewish law.</p> \n<p>Thus, the modest achievement that enabled the mass immigration from Europe has been erased along with the aliyah of unique groups such as Ethiopian Jews and the Karaites, whose roots are determined based on the biblical test – of being from the seed of Abraham. Reform Jews too, whose Jewishness is determined by the origin of the father or mother, and whose conversions are not accepted by the Orthodox Rabbinate, will not be allowed to immigrate.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: Israel’s Unholy and Transient Alliance With U.S. Evangelicals |&nbsp;Editorial</p> \n<p>By emphasizing that &quot;Jewish immigration&quot; will be encouraged, the nation-state law cancels the section of the Law of Return from 1970, which was achieved through tremendous struggle in the name of the far-flung Jews. The wording of the nation-state law reverses the achievements of the struggle over “who is a Jew” and who is entitled to make aliyah and receive equal rights. It surrenders to the 1970 proposal by the National Religious Party that the Knesset rejected.</p> \n<p>Someone observing what Israeli politicians are cooking up could understand that the support of the evangelical Christians is preferable to a dialogue with the Jews of the United States. Relying on the messianism in Israel along with that of the evangelicals has blinded the country’s leaders who are consciously deepening the rift with world Jewry. Is the blindness paralyzing us at the moment nothing but a disastrous repeat of the disgrace of the messianism of Sabbatai Zevi of the 17th century and Jacob Frank of the 18th?</p> \n<p>Isn’t it amazing that we have erased from the national memory the blood that was spilled by the Crusaders, who on their way to Jerusalem murdered multitudes of Jews? Today Israel’s leaders are standing at the head of crusades by evangelical Christianity. With a high degree of certainty it can be assumed that the dependence on the evangelicals – and not on world Jewry – is what guided those who legislated the nation-state law with all its deceits.</p> \n<p>Dr. Uri Huppert, an attorney, is a former chairman of the League Against Religious Coercion in Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday on the request by American student Lara Alqasem to hear an appeal of the decision to prevent her from entering Israel. Alqasem, 22, has been detained at Ben-Gurion Airport for 15 days over allegations that she is an anti-Israel boycott activist.</p> \n<p>Alqasem's attorney asked Justices Neal Hendel, Anat Baron and Uzi Vogelman to consider the entry visa originally issued to Alqasem, and said that the reasoning for barring her from entering the country does not meet the criteria set by the Strategic Affairs Ministry, which state that current &quot;leading activists&quot; working in a &quot;consistent and continuous&quot; manner can be denied entry.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;The ban on Lara Alqasem is a gift for BDS, and a disaster for Israel</p> \n<p>A representative for Hebrew University, which has joined Alqasem's appeal, told the court that any law limiting freedom of expression must be interpreted in a limited manner. &quot;We chose to join the appeal because of the importance we place on taking in foreign students and researchers,&quot; she said. &quot;We are not afraid of Lara Alqasem. Her right to change her mind and to be exposed to life here must be respected.&quot;</p> \n<p>The representative of the university also raised the possibility that barring Alqasem from Israel &quot;would play into the hands of those who claim that we are an unenlightened country.&quot;</p> \n<p>Justice Vogelman noted that the university had stated that Alqasam was not a pro-boycott activist and asked in what way refusing entry to her fulfilled the purpose of the law.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Vogelman asked how the Strategic Affairs Ministry's criteria relating to entry into the country square with the fact that the organization in which Alqasem had been involved, Students for Justice in Palestine, was small, &quot;I don't want to say transitory.&quot; In describing Alqasem, Vogelman said: &quot;We have here someone who is not an activist, declares that she is not an activist and is coming here to study. How does this advance the fight against BDS?&quot;</p> \n<p>A government representative said there was no need for intervention by a third party in the case and that the interior minister has the authority to prevent a person's entry to the country. Justice Vogelman said the court was aware that the minister has the authority but that he is also subject to judicial review.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;The law is the law, and the [interior] minister [can exercise] judgment, but is there a sufficient basis for revoking her entry at this stage?&quot; Justice Hendel asked.</p> \n<p>Justice Baron noted that there was no evidence presented of Alqasem's current activities. &quot;Just concerns, and it's good that we be concerned, but where do the concerns find expression in the law?&quot;</p> \n<p>The justices asked Alqasem's lawyer, Yotam Ben Hillel, if his client currently supports a boycott of Israel and if she is committed to refrain from calling for a boycott, to which Ben Hillel said that Alqasem had explicitly stated at earlier proceedings in the case that she is not a BDS activist and would not call for an anti-Israel boycott while in Israel.</p> \n<p>A representative of the state acknowledged at the Supreme Court hearing that the group to which Alqasem belonged &quot;had a small number of activists.&quot; When the justices asked whether the state is challenging the contention that the Florida student is no longer a BDS activist, he replied: &quot;We don't know.&quot;</p> \n<p>On Friday, the Tel Aviv&nbsp;District Court rejected her previous appeal, saying it could not justify intervening in the case and that the government's decision to detain her was reasonable. The court echoed a&nbsp;previous decision&nbsp;by an administrative appeals court.</p> \n<p>Alqasem, 22,&nbsp;was accepted as a graduate student at the Hebrew University but was barred from entering the country&nbsp;and detained at Ben-Gurion Airport since October 2 because the Israeli authorities claim she supports an anti-Israel boycott.&nbsp;Alqasem is being held at a facility at the airport despite obtaining a student visa from the Israeli consulate in Miami.</p> \n<p>In March 2017, the Knesset&nbsp;passed a law&nbsp;that&nbsp;bars from Israel&nbsp;any foreigners who have publicly expressed support for boycotting Israel. The interior minister is responsible for enforcing the law. According to the government,&nbsp;decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, usually in compliance with recommendations from the Strategic Affairs Ministry, which monitors the international boycott movement.</p> \n<p>Alqasem's attorney, Ben Hillel, said at the previous hearing on her appeal that the law&nbsp;states 'deliberately avoiding economic, cultural and academic ties because of its association with Israel.' Alqasem came to study at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, was accepted, paid money and issued a visa. How does this work with a boycott call? The state did not answer that.&quot;</p> \n<p>Revoking a visa requires strong evidence, Ben Hillel said, &quot;which is not the case here. She invested money and time in moving to Israel. She doesn't have a job to return to in the U.S. and at this point she can't start studying in the U.S.&quot;</p> \n<p>Ben Hillel said Alqasem is being portrayed in a fantastical manner as a senior activist in the BDS movement. &quot;She was a member in a small organization that at its peak numbered eight people,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Some 3,000 years ago, the Israelites and Philistines faced off on opposite sides of Elah Valley. Throughout 40 days of stalemate, every day, a gigantic warrior named Goliath stepped forward from the Philistines' ranks and shouted his challenge: to fight him in single combat. The Israelites quailed and held back, until a shepherd boy named David arose and, armed with naught but a slingshot, triumphed.</p> \n<p>So goes the biblical narrative (1 Samuel 17:4), which has been immortalized in popular culture since the day it was written, becoming a symbol of the weak prevailing over the powerful.</p> \n<p>True history is made up not of stones or words but of people. Was there ever a mighty warrior named Goliath who challenged the Israelites in the 11th century B.C.E.? Is the story based on distant memory from 3,000 years ago, or much later fabrication?</p> \n<p>One argument in favor of the historical narrative is that Bronze Age societies commonly employed single combats as proxies for the clash of two armies, to determine the outcome of a war. Evidence of that is legion. Another is that names are among the easiest things to pass down in oral tradition. But the most crucial argument is that the biblical description of Goliath's armor fits archaeological discoveries from his very era. And now new archaeological evidence from Philistine Gath obliquely supports the case that the biblical narrative reflects historical realities, albeit through a prism, and was not pure 7th century B.C.E. wishful thinking.</p> \n<p>Now let us meet the narrative's antagonist, Goliath.</p> \n<p>A champion named Goliath</p> \n<p>As the two armies confronted each other across the valley, a huge figure armed to the hilt stepped forward through the ranks of the Philistine army:</p> \n<p>“A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath” (1 Samuel 17:4).</p> \n<p>Goliath's birthplace was the city of Gath, the largest city of the Philistine Axis lords (1 Samuel 16:17-18).&nbsp; In 2017, archaeologists digging in the ancient Philistine capital discovered an inscription on a small sherd of pottery, found lying on a floor of a house dating to the 9th century B.C.E.</p> \n<p>The inscription contained the name WLT (Semitic languages were and are generally written without vowels).</p> \n<p>This was the second example of Philistine writing found in Gath: In 2005 the excavators found a similar inscription, with the name 'ALWT.</p> \n<p>Linguists explain that the etymology of the names 'ALWT and WLT is similar to that of the name Goliath. The fragments were subsequently dubbed the “Goliath sherds”.</p> \n<p>If nothing else, these inscriptions prove that people with names very similar to Goliath lived in Gath during the early Iron Age.</p> \n<p>Warrior of the Bronze Age</p> \n<p>The Bible gives a very detailed description of Goliath's arms and armor.</p> \n<p>“He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze... on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back”. &nbsp;(1 Samuel 17: 4-7)</p> \n<p>This description in the account of Samuel 17:4-7 and 53 has generated two approaches, one treating the narrative as the distant memory of a mostly factual event that happened in the 11th century B.C.E., and another that suspects the event was fabricated by priests in Jerusalem, conspiring to create their own version of history.</p> \n<p>The biblical description of Goliath's arms and armor is accurate for his time: bronze helmet, a coat of bronze mail, bronze greaves, scimitar (curved sword with convex cutting edge) and a bronze spear.</p> \n<p>Warriors arrayed in this way were called champions; they were at the front of the field and often led the attack. Homer calls them promachoi, meaning first-men. We recognize them from the warrior vase found at Mycenae, as well on the Egyptian reliefs at Medinet Habu from 1174 B.C.E. years ago, depicting an invasion by the “Sea People”.</p> \n<p>The Medinet Habu reliefs depict some Sea People warriors with feathered headdress, and bearing swords, round shields and spears, whom the Egyptian texts among the reliefs identify as Philistines, Tjekker, and Danuna – peoples from the Aegean. Other Sea People depicted with round caps were called the Tursha, and yet others with horned helmets were called the Sherden – other Aegean tribes.</p> \n<p>As for Goliath, his helmet evidently did not protect his forehead. Although he is called a Philistine, his helmet sounds like it more closely resembled either the horned helmets worn by the Sherden, or the round caps of the Tursha in the Medinet Habu reliefs.</p> \n<p>Moving on: what about Goliath's greaves? Depictions of Egyptian and Near Eastern Bronze Age warriors show them bare-legged. But greaves were definitely part of the panoply Mycenaean warriors bore in the 13th century B.C.E. and later. The Warrior Vase of Mycenae depicts the spearman with greaves. Bronze greaves have been found in tombs in Greece and Cyprus.</p> \n<p>However, the shirt of scale armor that Goliath was purported to have was not thought to be within the Mycenaean panoply. Their soldiers were wrapped in wide bronze bands connected by hinges, protecting their bodies from neck to groin. A superb example of the Mycenaean armor was found in Dendra, a Bronze Age site in Greece. Scale armor had been thought to have gone out of use before the Mycenaean heyday, around 1400 B.C.E. But in 2006, bronze scale armor was discovered in a Mycenaean palace on the island of Salamis.</p> \n<p>Now, if the story had been 7th or 6th century B.C.E. fiction, written hundreds of years after the event, the author would have had no idea how warriors had been garbed in the earlier Bronze Age. Skeptics supporting&nbsp; the narrative of fiction argue that the story of Goliath dresses him like Greek &quot;hoplites,&quot; heavily-armed soldiers who were deployed from the 7th to 5th century B.C.E.</p> \n<p>One weakness in that hypothesis is that hoplites used neither scale armor nor shieldbearers, as Goliath was said to have had. So whoever wrote the story, Goliath wasn't based on a hoplite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On the other hand, if Goliath was real, he lived a century or more after the Mycenaean era and could have chosen to emulate their ancient style.</p> \n<p>In summary, the Philistines have Aegean origins, like the Mycenaeans; the champion Goliath could have picked arms and armor as he saw fit, mixing styles of the Aegeanized warriors: headgear from one, greaves from another, and so on.</p> \n<p>Bronze Age war by proxy</p> \n<p>Not only does the description of Goliath's arms and armor fit the archaeological evidence of Bronze Age warriors. So does his challenge:</p> \n<p>&quot;This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other. On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified&quot; (1 Samuel 17:10-11)</p> \n<p>War by proxy was a common practice in the Bronze Age, to spare the bloody cost of armies clashing. The peoples assumed their gods would intervene on their behalf (and when they didn't, they assumed the gods were peeved at them). Examples abound.</p> \n<p>The Egyptian warrior Sinuhe, who may or may not have existed around 4,000 years ago, tells of his one-on-one battle with a powerful enemy: “When he charged me, I shot him, my arrow sticking in his neck. He screamed; he fell on his nose; I slew him with his ax&quot; (lines 137-140 in Lichheim 1996:79).</p> \n<p>Another account of single combat occurs in the Babylonian Epic Enuma Elish, in which the god's champion, Marduk, set out to crush Tiamat (who was either a creator goddess or a monstrous embodiment of terrible chaos, depending which ancient source you ask):</p> \n<p>“He made the bow, appointed it his weapon. He mounted the arrow, set it on the string... with raging fire he covered his body” (lines 35-40 in Foster 1993:373).</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most famous example of war by proxy is the duel between Paris and Menelaus in Homer&acute;s Iliad (3.340-382): they stood champions for their armies, but the gods meddled. The outcome got messy.</p> \n<p>Conspiracy in Jerusalem</p> \n<p>So the narrative of two champions standing in for their armies makes sense, but skeptics query, among other things, when the story was written down for the first time: in real time, or centuries later.</p> \n<p>Another skeptic argument relies on the paucity of epigraphic material from early periods of Israel and Judah: 3,000 years ago literacy was rare to nonexistent, they argue. There is no evidence of Hebrew scribes in Jerusalem capable of writing history before King Hezekiah's time, the 6th and 7th centuries B.C.E., the skeptics say. Ergo, the Goliath story had to have been written in the 6th-7th centuries B.C.E., some 300 or 400 years after the event.</p> \n<p>It is true that no Hebrew inscriptions have been found from the 11th -12th &nbsp;centuries B.C.E., when Goliath may have lived. It is also true that Hebrew inscriptions, ostraca, seals and graffiti that can be dated to the late 8th century B.C.E. or earlier, are scarce, much fewer than the number known from later periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is evidence starting in the 9th century B.C.E., not long after Goliath: for instance the Mesha Inscription (a.k.a. the Moabite Stone); the Tel Dan stele with its Aramaic inscription; and the prophetic account presented in the Deir Alla text (a prophetic inscription relating visions of the seer of the gods Baalam) from the 9th or 8th century B.C.E.</p> \n<p>So the story of Goliath may have been written in real time or shortly after. It didn't have to wait for centuries.</p> \n<p>To sum up, Goliath seems to have worn contemporary Bronze Age gear, scribes did exist shortly after his time and possibly within it, and the biblical descriptions suit other ancient texts referring to armies led by champions, rather than as the impersonal institutions of later texts.</p> \n<p>Finally, there is testimony of 12th and 11th century warfare from the ancient Near East itself: &nbsp;battles between champions instead of armies, the mutilation of enemy corpses, shouting matches between warriors, weeping as a sign of manhood – these and many other things are not scribal inventions of the 7th century B.C.E. but well-attested realities of late Bronze Age life. And Goliath's arms and armor are not much like those of a 5th century Greek hoplite as some suggest. The accurate description of a Bronze Age warrior’s equipment opens up the possibility that a memory was handed down over several centuries, embellished to be sure, but with a core of truth.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A Jerusalem administrative appeals court on Wednesday invalidated a decision by the state to bar entry into the country by Dr. Isabel Phiri, the deputy secretary general of the World Council of Churches.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Strategic Affairs Ministry and Interior Ministry said Dr. Phiri was the first person denied entry into the country for supporting the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement.</p> \n<p>It his ruling, custody court judge Marat Dorfman ruled that the anti-BDS legislation could not be applied retroactively to bar a BDS activist from visiting Israel and that the reasoning provided to her at that time, involving concern over &quot;illegal immigration,&quot; was without foundation.</p> \n<p>Phiri was barred entry to Israel in December of 2016, but the change in the law, permitting BDS activists to be barred under some circumstances, took effect the following year. The official explanation provided to Phiri at the time was that she was not being allowed into the country due to &quot;illegal immigration considerations.&quot;</p> \n<p>The attempt to apply the change in the law retroactively was first reported by Haaretz.</p> \n<p>In his ruling on Wednesday, Dorfman gave the Interior Ministry 60 days to issue a new decision and required that Phiri's lawyers also be provided the main outlines of the Foreign Ministry's professional opinion on her case. Dorfman also awarded the World Council of Churches 3,000 shekels ($820) in legal expenses.</p> \n<p>Phiri, a theologian from Malawi who as deputy secretary general of the World Council of Churches, which represents about 350 church denominations around the world, is based in Geneva, arrived in Israel in December 2016 to participate in the Ecumenical Accompaniment Program in Palestine and Israel, which the World Council supports.</p> \n<p>The program brings members to churches to Israel who are interested in learning about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to volunteer in the territories. The program's website states that its goals include collecting testimony about life under occupation.</p> \n<p>Phiri arrived in Israel with four colleagues who were allowed to entry the country. Phiri, however, was questioned, first by officials from the Shin Bet security service, who decided there were no security grounds for preventing her from entering the country. She was then referred for further questioning by the Interior Ministry's Population and Immigration Authority.</p> \n<p>Following consultations between the Strategic Affairs Ministry, which is involved in countering the BDS movement, and the Interior Ministry, Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan and Interior Minister Arye Dery ordered that Phiri be denied entry into Israel due to her purported support for BDS, the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel.</p> \n<p>The ministers issued a press release in which they said Phiri's case was &quot;actually the first time the State of Israel was clearly refusing entry to a tourist following activity against Israel and promoting economic, cultural and academic boycotts against it.&quot;</p> \n<p>But the border control officer's decision that was provided to Phiri said she was being denied entry due to &quot;illegal immigration considerations.&quot;</p> \n<p>In his ruling, the administrative court appeals court judge stated that the decision to bar Phiri from the country in December 2016 came before the law was amended (in March of the following year) to allow BDS activists to be denied entry under certain conditions. The change in the law could not be enforced retroactively, Judge Dorfman ruled.</p> \n<p>For its part, however, the state countered that in practice even before the amendment of the law took effect, the state conducted &quot;a pilot program in which we examined about ten cases involving the entry of figures involved in delegitimization and the promotion of boycotts, through which the entry of two activists, including [Phiri] was barred.&quot; The aim of the pilot in part was testing the use of Strategic Affairs Ministry databases to check the background of those at the country's borders including Ben-Gurion International Airport.</p> \n<p>Judge Dorfman ruled, however, that in light of the fact that Phiri was given official notice that she was being barred over &quot;illegal immigration&quot; concerns, that had to be considered the explanation that should be considered on appeal.</p> \n<p>Reacting to Judge Dorfman's decision on Wednesday, Michael Sfard, one of Phiri's lawyers, told Haaretz: &quot;The handing by the interior and strategic affairs ministries of Isabel Phiri's case was marked all along the way by negligence and foolishness. They prevented the entry of a senior official of a church organization that represents more than half a billion believers based on an inquiry full of errors and inaccuracies and reliance on questionable sources. They gave her a mistaken reason for excluding her and made arguments in court that essentially [involved] silencing legitimate political criticism. The appeals court has given the authorities a golden opportunity to correct their mistakes.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Foreign Ministry's analysis</p> \n<p>Documents submitted by the state in Phiri's case show that some of the accusations against the World Council of Churches didn't relate to support for the boycott, disinvestment and sanctions movement against Israel but rather criticism of Israel's policies in the territories and its support for the &quot;Palestinian narrative.&quot; In addition, it now appears, the Israeli Foreign Ministry had its own reservations about the case.</p> \n<p>The Foreign Ministry issued a professional opinion that it submitted to the Strategic Affairs Ministry on the church council's Ecumenical Accompaniment Program in Palestine and Israel. The professional opinion, which provided the basis for the position that Phiri should not be allowed into the country, included arguments related to program participants' activities in the territories. It was noted, for example, that they were present in locations where there was friction &quot;and documented the security forces' 'violations' there.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;The biased documentation creates imaginary images of Jews in general and soldiers and settlers in particular, who show cruelty to Palestinians and abuse them in all kinds of ways,&quot; the Foreign Ministry document stated, adding: &quot;After they return to their countries, many activists devote their time to giving lectures and writing articles against Israel while expressing support for promoting boycotts against it. These activities contribute to the creation of the State of Israel's negative image in the view of the international community.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;The program's activists' reports present a false picture of reality while ignoring Israel's work in improving the wellbeing of the Palestinian population,&quot; the Foreign Ministry said. The program's participants &quot;have generally refrained from condemning the Palestinians' terrorist activity against Israeli citizens, but on the other hand emphasize the acts of residents [of Jewish settlements] towards the Palestinian population as violent attacks.&quot;</p> \n<p>As an example of distortions of reality, the Foreign Ministry said program participants released pictures showing them accompanying Palestinian school children, purportedly to prevent them from being harmed by Israeli soldiers or settlers, and pictures of soldiers and settlers pointing weapons at Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Reacting to Wednesday's appeal, Rev. Olav Fiske Tveit, a Norwegian who is the secretary general of the World Council of Churches, told Haaretz that his organization does not support a general boycott or sanctions against Israel. There are 350 church denominations that are members of the council, he added, and they set policy for their own churches independently. He rejected the state's contention that Phiri supports the anti-Israel boycott.</p> \n<p>Phiri herself had told Haaretz after her denial of entry into the country that she was never asked by Israeli authorities about boycott activities or her position on the boycott, and she said she was surprised to read that her exclusion was related to BDS.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for Strategic Affairs Minister Erdan said at the time, however, that a comprehensive examination by the ministry had revealed that over the years the World Council of Churches had expressed support for the anti-Israeli boycott in articles that it published and through &quot;extremist statements of its activists.&quot;</p>",

The fact that a man like Bennett is responsible for the education of Israel’s children ought to alarm any decent parent.

        "text":["<p>Haaretz has revealed new information about Megamot Shalom, the mysterious body through which funds were allegedly transferred to fund Canary Mission, a controversial online blacklist that tracks Palestinian rights activists and supporters of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement.</p> \n<p>Haaretz found that Jonathan Bash, who heads Megamot Shalom, is also the owner of Royal Research, a company which provides &quot;research, data collection and website preparation services.&quot; The company was founded in September 2015, a few months after Canary Mission started to operate online. In an expose published by the Forward, two sources who spoke with the paper said that Bash, a resident of the Old City of Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter, told them he was the person behind Canary Mission.</p> \n<p>Ben Packer, an American-born rabbi who runs the Jerusalem Heritage House and is known to be an outspoken supporter of the far-right extremist rabbi Meir Kahane, is a shareholder in Megamot Shalom alongside Bash.</p> \n<p>Bash refused to respond to Haaretz's request for a response, as did others involved in Megamot Shalom and in Royal Research, including their accountant. However, a source familiar with Megamot Shalom's activities said it's a small body and confirmed that it engages in research and online activities.</p> \n<p>Haaretz recently revealed that Israel is using the information found on the Canary Mission site to ban entry into the country of some of the people the website follows, including Lara Alqasem, the American student barred from entering Israel for graduate studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israeli spy firm in Mueller probe first attempted to undermine BDS movement&nbsp;■&nbsp;Revealed:&nbsp;Canary Mission blacklist Is secretly bankrolled by major Jewish federation&nbsp;■&nbsp;Official documents prove: Israel bans young Americans based on Canary Mission website&nbsp;■&nbsp;San Francisco Jewish Federation also funding far-right fringe groups</p> \n<p>The identities of the people behind Canary Mission, as well as its funders, are clouded in secrecy. In early October, the Forward exposed that the American Helen Diller Family Foundation, which is controlled by the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco, donated $100,000 to Canary Mission through Megamot Shalom, a body that was previously almost unknown. The money was transferred through the New York-based Central Fund of Israel, an organization that serves as a conduit for transferring tens of millions of dollars a year to various organizations in Israel, many connected to right-wing groups and Jewish settlements.</p> \n<p>Bash founded Megamot Shalom in 2016 as an Israeli public benefit corporation - a form of nonprofit that has shareholders. According to a Haaretz investigation, Megamot Shalom was registered in Beit Shemesh under the address of its accountant, Eli Gough. Gough, who refused to respond or comment on this story, is also the accountant for Royal Research. Several of its stockholders live adjacent to Bash in Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter - for example, Ben Packer, who also refused to comment for this story.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bash, a British citizen born in 1973, founded the company while he was already operating Royal Research. The purpose of Megamot Shalom, as reported to the Justice Ministry's Corporations Authority, is to &quot;preserve and ensure the strength of Israel's national image and to act in the media against boycott, sanctions and divestment against Israel in the face of international challenges, using technological media tools.&quot;</p> \n<p>In 2016, when the company was founded, it employed 12 salaried workers and seven volunteers. The highest salary that year was 43,000 shekels ($12,000) paid to a content consultant. Other salaried employees included a finance manager, social media manager, content writer and a content editor. According to the protocols of Megamot Shalom's general assembly from June 2017, its current assets are valued at 255,000 shekels ($70,000). Its turnover is about 600,000 shekels and its program budget is 436,000 shekels. Among other things, Megamot Shalom spent 67,000 shekels ($18,000) on &quot;internet content editing.&quot;</p> \n<p>At the same time, Bash ran Royal Research, which was registered in at his Jerusalem home. According to the company's financial report, in 2016 revenues from service provision amounted to about 460,000 shekels ($127,000), and its expenses amounted to about 360,000 shekels. A year later, the company's revenues diminished to nearly zero, although it is still listed as active. Bash is also listed in Companies House, the British companies' registrar, on the board of directors of a British company called Body Clock Health Care and as its former head of IT.</p> \n<p>An official at the Strategic Affairs Ministry, the body that spearheads Israel’s fight against the BDS Movement, told Haaretz it does not work with Canary Mission, Royal Research or Megamot Shalom.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Only about 12,000 Israeli-Jewish adults – not even a fraction of a percent – are registered dues-paying members of Conservative and Reform synagogues, according to a study published on Monday. Roughly 7,500 are registered with the Conservative movement and 4,500 with the Reform movement.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the study, published by the Jewish People Policy Institute, found that about 800,000 Israeli-Jews (13 percent of the Jewish adult population) self-identify as Conservative or Reform Jews – 5 percent of them as Conservative and 8 percent as Reform.</p> \n<p>This is the first time any estimate has been published of the number of Israelis who officially belong to Reform and Conservative synagogues in the country. In recent years, though, various studies have tried to estimate the percentage of Israelis who identify with these movements, the results ranging from as low as 7 percent to as high as 13 percent in this latest report.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israelis support equal rights for Reform and Conservative Jews</p> \n<p>Explaining the discrepancy between the two figures, the report notes that paying synagogue dues is not part of Israeli culture, as it is in Jewish communities abroad. “Synagogues and organizational membership play a minimal role in Israel, as Israelis rarely ‘belong’ to synagogues (rather pay-per-service) or movements and much of what the organized Jewish community provides abroad is provided in Israel by the state, schools, or public spaces,” writes Dan Feferman, a fellow at the JPPI and the author of the report titled “Rising Streams: Reform and Conservative Judaism in Israel.”</p> \n<p>Unlike their Orthodox counterparts, Conservative and Reform synagogues in Israel are not eligible for government funding. So to sustain themselves, they have little choice but to charge dues.</p> \n<p>Fefferman notes that the growing number of Israelis who identify as Conservative and Reform can be attributed to the fact that so many of them have been exposed to non-Orthodox alternatives in recent decades through travel abroad and interactions with Diaspora Jews. It can also be ascribed, he says, to the growing contempt among Israelis toward the Orthodox-controlled Chief Rabbinate and the power it wields. The Chief Rabbinate controls most matters of personal status in the country.</p> \n<p>Historically, the report points out, most Israelis would say “the synagogue I do not attend is Orthodox” – suggesting that they view Orthodoxy as the only authentic form of Judaism, even if they are not observant.</p> \n<p>“Today, a significant and growing number of secular and traditional Israelis would also say they ‘do not attend Reform and Conservative synagogues,’” Feferman writes. “This means that Reform and Conservative Jewish practice are now seen as authentic and preferable by these largely secular and traditional Israelis, who engage with such Jewish practice primarily for lifecycle events and holidays.”</p> \n<p>Although this change in attitude has not translated into hundreds of thousands of new dues-paying members for the Reform and Conservative movements in Israel, Feferman writes that “it could mean that in the near future, as many as 20 to 30 percent of secular and traditional Israelis could similarly view Reform and Conservative Judaism as authentic and preferable forms of Jewish practice.”</p> \n<p>The report found that 125 Reform and Conservative communities exist in Israel today, 56 of them with their own permanent synagogues. About 280 rabbis are affiliated with both non-Orthodox movements, 85 of them working in communal capacities. The two movements graduate between eight and 10 new rabbis each years. Both movements have small, but active, youth movements with a combined membership of roughly 1,800. These figures, according to the report, represent “significant growth from just two and even one decade ago.”</p> \n<p>The Reform and Conservative movements, the report stipulates, have made their biggest mark on Israeli society through lifecycle events. Each year, rabbis affiliated with the two movements conduct approximately 1,000 weddings, more than 3,000 bar and bat mitzvah ceremonies, about 400 conversions and close to 1,000 other events, primarily funerals and circumcisions.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The fear of assimilation is something we’ve all imbibed with our mothers’ milk. Annihilation, destruction, Auschwitz, something like that. Even as proud Israelis with our own country and army, many among us were afraid to enter a church. Long before the latest wave of religious coercion while we were still fearfully kissing bibles that had fallen on the floor, we the children of the false secularism of Tel Aviv would sometimes play with fire: We’d cross ourselves, sort of as a joke. It was a test of courage and test of fate, no less than jumping from a roof or touching the flame of a burning candle.</p> \n<p>On Jaffa’s Yefet Street there’s a threatening school, and we were told it belonged to the “Missionaries.” Missionaries then sounded like the Gestapo. Whenever we’d walk pass it, even when we were already a little older, we would fearfully ponder what was going on within its walls. There was a rumor that a child from our school went there and was never heard from again. We never forgave. We suspected his parents of being Christians. It really frightened us.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;My Palestinian Husband Banned Hebrew From Our Home. Our Daughter Is Fighting Back</p> \n<p>That’s how we grew up, the first generation of the rebirth of the Jewish state – that’s how they brainwashed us with fear. We were never taught a single word of the New Testament. Impurity. “The Narrow Path: The Man from Nazareth” by Aaron Abraham Kabak was the only sliver of information we got about Jesus in the secular, liberal, official school curriculum, long before the advent of Naftali Bennett. We of course heard nothing at all about Islam or the Koran. When Arela (Rela), the daughter of a close friend of my mother’s and a cousin of Benjamin Netanyahu’s, married Donny in San Francisco, we said, it’s not so bad, Donny is nice despite his being a gentile. That’s the way we were.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'She seduced a Jew': Lawmaker bemoans wedding of Fauda star to Israeli Arab TV anchor</p> \n<p>We’ve grown up since then and gotten more powerful. Israeliness took root in the country, the world went global, and weddings with gentiles become more common and less threatening at least among a substantial minority of liberals. But the national narrative stayed the same: Mixed marriages are an existential threat, assimilation means destruction. We don’t need an excoriating Oren Hazan to understand how deeply rooted this narrative remains in the Jewish Israeli experience. Ask almost any parent, including most of those who regard themselves as enlightened and secular, and they’ll reply that they’d “prefer” that their son marry a Jewish woman. Why, for God’s sake?</p> \n<p>The opposition to assimilation is racist and purely nationalistic. Again it’s the superior and pure Jewish blood that mustn’t be mixed, heaven forbid, with any Christian, Muslim or other impurity. After a long history living as a minority under threat, the people can’t shake that survival instinct. But let’s advance on step and ask: What for?</p> \n<p>The state of Israel is the embodiment of Judaism and its values. Here the Jews are a majority, they’re the sovereign, there’s nothing to stop them from achieving their wishes.</p> \n<p>If Israel were a model society or moral country, we could understand the need for the struggle against assimilation for the sake of preserving lofty values. But look at the disaster: Gentile Canada has in the past year absorbed some 3,000 Eritrean asylum seekers fleeing Israel where they were shamefully rejected. Netta Ahituv recently described with what humanity the unchosen country has treated them, and what memories they have of the Chosen Land (Haaretz, September 21). That’s just one example.</p> \n<p>Is the struggle against assimilation a struggle to preserve Jewish values as they’ve been realized in Israel? If so, then it would be best to abandon that battle. The gefilte fish and hreime (spicy sauce), the bible, religion and heritage, can be preserved in mixed marriages as well. While Western countries are becoming multi-cultural and mixed marriages routine, here we fight against any mixing. We view it as an existential threat, with one of the ministers even threatening the children of mixed unions.</p> \n<p>The Jewish state has already crystallized an identity, which can only be enriched by assimilation, which is a normal, healthy process. Lucy Aharish and Tzachi Halevy may actually spawn a much more moral and civilized race than the one that has arisen here so far.</p>",

The employees said they didn't know him because he was relatively new there.</p> \n<p>&quot;We work here based on trust, I believe in coexistence, but someone like this ruins everything you build.

Nevertheless, security forces are still investigating whether the attacker received his weapon from terror groups.</p> \n<p>The Barkan industrial area, which was established in 1982, is one of 14 industrial areas that Israel set up beyond the Green Line. Barkan is a highly populated area, and only 14 out of the 728 dunams that it was allocated are empty.

[Israel] shouldn't expect such events to take place without a reaction.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yossi Dagan, the head of the Samaria Regional Council, where Barkan is located, said in response that the &quot;attacker opened fire at one of the largest offices of the Barkan industrial area. This is a very difficult incident at a place that is a bridge of coexistence at the heart of Samaria.&quot;</p> \n<p>Dagan added: &quot;There are more than 8,000 employees in this industrial area, half of which are Jewish and half of which are Arab. I see Arabs and Jews who are sitting together and crying here. We will never break down.

Gadi Eisenkot&nbsp;recently warned ministers of a potential uptick in violent attacks across the West Bank, but according to initial assessments there is no connection between the shooting and Eisenkot's warning.</p> \n<p>Last month, a 40-year-old Israeli man, Ari Fuld, was killed in a stabbing attack at the entrance to a mall near the West Bank's Gush Etzion Junction.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Fuld, a father of four from the settlement of Efrat, managed to shoot the assailant, a 17-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank village of Yatta near Hebron, who was later identified as Khalil Jabarin.

        "text":["<p>Police suspect that the incident on Friday in which a Palestinian woman was killed when a stone struck her in the head was a deliberate act by settlers. The division within the Judea and Samaria District Police that handles far-right activity has been tasked with investigating, with involvement by the Shin Bet security service.</p> \n<p>Thousands attended on Saturday&nbsp;the funeral of Aisha Mohammed Rabi, the Palestinian woman who, Palestinian reports had said, was killed late Friday night when settlers threw stones at her car near a West Bank checkpoint south of Nablus. Rabi, 47 and a mother of seven, was buried in Biddya, where she lived in the West Bank. A general strike was declared Saturday in the town in response to her death and all local shops and business were closed.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>&quot;I don’t have any doubt it was the settlers,&quot;&nbsp;Yacoub told Haaretz on Saturday. &quot;There were six or seven of them, and it was clear that they were young. In such a place and time, no young Palestinian would dare stand there. The Za'atara area [in the West Bank] is always surrounded by a military force, and so it's clear that the settlers did it.&quot;</p> \n<p>When asked if he expected the Israeli authorities to arrest the attackers, he responded: &quot;You ask the authorities that question. They ought to know.&quot;</p> \n<p>In the security establishment, there are differences of opinion about the incident. The police suspect that settlers who live nearby threw stones at the car in which Rabi and her husband were driving. But other sources involved in the investigation say there are doubts about the version relayed by Yacoub Rabi. Even though the investigation is being handled by the division of the Judea and Samaria District Police that deal with far-right activity, along with the Shin Bet, officials involved have not yet found any clear evidence that either Jews or Palestinians threw stones at the car. There is a gag order on the details of the investigation.</p> \n<p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas spoke with Rabi's husband on Saturday. According to Palestinian news agency Maan, Abbas described her as &quot;another martyr on the list of Palestinian martyrs&quot; and said that she was &quot;killed as a result of settler crimes under the auspices of the occupation state. This crime will not go unpunished.&quot; Abbas further said that &quot;the Palestinian people are determined to remain and hold onto our land despite the crimes committed against them, and will struggle until the establishment of its state with East Jerusalem as its capital.&quot;</p> \n<p>A member of the Fatah Central Committee, Dalal Salameh, who attended the funeral said: &quot;We are grieving the loss of a Palestinian woman who paid with her life for the aggression of the settlers – like the Dawabsheh family and the young man Mohammed Abu Khdeir. This doesn't give the settlers a right to this land, and we are telling them, you will not have a safe place here.&quot; She added: &quot;This crime will not go unnoticed, and like those before it, it will reach the International Criminal Court.&quot;</p> \n<p>Shafik Aw-Rabi, a relative, said: &quot;This is the fate of the Palestinian people, who will pay with their blood and their land for their liberty. Umm Mohammed is another victim and another martyr on the long list, but we will not despair and we will not stop until we expel the last of the settlers from our land.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Judea and Samaria District police confirmed that they have opened an investigation into the matter.</p> \n<p>According to Palestinian reports, Rabi and her husband, Yacoub, were driving when a group of settlers threw stones at their car. She was reportedly struck in the head with a stone and died shortly after. He was lightly wounded.&nbsp;He told Reuters: &quot;The stones came from the side where the settlement is. I could hear the people speak Hebrew, but I didn't see them.&quot;</p> \n<p>Issam, the husband's cousin, told Haaretz that the couple was heading home with two of their daughters after visiting a third daughter in Hebron. Issam said the car was struck by stones thrown from a hill near the Tapuach checkpoint, with one of the stones striking her inside the vehicle.&nbsp;The family was taken to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Issam told Haaretz that the family had not received any updates as of Saturday morning. &quot;It's as if nothing happened and we did not lose a wife and a mother,&quot; Issam said.</p> \n<p>The incident is the latest event in a violent week in the West Bank. On Thursday, two people were wounded in a stabbing attack on Thursday at the entrance to the Samaria regional brigade headquarters in the West Bank. On Sunday, two Israelis were killed at a factory in the Barkan Industrial Zone in the West Bank. The two victims,&nbsp;Ziv Hajbi, 35, and Kim Yehezkel-Levengrond, 29, were laid to rest on&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sunday.</p> \n<p>A manhunt remains underway for the assailant, Ashraf Walid Saliman Na'alwa, 23, who&nbsp;gave a coworker a note in which he said he planned to commit suicide and praised late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prior to the shooting.&nbsp;The note led security forces to conclude&nbsp;that the shooting was a terror attack.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In a kingdom once ruled by an ever-aging rotation of elderly monarchs, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stands out as the youthful face of a youthful nation. But behind the carefully calibrated public-relations campaign pushing images of the smiling prince meeting with the world’s top leaders and business executives lurks a darker side.</p> \n<p>Last year, at age 31, Mohammed became the kingdom’s crown prince, next in line to the throne now held by his octogenarian father, King Salman. While pushing for women to drive, he has overseen the arrest of women’s rights activists. While calling for foreign investment, he has imprisoned businessmen, royals and others in a crackdown on corruption that soon resembled a shakedown of the kingdom’s most powerful people.</p> \n<p>As Saudi defense minister from the age of 29, he pursued a war in Yemen against Shiite rebels that began a month after he took the helm and wears on today.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Why Turkey is in no hurry to cut off ties with Riyadh&nbsp;■&nbsp;Trump’s Saudi policy lets MBS think he can get away with murder, ex-U.S. officials say&nbsp;■&nbsp;Turkey, jailer of journalists, now slams Saudi Arabia - for murdering a journalist</p> \n<p>What the crown prince chooses next likely will affect the world’s largest oil producer for decades to come. And as the disappearance and feared death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul may show, the young prince will brook no dissent in reshaping the kingdom in his image.</p> \n<p>“I don’t want to waste my time,” he told Time Magazine in a cover story this year. “I am young.”</p> \n<p>Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who wrote several columns for The Washington Post critical of Prince Mohammed, disappeared Oct. 2 on a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials have offered no evidence, but say they fear the writer was killed and dismembered by a Saudi team of 15 men — an operation that, if carried out, would have to have been authorized by the top of the Al Saud monarchy. The kingdom describes the allegation as “baseless,” but has provided no proof that Khashoggi ever left the consulate.</p> \n<p>For decades in Saudi Arabia, succession passed down among the dozens of sons of the kingdom’s founder, King Abdul-Aziz. And, over time, the sons have grown older and older upon reaching the throne.</p> \n<p>When King Salman took power in January of 2015 and quickly appointed Prince Mohammed as defense minister, it took the kingdom by surprise, especially given the importance of the position and the prince’s age.</p> \n<p>He was little-known among the many grandchildren of Saudi Arabia’s patriarch, a young man educated only in the kingdom who stuck close to his father, who previously served as the governor of Riyadh, the Saudi capital.</p> \n<p>As defense minister, he entered office facing a crisis in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, which lies south of the kingdom. Shiite rebels known as Houthis had overrun the country’s capital, Sanaa, unseating the deeply unpopular government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.</p> \n<p>When Hadi fled and it appeared the country’s port city of Aden would fall to the rebels, Saudi Arabia launched a coalition war against the Houthis — a conflict that soon became a stalemate.</p> \n<p>The United Nations estimates 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen’s conflict, and activists say that number is likely far higher. It has exacerbated what the U.N. calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with hunger and cholera stalking civilians, worsened by the kingdom’s blockade of ports.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Saudi-led coalition has faced widespread criticism for its airstrikes hitting clinics and marketplaces, which have killed civilians. The Houthis, as well, have indiscriminately used land mines and arrested political opponents.</p> \n<p>The coalition says Iran has funneled weapons to the Houthis ranging from small arms to the ballistic missiles now regularly fired into the kingdom, which Iran denies.</p> \n<p>For Prince Mohammed, the conflict remains part of what he sees as an existential struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran for the future of the Middle East. Asked about Western concerns over civilian casualties, he offers this: “Mistakes happen in all wars.”</p> \n<p>“We don’t need to have a new Hezbollah in the Arabian Peninsula. This is a red line not only for Saudi Arabia but for the whole world,” the prince recently told Bloomberg, referring to the Iran-allied Shiite militant group and political party dominant in Lebanon.</p> \n<p>The prince also found himself involved in the bizarre resignation-by-television address of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who announced he would step down during a visit to the kingdom in November 2017, fueling suspicion he was coerced into doing so.</p> \n<p>Prince Mohammed’s harsh rhetoric extends to likening Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to Nazi Germany’s Adolf Hitler. He’s also hinted Saudi Arabia would be willing to fight Iran in other ways, leading Tehran to link the kingdom to an attack on a military parade in Ahvaz last month that killed at least 24 people and wounded more than 60. Both Arab separatists and the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the assault.</p> \n<p>“We won’t wait for the battle to be in Saudi Arabia,” the prince told the Saudi-owned broadcasting company MBC last year. “Instead, we will work so that the battle is for them in Iran, not in Saudi Arabia.”</p> \n<p>His aggressive posture against Iran has won the support of U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration, which pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal struck by President Barack Obama, whom the kingdom deeply distrusted.</p> \n<p>Before becoming crown prince, Prince Mohammed visited the White House and forged a close relationship with Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. The two are believed to be working on the administration’s peace plans for Israel and the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Trump made Riyadh his first stop overseas as president, a visit complete with Arab pageantry and opulence. Behind the scenes, many analysts believe Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates saw a greenlight to move ahead with the ongoing boycott of Qatar, a small Arabian Peninsula nation, over a political dispute.</p> \n<p>Trump initially seemed to favor the boycott of Qatar, which is home to al-Udeid Air Base, the forward headquarters of the U.S. military’s Central Command.</p> \n<p>Trump’s first Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, sought in vain to pressure the Saudis into resolving the spat and complained privately that the ties between the White House and Prince Mohammed were hurting the effort, officials said at the time. Tillerson’s dismissal in March and the arrival of Mike Pompeo as Trump’s top diplomat markedly reduced the State Department’s heat on Saudi Arabia about the detentions of human rights activists, including women, and the conflict in Yemen.</p> \n<p>Despite the mounting civilian casualties in Yemen, Pompeo certified to Congress in September that Saudi Arabia was taking steps to reduce and limit them, drawing severe condemnations from lawmakers and human rights groups.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia soon embarked on the prince’s ambitious proposal to allow women in the ultraconservative Wahhabi nation to drive. The resulting pictures of women in long black abayas behind the wheel represented a public-relations coup for the image-shaping firms employed by the kingdom, as did footage of women attending soccer matches and movie theaters for the first time in decades.</p> \n<p>But before women started their engines, a new crackdown emerged: The kingdom rounded up and imprisoned women’s rights activists, including reportedly grabbing one woman who was in the neighboring United Arab Emirates.</p> \n<p>Prince Mohammed has wowed the business world with promises of an initial public offering for the state oil behemoth Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, suggesting it would have a $2 trillion valuation. Stocks markets around the world have pitched having the IPO on their exchanges, but it has been repeatedly delayed.</p> \n<p>The young prince has traveled across the U.S. as part of his business pitch, meeting leaders like former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post.</p> \n<p>Prince Mohammed also hosted a major business summit at Riyadh’s Ritz Carlton, complete with a humanoid robot named Sophia being awarded Saudi citizenship.</p> \n<p>Only weeks later, the hotel turned into a luxury prison as part of a mass arrest of businessmen, royals and others orchestrated by Prince Mohammed in a move described as targeting corruption. Those released agreed to sign over some of their assets, however, giving it the feel of a shakedown.</p> \n<p>“If I have the power and the king has the power to take action against influential people, then you are already fundamentally strong,” Prince Mohammed told CBS earlier this year.</p> \n<p>For now, the anger over Khashoggi’s disappearance appears to have galvanized international criticism of the young prince, about whom the columnist wrote critically for the Post.</p> \n<p>Trump, already angry over rising global oil prices, has said he wants answers from Saudi Arabia and suggested Khashoggi’s fiancee could visit the White House.</p> \n<p>Prominent American lawmakers also are indignant — though U.S.-Saudi relations have survived even the 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers being from the kingdom.</p> \n<p>The opaqueness of the Al Saud royal family makes it difficult to see what effect the controversy is having on support for Prince Mohammed at home. State television continues to air footage of him attending meetings and greeting officials as if all is normal.</p> \n<p>And as the son of the king, analysts say he has the full protection of the throne’s powers.</p> \n<p>Once asked if anything could stop him, the prince gave a two-word reply: “Only death.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The veteran Jerusalem garage owner was stunned. He had never seen such a thing. Two bolts on the suspension (which connects the wheels to the chassis) were completely loose. One of them had been pulled out almost entirely. The nuts that secured the bolts were gone. The brake disks that are attached to the side, and which determine the angle of the wheels, were no longer in place. Nuts don’t just get lost, and the garage owner had absolutely no doubt: This was sabotage.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“They tried to kill you,” he told Guy Butavia, an activist in Ta’ayush, an Israeli-Palestinian anti-occupation group, who is despised by Israelis who are trying to grab more Palestinian land and expel more Palestinians from their villages. And make no mistake: The garage owner is a “kosher” Jew, and is not a supporter of Butavia and his friends.</p> \n<p>But it’s possible that Butavia was not the intended victim of those who sabotaged the pickup truck he was driving, but rather his friend, who had used the vehicle a few days before him: Guy Hirschfeld – another left-wing activist hated by Israelis who are trying hard to expel the Palestinians, etc. Prior to that, the vehicle had been held for nine days by Israel Defense Forces soldiers, and for three days it was held by the police. You could say: It was Hirschfeld who wanted to kill Butavia. These Don Quixotes, who are trying to prevent the expulsion of Palestinians from their land – who knows how much they quarrel among themselves?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The international committee for subsidizing the Israeli occupation | Analysis</p> \n<p>Let’s start at the beginning: On the eve of Yom Kippur, September 18, soldiers from the Jordan Valley Brigade confiscated the truck in which three activists, including Hirschfeld, were traveling to the northern Jordan Valley. The three went up to a hill at Tel al-Khema, where Palestinians have been grazing their sheep from time immemorial, until a Hebrew outpost sprouted up in the area, about three years ago.</p> \n<p>The story is a familiar one: There are demolition orders against the outpost but meanwhile it’s flourishing; its shepherds are hotheaded teenagers; at least one of the adults there is armed. The result: They harass the Palestinian shepherds so that they’ll be afraid to graze their flocks in the vicinity and will leave.</p> \n<p>Hirschfeld and his friends are trying to minimize damage, to prevent any harassment in advance. That particular day they saw the Hebrew herd grazing, and about a kilometer away – the Palestinian herd. As soon as the activists arrived, one of the Hebrew shepherds made a phone call. The responsible adult at the outpost showed up, and 10 minutes after him a heroic IDF jeep zoomed in, driving straight at the Palestinian shepherds. Get out, the officer ordered. This is a firing range. And he began to chase away the Palestinians’ flock.</p> \n<p>Hirschfeld and his friends (have we mentioned Don Quixotes?) tried to explain that the Palestinians have been grazing there sheep there for many years. “Firing range,” repeated the officer. The activists persisted: But the settlers also graze their sheep there – how can that be? The reply: “They have a grazing permit” (which is granted by the World Zionist Organization’s Settlement Division).</p> \n<p>Thus the high-tech superpower invents its own tricks of the trade: live bullets that aren’t fired, because there are no training exercises and haven’t been for a long time, if at all, and that hit only Palestinian flocks and Palestinian shepherds. And because we Jews are concerned about the lives of Arabs, we chase them away. For their own good. The bullets that don’t exist don’t hit the Hebrew shepherds who are allowed to be in the closed military area.</p> \n<p>Someone gave an order, and the officer obeyed it and confiscated the pickup truck. The Don Quixotes tried to say that there has to be an order, a receipt, something. To no avail. The officer confiscated the activists’ vehicle and that was that.</p> \n<p>Days passed, during which attorney Leah Tsemel contacted the West Bank office of the IDF Military Advocate General in order to demand the return of the truck. On September 27 someone in the Judea and Samaria district MAG office was so kind as to respond by fax that said vehicle was being held by the Israel Police, and that Tsemel should contact the Ariel police station. But at the Ariel police they didn’t know what she was talking about.</p> \n<p>Tsemel informed the MAG office that she intended to submit a preliminary appeal to the High Court of Justice. That finally got the troops moving. On the evening of September 27, there was a sign of life from the GPS in the truck: The vehicle was in the Jordan Valley. Someone was trying to move it.</p> \n<p>In simple Hebrew: Someone had previously lied to Tsemel. She sent a complaint to the preliminary High Court appeals division of the State Prosecutor’s Office, with copies to the army. I’ll submit a petition, she wrote. That worked. On September 30, someone called and told Hirschfeld to come pick up the vehicle at the police station in the settlement of Kedumim.</p> \n<p>When he arrived, he discovered a flat tire. Afterward it transpired that the hole could not be fixed. He drove the vehicle around for two days, felt that something was wrong, and assumed it was the pressure in the tires. On Friday, October 5, he brought the truck to Butavia, who crawled under the chassis and discovered the loose bolts and the missing nuts.</p> \n<p>The IDF’s Spokesman’s Office said in response that the vehicle was seized according to authorized protocol in Judea and Samaria regarding security orders, and that, “The IDF is not aware of any damage caused to the vehicle during the days when it was being held by the army.”</p> \n<p>For its part, the Israel Police said: “During activity by a military force, the vehicle was seized on suspicion of violating an order in a closed military area, and a few days later the vehicle was transferred to the Israel Police. When all the relevant information was received by the police, the suspect was summoned for an investigation, during which he gave his version of events, and the vehicle was returned to the suspect. We would like to note that to date the Israel Police has received no complaint, legal opinion or documentation testifying to any complaints about the condition of the vehicle.”</p> \n<p>Hirschfeld says that during the investigation there was no mention of a closed military area, but rather some commander’s order, and they didn’t talk to him about the vehicle at all.</p>",

Riyadh has dismissed the allegation as baseless, saying that Khashoggi left the building soon after he arrived. Neither Turkey nor the&nbsp;Saudis have produced evidence to prove their assertions.</p> \n<p>For some&nbsp;Saudis, the alleged killing is a story cooked up by regional opponents to tarnish the kingdom’s reputation.</p> \n<p>&quot;I cannot talk about these things, but I am sure the accusations against my country’s leadership are wrong. We have enemies, you know,&quot; Aziz Abdullah, a law student in&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia, told Reuters.</p> \n<p>For others, though, it is a sign that&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia may be headed in the wrong direction.</p> \n<p>Only a few&nbsp;Saudis interviewed by Reuters were prepared to criticise the government openly. But several who spoke on condition of anonymity said the allegations called into question the crown prince's promises to open up the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom.</p> \n<p>&quot;Everyone is spooked. It's like there are flies on the walls listening to everything. I don’t believe freedom of expression falls at all into the reform plans, just the opposite,&quot; said a&nbsp;Saudicitizen in Jeddah.</p> \n<p>&quot;But on the other hand, you get cinemas and entertainment. It's like an unspoken arrangement. No freedom, but you'll have amusements. Let's not mistake 'amusements' for freedom please.&quot;</p> \n<p>A&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;woman in her mid-thirties described the case as &quot;like watching a movie&quot;.</p> \n<p>&quot;The government thinks they can get away with things like these, whether he was murdered or kidnapped… There is always this feeling that we need to have our guard up and watch what we are saying. We are not entirely safe,&quot; she said.</p> \n<p>Saudi&nbsp;officials did not respond to questions about such perceptions.</p> \n<p>But they have consistently said they are committed to the course of modernisation charted under Prince Mohammed, which aims to create jobs for young&nbsp;Saudis and make the country a more attractive place to live for locals and foreign investors.</p> \n<p>Saudi&nbsp;Arabia's biggest online newspaper Sabq accused the international media, including Reuters, of using Khashoggi's disappearance to try to undermine that reform drive.</p> \n<p>&quot;They used an incident of a&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;citizen's disappearance to attack Riyadh and to try to stir international opinion to distort the bold steps of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;towards internal reform and to block the bright, new reality of the region,&quot; Sabq said.</p> \n<p>&quot;FAKE NEWS&quot;</p> \n<p>The crown prince, who runs the day-to-day affairs of&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia, has won admiration from Western powers over the last year for vowing to modernise&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia.</p> \n<p>He has implemented a series of high-profile reforms, including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.</p> \n<p>But those moves have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen. He has also put all security entities under his central control.</p> \n<p>In the week since Turkey alleged Khashoggi was killed, tightly controlled&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;newspapers have accused Qatar and other enemies of the kingdom of whipping up a crisis over the journalist's disappearance. The aim, they say, is to tarnish&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia's reputation.</p> \n<p>Saudi&nbsp;Arabia's Okaz newspaper dismissed the reports of Khashoggi's death as Qatari &quot;theatrics,&quot; language echoed in a report on Abu Dhabi-based Sky News Arabia. An Okaz columnist accused Khashoggi of pursuing &quot;terrorist objectives&quot; like &quot;inciting public opinion&quot; and &quot;destabilising the country.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;When we first heard the news (of Khashoggi's disappearance), we thought this could be true. Authorities would want him for criticising our leadership,&quot; said Fatima, 29, a saleswoman at one of Riyadh's glitzy shopping malls.</p> \n<p>&quot;But when the Qatari media said they (the&nbsp;Saudis) killed him, we now believe it is definitely fake news, it is a bunch of lies, this is a game from Turkey and Qatar and both support Iran.&quot;</p> \n<p>Abu Nasir, a 35-year old engineer, believes&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia will change for the better, even though Khashoggi's case has drawn fierce international criticism of the crown prince, including from the United States, his most important ally.</p> \n<p>&quot;We believe in the Vision and support our leadership,&quot; he said. &quot;My kids will grow up in a country that is totally different than the one where I grew up. This is all I care about.&quot;</p> \n<p>If MbS, as the crown prince is widely known, is to succeed, he will need billions of dollars in foreign investment, and the confidence of local and international banks and companies.</p> \n<p>The Khashoggi case has the potential to hurt that confidence.</p> \n<p>&quot;It is getting more and more scary to express your opinion, even if you discuss the basic feasibility of a plan, you cannot be sure you will be safe,&quot; said one&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;banker.</p> \n<p>Some young people, an important demographic for MbS as he pushes through sensitive changes in a country traditionally ruled by consensus among senior princes, are starting to question the future that has been promised them.</p> \n<p>&quot;I started to wonder, have we miscalculated the dream? Will we have to sacrifice freedom of expression for economic development and some basic rights?&quot; said Sarah, a&nbsp;Saudistudent abroad.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The ruling of Judge Erez Yakuel in the Tel Aviv District Court, in which he rejected the petition of American student Lara Alqasem against the prevention of her entry into Israel, is part of an anti-constitutional revolution.</p> \n<p>The ruling was based on the amendment to the Entry Into Israel Law, which mandates that “No visa and residency permit of any type will be given to a person if he, [or] the organization for which he works, has knowingly issued a public call to impose a boycott on the State of Israel, or has committed to participate in such a boycott.”</p> \n<p>The court rejected the petition, noting that Alqasem was a member of a student organization at the University of Florida that called for a boycott, and even served as its president. Judge Yakuel did not see fit to take into account that these were activities that took place in the past. He said that the purpose of the law is to prevent entry to anyone who is “likely” to exploit his stay in order to promote calls for a boycott, and ruled that this fear is still quite strong even now.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Letters to the Editor: Wake up, BDS Is succeeding</p> \n<p>In light of that fear, the decision was approved, despite Alqasem’s claim that she has discontinued her activity in the boycott organization, and despite her promise to refrain from any such activity during her stay in Israel.</p> \n<p>In handing down this ruling, Judge Yakuel in effect rejected a long history of judicial decisions, which began already with the famous Kol Ha’am ruling in 1953 (when the court overturned a decision by the interior minister to stop the publication of the Communist party organ). The decision in that case was that a “fear” is not sufficient, but that in order to curtail rights there must be a near certainty that genuine harm would be caused to the public order, and that in the absence of such certainty the court must reject executive branch decisions that undermine rights.</p> \n<p>The moment that a “fear” is sufficient for imposing restrictions, we are distancing ourselves from democracy in the direction of tyranny. When in 1953 the interior minister demanded that the newspaper be closed due to a law that permitted such a step in the event of the publication of something “liable” to harm the public welfare, Justice Shimon Agranat ruled in the High Court of Justice that this was insufficient. Now it was enough for the District Court that there is a “fear.”</p> \n<p>Yakuel’s ruling also shows that if in the past it was thought that the wave of anti-democratic legislation in recent years would be of a declarative nature only, and not change Israeli reality – in fact these laws have teeth and actual consequences. Even broader consequences than what could have been expected.</p> \n<p>For example, the ruling of Judge Moshe Drori in the Jerusalem District Court. He ruled that in the context of deciding on compensation for victims of terror attacks, the clause that the government “shall strive to ensure the safety of members of the Jewish People and of its citizens” in the Basic Law on Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People justifies punitive compensation in the event of an attack on Jews. Because, he said, the law is not solely declarative. This ruling contradicts the one that in the past obligated equal treatment for the country’s citizens – even if such equality was of course not actually implemented.</p> \n<p>These judicial rulings are thus part of the anti-constitutional revolution taking place here in recent years, and of which the nation-state law, along with the proposed override clause that would let the Knesset reenact laws overturned by the Supreme Court, are part. To understand this revolution, it isn’t enough to observe what is taking place in the High Court. The judges in these cases have internalized the “spirit of the commander” that was reflected in the words of Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, who said that ”Zionism will not continue bowing its head before a universalistic system of individual rights.” On the way they have rejected the basic concepts of constitutional law.</p>",

Not all things are dangerous,” Bennett answered, elaborating that he doesn’t want everyone to have to walk on eggshells. “I want everyone to be able to speak openly. I want us to be able to say real things.

Its ruling was in compliance with the ruling by an administrative appeals court. The university also joined her motion for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court, which on Sunday suspended her expulsion from the country until Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Last week, the Hebrew University senate called on Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan and Interior Minister Arye Dery to let Alqasem into the country. The senate’s announcement was seen as uncommon. University rector Barak Medina commented that the benefits of barring entrance to a person associated with supporting a boycott of Israel are dubious, and that the detriments of such actions cause great damage.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In a small town in southern Brazil, outside Porto Alegre, there is a small and very old synagogue, which has difficulty getting a minyan (prayer quorum of 10) together. “The older generation now understands that they were mistaken. They shouldn’t have excluded the intermarried couples who wanted to teach their children Jewish values. Because of them there are no longer any Jews here,” said the director of the synagogue, when I visited with a representative of the United Jewish Appeal.</p> \n<p>Interesting, I thought. Assimilation and the disappearance of the local community took place just because of the insistence on the purity of the Jewish race. People whose only sin was to fall in love with a non-Jewish man/woman couldn’t come with their children to welcome the Shabbat, celebrate the Jewish holidays and learn to read the holy tongue or study the history of the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>It’s interesting that it is actually the Reform community, which is maligned by Conservative Jews, that is preserving Judaism more than the ultra-Orthodox. It’s interesting that the State of Israel accepts immigrants with only a Jewish father (who, according to halakha, traditional Jewish law, are not considered Jews), and they can enlist in the Israel Defense Forces and pay taxes in the Jewish state – but if they want to get married, they will have to undergo a proper Orthodox conversion. In other words, do everything, just don’t multiply.</p> \n<p>I recalled my visit to Brazil in 2011 when I saw the headline about the wedding of Israeli Arab broadcaster Lucy Aharish and her Jewish boyfriend, actor Tzachi Halevy. My heart went out to them when I read about her relatives crying out that she was harming the family honor – an excuse for murdering women (!) among certain populations. I recalled a former friend, who, only long after we broke up, revealed to me that his mother isn’t even Jewish and he can’t get married (in Israel). He was born in Eastern Europe, and his family left for Israel when they opened the doors for Jews – because of his father.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israeli lawmaker's attack on celebrity Jewish-Arab marriage echoes Nazi ideology | Analysis&nbsp;■ A future forever pure | Editorial&nbsp;■ Israel's roaring silence in the face of racist, fascist misogyny | Opinion</p> \n<p>I thought, how hard it must have been for him to keep this secret, not to talk about his true identity. To study in a Jewish school, to enlist in the army, with nobody aware that in his home they didn’t celebrate holidays like other Jews. I wondered what it was like to be in his shoes, and to be involved in relationships without revealing to his girlfriends that he couldn’t get married in the rabbinate, for fear that they would leave him when they discovered the truth.</p> \n<p>I recalled a friend of my father’s, a senior lecturer at Columbia University in New York. When he married his non-Jewish girlfriend, his parents sat shivah for him. They caused everyone years of pain and suffering, and in the end they broke down when they realized that they had a grandson they had never met. So much pain and drama. Over nothing.</p> \n<p>I also recalled my own family – the decision made by my parents 45 years ago in order to avoid dealing with questions like: Will we pay a high price for our love? Will we be ostracized? Will we be able to manage on our own? In order to consummate their marriage and love, they used a false witness who claimed that my father had studied at a yeshiva with him. In doing so, they thought, they had solved the problem.</p> \n<p>Until I was 10 years old I thought my family was normal. I was in the United States, surrounded by people from varied backgrounds: blacks, Asians, mixed-race children – in short, a miscellany. I knew that I was Jewish, and Judaism was the only religion in our home. We even recited kiddush on Friday night.</p> \n<p>But I also knew that my father’s family were Catholics, and that he had chosen to be Jewish for my mother’s sake. Sending a Merry Christmas card to my grandparents and getting a Happy Hanukkah in return was routine. Until the death of my grandfather – a World War II hero who had bombed the Nazis with the U.S. forces and fallen into German captivity – I would call him from Israel to wish him a happy holiday every December 25.</p> \n<p>My uncle, who had studied and played with American-Israeli basketball star Lou Silver in college, told me that at his wedding my father turned to the priest and asked him to give him the traditional Communion, because he had married a Jewish woman and was raising Jewish children. And that except for some drama and gossip surrounding the wedding, it never bothered anyone that my father had married a Jewish woman.</p> \n<p>The last time I saw my Irish-American grandmother, she looked at me and my little brother and said that we had received the best of both worlds. Only that it was a shame that my mother’s world was physically so far from New York.</p> \n<p>When we came to Israel I realized that this tolerance, this coexistence, this unconditional love – don’t really exist. Suddenly I’m a half goy. Suddenly I’m not allowed to tell the truth (or to laugh in their faces) when people stop me in the street and say that they remember that my father came to Israel to participate in the Maccabiah. Suddenly I have to lie – for my parents’ sake. To everyone. To family, friends, colleagues, and every time they interviewed me in the media. Not to tell the truth. Not to be defiant. Not to come out against the status quo. Not to damage my family’s honor.</p> \n<p>It had always seemed strange to me that an Israeli hero, who helped put us on the map, and it wasn’t just in the realm of sport, who did reserve duty from the moment he became a citizen, had to hide. The only difference between him and other foreigners who married Israelis is his white skin. After all, if to this day people cast doubt on the Jewishness of the Ethiopian community, it’s clear that no rabbinical court judge would have believed that a black basketball player from New York is a former yeshiva student.</p> \n<p>Sean Dawson, the son of former basketball player Joe Dawson, who married an Israeli woman and stayed in Israel, didn’t have the privilege of concealing his father’s real roots, and he was a victim of considerable racism because of that, although his mother is a &quot;kosher&quot; Jew.</p> \n<p>I refused to internalize the message of my parents and their generation: to lie when you’re afraid that you won’t be accepted as you are. And perhaps because of that I’ve always had a warm place in my heart for Lucy, ever since first meeting her, outside the house of Maccabi basketball team manager Moni Fanan, when a group of sports people made racist remarks to her, when she had only come to do her job. A decade later she is still fighting for her place in Israeli society, which is still preoccupied with “us” versus “them,” and doesn’t always distinguish between being the victim and being the victimizers.</p> \n<p>I always find the discussion of the eternal question “Who is a Jew?” funny. Funny, because the world isn’t as black and white as most of the most outspoken participants in this discussion choose to believe. For example, my younger brother, the son of a non-Jewish man, who was born in the United States, did combat duty in Gaza and was wounded in Rafah, and is raising the next generation of Jewish Griffins in Israel. Mixed marriages don’t necessarily create assimilation. If anything, they usually create closeness.</p> \n<p>Lucy’s decision to confront everything and everyone, her strength in not apologizing for what she is and for the person she fell in love with – two things that are not under her control – should serve as a model for the new Israeliness, which challenges the status quo for the benefit of all of us, and does not surrender to the dictates of people who preach racial purity.</p> \n<p>She and Tzachi Halevy, because they are famous people, did not have the option that my parents had of deciding whether to conceal everything, but they did have the ability to choose to be together, despite the difficulties. And for that we should thank them: for the model of coexistence to which we as Israelis are supposed to aspire.</p> \n<p>Becky Griffin is a media personality and a strategic adviser.</p>",

        "text":["<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>America’s trade war with China is widely seen as a personal project of Donald Trump. It’s obvious why. It has all the hallmarks of the president’s style – aggressive and unplanned, disparaged by the global establishment and likely to cost the very voters who support him. It’s another instance of Trump’s assault on the system of international trade.</p> \n<p>Thus, the underlying assumption for many is that Trump will back off from the confrontation, whether because he gets distracted by other issues, decides the political cost is too steep, or decides, as he did with the North American Free Trade Agreement, to settle for symbolic concessions and claim victory.</p> \n<p>Those assumptions are wrong. The world should be readying for a new era, in which the two biggest players in the global economy are in a state of perpetual conflict, an economic cold war that could easily slip into something more dangerous.</p> \n<p>Unlike most other of the president’s policies (including his presumed love of Israel or loathing of the North Korean leader) Trump has long spoken out against China, and has been consistently hostile.</p> \n<p>“It’s an economic enemy, because they have taken advantage of us like nobody in history,” he said about China during a 2015 Good Morning America interview. “It’s the greatest theft in the history of the world what they’ve done to the United States.”</p> \n<p>The White House’s policy goals may be characterized by internecine warfare among top officials, and experts remain baffled by what the United States actually wants from China.</p> \n<p>But one thing for sure is that the Trump administration has no plans to return to the era of cooperation with Beijing in the hopes of gently coaxing it into becoming a member of the international system in good standing.</p> \n<p>A speech given by Vice President Mike Pence almost two weeks ago&nbsp; illustrates the new attitude toward China. It’s not just about Beijing’s trade practices and America’s whopping $335 billion trade surplus with the U.S. last year. It was a broad attack on everything China is and does, from imposing an “Orwellian” system of social controls to buying allies with cheap loans and engaging of reckless militarism.</p> \n<p>As many commentators suggested, it sounded like a call to Cold War, not a to-do list of grievances to be settled through trade talks.</p> \n<p>The 'China way'</p> \n<p>The last Cold War, which lasted for more than four decades, ended with a hands-down victory for the U.S. The war itself was fought in terms of arms races and third-world proxy wars, but America prevailed because of its better-performing economy and technological edge.</p> \n<p>In the emerging Cold War with China, each side’s assets are considerably different than they were in the late 1940s, when the U.S. and the Soviet Union began their face-off.</p> \n<p>Militarily, China is nowhere near where Russia was at the start.</p> \n<p>Ideologically, Russia’s Communism had a compelling model for society to oppose America’s democratic capitalism, but China does not. It can point to its huge economic achievements led by an undemocratic government, but the model isn’t the kind of thing that is going to inspire masses of people to choose the “China way.”</p> \n<p>In the end, however, economics will be the decisive factor, and here, too, America is in a stronger position. The U.S. economy remains much larger than China’s (24% of world output last year versus 14.8%) and much richer (GDP per capital of $59,000 versus $16,700).</p> \n<p>As Washington’s sanctions campaign against Iran demonstrates, America’s size and its web of trade, finance and investment connections, not to mention the paramount role of the dollar, give it global influence Beijing can’t come close to matching.</p> \n<p>Finally, America has a technology lead that China will take years to close, despite its best efforts, if it ever does. The ZTE affair earlier this year – when a leading Chinese tech company came close to collapse after the U.S. imposed sanctions on it for trading with Iran and North Korea – showed the extent to which even China’s technology champions rely on American components and intellectual property.</p> \n<p>The U.S. economy, of course, relies on China as a critical component of its supply chain for everything from iPhones to rare earths, but Beijing isn’t free to disrupt the chain. Its leaders have to deliver consistent, strong economic growth to maintain the appeal of the political system, both to the Chinese themselves and prospective allies.</p> \n<p>Unlike Cold War Communism and American liberalism, China has no ideals or political principles to fall back on. If it can’t ensure economic growth, then who needs it?</p> \n<p>Xi himself may understand that and that is why he has been trying to revive Mao-style communism, but he faces an uphill battle.</p> \n<p>One of the positive outcomes of a prolonged cold conflict with China is that America will need allies, just as it did in the conflict with Russia. As much as Trump disparages the international system, so far, his attack has been more about words than actions. NATO is still intact, and NAFTA is back in business under a new name. The Trump White House is even beginning to realize that allies, international institutions and even foreign aid aren’t such a bad thing after all.</p> \n<p>In that context, Israel may well find itself having to make some difficult choices. Tech-hungry China wants Israeli innovation, and we have been happy to provide it, but America will almost certainly begin looking askance at its ally giving Beijing any kind of boost, especially of the technology has military applications. Israel may have to sacrifice its new pal China to keep its old friend America.</p>",

        "text":["<p>For Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, the U.S. and Israel are two countries using political and economic leverage to force him to accept policies that he finds objectionable - or else risk being completely marginalized.</p> \n<p>Yet, Abbas believes that he has so far withstood at least three key challenges presented by the U.S. and Israel in recent months, and thus he believes he is scoring political victories. He may not be bringing his people an inch closer to statehood or bringing them major benefits, but he sees himself as a political survivor. Leading a movement that historically has been about defiance, he sees survival as its own reward. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>While American efforts - and its policy of pressure - could still yield success on the Palestinian front in resuming meaningful negotiations in the next two years, it is important to see how Abbas sees the Trump Administration, almost at its halfway point.</p> \n<p>Whether one likes Abbas or not, it is important to see how he is likely to think he is winning when it comes to issues of the last few months.</p> \n<p>In looking at his scorecard, it is worth starting with the United Nations. U.S. ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, who has just announced her retirement, led the charge of the Trump Administration to put forward a tough position on the issues of refugees and aid to the Palestinians. That stance is popular among many Americans who question whether the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is really seeking to solve the Palestinian refugee issue, but rather seeks to perpetuate it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, by not putting forward an alternative U.S. plan for Palestinian humanitarian assistance focused on bona fide American non-governmental aid groups, while withholding all American aid to the Palestinian Authority, it has made it easier for Europeans and Arabs states to galvanize enthusiasm and support for UNRWA. This was exacerbated by concerns that Palestinian kids in the West Bank and Gaza will not be able to go to school this fall.</p> \n<p>Two rounds of emergency appeals, including one at the time of the opening of the UN General Assembly, equaling $320 million in pledges for 2018, has covered the deficit that UNRWA has faced, according to UN officials.</p> \n<p>Of course, the test will be: Will these countries sustain these levels over the years to come? One senior non-American diplomat confidently declared to me, &quot;The U.S. withholding of funding from UNRWA has created a new international equilibrium as other countries have stepped in. UNRWA has not been crippled and the U.S. has been marginalized&quot; within the organization.</p> \n<p>The U.S. hope was that its withdrawal of funds would lead to a shift in UNRWA’s policy, not least its definition of refugees, but this does not seem to be the case. Likewise, U.S. hoped this would pressure Abbas to change his &quot;no contact&quot; stance via a vis the Trump administration has not been borne out either.</p> \n<p>The U.S. has legitimate reasons to stop funding UNRWA, but the bottom line is Abbas seems poised to continue to use UNRWA as a political cudgel, at least for now.</p> \n<p>Another development that Abbas must favor is President Donald Trump’s recent declaration in which he said for the first time that he favors the two-state solution, after famously refusing to publicly endorse the two-state approach since the start of his administration.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Over the first year of the Trump Administration, Palestinian officials say that Abbas was concerned that the U.S. would cajole Gulf states like Saudi Arabia into pressuring him to accept Trump’s peace deal.</p> \n<p>Those Gulf states may not much like or respect Abbas - due to an array of grievances with Abbas personally (including long-standing Emirati anger over Abbas’s feud with Mohammed Dahlan) and subsequently have not been generous donors to the Palestinian Authority. However, that pressure has simply not materialized - and Abbas has breathed a sigh of relief.</p> \n<p>Ever since the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) to the White House in the spring of this year, the once-fashionable term &quot;outside – in&quot; has lost its shine. That idea, that parties outside the immediate Israeli-Palestinian circle can facilitate Arab backing for a Trump peace plan or even pre-empt them with innovative bilateral ties, has been gradually nixed, as MBS has made it clear that the U.S. cannot count on Saudi to twist the arms of the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>This may have been the case even if the U.S. had not move its embassy to Jerusalem, but certainly Arab officials point to this as a complicating factor.</p> \n<p>Two elements likely to reinforce this dropping of outside Arab pressure on the PA are the cooling of Saudi-U.S. relations, indicated not least by a public statement by Trump at a rally to his supporters recently that the Kingdom could not survive two weeks without the U.S., as well as the recent crisis surrounding the disappearance and apparent murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A third area where Abbas feels success is that he has paid no political price for his indifference to the misery in Gaza. Not only has he not been involved in securing Qatari funding to increase electricity for Gazans, from four to eight hours per day until the end of 2018, he has opposed it. He has cut PA aid to Gaza.</p> \n<p>His strategy has been clear: Make the situation in Gaza more severe in order to press Hamas into a military confrontation with Israel, which would break the impasse.</p> \n<p>This would yield dual benefits. It would militarily weaken his rival, Hamas. And, it would allow Abbas to continue to do what he loves, namely, publicly blaming Israel as the victimizer. Blaming Israel as the bully is what enables Abbas to reinforce the Palestinian narrative in Europe as the victim. It is a cynical move, but it has worked.</p> \n<p>Abbas has not only not paid a price for his indifference to Gaza, but he has done so while snubbing Egyptian mediation and attempts to find a way for the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza.</p> \n<p>For Abbas, Gaza is a trap. In his view, unless Hamas surrenders its guns, he has the authority and they have the responsibility to improve the miserable living conditions in Gaza. That understandable position on Hamas disarmament, however, should be met with a concrete plan by Egypt regarding how to achieve an objective, but this has not been the case.</p> \n<p>So whether the issue is UNRWA, the Arabs and Trump, or Gaza, Abbas believes he has avoided paying political costs in defying the U.S, even if the U.S. has indeed cut economic aid.</p> \n<p>Of course, his political maneuverings have not necessarily helped the Palestinian people. The two-state outcome seems far off. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition still builds beyond the security barrier. Moreover, succession for the 83-year-old Abbas is murkier than ever.</p> \n<p>A common thread between the controversies relating to UNRWA, the role of Arab states and the status of Gaza is that Abbas measures successes by what did not happen - namely, by his ability to maintain the situation in these distinct arenas in a bid to foil the U.S.</p> \n<p>Sadly, in the Mideast, political survival and success are too often conflated with strategic gains. The two are not the same. In the twilight of his life, Abbas has no illusions that he is on the cusp of strategic success, and therefore consoles himself with these acts of non-cooperation.</p> \n<p>But even as the head of a movement whose very self-definition over many decades is inextricably tied to the idea of defiance of outside powers, this organizing principle has so far proven to an insufficient catalyst to reach closer to the goal of statehood.</p> \n<p>David Makovsky is the Ziegler Distinguished Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and helped create its interactive mapping tool &quot;Settlements and Solutions: Is It Too Late for Two States?&quot;&nbsp;He is a former senior advisor in the Office of the U.S. Secretary of State to the envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations (2013-2014)</p>",

Ultimately, the army stresses now, no formal bidding process related to this specific initiative was conducted and implementation of the plan never moved forward.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The document that was sent to the companies, which Haaretz has obtained and which was also posted on the Defense Ministry’s website, states that the system in question would have to scan and store both private and public information from users of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google Plus, YouTube and so on. It does not specify who would be monitored; whether Jewish citizens of Israel, or Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem – who for the most part don’t hold Israeli citizenship – would be targeted; or whether restrictions set by any outside entity would be imposed on the surveillance activities.</p> \n<p>The army would not say whether it is actually monitoring social media users or whether a bidding process for a related scheme is being pursued.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The dangers posed by invasive technologies&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>According to a statement issued by the IDF, the document “was a draft of an invitation to submit bids that did not come to fruition. For operational and technological reasons, the bidding process was not carried out. The army has a range of needs that stem from its operational situation, various threats and the enemy’s capabilities. For clear reasons of information security, we will not provide details regarding the characteristics of the technological systems.”</p> \n<p>The October 2016 document said the project was proposed following a wave of so-called lone-wolf stabbing attacks against Israelis in 2015. Such attacks, by individuals not typically acting on behalf of a specific organization, highlighted the need to monitor social media and to examine how those media were influencing Palestinians.</p> \n<p>The invitation for bids described a system that would monitor social media in Arabic, Hebrew and English. Unlike the ongoing monitoring by the IDF of nonprofit groups, social organizations and bloggers – involving collection and analyses of information that is widely accessible to the public – the system described in the document was to be used to follow personal communications. The objective was to gather information from up to 500 social media contacts, whom the individual in question either responded to, corresponded with or asked to add as a friend.</p> \n<p>The keywords the IDF proposed tracking included &quot;terrorism&quot; and related links, &quot;resistance,&quot; &quot;nationalism&quot; and &quot;religion.&quot; Other words that would have been monitored included &quot;statesmanship,&quot; &quot;politics,&quot; &quot;economics&quot; and &quot;quality of life.&quot;</p> \n<p>The choice of these words has raised questions among cybersecurity experts, as they seem to indicate an interest on the military's part in issues that up until now have been the exclusive realms of other Israeli information security agencies.</p> \n<p>“It is strange that they were seeking texts in Hebrew,” notes Jonathan Klinger, who specializes in cyber law and serves as legal counsel to the Israeli Digital Rights Movement.</p> \n<p>“It’s not within the army’s authority to go after citizens rather than enemies. Keywords like ‘politics,’ ‘parties,’ ‘political figures’ and ‘candidates’ are exactly what the army cannot track. The army can’t act like that with regard to Israeli citizens, other than when it comes to violations of [military] censorship, but this involves an entirely different system,” he says.</p> \n<p>Klinger adds that a system such as that described in the two-year-old document, if indeed used by the army, would have to be monitored by an external entity to ensure that it is not used against Israeli citizens.</p> \n<p>However, he says, “if the army were to set up such a system to foil terrorist attacks and those whom [the IDF] tracked were not Israeli citizens but were known as terrorist operatives who could carry out an attack – the Israeli army would then have the authority to act to prevent the next terrorist attack.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Archaeologists racing to save a vulnerable and rapidly disintegrating 2,000-year old Jewish catacomb in Rome gave in to pressure from an ultra-Orthodox Jewish group and let them rebury the bones found within, not allowing their study. The decision spurred outrage among some scientists who protested in frustration as the bones were resealed in their tombs, putting the remains beyond the reach of curious researchers forever.</p> \n<p>The Italian authorities and the archaeologists involved rebut that the compromise was necessary in order to save the site, which had begun to decay rapidly after its exposure.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, new discoveries made in the process of restoring the underground cemetery highlight the importance and prosperity of the Jewish community in the capital of the Roman empire, as well as the surprising extent to which their culture was intertwined with that of pagans and Christians.</p> \n<p>Also, in a development likely to surprise Jews everywhere, the study of the site has led archaeologists to a new theory about how and where the menorah became a symbol of the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>Mussolini and the Jews</p> \n<p>The catacomb, housing some 4,000 burials on two floors, was in use between the 2nd and 5th centuries C.E., the archaeologists say, though some experts believe it may have been built even earlier. It is located in northern modern Rome, beneath the grounds of Villa Torlonia, a 19th-century neoclassical villa with vast gardens once owned by the aristocratic family of the same name.</p> \n<p>During the Fascist period, the villa was rented by none other than Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, as his residence in the city.</p> \n<p>The underground city of the dead was rediscovered in 1919 during construction work on the estate, but it has since lain mostly abandoned and easy prey to looters, researchers say.</p> \n<p>“Most of the tombs had been smashed open and looted, with the bones strewn around the floor, and anyone who went in could walk on them and crush them,” says Yuval Baruch, an archaeologist with the Israel Antiquities Authority leading the restoration project.</p> \n<p>In general, Christian catacombs may be better known than Jewish ones because they have been well preserved by the Catholic Church as burial spots of martyrs and early places of worship. But Jews used catacombs too. There are at least six such cemeteries in Rome alone, says Daniela Rossi, the archaeologist overseeing the project on behalf of the Italian Culture Ministry.</p> \n<p>In fact, some researchers have concluded that the Jewish catacombs in the city predate the Christian ones, and that it was the Jews who first introduced this burial method to ancient Rome.</p> \n<p>As in most of these underground cemeteries, the dead of Villa Torlonia were buried in loculi - rows of niches carved into the soft tufa stone and then sealed with plaster. The cover would often be inscribed with the name of the deceased as well as prayers or invocations.</p> \n<p>Those who could afford it were buried in larger chapels with arched niches, known as arcosolia, whose walls and ceilings were elegantly decorated with Jewish motifs such as menorahs and the Ark of the Covenant, or symbolic fruits like the pomegranate and the etrog.</p> \n<p>Already in 2005, the Italian Culture Ministry had approved the 1.4-million-euro restoration plan for the catacomb, but then the experts ran into an impasse. Because Italian law recognizes and respects Jewish burial customs, archaeologists could not begin work on the site with all those bones lying around, Rossi explains.</p> \n<p>Jewish religious law prohibits removing or damaging bones from a burial, even if done for scientific purposes. In Israel, this has led to frequent clashes between ultra-Orthodox Jews and archaeologists whenever ancient Jewish graves are dug up.</p> \n<p>To preserve this treasure, archaeologists had to make concessions to Jewish religious sensitivities, Rossi says.</p> \n<p>Between a rock and a hard place</p> \n<p>Over the last year, Italian authorities allowed Atra Kadisha - a small ultra-Orthodox group that took upon itself to protect Jewish graves wherever they might be - to collect the human remains at Villa Torlonia and reseal them in the loculi.</p> \n<p>Bones, and the DNA they contain, can help date a site or answer questions like where people came from, what illnesses they suffered from and what they ate. The decision to surrender this scientific treasure trove angered many experts, dozens of whom signed petitions to the Culture Ministry asking for the reburials to be stopped.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, as the Italian-Israeli team presented the project at a conference in Jerusalem, one angry archaeologist interrupted the talk by shouting that his colleagues had behaved unethically.</p> \n<p>“It breaks my heart that people who have nothing to do with archaeology were allowed to do such enormous damage to antiquities,” the dissenting researcher, Amos Kloner from Bar Ilan University, later told Haaretz. “Atra Kadisha doesn’t care about archaeological findings. They are an extremist religious group that should not be backed by archaeologists.”</p> \n<p>The Italians only agreed to allow the ultra-Orthodox in “because they were afraid of being accused of anti-Semitism,” Kloner suggests.</p> \n<p>Scholars from around the world wrote time and again to the Italian authorities beseeching them to stop the works and allow a task force of international experts to inspect the site, says Leonard Rutgers, an archaeologist from Utrecht University and a longtime researcher of Jewish catacombs in Rome.</p> \n<p>“The Italians never let us in, which is even more worrying, because if there is no problem with your work then you should have nothing to hide,” Rutgers says. Before letting a minority group barge in and do “irreversible damage” to antiquities, there should have been a broader debate involving researchers and religious figures to discuss how to respect the human remains without losing anything of historical value, he says.</p> \n<p>Rutgers further cautioned that the catacomb is extremely fragile and opening it to the public could lead to further damage.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, Yuval Baruch, who explains that the Israel Antiquities Authority joined the project following the protests, reports that the Israelis were positively impressed when they inspected the site during the reburial work last year.</p> \n<p>“From what we saw, they worked together with experts in conservation and did a very precise work of archaeological restoration,” he said. “We don’t think that salvaging the bones did any damage to research beyond, of course, preventing research on the bones themselves.”</p> \n<p>“We were between a rock and a hard place, between the demands of the Orthodox and the scientific community,” Rossi told Haaretz on the sidelines of the conference. “I am not ashamed of the compromise we made. Certainly, it’s a loss for science, because we couldn’t bring in the anthropologists to study the bones, but this is a price we had to pay for not losing the entire monument.”</p> \n<p>With Atra Kadisha’s religious work completed, the restorers will begin work next month on conserving the frescoes and preparing the site for visitors. The plan is to open the catacomb sometime next year. Funding is still being sought for a small museum to be built above ground to showcase important finds, Rossi said.</p> \n<p>Shalom shalom</p> \n<p>The preliminary work has meanwhile turned up new discoveries, such as the only Hebrew inscription found in the catacomb. Most of the writing in the cemetery is in Greek – the lingua franca of early diaspora Jews and Hellenistic-era Israel – and some is in Latin.</p> \n<p>Actually, the new-found Hebrew text was first noticed by one of the rabbis working in the catacomb, Rossi says.</p> \n<p>The text is fragmentary but is believed to spell out “Clodius shalom shalom” – &nbsp;likely the equivalent of a rest-in-peace blessing for a man named Clodius.</p> \n<p>Archaeologists also found a beautifully preserved oil lamp decorated with the Christogram – a symbol of Christ formed by the Greek letters ‘chi’ and ‘rho’ – which suggests the catacomb was used by early Christians in Rome as well.</p> \n<p>The fact that local Jews had typically Latin names such as Clodius, and that Christian symbols were found, indicates the extent to which the cultures living side by side in Rome influenced each other, Rossi concludes. “There was a lot more coexistence and commingling than we think,” she says.</p> \n<p>The sheer number of burials in Villa Torlonia and in other Jewish catacombs in the city also attests to the size of the local community, Rossi says.</p> \n<p>The first Jews arrived in Rome during the second century B.C.E., and many more came –voluntarily or as captives – following the abortive Jewish Revolt and the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 C.E. Most of the Jews settled in Trastevere, a neighborhood on the River Tiber, and were generally artisans or traders.</p> \n<p>Catacombs with their tightly-packed shelves were usually used by the lower classes, who couldn’t afford to buy a plot in a fancy open-air pagan necropolis. But the rich decorations in some of the larger tombs in Villa Torlonia show that at least some of Rome’s Jews had achieved a modicum of wealth, Rossi says.</p> \n<p>“We don’t know exactly how many Jews there were, but it must have been a fairly large community with a stratified society, as was the rest of Roman society,” she says.</p> \n<p>Where does the menorah come from?</p> \n<p>The restoration at Villa Torlonia has also given researchers an opportunity to study more closely the catacomb’s frescoes, especially the nearly ubiquitous depictions of the menorah, the seven-armed candelabrum that was one of the treasures the Romans seized from the Temple.</p> \n<p>Their conclusions were presented at the conference in Jerusalem and suggest that we need to rethink the origins of the menorah as a symbol of the Jewish people, says Baruch, the Israeli archaeologist.</p> \n<p>There are less than a dozen depictions of the menorah in Israel that date to before the destruction of the Temple, and these are usually found in a discreet location, such as a water well, or in a context connected to the Cohanim, the priests of the Temple. This makes sense because at the time the menorah was locked up in the Temple and visible only to the priests, Baruch says.</p> \n<p>After the Temple was destroyed, the menorah was prominently depicted on the primary Arch of Titus, which the emperor Domitian built in Rome (in fact, two were built) to celebrate the Roman triumph over rebellious Judea. The original menorah, looted from the Temple, was displayed in the Temple of Peace built nearby by the emperor Vespasian along with other trophies of Rome’s wars.</p> \n<p>Most historians believe the menorah itself was melted down during the barbarian invasions of Italy in the 5th century C.E., but the bas-relief on the arch has endured to this day. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Suddenly anyone could go and copy it, and the depiction on the arch became the prototype of all menorahs,” Baruch says.</p> \n<p>Initially used in the Jewish catacombs of Rome as a symbol of death and mourning for the destruction of the Temple, only later did the menorah acquire a broader national significance, appearing in synagogues and Jewish buildings across Israel and the diaspora, he says.</p> \n<p>“Ironically, it seems that the menorah as a symbol of the Jewish people did not originate in Israel, but in Rome,” the archaeologist concludes.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Turkish authorities believe that prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who disappeared four days ago after entering Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul, was killed inside the consulate, two Turkish sources said on Saturday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;The initial assessment of the Turkish police is that Mr. Khashoggi has been killed at the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul. We believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate,&quot; one Turkish official told Reuters.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The sources did not say how they believed the killing was carried out.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A source at the Saudi consulate denied that Khashoggi had been killed at the mission and said in a statement that the accusations were baseless.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The source said that a security team including Saudi investigators had arrived in Istanbul on Saturday to take part in the investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Trump: I told Saudi King Salman he wouldn't last for two weeks without U.S. military backing</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia's consul-general told Reuters earlier on Saturday that his country was helping search for Khashoggi, and dismissed talk of his possible abduction.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Khashoggi, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Washington for the past year fearing retribution for his criticism of Saudi policies, entered the consulate on Tuesday to secure documents for his forthcoming marriage, according to his fiancee, who waited outside. He has not been heard of since.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since then, Turkish and Saudi officials have offered conflicting accounts of his disappearance, with Ankara saying there was no evidence that he had left the diplomatic mission and Riyadh saying he exited the premises the same day.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The United States is seeking more information, a State Department official said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We are not in a position to confirm these reports, but we are following them closely,&quot; the official said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A Turkish security source told Reuters that a group of 15 Saudi nationals, including some officials, had arrived in Istanbul in two planes and entered the consulate on the same day Khashoggi was there, and later left the country.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Turkish source said Turkish officials were trying to identify them. Turkey's Anadolu news agency also reported that the group of Saudis were briefly at the consulate.&nbsp;  Deeping Divisions&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Khashoggi's disappearance is likely to further deepen divisions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Relations were already strained after Turkey sent troops to the Gulf state of Qatar last year in a show of support after its Gulf neighbours, including Saudi Arabia, imposed an embargo on Doha.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said this week that the kingdom would allow Turkey to search the consulate for Khashoggi. But he also criticized Turkey's crackdown following a 2016 failed coup against Erdogan.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;How Saudi Arabia's crown prince's rise led to the fall of the Bin Laden business empire</p> \n<p>On Saturday, Yasin Aktay, Erdogan's AK Party adviser and a friend of Khashoggi, told Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera: &quot;We demand a convincing clarification from Saudi Arabia, and what the crown prince offered is not convincing.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He also said what happened to Khashoggi was a crime and those responsible for his disappearance must be tried, Al Jazeera said.&nbsp; Turkish prosecutors have begun an investigation into the case, officials said on Saturday, and a spokesman for Erdogan's AK Party said authorities would uncover his whereabouts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;The condition of the lost journalist, details on him and who is responsible for this will be uncovered,&quot; Omer Celik said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Khashoggi is a familiar face on political talk shows on Arab satellite television networks and used to advise Prince Turki al-Faisal, former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to the United States and Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Over the past year, he has written columns for newspapers including the Washington Post criticising Saudi policies towards Qatar and Canada, the war in Yemen and a crackdown on dissent which has seen dozens of people detained.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice,&quot; Khashoggi wrote in September 2017. &quot;To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Two months later, writing about the detentions of scores of Saudi royals, senior officials and businessmen accused of corruption, he said Mohammed bin Salman dispensed &quot;selective justice&quot; and said there was &quot;complete intolerance for even mild criticism&quot; of the crown prince.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On Saturday Saudi Arabia's consul-general in Istanbul, Mohammad al-Otaibi, opened up his mission to Reuters to show that Khashoggi was not on the premises, and said talk of his abduction was ungrounded.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Opening cupboards, filing cabinets and wooden panels covering air conditioning units, Otaibi walked through the six floors of the building including a basement prayer room, offices, visa counters, kitchens and toilets as well as storage and security rooms.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said the consulate was equipped with cameras but they did not record footage, so no images could be retrieved of Khashoggi entering or leaving the consulate, which is ringed by police barriers and has high security fences topped with barbed wire.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>The crisis on the Syrian front also appears to be far from over, even if it has fallen off the front pages and the news broadcasts. Despite the reassuring noises coming out of Jerusalem, something fundamental has shifted in the north. Senior officials repeat at every occasion the mantra that the Israel Air Force is free to act in Syrian airspace and will renew its strikes on military targets there if necessary. In the meantime, however, at least according to foreign news reports, that hasn’t happened. Since the downing of the Russian plane over Latakia by Syrian anti-aircraft missiles during an Israeli airstrike on September 17, there have been no reports of new attacks.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>With great pomp and circumstance, S-300 surface-to-air missile systems were delivered to the Russian Hmeimim air base in western Syria, in Moscow’s first concrete response to last month’s incident. According to experts, it will take the Russians a few months to train the Syrian crews to operate them independently. Even then, it’s not clear what command and control policy will be established between Damascus and Moscow on Syrian soil.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, after marveling at the presumed ability of IAF pilots to evade these air defense systems, it bears remembering that this challenge is not child’s play. The Russians are equipped with electronic warfare systems and a myriad other methods that could increase the difficulty level for Israel.</p> \n<p>The bigger obstacle, though, is strategic. Vladimir Putin was not happy about Israel’s continued attacks after the Assad regime regained control of southern Syria and consolidated his grip on the rest of the country. The most recent incident gave the Russian president tools to ratchet up the pressure on Israel – and perhaps on Iran and Hezbollah as well – and to create a new strategic model that minimizes the power and the frequency of friction among the parties.</p> \n<p>In his address to the UN General Assembly last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also mentioned the destination of the Iranian shipment that was attacked in Latakia – underground manufacturing sites for precision-guided missiles and rockets that Hezbollah is building in Beirut, according to Israel. After a calculated three-day delay, the Lebanese government invited diplomats and journalists to a tour of the sites exposed by Netanyahu to rebuff the Israeli leader’s allegations. Not all the participants were persuaded. Some of them must have noted that three days would have given Hezbollah sufficient time to get rid of the evidence – in theory, at least. The locations of the sites were not hidden from Western observers: near the international airport, schools and hospitals, not to mention a golf course favored by foreigners.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, someone sent text messages to the cellphones of tens of thousands of residents of southern Beirut, showing an aerial image of a fourth site that Hezbollah is developing in the heart of their neighborhood. The residents were warned of the implications of living so close to missiles. In contrast to the Gaza Strip, the drumbeat of an imminent war is not heard in Lebanon, but psychological warfare is undoubtedly being conducted in there, on a wide range of channels and frequencies.</p>",

As part of the initiative, which will be announced Monday evening, interviews will be conducted with hundreds of people who were involved in establishing and developing the settlements.</p> \n<p>“The project will document the ‘legends’ of settlement, people like Daniela Weiss, Ze’ev Hever, Benny Katzover, Miriam Levinger and Israel Harel,” an associate of Gamliel’s explained. “Testimonies will also be taken from people who have never before spoken publicly and were part of the founding nucleus of communities like Kedumim and Karnei Shomron.”</p> \n<p>The ministry estimates that during the project’s first year some 100 interviews will be conducted, in which the subjects will review their personal history and tell about how they founded the settlements and the challenges they face.

        "text":["<p>They advise members of Knesset and ministers, attend Knesset committee meetings, sit at conferences, write policy papers, publish newspaper articles and petition the High Court. Meet the Kohelet Policy Forum.</p> \n<p>Quietly, under the radar, this research institute, officially a nongovernmental organization, has become one of the strongest and most influential bodies in Israeli politics. Kohelet’s fingerprints are visible in every explosive and divisive issue that has weakened the legal system and regulation, from the nation-state law through personal political appointments of senior professional positions to the override clause (that would let the Knesset reenact laws overturned by the High Court of Justice).</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The chairman of the Kohelet Forum, which was established in 2012, is Prof. Moshe Koppel, who teaches computer science at Bar-Ilan University. Executive Director Meir Rubin (Neria), however, is considered the man behind the organization’s success. In the past two years he has become a familiar face in the Knesset among lobbyists, parliamentary advisers, MKs and ministers. Someone who met him recently says that Rubin boasted to him that “We run the Knesset” (Rubin claims that he doesn’t remember saying such a thing).</p> \n<p>Rubin is a very ideological man, with the skills of a political wheeler-dealer. He began his political career as the parliamentary adviser of Minister Zeev Elkin from the Likud political party, and later served as the legislation coordinator for the Likud. He graduated from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem with a bachelor’s degree in law and economics and a master’s degree in public and international law, and interned in the Gornitzky and Co law firm.</p> \n<p>He has worked at Kohelet since its inception, back when there were only six employees. At the time, he exploited his Likud connections in order to reach ministers and MKs. Today, when the organization employs about 70 people, Rubin and his staff are far more entrenched in the political arena, mainly on the right.</p> \n<p>The Kohelet Forum was founded as a think tank for the political and economic right, a counterweight to the liberal Israel Democracy Institute. And in fact, slowly but surely, the Forum seems to have accumulated status and power, particularly in the current government. Its influence is now greater than that of the IDI.</p> \n<p>Kohelet focuses its work on the legal and economic sphere. As part of their “Governability” project, they are trying to weaken the legal system in general, and regulation in particular; their “Individual Liberty” portfolio strives towards the libertarian causes of minimizing government intervention and promoting free-market economy. In religious Zionist circles Kohelet therefore gets considerable flak, as the Forum and the leaders of Habayit Hayehudi political party are seen as having “forgotten” concepts such as the welfare state and concern for the weak. In the Knesset, some compare their views to those of the Trumpian branch of the Republican Party in the United States.</p> \n<p>The Kohelet Forum’s main project is in the field of law and government. In Kohelet they believe that the professional echelon in parliament and in the government should be totally subordinate to the elected leadership, as is the case in the United States. This in spite of Israel’s experience, which shows that politicization in the Civil Service can cause considerable damage.</p> \n<p>“Today, policy is decided by legal advisers, something that undermines governability,” says Dr. Michael Sarel, former chief economist in the Finance Ministry who now heads the Kohelet Economic Forum. “The overregulation undermines competition. I’m in favor of government intervention when it’s related to equality of opportunity and to providing high-quality public services.”</p> \n<p>An example of the Forum’s fight for the subordination of the professional echelon is their struggle for personal political appointments of legal advisers and deputy director generals in governmental offices ministries. Ministries’ director generals have always been personal political appointments, but as part of the attempt to expand political influence over the professional echelon, Kohelet has pushed to have their deputies appointed politically as well. In July 2015, the forum published a position paper entitled “Appointments and Governability in Israel” that recommended that ministers should be able to appoint two senior professional advisers or two senior directors in each ministry.</p> \n<p>They also recommended that every minister should be able to personally appoint their ministry’s legal adviser. “Ministers in Israel lack the tools to run the ministries and to examine the policy implemented by senior officials,” the authors argued. Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked and others have tried to pass measures to this effect in the past year. For now, they have yet to succeed.</p> \n<p>The nation-state law is another important aspect of Kohelet’s activity. The Basic Law on Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People, also known as the nation-state law, was approved by the Knesset on July 19 and affirmed that only Jews have the right to self-determination in Israel. It also downgraded Arabic to a language with “special status.” The law permits judges to give priority to Israel’s Jewish character in their rulings.</p> \n<p>Although the law was under discussion in the government even before Kohelet was around (it was first initiated by the Institute for Zionist Strategies, then headed by Israel Harel), Kohelet’s members are considered responsible for pushing the bill forward in the past year and insisting on specific wording.</p> \n<p>“Originally, when it was in Israel Harel’s hands, there was room for negotiation in the discussions,” says someone who was a witness to the legislative process. “At the time, for example, some people were willing to settle for the [Israeli] Declaration of Independence as the nation-state law itself. But when the Kohelet Forum arrived, the entire discussion went to a more extreme place that emphasized the supremacy of the Jewish people.”</p> \n<p>Former Cabinet Secretary Zvi Hauser, a Kohelet research fellow, participated in a number of Knesset discussions on the law. In media interviews he described the importance of the law as complementing the series of basic laws that form the Israeli constitution, in that it defines Israel as the state of the Jewish people. “In the nation-state law we contributed quite a lot to the discussion,” says Rubin. “Hauser had a lot to contribute regarding the meaning of Israel as a nation-state. Koppel also wrote first drafts of the law.”</p> \n<p>Deep ties</p> \n<p>Outwardly, Kohelet presents itself as an independent research institute without ties to any organization, whose services are available to everyone. In fact, they find a sympathetic ear in specific parts of Likud, and, above all, in Habayit Hayehudi. “They have an open door to [Education Minister Naftali] Bennett and Shaked,” said a coalition MK. “Maybe they offer their wares to everyone, but Shaked and Bennett are the purchasers.”</p> \n<p>Shaked in particular eagerly buys into the ideas and the mind-set of the Forum. Shaked has been singled out in the political system as the person likely to succeed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as head of Likud (Likud activists are already gossiping about her future as the next party leader), as was also indicated by a survey that predicted 33 seats to Likud under her leadership. In such a future situation, there is no question that the influence of the Kohelet Forum would soar to new heights.</p> \n<p>In closed discussions, Shaked admits that the Kohelet Forum is definitely a body that she listens to. Others see this too. “About three years ago I met with Rubin and suggested to him that we write a joint letter to Shaked on a subject I wanted to advance,” a strategic adviser involved in the political system told Haaretz. “He told me, ‘I don’t need letters in order to get to Ayelet. I send her a message or pick up a phone directly.”</p> \n<p>In response, Rubin said: “I won’t comment on the relationships we have with specific elected officials, unless they attend public events. We cooperate with every minister, MK or senior official who is part of public discourse, without giving preference to anyone. Clearly there are politicians who feel more comfortable sending a text message to a Kohelet department head at 2 AM and getting a reply half an hour later. An MK who doesn’t know us will feel less comfortable doing that. Those who work with us more – know how to make more use of what we have to offer.”</p> \n<p>Influencing the media</p> \n<p>Another example of the long-term influence of the organization can be seen in the amendment to the film law, a move led by Culture Minister Miri Regev, which almost passed at the end of the Knesset summer session, but nose-dived after an opposition filibuster. Regev sought to carry out a reform in the approval of film budgets by changing the composition of the reviewers, increasing the representation of residents of Judea and Samaria and of the country’s periphery – which aroused considerable anger in the artistic community.</p> \n<p>But film is only one aspect of the Kohelet Forum’s involvement in the media and freedom of expression. For instance, in 2015 the Forum submitted a document to the committee in charge of the official Knesset Channel that broadcasts Knesset hearings. In the position paper, they aligned themselves with the politicians on the committee who wanted the Knesset Channel to be subordinate to them by recommending, indirectly, that the Channel be transferred to the control of Channel 20. Channel 20, founded in 2014, has become a right-wing channel for current affairs that expresses clear support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Despite its low ratings, Kohelet effectively supported its bid to run the Knesset broadcasts in an attempt to secure another outlet for their ideology.</p> \n<p>In addition, in 2014 the Kohelet Forum published a policy paper on the Army Radio. They suggested introducing a greater variety of viewpoints among the station’s broadcasters and considering changes in the team presenting the main programs. Some of their recommendations have in fact taken effect in recent years after increasing criticism of Army Radio from the right.</p> \n<p>Follow the money</p> \n<p>Kohelet Chairman Koppel is also a member of the board of directors of the Tikvah Fund, which is one of Kohelet’s donors. The Tikvah Fund was established by the late Jewish philanthropist Zalman Bernstein whose widow, Mem Bernstein, has replaced him on the board of directors.</p> \n<p>Avi Chai received its assets from Bernstein and his estate.</p> \n<p>Tikvah also donates to a series of right-wing organizations, including news and intellectual website Mida, the Movement for Governability and Democracy, and organizations connected to the settlements.</p> \n<p>Tikvah Fund’s chairman is Roger Hertog, who in the past contributed to Netanyahu and to Likud Minister Yuval Steinitz. The Tikvah Fund is the publisher of the journal Hashiloach, which published an article by Shaked several years ago titled “The Path to Democracy and Governance.” In this article, she spelled out her vision for the changes needed, in her view, in Israel’s legal system.</p> \n<p>Other donors to the Kohelet Forum include the Central Fund of Israel, which is run by Marcus Brothers Fabric in the United States. One of the family members, Itamar Marcus, established the right-wing research institute Palestinian Media Watch. Another donor is American businessman Myron Zimmerman, who gives through the MZ Foundation, located in San Francisco. Zimmerman also contributed to Shaked’s campaign before the 2015 election. The Friedberg Charitable Foundation in Canada is another donor.</p> \n<p>However, Kohelet’s main donor remains anonymous, and sends donations via an American nonprofit organization called American Friends of Kohelet Policy Forum. In 2016 he donated about 7.8 million shekels ($2.1 million), and a year later, about 28.5 million (part of which, according to the NGO’s report, was designated for activity in 2018). In addition, there may be small donors who also send money via the friends of the Kohelet Forum organization.</p> \n<p>In the political establishment, many people are outraged that an organization that seeks to influence central processes within Israeli politics operates without transparency, concealing the identity of its principal donor. Recently, the Financial Justice NGO examined the possibility of cooperating with Kohelet in connection with a project related to regulation of the banks, but ended up pulling out due to the lack of transparency. “This is an organization with a large budget, the public deserves to know who the donor is,” explains Barak Gonen, the head of Financial Justice. “I have no problem with Kohelet having donors, including people from the right, but it’s very disturbing that large sums of money are being channeled for the purpose of influencing our politics and our economy, and the general public has absolutely no idea where the money is coming from.”</p> \n<p>A substantial part of the money is used for salaries for the employees, most of whom are legal scholars and economists who write policy papers in the Forum’s spacious offices in Jerusalem. The salaries are high, certainly relative to other NGOs and research institutes in the field of the social sciences.</p> \n<p>This article was updated on October 5, 2018 to clarify that Avi Chai does not receive funding from Tikvah, but that it received its assets from Bernstein and his estate.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Hamas’ leader in Gaza says that though Israel is incomparably stronger than the Islamist group, it will never win. He added that if war does break out, Israel will have no choice but to try to reoccupy Gaza.</p> \n<p>Yahya Sinwar made the comments as part of an exclusive interview with the Italian daily la Repubblica, a partial Hebrew translation of which was published in Israel on Thursday. Haaretz has obtained lengthy extracts of the interview, slated to run in the Italian newspaper and Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth in full on Friday.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Deadly&nbsp;Gaza clashes: Hamas is deliberately testing Israel</p> \n<p>In the interview with Francesca Borri, his first with a Western outlet, Sinwar called for a cease-fire with Israel, speaking of a “historic opportunity for change.”</p> \n<p>Sinwar said neither side is interested in a new war. “We cannot prevail in a confrontation with a nuclear power,” he said, “but likewise, [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu would have nothing to gain from a new war: This would be the fourth war, and they cannot deliver the same results they delivered with the first, the second, the third. … Eventually, they would have to reoccupy Gaza.”</p> \n<p>According to the Hamas leader, this would be a problem for Israel due to its settlements. “At a time when Netanyahu is trying to get rid of Palestinians in the West Bank while keeping a Jewish majority, I don’t think he would be interested in annexing a territory with an extra 2 million Palestinians,” he said of the coastal enclave.</p> \n<p>“If you know war, you don’t want war,” he added. “I’m not saying I won’t fight anymore. I’m saying I want no more wars. I want the end of the siege.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;War in Gaza: Palestinians die. Israelis die. Only Hamas wins</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Israeli army announced Thursday it was significantly boosting its forces in the south, citing its policy to “thwart terrorism and prevent penetration into Israel along the Gaza border fence.”</p> \n<p>The decision was made after a situation assessment by Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot and senior IDF and Shin Bet security service officials.</p> \n<p>The army’s decision was made ahead of the expected demonstrations on Friday along the border, out of concern over a possible escalation. The army is also preparing for mortar and rocket fire from Gaza at Israeli communities near the border, which could lead to a wider escalation, and is therefore deploying the Iron Dome defense system. The IDF said it was “ready for different scenarios.”</p> \n<p>'War by other means'</p> \n<p>Asked why Hamas had invested millions in creating attack tunnels when half of Gaza’s citizens are facing hunger, Sinwar said he was glad Hamas had invested in tunnels, because “otherwise we would be all dead. At times the Israelis wouldn’t even let in milk,” he said, implying that Hamas uses the tunnels for goods and not only for military purposes.</p> \n<p>Pressed on whether he feels the weight of responsibility for the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, Sinwar said “the responsibility lies with those who have sealed the border and not with those who tried to open it.”</p> \n<p>Addressing the ongoing negotiations for a prolonged cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, reportedly being mediated by Egypt, he told the Italian journalist that the end of the siege was the crucial component in any future deal.</p> \n<p>“If a cease-fire means we stop being bombed but keep not having water, no electricity, nothing at all, and we are still under siege, then it makes no sense,” Sinwar said.</p> \n<p>“The siege is a form of war by other means. But if it ends, and Gaza little by little goes back to being normal, if we start getting investments and development – and not only humanitarian aid, because we are not beggars – we want to work, study, travel, like everyone else. … If that happens, the cease-fire can be extended, and extended again and again.</p> \n<p>“But there is no peace without justice and freedom. I don’t want the peace of [living in a] grave,” he said.</p> \n<p>Pressed on whether a cease-fire would mean no hostile acts at all, Sinwar emphasized that it meant “nothing from here, nothing from there.”</p> \n<p>Referring to the incendiary kites and balloons that Gazans have been sending into Israel in recent months, Sinwar said, “They cannot be considered a weapon – a fire extinguisher is enough to put them out. They are just a message, and the message is that you [the Israelis] are incomparably stronger, but you will never win. Never.”</p> \n<p>Asked what would happen if a cease-fire failed, he said, “It’s simple: If we are attacked, we will strike back. I think we all have the instruments to understand whether an incident is caused by extremists or not.” However, he added: “For once, can we ask the question, ‘What happens if it does work?’ It could give us the right motivation to make it work, don’t you think? If for a moment we stopped and imagined Gaza like it used to be – have you ever seen Gaza pictures from the 1950s? When in summer everyone was coming here on holiday?” Speaking of the cease-fire, Sinwar said the question is not whether Hamas can be trusted, but whether Israel can be trusted as it always initiated war. He added that building trust requires making the first step together.</p> \n<p>'Likud doesn’t recognize Palestine'</p> \n<p>At the end of the interview, Borri asked Sinwar why he does not use the world Israel. “Did you hear the word Palestine, on the other side? ... Netanyahu is from Likud, and Likud does not recognize Palestine. And what about [the late] Rabbi [Ovadia] Yosef … who wanted all of us to be dead?” he said of the former Sephardi chief rabbi and spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox party Shas.</p> \n<p>When asked about Hamas’ relationship with Fatah, Sinwar said problems between the two Palestinian factions are also a by-product of the siege. “I understand Fatah,” he said. “If they were to agree to a unity government with us, they wouldn’t get a dollar anymore, they’d risk going bankrupt.”</p> \n<p>To Sinwar, the political situation among the Palestinians is not dissimilar to the one in the years leading up to Israel’s “disengagement” from Gaza.</p> \n<p>“In 2005 they [the Israelis] left, but they simply restructured the occupation: Before, they occupied from inside; now they seal the border,” he said. “Do you think that governing Gaza is like governing Paris?” Sinwar asks. “Since many years we were governing in many municipalities because we are renowned for our efficiency and honesty. Then, in 2006, we won general elections, and the world isolated us.</p> \n<p>“There is no electricity, it’s true. And this has consequences on all the rest. But do you think we don’t have any engineers? That we cannot build a turbine? Of course we are capable of doing that – but how? What can you do with nothing in your hands? Even the best surgeon is helpless with instruments such as a knife and a fork to carry out the operation,” he said.</p> \n<p>Similarly, Sinwar dismissed the Oslo Accords as “just a way to distract the world while settlement expansion was compromising all prospects for a Palestinian state.”</p> \n<p>At one point, Sinwar argues that Gaza could become prosperous, and repeatedly praises the youth of Gaza for its steadfastness and energy.</p> \n<p>“Did you see how brilliant our youth are? Full of talent, despite everything. … They use old fax machines, old computers, a group of youths in their 20s has built a 3-D printer on their own to manufacture the medical equipment that’s missing. This is Gaza. It’s not just poverty. Not just kids with no shoes. Gaza can be like Singapore or Dubai. Let’s let time go by, let it heal the wounds.</p> \n<p>“Around 45 percent of the population here is less than 15 years old. They don’t even know what is Hamas, what is Zionism. At night they walk by the sea and wonder what the world is like beyond the waves. Looking at them breaks you – it would break anyone,” he said.</p> \n<p>‘Like a Bar Mitzvah’</p> \n<p>Sinwar spent over 20 years in Israeli prisons and says he had a better time there than “in the prison of Gaza,” as at least there he had “electricity, water and books.” He was released in the prisoner swap with Israel in 2011, when Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was returned in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners.</p> \n<p>With the bodies of fallen soldiers Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul still in Gaza, and Israeli civilians Abera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed still missing in the Strip, a possible prisoner exchange remains high on Sinwar’s agenda.</p> \n<p>“The issue of prisoners is crucial, it’s a moral issue to me. Your readers might think that prisoners are terrorists, but in here we all get arrested at some stage. It’s a step to becoming an adult, like the Bar Mitzvah,” he said.</p> \n<p>While a swap deal must be included in any future deal, Sinwar said he would not accept international forces in Gaza. “It would be like Srebrenica,” he said, referring to the UN-protected, Muslim-populated town in eastern Bosnia besieged by Serb forces throughout the war. The Serbs overran the enclave and massacred some 8,000 men and boys in July 1995.</p> \n<p>Criticizing the international community, Sinwar said Gaza only ever received attention when there is violence and blood – but the problem “is not the resistance but rather the occupation.</p> \n<p>“Did you see the video where the soldier shoots at us and keeps laughing?” he asked. “Once they [the Jewish people] used to be people like Freud, Einstein, Kafka. They were famous for their mathematics and philosophy – today only for the drones. What a shame.”</p> \n<p>Sinwar said that although he “learned a lot” from spending time in jail, he “wouldn’t wish that on anyone” – not even “to those who, from beyond the barbed wire, shoot at us as [if] we were bowling pins, and then they laugh: They don’t know one day they could end up for 25 years in The Hague,” he added.</p> \n<p>At one point in the interview, Sinwar explains to Borri how everyone in the room had been affected by the conflict.</p> \n<p>“I was in prison for 25 years. Basem [one of the advisers] lost a child in an Israeli army raid. Your translator lost two brothers. The man who served us tea: his wife died of an infection – it was just a small cut but there were no antibiotics. She died just like that. For something you can heal if you just have access to a pharmacy.</p> \n<p>“Do you think it’s easy for us?” he asked. “To forget everything, to suddenly start again? But let’s start with this cease-fire. Let’s give our children the life we never had. And they will become better than us. Now, emotions are still too strong. The memories, the traumas. The resentments. We all need to retrieve our clarity of thought here. Not just us. Everyone. And in 20 years, 30 years, maybe those living here will see the world in a totally different way.”</p> \n<p>Sinwar spoke to Borri over a five-day period, in which she followed him around caf&eacute;s, ministries and hospitals across the Gaza Strip. After a partial translation of the interview was published in Yedioth Ahronoth on Thursday, billed as an exclusive, Hamas issued a statement saying the Israeli daily misrepresented the text. It added that Sinwar had only spoken to Borri because she was not an Israeli and the interview had been intended only for la Republica and The Guardian. Hamas also said the Hebrew translation was not accurate and twisted Sinwar’s words.</p> \n<p>At the end of their interview, Sinwar explained to the journalist why he had granted her an interview, despite her previous reports revealing that Hamas had cracked down on Fatah activists in Gaza during the border protests.</p> \n<p>“Your article was very hard on us. And on top of that, your work is regularly translated in Hebrew. And yet you are here. Again, because you have a profound respect for us, and we have a profound respect for you. Sometimes, the messenger is also the message. You will leave now and you will tell all this. Will they read you? Will they listen to you? I don’t know. But I did [take] my step forward.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>An organization spearheaded by Rabbi Susan Silverman that, inspired by Anne Frank, called on Israelis to shelter African asylum seekers in their homes is in contention to win the Nobel Peace Prize.</p> \n<p>The prize will be announced in Oslo on Friday and the Miklat Israel group (known outside of Israel as the Anne Frank Home Sanctuary Movement) is one of 331 nominees: 115 are organizations and the other 216 are individuals, according to the Nobel website.</p> \n<p>Last winter, as the Israeli government prepared to deport thousands of Africans seeking asylum status in Israel, Miklat Israel launched an emergency effort to try to help the mainly Sudanese and Eritrean men who were threatened with forced deportation.</p> \n<p>The group’s call for civil disobedience, together with the protests of other civil society organizations in both Israel and the Jewish world, was credited with helping disrupt the planned deportations, which has still yet to be carried out.</p> \n<p>Miklat Israel’s nomination was submitted to the Nobel Prize committee by MK Ilan Gilon (Meretz) last January, ahead of the February 1 deadline.</p> \n<p>Gilon wrote in his nominating letter: “The movement has been a beacon of light against the actions of the Israeli government, which go against our collective history and current obligations to the 1951 International Convention on Refugees. … What is standing between the deportation order is neither law nor leadership but the civil disobedience of Israeli citizens who have been inspired by the Righteous Among the Nations who hid Jews during the Holocaust.”</p> \n<p>Miklat Israel said it signed up over 1,500 households, in addition to dozens of kibbutzim, who all volunteered to take in and protect the asylum seekers. (“Miklat” means refuge or sanctuary in Hebrew.)</p> \n<p>The group also trained hundreds of volunteer families on how to proceed if a deportation order was carried out by the state.</p> \n<p>The movement was founded by Silverman and overseen by two other rabbis who, like her, are longtime human rights activists: Nava Hefetz and Tamara Schagas.</p> \n<p>Silverman, who immigrated to Israel from Boston over a decade ago and is the older sister of U.S. comedian Sarah Silverman, said her idea was inspired by U.S. sanctuary states and cities. These have been used as tools to fight the deportation of immigrants who entered the United States without authorization.</p> \n<p>The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize is set to be announced at 12 P.M. Israel time (5 A.M. EST) on Friday, and Miklat Israel admits its chances of winning are slim. According to Time Magazine, the favorites are Korean presidents Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in; U.S. President Donald Trump; the ACLU; Pope Francis; the UN High Commissioner for Refugees; Saudi blogger Raif Badawi; and exiled Catalan politician Carlos Puigdemont.</p> \n<p>But Miklat Israel hopes its Nobel nomination can again serve to apply pressure to the Israeli government.</p> \n<p>“With the Israeli prime minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] and Rwandan President [Paul] Kagame’s UN meeting last week, the nomination serves a new purpose as a warning signal to any African head of state considering cooperating with any new deportation plans: The eyes of the world and the world Jewish community are watching very closely and will spring back into action as needed to oppose illegal, forced and immoral deportations,” the Miklat Israel organizers wrote in a statement to Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Israel is still yet to rescind its plan – which was supposed to begin last April – to deport some 40,000 African asylum seekers over the course of two years to either their homelands or another sub-Saharan country.</p> \n<p>Documents seen by Haaretz confirmed that the Miklat Israel leadership was instrumental in halting the government’s plan to deport some of the asylum seekers to Uganda. It also played a key role in drafting a UN deal that would have seen about half of the asylum seekers being taken in by other Western countries and the other half remaining in Israel, according to other documents seen by Haaretz.</p> \n<p>In a head-spinning turn of events last April, Netanyahu first announced that Israel had signed the UN deal, but just a few hours later, under pressure from other right-wing politicians, he flip-flopped and suspended the agreement.</p> \n<p>Miklat Israel referred to these, and other back-channel, efforts in its statement to Haaretz.</p> \n<p>“The movement leveraged its excellent relations with American-Jewish leaders and the global media to add additional muscle and played the determining role in having Uganda and Rwanda back out of their deals with Israel to accept the asylum seekers, cutting off the deportations,” it said.</p> \n<p>“When the movement launched at the Shalom Hartman Institute and the Knesset in early January, it set out the goal of having Israel and the UNHCR sign a deal on the refugees by Passover, whose first draft was written by movement leaders and played an instrumental role in bringing the parties together in that short-lived deal.”</p> \n<p>The forced deportations triggered public protests (and counterprotests) in Israel and much criticism of the Israeli government on social media. For some, the idea that a country founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust – by a people that experienced centuries of displacement and exile – might kick out those for whom deportation could put their lives at risk, was itself a call for action.</p> \n<p>As well as Miklat Israel and other civil society organizations working to halt the deportations, there were protests by El Al pilots, who refused to fly planes that might carry forced deportees; street demonstrations, and protest letters by academics, lawyers and others. Among those who volunteered to host asylum seekers were actual Holocaust survivors.</p> \n<p>In concluding his letter to the Nobel Peace Prize committee, Gilon wrote: “The world is witnessing a surge in intolerance for refugees at the very moment when there are more refugees than at any time in history. Instead of giving in to a rising tide of global xenophobia, the families and communities in the Anne Frank Home Sanctuary movement [Miklat Israel] are offering a hopeful counter-example that appeals to basic and decent human rights and sensibilities.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Just when it seemed that President Donald Trump had ensured that American politics couldn’t get any nastier or more divisive, along came Brett Kavanaugh. The debate about the newest U.S. Supreme Court justice didn’t just illustrate how American politics has become a species of warfare with no middle ground left between the parties and ideological factions.</p> \n<p>The intersection of important concerns about sexual violence with the implacable rigidity of contemporary partisanship and the no-holds-barred style of discourse - of which Trump is both a symptom and an ever-present force for making things worse - has damaged every individual and institution involved in the controversy.</p> \n<p>Both sides have contributed to this dismal situation, but both are so committed to their ideological and political ends that neither is willing to acknowledge their roles in this moral catastrophe, or the costs of a politics of personal destruction, let alone to give their opponents credit for having decent motives.</p> \n<p>That’s why any hint of interjecting the question of anti-Semitism into this already toxic mix should be viewed with alarm. Yet that is what happened when President Donald Trump and Republicans like Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Grassley said they blamed billionaire George Soros for funding some of the groups and individuals who flooded Capitol Hill, to not only urge Senators to reject Kavanaugh but to harass those who disagreed.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Attacking Soros: Israel’s Unholy Covenant With Europe’s anti-Semitic Ultra-right&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&gt;Charlottesville Mayor: Trump Made 'Devil's Bargain' With anti-Semites&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The mention of Soros had some on the left not merely crying foul about blaming a left-wing sugar daddy for the surge of activism. They also claimed that any mention of Soros is a dog whistle for anti-Semites.</p> \n<p>The comments by Trump and Grassley were linked to the attacks on Soros by the Hungarian government, whose authoritarian leader Viktor Orban has employed traditional anti-Semitic slurs while seeking to use the billionaire investor as a scapegoat in a campaign against his domestic foes.</p> \n<p>Put in that context, criticism of Soros or even a mention of him is interpreted as a signal that dark forces are seeking to use the toolbox of Jew hatred.</p> \n<p>If that wasn’t enough to fuel this fire, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s retweeting of a comment in which Soros was spoken of as &quot;the anti-Christ&quot; and others on the right calling for Trump to freeze or seize his assets &quot;as an enemy of the United States,&quot; for &quot;seditious conspiracy against the United States.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But while Trump’s critics are quick to connect the dots between the fight over Kavanaugh, and Orban’s depiction of Soros as a rich Jew threatening Hungary’s peace and prosperity, they need to understand that criticism of him means something very different in the context of American politics.</p> \n<p>While some have embraced Orban because of his hostility to Muslims or his embrace of Israel, autocrats like those in Hungary have always hated Soros because his Open Society Foundation has promoted democracy and free speech. Soros’s philanthropic efforts in Eastern Europe and the Third World have been on behalf of projects that shouldn’t be controversial in a Western context.</p> \n<p>But right-wingers tend to see Soros solely through the prism of his backing for left-of-center causes in both the U.S. and Israel.</p> \n<p>In the United States, Soros isn’t the boogeyman of Hungarian politics or a supporter of the Palestinians. Here, he’s just one more billionaire funding Democrats like Tom Steyer, who has been the very public leader of the movement to impeach Trump, or Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who is a fervent supporter of gun control and has pledged $80 million to help the Democrats win the 2018 midterm elections.</p> \n<p>While some extremists - on both the right and the left - may see only Jews when names like Steyer, Bloomberg or Soros - are raised, a largely philo-Semitic and overwhelmingly pro-Israel American right just sees rich liberals. If Republicans bash Soros, it isn’t because he’s Jewish. It’s because he has been spending freely to defeat them for the last two decades.</p> \n<p>While their criticism of Soros has sometimes been inappropriate (such as those who recycled charges&nbsp;about his behavior during the Holocaust when he was a boy in Hungary), their attacks on him are no different from the way Democrats have gone all out to demonize the billionaire Koch Brothers - non-Jewish libertarians who spent freely on behalf of Republicans.</p> \n<p>Just as some extremists associate Soros with a nefarious global Jewish conspiracy, the left-wing screeds against the Kochs that claim they are carrying out an equally awful plot of the wealthy to defraud American democracy plays upon the same themes - minus the Jewish angle.</p> \n<p>Trump and Grassley might be wrong about Soros’ funding of all the anti-Kavanaugh protesters. But they’re not wrong that he is someone who seeks to use his considerable resources to defeat them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It may be hypocritical for American conservatives - who view spending on political causes as constitutionally protected free speech - to think there’s something sinister about Soros’ efforts. But their animus for him is no more illegitimate than the way the left attacks GOP donors.</p> \n<p>Nor is such criticism - in an American context - anti-Semitic. Talk of global conspiracies may resonate in Hungary, but Soros-bashing means something different in the U.S.</p> \n<p>As even the Washington Post’s Richard Cohen admitted in a column in which he claimed attacks on Soros are troubling (the president invokes racist tropes out of ignorance, an &quot;anti-Semitism without Jews&quot;), Trump is no anti-Semite. Nor are Grassley or Giuliani.</p> \n<p>As is the case with the left’s attacks on conservative donors, painting Soros as a puppeteer rather than just another political big giver is a way to delegitimize the causes and candidates he supports rather than to address the issues he cares about. But tarring his critics with anti-Semitism is also neither accurate nor fair.</p> \n<p>In other times and places, criticism of wealthy Jewish individuals was part of an anti-Semitic narrative. But in 21st century America, Soros is just as much fair game for criticism as anyone else who seeks to use their money to get their way in politics.</p> \n<p>Jonathan S.

They don't like the president, and they weren’t about to vote for anyone, like Brat, who supports him.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Attacking Soros: Israel’s Unholy Covenant With Europe’s anti-Semitic Ultra-right&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&gt;Charlottesville Mayor: Trump Made 'Devil's Bargain' With anti-Semites&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“More than the policy, it’s the animosity he is fostering within the country,” Sneed said of Trump.</p> \n<p>Voters such as Sneed and Lesser are a significant reason why Democrats now believe that in the Nov. 6 congressional midterm elections, the party can win more than the 23 seats they need to seize control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Some predict Democrats could take as many as 40 seats by flipping districts like Brat's in Virginia.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, Brat's seat was considered safe. But if a so-called “blue&nbsp;wave” materializes, it would roll through a district like his, which includes pockets of suburban voters who increasingly have been turning away from Republicans.</p> \n<p>“Republicans are playing defense in more and more places,” said Doug Heye, a former official at the Republican National Committee. “The Democrats’ map continues to get bigger. The Republicans’ map continues to get smaller. That’s a real problem.”</p> \n<p>Democrats have poured resources not only into Brat’s district, but others that have come onto their battleground list, in places such as Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Southern California and other parts of Virginia such as the district currently represented by Republican Scott Taylor.</p> \n<p>They have been backed in the effort in Virginia by deep-pocketed advocacy groups such as House Majority PAC, which started running anti-Brat television ads last month, and NextGen, funded by California billionaire Tom Steyer, which decided this summer to launch efforts to turn out young voters in the district.</p> \n<p>In response, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican political-action committee, is running ads attacking Spanberger, a sign that the party is genuinely worried about losing the seat.</p> \n<p>&quot;IN MY GRILLE&quot;</p> \n<p>Brat is a high-value Democratic target for several reasons.</p> \n<p>In 2014, he shocked the political order by beating then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary. Since taking office, he has aligned himself with the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, which has become a reliable ally of the Trump White House.</p> \n<p>Last year, as protesters crashed his events in the midst of a House push to repeal former President Barack Obama's healthcare program, Brat remarked that “women are in my grille no matter where I go.”</p> \n<p>Those words have followed him ever since.</p> \n<p>In September, Brat held his first town hall in a year and did so with supportive audience of older veterans.</p> \n<p>Sarah Montgomery, a librarian for the U.S. Department of Defense who attended Spanberger’s event in Spotsylvania, said that after Brat’s district was re-drawn in 2016 to include her home, she researched him, and the video of his “grille” remark was the first thing she found.</p> \n<p>“He obviously has no respect for women,” she said.</p> \n<p>The firestorm over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault while in high school, came at a perilous moment for Brat, given his already difficult reputation with some women voters.</p> \n<p>Trump has played a part. Both Sneed and Lesser were angry that he chose to attack Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, at a rally last week.</p> \n<p>“It was disgusting,” Lesser said.</p> \n<p>Kavanaugh was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Saturday. Democratic activists hope discontent with his nomination will linger through November.</p> \n<p>Republicans, however, see the Kavanaugh fracas as galvanizing conservatives who have been looking for a reason to come out and vote in November's elections.</p> \n<p>“It has mobilized and energized Republican voters in a way that only a Supreme Court nomination can,” said Matt Gorman, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the arm of the party that supports House candidates like Brat.</p> \n<p>Brat has been a solid supporter of Kavanaugh, even though the House served no role in his nomination, and reasserted that support last week in a Facebook post.</p> \n<p>His campaign rejected the notion that he is not supportive of women, pointing to his efforts to combat human trafficking and the opioid epidemic and the passage of tax reform last year.</p> \n<p>“Congressman Brat has worked hard on issues affecting women since day one,” said a spokesperson, Katey Price.</p> \n<p>A MODERATE TONE</p> \n<p>A 39-year-old former officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, Spanberger looks like she could be the face of the Resistance, the woman-driven protest movement against Trump.</p> \n<p>But she has been careful to not alienate the independent and moderate voters she needs to win the district. At the Spotsylvania event, she didn’t mention Trump, Brat or Kavanaugh, focusing on domestic-policy issues such as healthcare and education.</p> \n<p>Asked for her position on Kavanaugh’s nomination, her campaign declined to comment.</p> \n<p>Instead, Spanberger touched on the thing that attracted voters such as Meg Sneed to her: turning down the volume in the civic discourse.</p> \n<p>“We’ve reached a place where we need to restore a level of civility to our conversations,” she told the crowd.</p> \n<p>Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia, said it remains Brat’s race to win, and that Kavanaugh may be the issue that pulls him over the finish line.</p> \n<p>“It’s still a southern district,” Davis said. “There’s nothing like a good fight to keep your base in line.”</p>",

Before carrying out the deadly shooting, Neloah gave a coworker a note in which he said he planned to commit suicide and praised late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.</p> \n<p>The two victims were identified as Kim Yehezkel-Levengrond, a married 29-year old with a young son who worked in the recycling plant's financial department, and Ziv Hajbi, a 35-year-old married father of three who worked as an accountant at the plant.

        "text":["<p>Has the formula been found for the lie that absolves Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of responsibility for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?</p> \n<p>Is the kingdom’s latest version, according to which the Saudi journalist died in a fistfight with a number of Saudis who were arrested last week, enough to salvage Donald Trump’s precious $110 billion arms deal? The U.S. president rushed to declare the Saudi explanation “credible.” It’s possible that someone who dispenses lies on a daily basis knows the difference between credible and incredible lies. But anyone who chooses to believe the Saudi version must ask a few nagging questions.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Khashoggi and the myth of the 'liberal' Middle East crown princes&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Will the Khashoggi 'murder' bring down Saudi’s crown prince?&nbsp;| Explained&nbsp;■&nbsp;Why the Khashoggi murder is a disaster for Israel&nbsp;|&nbsp;Opinion</p> \n<p>The first pertains to the location of Khashoggi’s body, whole or otherwise. If he died in a brawl, why was it necessary to dismember corpse? What were 15 Saudi security officers doing at the consulate? Why did the crown prince lie when he said he didn’t know about Khashoggi’s murder, and why did the Saudis say the journalist left the consulate shortly after arriving, which is why he could not be found? But even if these contradictions can be papered over with a credible cover story, the dismissal of senior Saudi intelligence official Gen. Ahmed al-Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani, both of them close advisers to Crown Prince Mohammed, has pulled the rug out from under the official version. If the two knew about the murder, or perhaps even ordered it, this cannot have been without the knowledge of Saudi General Intelligence Khalid al-Humaidan. And if Humaidan, whose head hasn’t rolled yet, knew about it, so did the crown prince.</p> \n<p>One should treat with suspicion these dismissals, as well as King Salman’s establishment of a commission of inquiry, under Crown Prince Mohammed, that has also been tasked with reorganizing the kingdom’s intelligence services. Asiri and Qahtani, who were appointed by the crown prince, will most likely win new appointments: They know too much about the crown prince and his military and economic failures.</p> \n<p>Asiri was previously a spokesman for the Saudi forces operating in Yemen, heading PR efforts to justify the war as benefiting international interests and to absolve Saudi Arabia from responsibility for the deaths of thousands of civilians in Yemen. Qahtani, meanwhile, directed the Saudi media from behind the scenes, operating social networks while shaping a positive image for the crown prince in Arab and international media. Prosecuting the two or otherwise damaging their standing could lead to political infighting and conflicts between Saudi military leaders and the House of Saud, if Crown Prince Mohammed is viewed as throwing his top aides under the bus.</p> \n<p>But the most serious threat to the Saudi story and an American seal of approval is in Turkish intelligence headquarters in Ankara. Turkish listening devices and sensitive cameras have already yielded most of the horrific details of Khashoggi’s murder. Turkey claims the Saudis are cooperating with Turkish investigators, who are sharing their findings with their U.S. counterparts, American intelligence agencies, but no one knows what is being held back from publication. Turkey, which changed from a Saudi rival to its enemy in the wake of the incident, is the main target of criticism of Saudi Arabia and its allies.</p> \n<p>Ankara isn’t accepting Saudi explanations regarding Khashoggi’s death. A spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development Party, Omer Celik, said Saturday that Turkey will get to the bottom of Khashoggi’s disappearance and death. His remark suggests that Turkey, to the extent that it has the evidence to back up its claims, will determine the nature of future relations between Riyadh and Washington. If it has a recording of the murderers calling Crown Prince Mohammed to announce “mission accomplished,” or a record of the crown prince calling them during their stay in Turkey, Trump will have to re-examine, if not disavow, his support for the new Saudi version of events.</p> \n<p>The question is whether and how Turkey might want to leverage the Khashoggi affair, which is evolving from a mafia-style hit by Saudi intelligence operatives into an international incident obligating Western countries to maneuver carefully vis-a-vis Riyadh, caught between pressure to guarantee a transparent investigation of the murder and the need to preserve their political and economic interests. Theoretically, Turkey could demand political “hush money” such as the lifting of the Saudi embargo on Qatar in exchange for freezing the investigation or accepting the Saudi version. This is a high price, which the crown prince is unlikely to pay, but if the demand comes with American pressure and mediation, it could serve the interests of all sides.</p> \n<p>Khashoggi’s murder poses a dilemma for Saudi Arabia’s allies. For now, only Trump is willing to pull Riyadh’s chestnuts out of the fire. His decision will clearly greatly affect the future of the investigation as well as international responses toward Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, no leader, including Turkey’s president, has called for sanctions like the ones imposed on Russia for assassinating former agents and dissident journalists. Perhaps that’s because Western states still regard the killing of a journalist by an Arab government as infuriating but not inconceivable, particularly since this was done in another Muslim state, which treats its own journalists as criminals. Russia, on the other hand, is perceived as part of the “civilized” world, committing its assassinations in the heart of Europe. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is seen as pro-Western by virtue of its membership in the alliance against Iran. As a result, even if it is far removed from embracing Western values, it enjoys certain “discounts” that the anti-Western resistance front members Russia and China do not.</p>",

Their goal appears to be to counter a portrait of Khashoggi as a Saudi reformer and free speech activist, and perhaps derail pressure building on the White House to punish Saudi Arabia for his disappearance and presumed murder.</p> \n<p>Latest:&nbsp;Truth or Trap? Saudi Explanation for Khashoggi's Murder Puts Trump to the Test&nbsp;|&nbsp;Why the Khashoggi Murder Is a Disaster for Israel&nbsp;|&nbsp;Trump Changes Tune on Saudi Arabia, Accuses Key Ally of 'Lies'</p> \n<p>Notably, the mainstream pro-Israel groups, like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, were not joining in the attacks, and Israeli officials were silent as well.</p> \n<p>Purveyors of the attacks on Khashoggi said they wanted to set the record straight. Other observers suggested that the public fight over Khashoggi’s reputation has to do with a number of issues central to the latest crisis in U.S.-Saudi relations: cultivating Saudi cooperation in the diplomatic fight against Iran, keeping the Saudis on board the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and maintaining the kingdom as a bulwark against violent forms of radical Islam.</p> \n<p>Who’s saying what&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>The hits on Khashoggi, deriding him as a radical Islamist and an anti-Semite, have emerged alongside gruesome reports by official Turkish sources about his disappearance: According to the Turkish reports, the U.S.-based columnist entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul for some paperwork ahead of his planned wedding to a Turkish national, and a team of 15 Saudi agents was waiting to torture and kill him.</p> \n<p>As&nbsp;reported&nbsp;Friday in The Washington Post, the anti-Khashoggi narrative is emerging among hard-line conservatives and is being circulated in Republican congressional offices.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump Jr. retweeted one of the earliest attacks on Khashoggi, from a correspondent for the PJ Media conservative website. The correspondent, Patrick Poole, had posted photos of interviews Khashoggi had conducted in the late 1980s with Osama bin Laden, who went on to found al-Qaeda and to plot the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t realize until yesterday that Jamal Khashoggi was the author of this notorious 1988 Arab News article of him tooling around Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda co-founder Abdullah Azzam,” Poole&nbsp;tweeted&nbsp;on Oct. 12, 10 days after Khashoggi’s disappearance. “He’s just a democrat reformer journalist holding a RPG with jihadists.” A photo showed Khashoggi posing with a rocket-propelled grenade.</p> \n<p>The interview was at a time when the Reagan administration was backing insurgents in Afghanistan. Khashoggi was indeed sympathetic to bin Laden (the Khashoggi and bin Laden families were close). When bin Laden launched terrorism operations against the West, however, Khashoggi disavowed him.</p> \n<p>Other joined the fray. FrontPage mag, helmed by right-wing provocateur David Horowitz, ran an article the same day declaring, “Jamal Khashoggi blamed 9/11 on U.S. support for Israel.” The article cites a piece Khashoggi wrote in 2001 after the attacks, published in Arab News and the Guardian, in which Khashoggi sympathetically describes Saudi reactions to the attacks but does not outright endorse them.</p> \n<p>Khashoggi’s piece falls short of blaming U.S. support for Israel for the attacks, although he says that Saudis saw the Sept. 11 attacks as of a piece with Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians — a posture that would offend Israelis and many Americans. When Khashoggi does express his opinion, it is to condemn bin Laden for targeting civilians.</p> \n<p>On Oct. 17,&nbsp;the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s European office sent out a release titled “Wiesenthal Centre Exposes Jamal Khashoggi Antisemitic Tweets.”</p> \n<p>“The Wiesenthal Centre expresses its horror and revulsion at the presumed gruesome murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,” the release said. “In a search, however, of his official Twitter account, Simon Wiesenthal Centre Director for International Relations, Dr. Shimon Samuels, discovered the following tweets of 16 October 2015.” Samuels is a respected analyst who monitors extremism on the left and the right. “If you have a tweet and it is of interest and in the public domain, it shouldn’t be hidden,” Samuels told JTA.</p> \n<p>In the tweets, Khashoggi denies any Jewish connection to the land of Israel, and says the Western Wall was a Muslim construction — a false narrative that infuriates Israelis, and is commonplace in the region, particularly among Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Wiesenthal Center’s Los Angeles-based associate dean, told JTA that Samuels’ post was premature. “It could be that Shimon in Europe is not as sensitive” to the repercussions of Khashoggi’s reported murder, he said. “There’s a lot of appropriate anger” at the Saudis. At a later date, the center might publish a fuller and nuanced account of Khashoggi’s life and influence, Cooper said.</p> \n<p>Josh Block, the CEO of The Israel Project has posted multiple tweets implicating Khashoggi in an array of terrorist activities. On Oct. 18, Block quoted a New Yorker article describing Khashoggi as a journalist,&nbsp;and commented,&nbsp;“Uh, U mean frontman for Islamists &amp; paid spook for Qatar, Turkey &amp; Turki al Faisal, whose ‘journalism’ was a cover for his real work, just as he wrapped his Islamist ideas in flowery language of ‘human rights’ as he praised Hamas &amp; called for Israel to be destroyed by violence.”&nbsp;Block declined to comment and his sources are not clear. Following publication of this article, he tweeted: “Noting his anti-Semitic views &amp; close ties 2 radical Islamists (w/whom he spent his final week in London) &amp; his ties to the financiers of Hamas [Al Qaeda] ISIS etc, is about preventing whitewash of history.”</p> \n<p>What is motivating the attacks on Khashoggi? Some possibilities:</p> \n<p>The Muslim Brotherhood connection</p> \n<p>Some accounts in mainstream media have suggested that Khashoggi was a more complex figure than the reformer that his friends and allies have depicted.</p> \n<p>“Several Muslim Brothers said this week that they always felt he was with them,” The New York Times&nbsp;reported, referring to the multinational Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood. “Many of his secular friends would not have believed it.”</p> \n<p>If Khashoggi was a member of the pre-eminent Islamist organization in the Middle East, his critics charge,&nbsp;whitewashing that affiliation is a disservice to history, and helps elevate a group that should be marginalized.</p> \n<p>“#Khashoggi did not deserve his fate,”&nbsp;tweeted&nbsp;David Reaboi, an analyst with a conservative think tank, Security Studies Group. “That said, the misrepresentation of his Islamist views as championing ‘freedom’ and ‘democracy’ is a repulsive whitewash.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Jamal Khashoggi Was a Victim of Saudi Terror. He Was Also a Keen Supporter of Palestinian Terrorism</p> \n<p>“[U]nless you are rooting for an Islamist Middle East, it seems doubtful that Khashoggi’s vision for the region was a big improvement over the agenda of the autocratic Saudis,” wrote&nbsp;Petra Marquardt-Bigman, a journalist, in&nbsp;an op-ed in Haaretz&nbsp;outlining Khashoggi’s sympathetic views on Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> \n<p>Tamara Cofman Wittes, a senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brooking Institution, knew Khashoggi for a decade. She warned against a simplistic take both on Khashoggi’s views and on the Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood, she pointed out, is a presence in parliaments of U.S. allies in the region, like Jordan, and in the governments of allies&nbsp;like Morocco.</p> \n<p>“The Muslim Brotherhood is in the mainstream,” Wittes said, and noted that Saudi hostility to the group was recent. For decades, Saudis welcomed and promoted the group.</p> \n<p>“There was nothing out of the mainstream, nothing oppositional about being sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood in Saudi Arabia until a few years ago,” she said.</p> \n<p>The “we need Saudi Arabia” argument</p> \n<p>White House adviser Jared Kushner sees the Saudis, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in particular, as key to advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace proposal he hopes to unveil soon.</p> \n<p>Right-wing pro-Israel figures have embraced Trump because he has embraced their outlook, moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and pulling out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and now they may be returning the favor, said Michael Koplow, the policy director for the Israel Policy Forum, a group that backs the two-state solution.</p> \n<p>Kushner has not revealed details of the plan, but right-wingers are hopeful that it rolls back many of the pro-Palestinian orthodoxies of past plans, including statehood as an outcome and a presence in Jerusalem’s Old City.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is counting on Saudi Arabia</p> \n<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has touted emerging ties with Saudi Arabia and other countries as validating his strategy of downplaying peace with the Palestinians, believing he can make Israel at home in the region without the Palestinians. Bin Salman was a key figure in this strategy.</p> \n<p>“Much of the Israeli argument for the lack of Israel’s isolation hinges on the fact that Saudis are behind the scenes friendly in ways we couldn’t imagine before,” Koplow said.</p> \n<p>Wittes was skeptical that Israeli officials have encouraged the efforts to puncture Khashoggi’s reputation. Instead, she said, the attacks seemed to be a result of the polarization on the American political scene, in which allies on the left or the right attack the other side in a way that does not necessarily serve their particular interests.</p> \n<p>“What we’ve witnessed in American politics is this intense polarization, and when a stance is taken” by your side, “you tend to echo that without reflection on your interests,” she said.</p> \n<p>Don’t forget about Iran</p> \n<p>Israel and the Trump administration see Saudi Arabia as key to containing the influence of Iran in the region. Some of the pundits highlighting Khashoggi’s Muslim Brotherhood past suspect that&nbsp; supporters of the Iran deal are behind an effort to smear the Saudis. Isolating the Saudis, they fear, would undercut support for the Trump administration’s hard line on Iran, and his rejection of the sanctions-relief-for-nuclear-rollback deal negotiated by Trump’s hated predecessor, President Barack Obama.</p> \n<p>Khashoggi “made a tactical alliance with former Obama officials who seek to depict Trump’s pro-Saudi and anti-Iranian policy as a disaster,” Mike Doran of the conservative Hudson Institute and Tony Badran of the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies,&nbsp;write&nbsp;this week in the New York Post. “Trump, in this view, is the enabler of a young, impetuous crown prince. Conflicts such as Yemen result from Saudi recklessness rather than Iranian expansionism.” Bin Salman has directed a bombing campaign against Iranian-backed forces in Yemen.</p> \n<p>Daniel Shapiro, Obama’s ambassador to Israel, rejects the argument that confronting Iran is more important than dealing with Khashoggi’s murder.</p> \n<p>“It has a whiff of trying to say this murder wasn’t as bad as it is because of the investment made in Saudia Arabia under [bin Salman] as a strategic anchor under the anti-Iran coalition,” Shapiro, a visiting fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Israel, said in an interview.</p> \n<p>Groups that want Iran isolated, and quickly, are frustrated by the Khashoggi distraction, Shapiro said.</p> \n<p>“If indeed the United States cannot conduct business as usual while this is unresolved, it puts at risk that whole kind of strategic concept Israel has counted on and strong opponents of Iran have counted on,” he said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In recent weeks Russia has been taking a more forceful stance toward Israel concerning Israel Air Force activity in the north.</p> \n<p>The Russians are demanding further clarifications from the Israel Defense Forces via the “hotline” that is meant to prevent any aerial clashes between the two parties, and there have been several instances in which Russian air defense radars in Syria were activated in connection with Israel's air force activity in the north.</p> \n<p>Russia’s behavior is being interpreted in Israel as a response to the incident in which a Syrian anti-aircraft missile downed an Ilyushin Russian intelligence-gathering plane on September 17 at the end of an Israeli airstrike near Latakia in northwestern Syria.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said last week that Israel will continue to operate in Syria for the purpose of thwarting Hezbollah’s military buildup.</p> \n<p>At the end of last week, the Russian newspaper Izvestia reported that three air defense systems supplied to Syria by Russia in late Septemeber, following the September 17 incident, were of the most advanced model of the S-300 missiles with the highest radar and target-identification capabilities.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Putin now has leverage over Israel, and no reason to give it up&nbsp;■ Opinion:&nbsp;The real issue behind the downing of the Russian plane&nbsp;■ Analysis:&nbsp;Israel faces a much bigger challenge in Syria than S-300s</p> \n<p>The newspaper also reported that the missile batteries will initially be operated by Russian experts. The Israeli security establishment believes that, if necessary, Israel's air force could still manage to strike targets in Syria despite the new missile batteries.</p> \n<p>The process of training Syrian soldiers to operate the missile batteries is expected take some time and the batteries themselves are not yet fully operative.</p> \n<p>However, Russia's main move is on the public and diplomatic front: Moscow is signaling to Israel that it intends to limit Israel’s freedom to maneuver in the Syrian skies.</p> \n<p>The presence of Russian troops with the missile batteries will also make it harder for Israel to strike those batteries if missiles are fired from them at its air force jets.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu said two weeks ago that he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and that they had agreed to meet soon. No date for such a meeting has been announced yet.</p> \n<p>In the contacts that occurred in the days following the incident, the Russians were not enthusiastic about holding a high-level meeting and felt that the visit to Moscow by an Israeli military delegation headed by Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin, commander of the air force, was sufficient.</p> \n<p>Norkin shared with his Russian counterparts the detailed findings of the air force investigation of the incident, which placed full responsibility for the downing of the plane on the Syrian Army.</p> \n<p>But Russia rejected these findings and issued its own account that accused the Israel Air Force of dangerous conduct and relied upon a completely different timetable of the events. Israeli officials believed the Russians had falsified the radar images they published of the event in order to pin the blame on the Israeli air force jets.</p> \n<p>Russia's moves do not spell the end of Israeli airstrikes in Syria. But now, more than a month after the incident, it is clear that something has fundamentally changed and that Israel will have to take a new diplomatic and military approach in order to preserve at least some of its freedom of operation.</p> \n<p>Thus it is worth re-examining the policies of the last few years. The string of successes by the intelligence community and the air force led to a feeling in the government that Israel could do practically whatever it pleases in Syria.</p> \n<p>Perhaps before the downing of the Russian plane occurred, Israel did not fully grasp the attitude shift in Moscow and Damascus that came with the Assad regime’s major gains in southern Syria.</p> \n<p>After the offensive in Latakia during which the Ilyushin plane was shot down, the IDF said that the target struck included machinery for manufacturing equipment that would improve the precision of Hezbollah rockets. According to Israel, Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah militants were about to smuggle this equipment from Syria to Lebanon.</p> \n<p>The question, in retrospect, is whether this was indeed a target that justified an Israeli strike in the heart of the Russian area of influence and interest, close to Hmeimim air base and the Tartus port, both held by Russia. It wouldn’t be the first time that an impressive show of Israel’s tactical and intelligence capabilities causes an entanglement on the strategic level.</p> \n<p>Iran increases arms smuggling to Lebanon at Syria's expense</p> \n<p>Last week, Fox News reported, quoting Western intelligence sources that Iran has recently increased the frequency of its arms shipments to Hezbollah using civilian flights to Beirut.</p> \n<p>According to the report, components for installing GPS navigation systems on Hezbollah’s rockets to turn them into precision-guided weapons were transferred on Boeing 747s, some of which made stopovers at the Damascus airport.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah apparently still lacks the full technological capability needed to quickly and effectively install these components on its rockets in Lebanon in a way that would rapidly improve their precision.</p> \n<p>In his speech before the UN General Assembly last month, Netanyahu warned about Iran and Hezbollah’s effort to build production lines for installing the components at several sites in Beirut, including an underground compound beneath a soccer stadium and one adjacent to the airport. It’s quite possible that Israel will soon take further public measures to expose Hezbollah’s plans.</p> \n<p>In response to Netanyahu’s UN speech, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech at a rally that he’d had enough of the Israeli reports and that from now on, he would not comment publicly on accusations about Hezbollah’s moves.</p> \n<p>The Iranian focus on smuggling efforts directly to Lebanon is occurring in tandem with a certain decline over the past month in smuggling via Syria territory. Israel isn’t ruling out the possibility that the change is due to a Russian directive in wake of the incident in which the Russian plane was shot down. This development could reflect an attempt by Moscow to set new rules of the game in Syria and to reduce the friction between Israel and Iran there as part of the effort to stabilize Assad’s rule.</p>",

        "text":["<p>I was delighted to see the sign stating what ought to be self-evident. “What makes man unique?” it asked, in bright yellow letters. “More than 98% of modern man’s genetic material is identical to a chimpanzee’s genetic material. Man’s development and differentiation from his relatives, the apes, is rooted in three principal physiological characteristics: erect posture and walking on two legs, release of the arms and development of the brain.”</p> \n<p>”Thank you,” I whispered. Thank you for saving us from terrible embarrassment. A display of this clear, unquestionable scientific truth cannot be taken for granted in the Israel of 2018.</p> \n<p>The sign is displayed as part of a new exhibit titled “What makes us human?” in the new natural history museum at Tel Aviv University, which shows the origin and development of the human species.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Religion, science clash as archaeologists restore ancient Jewish catacomb in Rome</p> \n<p>Granted, questions remain about the curation of the exhibit and some of the choices it made, but it’s important to state this clearly and joyfully: Several months belatedly, the museum’s directors have chosen a side in the debate between science and religion. This is giant leap forward.</p> \n<p>With the opening of “What makes us human?” the museum’s curators significantly changed the impression visitors receive. Science has triumphed over fairy tales. The curators have salvaged their own honor and that of their institution.</p> \n<p>The Steinhardt Museum of Natural History, an important and interesting institution, opened in Ramat Aviv, earlyJuly 2018. I visited it a few days after its doors opened. The review I published in Haaretz reflected my great disappointment.</p> \n<p>What mainly bothered me was that the museum completely ignored the theory of evolution. The question of how man was created, of how we reached our present form, in which we roam the world on two legs with a large brain, received no answer or even mention in the exhibit I saw in early summer.</p> \n<p>My feeling during that visit was that the museum’s founders had sought to please everyone, and to this end, made a great effort to obscure both the earth’s age and the number of years man has been on it. I was stunned to discover that the museum’s founders hadn’t taken sides in the battle between creationists – who, in line with their religious faith, claim that the world was created in seven days 5,779 years ago – and people who recognize the clear scientific facts that the world was created hundreds of millions of years ago through a lengthy, complex process.</p> \n<p>This problem – it’s tempting to say “Thank God” – has now been solved with the opening of the new exhibit. Breathe a sigh of relief. This isn’t another theory, but the facts. This is a case where it’s impossible to please everyone, even if someone gets angry.</p> \n<p>At the entrance to the “What makes us human?” exhibit there’s a large sign with clear numbers. The big bang occurred 14 billion years ago. The solar system and the earth were created 4.5 billion years ago. The dinosaurs and small mammals appeared 251 million years ago. And modern man appeared 300,000 years ago. Breathe a sigh of relief.</p> \n<p>The sign describing man’s origins says, “Man is part of the great ape family (Hominidae), which includes chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. Of these, the closest to us is the chimpanzee.” The rest of the sign is admittedly worded rather evasively and ambiguously, but that’s a detail, not the essence.</p> \n<p>The impressive exhibit includes an explanation of what homo sapien is, the story of Lucy, who lived in Ethiopia 3.2 million years ago, and whose discovery revolutionized our understanding of the stages of man’s evolution; and explanations of tool-making, genetic research, the increase in brain size, human communication, symbolic thinking, language, writing and society.</p> \n<p>A sensitive, delicate issue</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, several questions remain. Firstly, the name Charles Darwin, the father of evolutionary theory, is never mentioned in the museum. Nor is there any explanation of what evolution is. The word is used several times, but a student seeking to understand it would have trouble learning anything without the help of outside sources.</p> \n<p>The bigger problem is the isolation of the “What makes us human?” exhibit. The fourth floor is a rather mysterious wing, hidden away, which recalls the electric cave in the famous Israeli children’s book series “Hasamba.” Anyone who knows the exhibit is there will find it, but someone who hasn’t heard about it is liable to leave the museum without ever seeing it.</p> \n<p>The museum’s architectural plan is an enigma. The building is huge, but the museum is quite small, even a little squashed, with bizarre twists and turns.</p> \n<p>The suggested visitors’ route begins comfortably on the first and second floors. Then you arrive at the collection (countless taxidermic animals with glaring eyes) and you feel as if you’ve finished.</p> \n<p>At that point, you have to be smart: Skip the third floor and the multipurpose gallery, which features an art exhibit about bird’s nests; it’s a kind of minefield or antitank barrier meant to keep visitors away. Instead, proceed resolutely to the fourth floor. Don’t give up. Take an honest look at the human skeleton placed alongside the chimpanzee skeleton. We’re brothers.</p> \n<p>A clear reminder of the difficult battle that still awaits the museum’s directors came on October 3. The Public Forum for a Jewish and Democratic Israel, an organization founded in April 2018 for the purpose, according to its founders, of “providing a response in the media, on social media and on the ground to the activity of groups that seek a disconnection of Israelis from Judaism,” posted the following statement on Facebook.</p> \n<p>“A parent of young children wrote the following to us: I visited the new Museum of Natural History at Tel Aviv University today with my children. I was surprised to discover an entire floor about ‘man originating from monkeys.’ Drawings, diagrams and detailed explanations. I must say I felt very uncomfortable, and preferred to spare my young children this part of the museum.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know if there’s a scientific consensus about Darwinian evolution, but it’s clear that this is a sensitive, delicate issue, about which there’s no consensus in Israeli society, especially when it comes to the large swaths of Israeli society that are ultra-Orthodox, religious or traditional. The theory of evolution clashes with their belief in the creation of the world.</p> \n<p>“In my view, because this is a museum clearly intended for children, they ought to get rid of this section. At a time when claims of ‘religionization’ (in my view, exaggerated and unjustified in many cases) are appearing every day, we should rise up against the disconnection of Israeli children.”</p> \n<p>Rereading this post stifles the sighs of relief I breathed earlier. They were premature. The natural history museum’s staff is now on the front lines. If they manage to get children (including the children of that anonymous writer to the Forum for a Jewish and Democratic Israel) to see the “What makes us human?” exhibit, they will have taken another step toward an erect spine and a developed brain.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“We need to talk.”</p> \n<p>The title chosen for this year’s Jewish federation summit doesn’t beat around the bush: There is trouble in the tribe, it suggests in rather blunt terms, and it’s time to hold some tough conversations about the many issues dividing Israel and American Jewry.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Jewish Federations GA slogan 'We need to talk' is a desperate plea to save Israel-U.S. Jewish ties | Chemi Shalev</p> \n<p>To be sure, there is no shortage of topics to fill a three-day gathering devoted to the crisis in Israel-Diaspora relations. Critics, however, charge that the actual program for the annual General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America – which kicks off Monday and will be held this year, for the first time ever, in Tel Aviv – doesn’t live up to the promise of its title.</p> \n<p>The choice of venue guarantees a good showing from both sides of the Atlantic, and indeed, at last count, the mega-event was expected to draw close to 2,500 participants, split almost evenly between Americans and Israelis.</p> \n<p>But how can a gathering that promises to put everything on the table – ask critics from the progressive side of the map – ignore some of the most divisive issues threatening Israel’s relations with Diaspora Jewry such as Israel’s continued occupation of the West Bank and its discrimination of Reform and Conservative Jews, who account for the vast majority in the United States? And how, according to critics from the opposite side of the spectrum, can such an event ignore the voices of the small but increasingly influential Orthodox community?</p> \n<p>T’ruah, a rabbinical human rights group based in New York (whose membership consists mainly of non-Orthodox rabbis), had proposed organizing a tour to the West Bank, a day before or after the GA, for participants who might be interested in seeing the occupation up close. “There wasn’t any openness or interest though,” lamented Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the executive director of the organization.</p> \n<p>T’ruah also prepared a pamphlet on the occupation, she says, and offered to pay to have it distributed in the GA conference bags. According to Jacobs, that request was also rejected. “What we were told is that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not on the agenda of the JFNA and never has been, and there was concern that people would be upset if they opened their bags and found this booklet,” she said.</p> \n<p>“Our goal was to give participants in a conference titled ‘We Need to Talk’ the opportunity to learn about the occupation, which is after all the major reason American Jews, particularly young American Jews, are increasingly walking away from Israel.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The Israeli minister who will be conspicuously absent from this week’s big Jewish federation event&nbsp;■&nbsp;The GA's 'We need to talk' slogan is a desperate plea to save Israel-U.S. Jewish ties | Analysis</p> \n<p>During the GA, T’ruah will share a booth outside the main session halls with two other liberal Zionist organizations – the New Israel Fund and J Street – where they will distribute information about the nation-state law and its threat, as they see it, to Israeli democracy.</p> \n<p>Asked for comment on why T’ruah was not allowed to put its pamphlet on the occupation in the conference bags, the spokeswoman for the Jewish Federations of North America, Rebecca Dinar, said: “We are pleased that T’ruah is a sponsor and encourage them to distribute information from their booth.”</p> \n<p>'Disillusioned and disappointed' </p> \n<p>Hagit Ofran, director of the Settlement Watch project at Peace Now, expressed similar frustrations with the lack of attention in the program to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “The program rightfully underlines the growing divide between Israeli and North American Jewry,” she said, “yet fails to address the elephant in the room – Israel’s policy toward and military rule over the Palestinians.”</p> \n<p>It’s no secret, she added, that the Israeli government’s opposition to a two-state solution has left many American Jews “disillusioned and disappointed with the Jewish institutions claiming to represent them.”</p> \n<p>“If the JFNA wants to engage in meaningful dialogue on the fate of the Israel-Diaspora Jewish connection,” Ofran said, “it must not ignore the tectonic political issues driving the communities apart.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; American Jews Are Funding the Far-right Dream of Greater Israel. We Have to End This - Now</p> \n<p>Logan Bayroff, director of communications at J Street, said he was also disappointed that the new nation-state law, which detractors say downplays Israel’s democratic character, was not up for discussion in the program. “The GA, as a major gathering of American Jews, should not in any way be shying away from those subjects and should be making them a major component of their program,” he said.</p> \n<p>Over the past year, mainstream Jewish organizations have been extremely vocal in their criticism of the Israeli government’s treatment of asylum seekers. For that reason, Tamara Newman, a Tel Aviv-based advocate for asylum seekers, had hoped to see the issue addressed at the GA summit. Hence her deep disappointment.</p> \n<p>“It’s not an exaggeration to say that the engagement of world Jewry on this issue saved thousands of lives,” said Newman, director for international relations and development for the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants.</p> \n<p>“But just a few months later, literally two weeks before the start of the GA, the Israeli government has announced that they will deport the few hundred asylum seekers here from the Congo. Some of them have been in the country for 20 years. There are teenagers who were born here, who read and write and dream in Hebrew, and in 90 days they are going to be deported to a war zone and never be able to return. We need to talk about that, too.”</p> \n<p>It’s not only the left that feels left out. An Orthodox Jewish-American group called Am Echad – Preserving One Jewish People charges that the community it represents appears to be unwanted at the biggest Jewish-world event of the year.</p> \n<p>“Unfortunately, while they speak about the importance of dialogue and understanding, the voices at the General Assembly are limited in their variation,” the organization said in a statement. “It is the voice of the American Reform and Conservative, the voice of the liberal American who values Israel’s democratic nature over its Jewish nature, that dominates the conference.”</p> \n<p>“Where are the other voices in the dialogue?” the group asked. “Where are the voices of those with the natural, vibrant, everyday connection to Israel and its people? Where are the voices of those who, with their minimal intermarriage and assimilation rates, are poised to become the dominant face of American Jewry within the next few decades?”</p> \n<p>Everybody but the Orthodox</p> \n<p>A look at the program reveals that critics from both sides, indeed, have grounds for their grievances. Orthodox voices are nowhere to be found and issues that have caused outrage and angst among progressives Jews – who still account for the overwhelming majority in America – are not specifically addressed in the program.</p> \n<p>So what is? For the most part, it seems, issues of consensus. That includes, for example, the success of Israeli high-tech (to which several sessions are devoted), the need to support and empower Holocaust survivors, and the importance of integrating ultra-Orthodox Jews into Israeli society.</p> \n<p>There’s also a session on the importance of fighting the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement (but not one on whether it’s worth fighting or whether it’s being fought in the right way), and a luncheon, for invited guests only, devoted to female philanthropy. A session titled “Can We Talk? Peace Process Realities in Israel” holds promise of sparking some controversy, but the accompanying explanation indicates that the discussion will confine itself to feel-good stories about organizations and individuals trying to create coexistence and dialogue.</p> \n<p>A session devoted to Israeli Arabs will similarly focus on the good work being done, in this case by the government, to assist this embattled minority. A session devoted to religious pluralism will spotlight various grassroots initiatives aimed at circumventing Israel's religious authorities and how federation funding is helping them – once again, an attempt to put a positive spin on a thorny issue.</p> \n<p>Indeed, the only session that seems to hold some promise of delivering on the theme of the program is called “Tackling the Toughest Issues.” The accompanying explanation notes that participants in this dialogue forum, to be facilitated by the Jewish Agency, will be encouraged to speak their minds on issues such as the nation-state law, prayer at the Western Wall and conversion.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, is concerned that the Jewish Federations of North America may be squandering a unique opportunity. “I admire greatly the federation leadership, but to be truthful, they are trying to do something that is impossible, which is to create a very warm, positive groundswell at a time that there are very serious deep divides and debates,” he told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>“I commend them for putting out a positive message, but we’ve got to be able to air hard issues in a thoughtful way – otherwise I think people will be frustrated that they came and that we didn’t get to the real crux of the matters.”</p> \n<p>Asked to respond to allegations that the GA program avoids most of the hot-button issues in Israel’s relations with American Jewry – among them the occupation, prayer at the Western Wall, conversion, the nation-state law and treatment of asylum seekers – the JFNA spokeswoman said: “Our program was designed to offer GA attendees a chance to look behind the scenes of how life really is in two very different communities.</p> \n<p>“By shining a light on issues like Israeli Arab concerns about minority integration, Haredi innovators working on social innovation, Federation leaders’ approach to interfaith marriage, and pluralistic Jewish expression, we hope that people will challenge their historic narratives about each other; and we hope to help grow the knowledge base about the variables involved in policy- and decision-making within Israel and among Jews communities across the ocean.”</p> \n<p>She added: “In moderated discussions on the plenary stage, facilitated discussions in dialogue dens, and casual conversations held informally in hallways, I can guarantee that the policy differences that you listed will also be addressed.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>On Sunday the Ministerial Committee for Legislation is due to discuss the so-called loyalty-in-culture bill proposed by Culture Minister Miri Regev, who seeks to grant herself power to censor Israeli culture. Under the proposal, Regev will be granted the authority to withhold budgets from cultural institutions on several grounds, some of them criminal offenses such as support for terror, incitement to racism and the desecration of state symbols.</p> \n<p>But Regev wants to make herself investigator, judge and executor while deciding on her own (after receiving opinions from advisers) when a work or cultural institution “supports terror,” “incites to racism” or “desecrates state symbols.” The other grounds for withholding funding are legal actions such as artistic statements about the Nakba – the Palestinians’ term for the events of the 1947-49 war – and “rejecting the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state” – such a vague definition that any culture minister could take advantage of it to censor institutions.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The disingenuous argument that this is not an attack on freedom of expression but just “withholding funding” stems from the view that state funds are the personal piggy banks of government ministers. If they want to fund, they will; if they don’t, they won’t – all based on political considerations. After all, they have the “freedom to finance.”</p> \n<p>But that’s not how things work. Public funding in a democratic country is distributed based on equal criteria in accordance with the law, and not based on criteria that let ministers hand out money based on their political opinions.</p> \n<p>Maintaining freedom of speech and artistic freedom are crucial in culture. This bill brings Israel closer to a situation in which only works glorifying the government and its policies receive funding. This state – of art in the name of and subject to political whims – characterizes authoritarian regimes.</p> \n<p>The finance minister has similar authority – the so-called Nakba law of 2011. And yet, not only are the proposed powers broader, but the fact that a damaging law that has never been used is already on the books isn’t an excuse to pass an even more harmful law that would grant powers to the minister responsible for culture, of all people. This is a minister who has already announced that she intends to use her power against works that criticize the army or the occupation, or even against works that simply contain nudity – which she calls an offense to “the country’s Jewishness.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;No Nakba, No Boycott: Israeli Minister to Get Power to Crack Down on Cultural Institutions</p> \n<p>Despite the smokescreen, this isn’t a bill that would withhold funding from “terrorism supporters” or “people acting against the country.” This is a brutish and blunt attempt to gag cultural institutions and artists that provide criticism. The bill is likely to pass thanks to the embarrassing support of Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, contrary to the opinion of his ministry’s legal adviser and despite the misgivings of the attorney general. The government cannot approve this malicious bill.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz’s lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>During the summer of 2016, Santiago Aguirre divided his time between part-time university lecturing and working for an organization that helps locate missing people. Mexico was then in the news internationally because of presidential candidate Donald Trump’s promise to build a wall on the American border with its southern neighbor. However, for Aguirre, a Mexican human rights activist, the problems of the present were far more pressing than any future wall. At the time, he was in the midst of a lengthy investigation to solve the mystery of the disappearance and presumed murder of 43 students in the city of Iguala two years before. It was becoming increasingly clear that his findings were incompatible with the results of the investigation conducted by the government.</p> \n<p>Aguirre wasn’t concerned when he received a series of text messages containing broken links. “Please help me with my brother, the police took him only because he is a teacher,” one message read. And another: “Professor, I encountered a problem. I am sending back my thesis, which is based on your dissertation, so that you can give me your comments.” The messages looked no different from many of the legitimate messages he received every day as part of his work. And therein lay the secret of their power. When Aguirre clicked on the links, however, he was inadvertently turning his smartphone into a surveillance device in the hands of the government.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“Those text messages had information that was personal,” Aguirre notes, “the kind of information that could make the message interesting for me so I would click.&nbsp;It wasn’t until later that I actually thought – well, it is actually pretty weird that I received three messages with broken links.”</p> \n<p>The discovery had a brutally chilling effect on the work of his organization. For the first time, he says, speaking with Haaretz by phone, he really and truly feared that every step he took was being watched, and that perhaps his family too was under surveillance.</p> \n<p>“Over the past 10 years, we have a figure of around 30,000 people who disappeared” in Mexico, Aguirre explains.&nbsp;“Many places in Mexico are controlled by organized crime. It has under its influence and power the authorities of some regions of the country, so they use the police to detain and then disappear people that they think are the enemy.&nbsp;I can tell you of many examples in which the Mexican military, for example, has presented the work human rights defenders as [benefiting] the drug cartels and organized crime. So there’s a pattern of thinking about the human rights sector in Mexico as a sector that needs to be surveilled.”</p> \n<p>The public revelation of the fact that Aguirre was under surveillance was made possible by cooperation between Mexican organizations and the Canadian research institute Citizen Lab. It turned out that Aguirre was one of a group of 22 journalists, lawyers, politicians, researchers and activists who were being tracked by local authorities. An examination of Aguirre’s telephone revealed that the links in the text messages were related to Pegasus spyware, which the authorities were using.</p> \n<p>But how did Pegasus get to Mexico? The trail of the malware led to Herzliya Pituah, the prosperous Tel Aviv suburb that is one of the major hubs of Israel’s high-tech industry. It’s there, in a narrow stretch of land between Israel’s coastal highway and the Mediterranean Sea, that NSO Group, the company that developed this Trojan-horse program, has its headquarters. Pegasus, which Forbes magazine called “the world’s most invasive mobile spy kit” in 2016, allows almost unlimited monitoring, even commandeering, of cellphones: to discover the phone’s location, eavesdrop on it, record nearby conversations, photograph those in the vicinity of the phone, read and write text messages and emails, download apps and penetrate apps already in the phone, and access photographs, clips, calendar reminders and the contacts list. And all in total secrecy.</p> \n<p>Pegasus’ invasive capability was rapidly transformed into dazzling economic success. In 2014, less than five years after entering the world from a space in a chicken coop in Bnei Zion, a moshav in the country’s center, 70 percent of the company’s holdings were purchased for $130 million. The buyer was Francisco Partners, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, which specializes in high-tech investments. That deal followed Francisco Partners’ earlier purchases of Israeli firms Ex Libris and Dmatek, According to Reuters, a year after the NSO takeover, Francisco Partners enjoyed a profit of $75 million.</p> \n<p>But the big money of NSO is only a small part of the big picture. Within a few years, the Israeli espionage industry has become the spearhead of the global commerce in surveillance tools and communications interception. Today, every self-respecting governmental agency that has no respect for the privacy of its citizens, is equipped with spy capabilities created in Herzliya Pituah.</p> \n<p>Supreme secrecy</p> \n<p>The reports about Pegasus prompted Meretz MK Tamar Zandberg and human rights lawyer Itay Mack to go to court in 2016 with a request to suspend NSO’s export permit. At the state’s request, however, the deliberations were held in camera and a gag order was issued on the judgment. Supreme Court President Justice Esther Hayut summed up the matter by noting, “Our economy, as it happens, rests not a little on that export.”</p> \n<p>The Defense Ministry benefits from the news blackout. Supervision takes place far from the public eye – not even the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee is privy to basic details of the lion’s share of Israel’s defense exports. Contrary to the norms that exist in other democracies, the ministry refuses to disclose the list of countries to which military exports are prohibited, or the criteria and standards that underlie its decisions.</p> \n<p>A comprehensive investigation carried out by Haaretz, based on about 100 sources in 15 countries, had as its aim lifting the veil of secrecy from commerce based on means of espionage. The findings show that Israeli industry have not hesitated to sell offensive capabilities to many countries that lack a strong democratic tradition, even when they have no way to ascertain whether the items sold were being used to violate the rights of civilians. The testimonies show that the Israeli equipment has been used to locate and detain human rights activists, persecute members of the LGBT community, silence citizens who were critical of their government and even to fabricate cases of blasphemy against Islam in Muslim countries that don’t maintain formal relations with Israel. The Haaretz investigation also found that Israeli firms continued to sell espionage products even when it was revealed publicly that the equipment was used for malicious purposes.</p> \n<p>Private Israeli companies, the investigation discovered, have sold espionage and intelligence-gathering software to Bahrain, Indonesia, Angola, Mozambique, the Dominican Republic, Azerbaijan, Swaziland, Botswana, Bangladesh, El Salvador, Panama and Nicaragua. In addition, the investigation corroborated earlier reports over the years about sales to Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Honduras, Trinidad and Tobago, Peru, Colombia, Uganda, Nigeria, Ecuador and United Arab Emirates.</p> \n<p>The great majority of employees with whom we spoke declined to have their detailed testimonies appear in this investigative report, because of the draconian secrecy contracts they signed. Other personnel, who agreed to tell about their part in the industry, appear under false names. While some CEOs spoke to us, others preferred to toe the secrecy line and spout the usual response: Israeli systems help thwart terrorism and fight crime; the sales were authorized by the Defense Ministry; the exports are carried out lawfully.</p> \n<p>And the truth is that all of the above claims are correct. The law does not prohibit the sale of surveillance and interception equipment to foreign governments and law-enforcement agencies, the exports are approved by the Defense Exports Control Agency (a unit in the Defense Ministry), and the items in question are used to thwart terrorism and crime. For example, systems of the Verint company assisted in the effort to stop abductions in Mozambique and in a campaign against poaching in Botswana. In Nigeria, Israeli systems assisted in the battle against the terrorist organization Boko Haram. However, senior officials in the Israeli firms admit that once the systems are sold, there is no way to prevent their abuse.</p> \n<p>“I can’t constrict my client’s capabilities,” says Roy, who is experienced in cyberware. “You can’t sell someone a Mercedes and tell him not to drive faster than 100 kilometers an hour. The truth is that the Israeli companies don’t know what use will be made of the systems they sell.”</p> \n<p>“It’s hard to supervise,” adds Yaniv (a pseudonym, like all the other names cited here), who is employed in the industry and served in the Israel Defense Forces’ vaunted Unit 8200 in the Intelligence Corps. “Even when limitations are placed over the capabilities of the computer programs, the companies don’t know who they will be used against. Everyone in this field knows that we are manufacturing systems that invade people’s lives and violate their most basic rights. It’s a weapon – like selling a pistol. The thing is that in this industry people think about the technological challenges, not about the implications. I want to believe that the Defense Ministry supervises exports in the right way.”</p> \n<p>However, even the supervisors in the ministry have no way of knowing who’s being spied on with the Israeli products. Israelis who train the buyers in the use of the systems sometimes learn about the purposes for which they have been acquired. “I happened to see a super-wrong use of the systems,” says Tomer, who has trained intelligence bodies all over the world. “I’m telling foreign trainees about the system’s capabilities, and they pounce on it and start to place people under surveillance for negligible reasons, right before my eyes. Someone was critical of the president’s move to raise prices, someone else shared a hashtag identified with the opposition – and in an instant they’re both on the surveillance list.”</p> \n<p>Guy Mizrahi, co-founder of Cyberia, a cyber solutions company, divides the industry into two types of firms. “There are companies that know how to do only one thing, but really well,” he notes, “while other companies have a range of products. Some of them control the databases of internet providers and cellular operators, some are capable of getting to the [targeted] device itself, by all kinds of means.”</p> \n<p>NSO, the developer of Pegasus, is probably the best-known example of the first category, which consists of one exceptional ability. Verint Systems, one of the multifaceted giants of the industry, is an example of the second type, with diverse products. Verint started as the intelligence unit of Comverse Technology, which was established by Jacob “Kobi” Alexander, an American-Israeli businessman who was recently released from prison in the wake of fraud charges brought against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Verint subsequently went its own way and is now headed by CEO Dan Bodner. The company has 5,200 employees in a number of countries, of whom 1,000 work at its Herzliya Pituah headquarters.</p> \n<p>Though sources who worked with Verint products in Mozambique and Botswana encountered only legitimate projects, instructors of agencies in Azerbaijan and Indonesia related that the firm’s products were used maliciously. “I was an instructor in Azerbaijan. One day the trainees came over to me during a break,” Tal recalls. “They wanted to know how to check sexual inclinations via Facebook. Afterward, when I read up on the subject, I discovered that they’re known for persecuting the [gay] community there. Suddenly things were connected.”</p> \n<p>An example of what he meant is a 2017 report on the arrest and torture by Azeri police of 45 gay men and transgender women. That took place a few years after Verint’s systems began being used in the country. Tal says he now regrets having worked there, adding that incidents of the Azerbaijan type hastened his decision to leave the profession.</p> \n<p>Indonesia is no haven for the LGBT community, either. Reports by human rights organizations have noted the tough policy against the community, as well as against religious minorities, under legislation that bans “blasphemy.” Three sources who spoke to Haaretz talked about wrongful use of Verint products in Indonesia.</p> \n<p>In one case, the systems were used to create a database of LGBT rights activists who had been targeted for surveillance. In another, the victims of the spyware were religious minorities. “As soon as I arrived in the country, the client told me that my help was needed with an investigation that was bogged down,” Netanel, who worked with the Indonesians to activate the systems, relates. “Very quickly the investigation turned out to be a case against a non-Muslim public figure who was accused of blasphemy,” an offense that carries up to five years in prison.</p> \n<p>Leave no traces</p> \n<p>Back to NSO. The Israeli cyber giant was founded in 2010 by three friends: Omri Lavie, Shalev Hulio and Niv Carmi (the latter left early on). Lavie and Hulio, who are today in their late 30s, knew each other from high school in Haifa. They embarked on their path in business a few years after Hulio completed his army service at the Home Front Command.</p> \n<p>What is their business path? “We are a ghost,” Lavie was once quoted as saying. “We are completely transparent to our goal and we leave no traces.” Some years later, the traces of the ghosts from Haifa could be detected in every corner of the world.</p> \n<p>As befits ghosts, Lavie and Hulio are not prone to making public statements. In 2015, Hulio gave a rare interview to the podcast “Hashavua” (This Week). “From the outset, we thought of creating a system that would allow all the intelligence and law enforcement bodies to be in control of telephones remotely, or to extract information from them, with or without the user’s knowledge,” Hulio related. “We thought it would be simple, but it was extremely complex. That’s actually what NSO is doing to this day. We have iPhones and Androids, and everything is very secure, but in the end we see that everyone is listening to everyone,” he said, chuckling. “The phone goes with you everywhere. The amount of information about a person that can be extracted from his telephone is amazing, and there is no phone that is secure today.”</p> \n<p>The most blatant case in which NSO apparently left traces is that of Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist from the United Arab Emirates. In August 2016, Mansoor received a text message on his iPhone, promising secret information about the use of torture in the country, if he clicked on an attached link. Behind the link, however, was Pegasus spyware, which was then identified by the organization Citizen Lab. Its exposure generated worldwide panic. Experts at the time suggested that it was the most sophisticated and comprehensive breach of Apple’s exacting security systems. Embarrassed, the corporation had to issue an urgent software update for all its clients’ devices.</p> \n<p>Mansoor is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence for publishing posts critical of the regime on social networks. His story appears in two lawsuits that were filed against NSO and another firm, Circles Technologies, which was also founded by Israelis. One of the plaintiffs is the Mexican activist Santiago Aguirre, together with a Qatari citizen. Documents appended to the suit allege that NSO and Circles systems in the UAE kept tabs on 159 members of the Qatari royal family, senior government officials and various citizens of that country.</p> \n<p>According to the suit, filed in August 2014 in Israel and Cyprus, Eric Banoun, an Israeli who was a senior executive at Circles, received an email from Ahmad Ali al-Habsi, an official of the UAE’s Supreme Council for National Security. The message noted that the council’s directorate would soon make a decision, apparently referring to the purchase of the company’s products. In the meantime, he asked Banoun to demonstrate the company’s capabilities, “even though I know that this is not included in our license,” and is also prohibited under the rules of the [Israeli] Defense Ministry. In this connection, Circles was asked to intercept the conversations of the editor of the Al Arab newspaper, of Qatar, over a 48-hour period. And indeed, within two days al-Habsi received an email with recordings of the editor’s conversations.</p> \n<p>Ben, who serves as a consultant to surveillance firms in the Emirates, spoke with Haaretz from his residence in the Persian Gulf. Israeli companies are known in the region as suppliers of espionage equipment, he said. “Dubai [referring to the UAE] is a big client of surveillance technologies,” he maintains, “and they know that the best technologies come from Israel.” During the call he started to laugh nervously and remarked, “For sure the conversation now is being recorded.” Voice calls via encrypted apps such as WhatsApp, Single and Telegram are blocked in the country, leaving only the monitored phone network.</p> \n<p>The UAE is not alone. Earlier this month, Citizen Lab announced with “high confidence” that Pegasus spyware was used to track Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada under political asylum. According to the organization’s report, agents of the regime in Riyadh used NSO technology in Montreal against Abdulaziz. NSO did not deny the report.</p> \n<p>Haaretz now adds another piece to the Israeli spyware puzzle in the Gulf. Our investigation reveals that Verint systems were sold to Bahrain, a small, undemocratic kingdom in the Gulf, where a Shi’ite majority is ruled by a Sunni royal house. During the Arab Spring, the rulers brutally suppressed demonstrations in the country with the aid of reinforcements brought in from Saudi Arabia. Last February, Nabeel Rajab, Bahrain’s most prominent human rights activist, was sentenced to five years in prison in the wake of a series of tweets critical of the regime.</p> \n<p>According to two sources who have been to Bahrain, Verint supplied the kingdom with systems that are typically used by monitoring centers, and with another system used for collecting information from social networks. One of the two sources, Arnon, related that Israelis travel to the country to train regime officials in the use of the systems or to carry out maintenance work. The Israelis arrive with foreign passports and are usually forbidden to move about in the country, he adds. The ban on free movement was a recurring theme in conversations with several sources who act as instructors in countries that want to play down the Israeli presence. In many cases, the Israelis are confined to their hotel room when they’re not working.</p> \n<p>“I have been to many countries,” Arnon relates. “There were places where I trained soldiers and members of enforcement agencies, and places where we trained confidants – people who seem to be members of the ruler’s extended family. In Bahrain all the members of the team were Indians, and alongside them were the personnel of Bahraini intelligence – including women, by the way. The truth is that I hated that country, because we were simply bored there. It’s not scary, but we’re not allowed to go anywhere. If I had to speculate on what use they make of the systems, I would guess that it has to do with anti-regime protest.”</p> \n<p>From Elbit to Ethiopia</p> \n<p>Besides the Persian Gulf, Africa is also a flourishing arena for Israeli espionage equipment. Two sources who were involved in Verint projects confirmed to Haaretz that systems relating to communications interception were sold to Swaziland, which has gained the dubious distinction of being “the last absolutist monarchy in Africa.” Our investigation found that Israeli companies sold espionage and intelligence capabilities to eight countries on the continent, as mentioned above. In addition to Swaziland, transactions were concluded with Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Botswana, Nigeria and Uganda.</p> \n<p>The most disturbing case is South Sudan, the young country founded in 2011. Two years after it gained independence, a vicious civil war erupted in the country, in which war crimes, including massacres and systematic rape were perpetrated by all the parties involved. As early as 2016 the United Nations stated that Israeli companies were selling equipment to South Sudan that was used for eavesdropping on opponents of the regime. Now, three sources confirmed that Verint supplied espionage means to the country, and two of them were able to say that the equipment was used in a monitoring center.</p> \n<p>From the distance of time, Tomer, who used to train security personnel in use of surveillance systems, looks back at South Sudan and is overcome with disgust. “There were Israelis there from the moment they started to talk about the peace agreement that led to the country’s establishment,” he says. “Two weeks after the signing we already started to talk about projects there. The spirit of things was ‘What fun, we have a new opportunity.’ It’s simply revolting.”</p> \n<p>Abuse of Israeli-manufactured capabilities apparently occurred in Nigeria, too. A comprehensive report published in that country asserted that products of Circles Technologies were sold in 2012 to the governors of Delta and Bayelsa, states in the Nigerian federation. The investigation found that, ahead of the 2015 election, the governor of Bayelsa used the capabilities to monitor his chief rival and his wife and aides, and in one case to locate and arrest a well-known critic of the regime.</p> \n<p>In 2013, it was revealed that the Israeli firm Elbit Systems had also been awarded a contract in the country, worth $40 million. At the time, Yehuda Vered, general manager of one of the company’s divisions, said the deal was for the supply of “systems for cyber analysis and protection.” But then came a report saying that, in addition to devices for “analysis and protection,” Elbit had supplied the Nigerians with an espionage program as well. In the wake of the revelation, the Nigerian National Assembly suspended the transaction pending the outcome of an investigation. However, it wasn’t long before the Israeli systems were installed in the headquarters of the National Intelligence Agency in Abuja.</p> \n<p>Last December, Citizen Lab reported that the spyware PC 360 was used inside Ethiopia against dissidents living in the United States and Britain. The targets received an email supposedly leading to a link proving that the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea was expected to continue. In this connection, the recipients were asked to download an Adobe update, in which the malware was concealed. By this means, passwords, email exchanges and screenshots were stolen from them.</p> \n<p>The investigation by Citizen Lab led to the servers of Cyberbit, formerly the intelligence division of Nice Systems, which was subsequently acquired by Elbit Systems. The laptops used by company personnel to illustrate the products’ capabilities helped the investigators of Citizen Lab trace their visits to potential clients in the Philippines, Thailand, Uzbekistan and Zambia.</p> \n<p>To this day, no one in either Israel or Ethiopia has admitted that the deal was consummated, but two sources who were employed by Cyberbit confirmed to Haaretz that it was. The two, Gal and Roy, decided to leave the surveillance field because of moral qualms and the secrecy their work entailed.</p> \n<p>“There’s a difference between selling to countries such as Germany or Denmark, and to clients from Ethiopia or Kazakhstan,” notes Gal. “That no longer suited my values. Whoever takes part in this industry knows what he is doing. There’s no way that technology of this sort will not be wrongfully abused – the only question is in what way. I don’t want to be part of that agonizing.”</p> \n<p>Adds Gal, “Along with that, it’s a good industry. The army supplies very young but experienced talents, with specific knowledge. Why don’t we [Israelis] develop social networks like Snapchat, in which a message that’s sent immediately fades? Because we don’t have a relative advantage [in that]. The relative advantage there lies with an American college student, who knows that people send each other nude photos.”</p> \n<p>And we’re good at extracting those nude photos from phones?</p> \n<p>Gal: “Precisely! That’s the relative advantage. There are other industries like this – the drones, for example. The reason that the industry in Israel is flourishing so well is the ecosystem that was created here. It’s not that we’re so special.”</p> \n<p>Scene of the crime</p> \n<p>No few traces of Israeli activity can be found in Latin America, too. Documents uncovered by the AP news agency show that in 2015 Verint set up a military monitoring base in Peru, at a cost of $22 million. The system is capable of tracking satellite, wireless and landline communications of 5,000 targets, and of recording conversations of 300 individuals simultaneously.</p> \n<p>The deal with Peru also included a product called SkyLock. The cover page of the commercial brochure for the surveillance system, which was leaked to The Washington Post, states: “Locate. Track. Manipulate.” The brochure goes on to describe in detail how the system can pinpoint the location of telephones throughout Peru, and in most other countries.</p> \n<p>However, the deal was delayed due to unforeseen difficulties, when Peru’s chief intelligence agency became involved in an espionage scandal. The prime minister at the time, Ana Jara, had used the agency to place legislators, journalists and leading businesspeople under surveillance. Jara was forced to resign, but Verint apparently did not back out of the deal. According to a source who was involved in the details, personnel from the agency that got into trouble are now operating the system within the framework of the police force.</p> \n<p>Another source who spoke to Haaretz confirms that Israeli firms are continuing to sell offensive cyber capabilities to Mexico as well, even after it became known that they were being used against civilians. “One of the things that always scared me in Mexico is that you never know whom you’re actually talking to, and who’s behind him,” the source says. “Everything there is utterly corrupt, but they are very careful not to reveal their purposes to the Israelis.”</p> \n<p>Another example of a decision to go on doing business with those who abuse the surveillance capabilities is Colombia. In 2015, the British nonprofit Privacy International revealed that Verint and Nice had supplied the Bogota police with systems to intercept phone conversations, and that the technology was used to surveil opponents of the regime. A source involved in Verint’s deals in Latin America maintains that despite this, the company is continuing to sell its products in Colombia.</p> \n<p>An instructor who trained local agencies in Latin America in the use of Verint systems, relates that he personally witnessed the abuse of the products. “There was one time that I was teaching people how to collect information from the social networks,” he recalls. “I’m working with the trainees and explaining things to them, when suddenly they ask me to run a check on [political] demonstrators. Just like that, in the middle of the training session.”</p> \n<p>Rolling in billions</p> \n<p>“Since the birth of communications, there have been attempts, and new means, of trying to intercept and decrypt these communications. Most recently, since the rise of the internet, this took on a whole new perspective, as more and more civilians have access to digital technology,” says Edin Omanovic, a Privacy International investigator whose field of expertise is espionage and intelligence means produced by private companies. “That, alongside the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the ‘war on terror,’ has led governments around the world to invest more and more capital in surveillance technologies […] Today’s equipment enables mass surveillance over the internet and other means of electronic communications.”</p> \n<p>Privacy International has been publishing research studies about international trade in surveillance technology since 1995. A PI report issued two years ago noted the tremendous growth of the industry. Whereas in 2012 it encompassed 246 companies globally, by 2016 the number of firms had more than doubled, to 528. There are 27 Israeli firms on the list, making Israel the country with the highest per capita ratio of surveillance companies. Local and international data indicate that Israel accounts for between 10 and 20 percent of the global cyber market. In 2016, investments in Israeli startups in the industry accounted for 20 percent of the world total.</p> \n<p>The dizzying success of the Israeli interception and surveillance industry is not a chance development that was generated by a spontaneous eruption of Jewish genius. When the high-tech bubble burst, in 2000, the Israeli economy went into a tailspin, which was countered by the intervention of Finance Minister Silvan Shalom and his successor, Benjamin Netanyahu. The government increased security expenditures by more than 10 percent and encouraged the local startup industry to enter the fields of security and surveillance.</p> \n<p>The Israel Defense Forces, for its part, played the role of a business hothouse, as its technological intelligence units swelled and their graduates channeled the knowledge they’d acquired into a host of startups. The timing certainly played into the hands of the industry. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, countries around the world started to intensively acquire devices to monitor individuals suspected of terrorism or radicalization. The rich experience of recently discharged IDF soldiers met that need precisely.</p> \n<p>Since then, the IDF and the local startup industry have continued to nourish each other. Only recently Haaretz reported that at the end of 2015, the army issued a call for bids for the establishment of a system to track targets on the net, which a year later was already being operated by an external firm. Concurrently, when the wave of stabbing attacks erupted, in 2015, the defense establishment made wide use of early-warning systems based in part on information gleaned from the social networks.</p> \n<p>Another example is Fifth Dimension, a local firm that provides predictive systems for Israeli security agencies. These products join the ramified eavesdropping system that the IDF has employed for years against the Palestinians in the territories.</p> \n<p>Indeed, a recently published study found that the 700 local cyber companies were established by a small group of 2,300 Israelis, 80 percent of whom belong to the exclusive club created in the IDF’s intelligence units, notably Unit 8200.</p> \n<p>If at the beginning of the last decade the government of Ariel Sharon sought to exploit the know-how of former intelligence-unit personnel, at the beginning of the current decade, the Netanyahu government was bent on exploiting the potential latent in academia. The reasons derive from security and economic aims alike. During the past year the internet information-security market had a turnover of $31 billion, and estimates project that within eight years the turnover will soar to $76 billion annually worldwide. Or, in Netanyahu’s words, “Cyber is a serious threat and a very lucrative business.”</p> \n<p>After returning to power in 2009, Netanyahu set out to push the industry ahead. To that end, he called on Maj. Gen. (res.) Isaac Ben-Israel to draw up a multiyear plan. Prof. Ben-Israel now heads the Interdisciplinary Cyber Studies Center at Tel Aviv University. The national cyber program with whose development he was entrusted engendered four additional cyber research centers around the country. Ben-Israel believed that the focus should be on education and research. “Before this, it was impossible to take cyber studies in the universities, only computer sciences,” he says. “There were no research institutes, the industry did not have a mechanism to encourage cyber development, and the defense system, which in Israel is a huge component in high-tech, wasn’t connected to it in the least.”</p> \n<p>What about the exponential increase in the exports of Israeli-made espionage capabilities to every corner of the world? According to Ben-Israel, offensive cyber constitutes a small part of the industry, which is for the most part geared to defense.</p> \n<p>But is it really a negligible component? Gil Reider, director of the homeland security and aerospace division of the Israel Export Institute, admits that it’s difficult to gauge the proportion of the espionage capabilities within the overall cyber market.</p> \n<p>“These days, everyone who served in 8200 comes out of the army with some cool idea, embarks on a career change, and before you know it there’s a startup and a new product,” Reider says, referring to the difficulty of quantifying the export volume, adding, “Governmental regulation in the cyber world is in its very early stages. Where the institute’s work is concerned, in order to track the export of a product, we are aided by organizations connected to customs duties and the business world. But it’s very difficult to measure the cyber market. After all, you don’t export a container of cyber the way you do a container of security equipment.”</p> \n<p>Relocating abroad</p> \n<p>The secrecy of the Defense Ministry, feeble regulations and the Export Institute’s monitoring difficulties all help the industry to move ahead and grow under the radar. We contacted the Central Bureau of Statistics, too, and were told, “It is not possible to provide information about security companies, and we are unable to distinguish between security exports and civilian exports.”</p> \n<p>Attempts to track Israeli exports of espionage devices are also hampered by the fact that in many cases the systems are not actually exported from Israel. Many companies prefer to be registered abroad, or to operate physically overseas, for a variety of reasons: cheap labor, a beneficent taxation policy, greater secrecy, laxer governmental regulation and a desire to camouflage the systems’ Israeli origins, in order to penetrate markets in hostile countries.</p> \n<p>NSO is an example of a particularly complex interlinking of companies. After its purchase by the American equity fund Francisco Partners, it was rebranded as Q Cyber Technologies and became the subsidiary of a company called OSY Technologies, which is registered in Luxembourg. From there the corporate babushka encompasses another pair of companies in Luxembourg, goes on to a firm in the British Virgin Islands and finally to the Cayman Islands.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, NSO’s center remains in Herzliya Pituah. Other companies have moved their center of activity abroad. “You will come across many firms that have research and development centers in Moldova and in Ukraine,” says Roy, an industry veteran. “As I understand it, the reason is, above all, cheap labor. To pay a Ukrainian or Moldovan $2,000 a month to investigate weaknesses in security mechanisms nonstop, is not a lot of money.”</p> \n<p>Some of the cyber firms have remained in Israel but maintain subsidiaries or branches overseas. Two prominent countries on the Israeli cyber map are Cyprus and Bulgaria. The choice of those countries, says a particularly experienced source, derives from low costs, the fact that both are members of the European Union, and also because, despite the European cachet, they are still undeveloped in a way that ensures toothless regulation.</p> \n<p>According to Cyberia’s Guy Mizrahi, “Cyprus is definitely one of the preferred countries. Some countries are unwilling to work with Israeli companies and insist on working with a European firm, so you need an additional front to win bids. In most cases, when you want to sell in the EU, and very definitely in the Gulf states, you will need a non-Israeli front.”</p> \n<p>Avi Rosen is CEO of the Israeli cyber-defense firm Kaymera, and former vice president in charge of development at Cyota, the information security firm founded by Education Minister Naftali Bennett. Rosen: “When you sell in the Gulf, with a license of course, they prefer to see a Bulgarian, on top of which Israelis have a problem due to visa issues. One way or another, there are Israeli products in every country in the world, especially in the security market. It makes no difference whether they like us publicly in the media or not.”</p> \n<p>Cyber expert Yaniv notes another method for disguising the origin of espionage systems, one that is used by Israeli firms at home and abroad. “In many cases products have white names and black names,” he says. “White names have no connection with the product. Pegasus, for example, is already saliently connected to the Israeli firm that developed the program, but you might also encounter software you know rebranded under names that you don’t know. You can’t know how items are presented abroad.”</p> \n<p>Circles Technologies is one of the leading companies operating out of Europe. It was founded in 2011 by Boaz Goldman and the intelligence expert Tal Dilian, who were later joined by Eric Banoun. “Circles,” Guy Mizrahi explains, “created a product that uses the weakness of the cellular network to locate devices. You give me a phone number and I tell you which cellular cell it’s currently connected to and approximately where it’s located.”</p> \n<p>According to Ronen, a former employee of Sigmabit, an Elbit intelligence firm, systems like this intercept information that passes between devices as they are being transmitted. The physical mechanism is less complicated than one might think: The Circles system can be installed on drones, surveillance vehicles and even in a suitcase carried by an agent in the field.</p> \n<p>“Our phones are engineered to connect with the strongest cellular cell in the area near them,” Kaymera’s Avi Rosen explains. “So I set up a mobile cell close to you, which looks and behaves as though it’s the desired cell, so that you will disconnect from the cellular network and connect to mine.” At the same time, the system will deceive the cell operator into thinking that it is the target’s device, and thus basically becomes a hub through which his incoming and outgoing communication flows.</p> \n<p>Another type of system that’s widespread in the Israeli cyber industry focuses on collecting information from the social networks. These are non-invasive systems that are not under Defense Ministry supervision. The systems concentrate open-source information and analyze it in a way that enables conclusions to be drawn from big data and to assist the authorities. Our investigation found that Israeli firms sold systems of this kind to Angola and Malaysia.</p> \n<p>But when all is said and done, the most sought-after espionage means is one that breaches the device. Yaniv: “What is a hack? It’s not the black screens you see in movies, where a hacker keys in something and, poof, he’s in another computer. It’s a programmer – or a researcher, in our parlance – who detects a bug, a kind of weakness, in software. It can be in an internet browser, a chat, email or a system in a particular device. When a weakness like that is detected, it’s possible to exploit it in order to change the system’s behavior. For example, I might detect a weakness in a chat program that will allow me to enter the computer of the person who’s talking to me and send his files to me.”</p> \n<p>The big cyber firms employ researchers like Yaniv who spend their days looking for cracks in the code lines of cellular infrastructures, internet infrastructures, computers, telephones, operating systems, apps and software programs. “Naturally, the demand is for ‘exploits’ of weaknesses in very widespread platforms, such as Apple devices,” Yaniv observes.</p> \n<p>Large firms, he adds, maintain a few weaknesses of these kinds on the shelf, ahead of the day when they will close the breach they are now using. “One of the advantages of NSO is that, according to reports, it has the ability to exploit weaknesses without sending a link to the target. That’s known as zero click. It’s the best weakness, because I need zero interaction with you. It’s something I send to your phone and, poof, I’m inside.”</p> \n<p>A case in point, Yaniv says, is the iPhone. “The phone is connected to Apple servers. An espionage program can impersonate an application you’ve downloaded to your phone that sends push notifications via Apple’s servers. If the impersonating program sends a push notification and Apple doesn’t know that a weakness was exploited and that it’s not the app, it transmits the espionage program to the device. Still, that’s rare. Generally you need human engineering, to search for ways to interest you on the social networks. With that information [about our target], I can use a fictitious character and make the target press on a link that’s been sent.”</p> \n<p>How rare is it for a researcher to detect a weakness in one of the systems? According to Yaniv, detecting a weakness that no one is familiar with is valuable. “I once found a thing like that,” he says. “It’s a discovery that’s worth millions of dollars.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, the prices of intelligence products can be astronomical. That’s the background to the high salaries that are paid in the cyber world.</p> \n<p>“When I was job hunting, I received an offer from one of the Israeli offensive cyber firms located in Cyprus,” Yaniv relates. “They were talking wild amounts, like tens of thousands of dollars a month. A weakness researcher in Israel can make 50,000 shekels [$13,775] a month. I make 36,000. The Cyprus offer was almost four times as much. I passed it up, because I wanted to stay close to family and friends. The most generous offer I rejected was to teach cyber in Singapore. They offered absolutely crazy amounts – hundreds of thousands of shekels a month. You don’t find salaries like this in any field until you come to offensive cyber.”</p> \n<p>Hacker and antivirus</p> \n<p>“Everyone needs defense, everyone wants offense,” says Avi Rosen from Kaymera. “It’s a matter of timing, of long-term experience. This is a relatively young industry, and it takes time for these things to spread.”</p> \n<p>The demand for both defense and offense has led to a widespread phenomenon in the Israeli cyber industry: the sale of espionage capabilities alongside security products. The phenomenon can be likened to a group of hackers who develop malware and afterward sell the antivirus, or to physicians who spread epidemics and then sell the vaccination. Though in some fields this is prohibited practice, in the security world it’s common and widely accepted.</p> \n<p>“Today people want a comprehensive solution, not a product,” says Roy, speaking from experience. “On the one hand, the clients are told, ‘Come and see the offensive systems we have and you’ll understand what we can do with them.’ On the other hand, they sell the clients systems to defend against those very attacks.”</p> \n<p>The example of Kaymera, the cyber defense firm whose genesis lies in the offense-oriented NSO, isn’t the only example of this duality. Still, there are probably not many experts who can testify to the phenomenon better than Rosen. Asked in the past about Kaymera’s origins, he replied, “NSO started to sell its products, and suddenly a strong need for defensive tools emerged. Everyone who saw what NSO can do said, ‘Hold on, this is an interesting story, but how do I protect myself against similar things?’”</p> \n<p>Rosen relates that “NSO initially thought about how to create a product like this, because the need arose from the clients, but they quickly realized that it would need to be something separate. So they drew me in and we built this thing from scratch. We raised money and set up a separate company. I am not privy to what goes on in NSO.”</p> \n<p>Although NSO founders Lavie and Hulio don’t invest in Kaymera, they are on its board of directors, as Rosen himself attests. Asked about the connection between the firms, he admits that indeed, “It’s of great value. The proximity is important to us – thanks to it, we are exposed to all kinds of things in the offensive world.”</p> \n<p>“The argument that NSO’s success nourishes Kaymera’s success is correct and logical,” said Guy Mizrahi, from Cyberia. “The truth is that defending and attacking call for very similar capabilities.”</p> \n<p>Kaymera is not the only example. Elbit, too, maintains an offensive cyber company that disseminates intrusive espionage means, and along with it a security company that provides cyber defense. Thus, within the same ecosystem that enjoys Israeli government patronage, a two-headed industry has sprung up: One wreaks havoc, the other provides immunization.</p> \n<p>Supervising the supervisor</p> \n<p>Attorney Itay Mack is devoting his life to uncovering information about Israel’s security exports. Commerce in weapons is inherently not fully transparent, but according to Mack the level of secrecy in Israel and the absence of a public debate are exceptional. “In the United States relatively open discussions are held by Congress about decisions to arm all kinds of juntas and dictatorships,” Mack notes. “There is nothing like that here.”</p> \n<p>According to Mack, “Documents in the State Archives show that from the very day of its establishment, Israel grasped the diplomatic clout of weapons as a means to forge alliances. You can see that in connection with countries on the Mideast periphery, such as Ethiopia and Turkey. The thing is that, under Netanyahu, security exports have become a cynical tool. You see many transactions that have no security-strategic value. We have moved from Ben-Gurion’s ‘alliance of the periphery’ to Netanyahu’s Micronesia alliance” – referring to security exports to small countries whose sole purpose is to gain votes for Israel at the United Nations.”</p> \n<p>Edin Omanovic, from Privacy International, doesn’t rely on governmental supervision. “Every country can buy a certain technological tool and pass it on to some government agency. So every country that buys this equipment needs an end-user certificate, stating that the buyer won’t pass it to somebody else and that they’ll only use it for specific purposes, but enforcing that is really difficult. It’s basically relying on their&nbsp;word. In Britain, public campaigns at least made them publicize the export permits.”</p> \n<p>Mack is concerned about the absence of supervision over the supervision. “How many people make the decisions about security exports? Very few,” he says. “If you ask members of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, they say that they have never discussed exports to specific countries [in their deliberations], only regulations. So who takes part in the discussions about specific exports? Personnel from the [Defense Ministry’s] supervisory unit, a few other senior people, and in sensitive cases the decision is apparently simply made by Netanyahu.”</p> \n<p>A discussion that took place in June 2017 provides a clear example of the impotence of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. The participants were the committee chairman, MK Avi Dichter (Likud), Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry officials, representatives of the military industries, and a pair of guests, MKs Yehuda Glick (Likud) and Tamar Zandberg (Meretz). The subject was exemptions from marketing permits, which would benefit the cyber industry in particular. In 2016, 1,200 marketing and export permits were issued for 73 cyber products that are subject to supervision, though only 16 of them are in the classified category.</p> \n<p>The following excerpt from the transcription of the deliberations exemplifies the Knesset’s weakness in supervising the Defense Ministry:</p> \n<p>Zandberg: “Is there a policy by which you transmit an opinion not to export because [the product] is used in crimes against civilians, but your recommendation is not accepted?”</p> \n<p>Director of the department for export supervision in the Foreign Ministry, Eliaz Luf: “No, that can’t happen.”</p> \n<p>Zandberg: “In other words, the Foreign Ministry of Israel authorized exports to Burma and South Sudan?”</p> \n<p>Luf: “I can’t answer that question.”</p> \n<p>Glick: “Why not?”</p> \n<p>Zandberg: “I prefer to think that you recommended against [doing so], and perhaps the Defense Ministry gave the authorization due to other considerations.”</p> \n<p>Rachel Chen, director of the Defense Export Control Agency in the Defense Ministry: “I want to reply that even if the Foreign Ministry does not pass on a recommendation to the Defense Ministry, I will still not authorize products that are liable to harm human rights, period.”</p> \n<p>Glick: “But there is something here that we aren’t able to understand. If at the moment and in practice these countries have weapons, does that mean that you authorized it?”</p> \n<p>Chen: “I do not intend to give answers here about specific countries.”</p> \n<p>The rest of the meeting was unfruitful. Some months later, MK Zandberg told Haaretz that the most urgent issue for her was to uncover the list of countries to which Israel sells its security products. Data supplied to the Knesset’s State Control Committee in 2014 indicate that the list comprises 130 countries.</p> \n<p>MK Glick also says that he was unable to get a copy of the list, despite his efforts. “In Israel, everything is placed under the security rubric and you automatically get an impenetrable protective barrier,” he says. “Instead of being a light unto the nations, the Jewish state is circulating weapons that are used in crimes against humanity, and it makes no difference whether it’s a rifle by the force of which a woman was raped by soldiers, or a digital system used for surveillance.”</p> \n<p>Yaniv, the industry person who was of great help in the investigation, changed his tone in his last conversation with Haaretz. “Until last week I was certain that the Defense Exports Control Agency is doing its job properly, and I had no second thoughts about it,” he said. “After checking it out with colleagues, I discovered that supervision is awful. I had no idea that things were conducted like this, that there’s such a gap. I thought that they were in the guts of things, that they restrict usage and sales. It really jolted me.”</p> \n<p>Tomer, the instructor for Verint products, mocks the supervision efforts and laughs when asked if there’s a protocol in the event that they encounter a violation of the terms of use. “Most of the people who worked with me in the company and carried out the training didn’t talk about this subject. It feels like guys who came back from a war. Everyone knows what it means to go to those countries, but no one says what they do when they see problematic things.”</p> \n<p>Roy, who held key positions in Cyberbit and other companies, says that nothing surprises him any longer. He remembers reports revealing abuse of Israeli cyber products in countries of the former Soviet Union, but where the sales continued afterward as though nothing had happened. He himself served as an emissary in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, when it was already clear what use the authorities there were making of the systems. “To say that I relied on our clients?” he asks, and immediately answers, “I don’t trust anyone. That’s why I’m no longer in that field.”</p> \n<p>Responses: ‘International standards’</p> \n<p>From the Defense Ministry: “The Defense Exports Control Agency operates under the aegis of the Supervision Law to safeguard Israel’s strategic interests. The supervision is carried out according to [international] conventions and is applied in the light of international standards. The supervision policy is examined frequently in accordance with diverse considerations, including considerations of upholding human rights. The Foreign Ministry, which also attaches great importance to human rights, takes part in the decision-making process.”</p> \n<p>From NSO: “The company develops products that are sold solely to officially authorized government bodies, for the exclusive purpose of investigation and prevention of crime and terrorism, and all subject to the law. The company’s products have helped save thousands of lives, including [by] the prevention of suicide attacks, the arrest and conviction of heads of drug cartels, the investigation of complicated crimes and the return of kidnapped children to their parents. The company’s ethics committee is an independent body that includes external experts who have the power to annul contracts in case of improper usage.</p> \n<p>“We investigate every allegation about improper use of the system, but in light of contractual restrictions we cannot refer to specific clients. A 2014 case that is being heard in a suit against us has nothing to do with the company. We do not operate the systems for the clients, but only develop the products. In the case of a contract violation, the company acts accordingly vis-&agrave;-vis its clients, including cancellation of contracts. Any attempt to present training as involvement in the system’s operation is groundless.”</p> \n<p>Elbit: “The company operates according to the law and in accordance with the rules of the defense establishment.”</p> \n<p>Nice: “The company sold its security business a few years ago. Nice today has no activity, products or personnel dealing with these spheres.”</p> \n<p>Verint did not respond. Every attempt to get a response to findings about the firm went unanswered, as did a request to the company’s CEO.</p> \n<p>Circles Technologies also did not provide a response.</p> \n<p>Contact the authors at surveillance@haaretz.co.il</p>",

        "text":["<p>Breaking the Silence director spoke Sunday morning with high school students in Tel Aviv for the first time since a law seen as targeting the organization passed in July, prohibiting lectures and activities organized by groups in favor of legal actions abroad against IDF soldiers.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Avner Gvaryahu, the organization's executive director, spoke at Tichonet High School in Tel Aviv part of an event held by the school to mark the memorial day for assassinated prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. Twenty organizations were invited to speak with the students, including Zochrot, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, the Crisis Center for Victims of Sexual Assault, the Committee Against Torture, as well as an activist for public housing and an activist from the Jewish Voice website that is associated with settlers from Yitzhar.</p> \n<p>The law, which received the backing of Education Minister Naftali Bennett, was perceived to be targeting the Israeli non-profit organization Breaking the Silence, which seeks to provide testimonies by Israeli veterans who served in volatile areas such as the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. It aims at clamping down on organizations critical of the Israel Defense Forces.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Defend Breaking the Silence | Editorial</p> \n<p>Breaking the Silence claims the law does not apply to them. “Odd as it may sound, the ‘Breaking the Silence Law’ does not apply to us at all. We do not promote refusal to serve, we only provide soldiers’ testimonies. And we do not call for soldiers to be tried in international forums or anywhere else. If Education Minister Bennett wants to punish the school administration for inviting us, he’ll have to prove that the law was violated. There are other principals who want to invite us to their schools but they’re afraid of the education minister’s bullying. Now we hope they’ll see that it’s possible,” the organization's spokesman Dean Issacharoff said Sunday.</p> \n<p>Dozens of students chose to attend the talk at Tichonet, according to Breaking the Silence. In 2016, Tichonet principal Ram Cohen invited members of the organization to the school despite a directive from the Education Ministry prohibiting principals from inviting “controversial” organizations. Cohen said at the time that he invited the organization “because there is an effort now to limit schools’ space for action and to limit thinking and expression within the schools.”</p> \n<p>Attorney Michael Sfard, the legal adviser to Breaking the Silence, said: “Ironically, the so-called Breaking the Silence Law has nothing to do with the organizations, as this organizations does not call for refusal to serve nor does it seek to have soldiers tried in international forums - the conditions that the law stipulates for banning entry to schools. Once again Bennett is revealed as someone who invents demons and then chases after them and as someone hitching a ride on the backs of the soldiers who are exposing the daily reality of the occupation, in order to avoid confronting their testimony.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The last few weeks have seen a flurry of apparent breakthroughs in Israel’s foreign relations with the Arab world. A week ago, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Oman, an Arab monarchy with which Israel lacks formal diplomatic ties.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Netanyahu's Next Stop on Gulf Tour Emerges: Bahrain</p> \n<p>The following weekend, Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev was present at an international judoka tournament in Abu Dhabi where Hatikvah, the Israeli national anthem, was played for Israeli medal winners, a sharp departure from the Egyptian judoka who&nbsp;snubbed the offer of a handshake by his Israeli completitor in 2016.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Days after, Emirati officials accompanied Regev on a tour of their capital’s Grand Mosque, although the UAE, like 29 other Arab and Muslim states, does not recognize Israel. Minister of Communications Minister Ayoub Kara was also in the Emirates, although his trip was for a meeting of a United Nations agency.</p> \n<p>Some have leveraged these developments to question the axiom that Israel’s international standing will suffer as the country drifts further and further away from a negotiated two-state solution. The Mitvim Institute’s recently released 2018 Israeli Foreign Policy Index showed that 49 percent of Israelis think a breakthrough with the Arab states is achievable even absent movement on the Palestinian track. On Wednesday, U.S. envoy Jason Greenblatt also praised this apparent progress.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Such sentiment – that Israel's relations with the Arab world are flourishing, rather than being diminished, by the lack of progress in resolving the conflict with the Palestinians - seems to gain traction whenever a Gulf Arab state makes even the most basic gesture toward the Jewish state.</p> \n<p>But it was never quite so simple.</p> \n<p>Israel’s position in the world is stronger today than it was for most of the country’s history. Netanyahu deserves some credit for this, but the groundwork for this shift occurred over two decades ago.</p> \n<p>The Arab League boycotted Israel from the country’s founding, reaffirming its intransigent stance under the 1967 Khartoum Declaration. The Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites (except Romania) severed relations with Israel following the Six Day War, and 25 African states broke ties after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Spain and Portugal did not recognize Israel until 1986 and 1977 respectively, after the collapse of fascist governments in both countries. Major powers like India and the People’s Republic of China did not establish official relations with Israel until the 1990s.</p> \n<p>The Arab-Israeli conflict, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict especially, only have an immediate impact on a small number of countries. Israel’s relative isolation during its formative years was reflective of Arab state and Soviet influence, as well as communist, anti-colonial, and non-aligned political commitments in developing nations.</p> \n<p>The end of the Cold War rendered these alliances obsolete, opening Israel to the world. This wasn’t the work of any one Israeli leader, but a side-effect of broader geopolitical events.</p> \n<p>But the Arab and Muslim countries remained obstinate. Their quarrel with Israel was direct, not an extension of the East-West superpower struggle. Ultimately, Israel’s victory in the 1967 war removed the Jewish state’s total erasure as an objective for all but the most radical regimes, namely Syria and Iraq (later joined by Iran after the Islamic Revolution).</p> \n<p>But it also opened up the question of Palestinian statehood on the newly occupied territories, especially after the 1980s: the catastrophe in Lebanon, the First Intifada, and the Palestinian declaration of independence. Progress on the Palestinian front would yield progress in regional integration. On the flipside, stagnation would keep the Arab world at arms length, and Israel’s ties with Egypt and Jordan would never evolve past a cold peace.</p> \n<p>The heady days of the Oslo peace process saw officials in the Labor governments of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres as guests in many countries that lacked relations with Israel. Like Netanyahu, Peres and Rabin visited Oman, but not just Oman. Morocco and Indonesia also welcomed the Israeli leader. Bahrain hosted an Israeli minister in 1994. As prime minister, Peres also traveled to Qatar.</p> \n<p>It’s useful to juxtapose the circumstances informing Israeli foreign policy advancements in the 1990s versus today’s developments. Rabin and Peres were riding the wave of optimism surrounding a reinvigorated peace process. That diplomacy yielded real, lasting improvements. For instance, in 1994, Saudi Arabia and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council stopped enforcing most elements of the Arab League boycott and ceased urging other countries to do the same.</p> \n<p>Thus, in a way, Netanyahu is instrumentalizing the products of a peace process he vehemently opposed two decades ago, and has partly helped upend today.</p> \n<p>But Netanyahu has also benefited from regional tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia and its allies. While the confrontation with Iran takes clear precedence over the Palestinian question in terms of immediate impact and importance to the Arab states, it will not last forever and so its benefits for Israel will likely prove ephemeral. A relationship that is a function of present circumstances is the basis for a tactical arrangement, not a lasting peace.</p> \n<p>Recall that before Israel destroyed Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor, Iran attempted to do the same thing. Israel coordinated its attack on their shared enemy with Tehran, and even continued arms sales to the Islamic Republic into the 1980s - well after the fall of the Shah. Where are the fruits of that alliance today?</p> \n<p>A common enemy can produce some meetings and covert collaboration, but only a final status agreement with the Palestinians can inspire normalization. Jordan’s recent termination of leases on two small territories to Israel under the 1994 peace treaty, a concession to the country’s massive anti-Israel movement, is evidence of that.</p> \n<p>Moreover, minor steps taken with hereditary dictatorships will do nothing to address ambivalence toward Israel among Western audiences or popular boycott campaigns. While BDS has little tangible impact on Israel, anti-Israel campaigns understandably perturb Israelis who crave normalcy.  Despite the real gains made by Israel’s government over the weekend and in previous years, Israel’s position vis-a-vis the Arab world is anything but normal. Playing a country’s national anthem at an international sporting event signals the most basic level of decorum, opening a trade office is pretty standard fare, and leaders exchange visits regularly.</p> \n<p>Indeed, some of what is being touted as progress with the Arab states has little to do with the Arabs themselves. Ayoub Kara’s visit to the Emirates, as well as this week’s visit to Oman by Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz, are for conferences organized by multilateral institutions, not their host governments. And Regev’s time in the UAE came after the International Judo Federation threatened to cancel last weekend’s competition if it did not treat all participating countries equally, a hazard which would undermine the Emirates’ aspiration to be a global cultural hub.</p> \n<p>That right-wing Israeli leaders and their supporters now fawn over the Gulf states for undertaking relatively simple steps only underscores the enormous room for growth that still remains. Israeli leaders could exploit the situation with Iran and recent minor openings to build Arab state support on the back of progress toward a comprehensive agreement with the Palestinians. But absent momentum with the Palestinians, sustainable growth with the rest of the Arab world will remain elusive.</p> \n<p>Evan Gottesman is the Associate Director of Policy and Communications at Israel Policy Forum.

The Shin Bet said that Na'alwa was armed when forces arrived to the scene.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to the Shin Bet, he was found as part of a large-scale intelligence operation. The arrest and interrogation of several suspects had helped locate&nbsp;Na'alwa and also revealed that he had planned to carry out another attack.</p> \n<p>Security forces surrounded a building in which he was located, around 1:30 A.M., according to Palestinian reports.</p> \n<p>The family's matriarch said two of her sons were also arrested during the operation, one of whom is a former convict. She added she did not know whether Na'alwa had been hiding in the building for some time, or arrived during the night.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to Palestinians' testimonies, the force entered the building with heavy fire and shot him dead at the scene.</p> \n<p>Suspect in drive-by shooting near settlement killed</p> \n<p>This comes hours after a separate operation to&nbsp;find the assailants of&nbsp;Sunday's drive-by shooting&nbsp;near an Israeli settlement during which&nbsp;Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian man&nbsp;north of the West Bank city of Ramallah.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israeli forces surrounded a house near the Palestinian Authority's headquarters, which is close to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' home, in the search for the drive-by shooter.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Palestinian reports identified the man killed in the earlier operation as Salah Omar Barghouti, 29, from the village of Kobar. Salah is the son of Omar Barghouti, a senior Hamas member in the West Bank who is known as a veteran prisoner.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hamas responded to Thursday morning's events, saying: &quot;The fire of resistance in the West Bank will not die until the occupation is lifted. The death of the two soldiers proves that the option of the Palestinian people is defiance. The West Bank will continue to support the forces of resistance and the blood of Na'alwa and Barghouti has not been spilled in vain. Hamas and the other resistance factions will continue to support activity to avenge their death.&quot;</p> \n<p>Islamic Jihad released a similar statement, calling on Palestinians to escalate confrontations.</p> \n<p>Earlier Wednesday,&nbsp;the baby, who was delivered three days earlier, died after his mother was&nbsp;seriously wounded in the drive-by shooting attack.</p> \n<p>Immediatly following the October Barkan&nbsp;attack, the IDF, together with the Shin Bet and the Border Police, raided the village of the assailant and arrested Na'alwa's brother and sister.</p> \n<p>According to Palestinian sources, neither the brother nor the sister had any information related to the attack, but the arrests were served to pressure Na'alwa to reveal himself.</p> \n<p>Before carrying out the attack, Na'alwa&nbsp;gave a coworker a note in which he said he planned to commit suicide and praised late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The note led&nbsp;security forces to conclude&nbsp;that the shooting was a terror attack.</p> \n<p>Employees in the factory said they did not know Na'alwa very well, who had worked there for four months. He was one of 250 Palestinian workers who were employed by&nbsp;the factory.&nbsp;According to his coworkers, he had not come to work over the past couple of weeks due to an illness.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>The price of everything goes up with demand, and real estate is no exception. Property prices in Tel Aviv have gone up because people want to live there, businesses want to open there and company owners believe it’s a great location. The result is that only rich people can afford to buy an apartment there. The heart of the city has the highest prices in Israel for homes, offices and commercial space.</p> \n<p>Prices in the heart of Tel Aviv rose because of enormous public spending on projects such as the renewal of Rothschild Boulevard and the construction of plazas at either end. Skyscrapers went up with luxury apartments that attract wealthy buyers. Every old Tel Aviv neighborhood has gentrified. It’s the situation in every thriving city worldwide — the more attractive the area, the more in demand and expensive its real estate becomes.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Tel Aviv ranked the 9th most expensive city in the world - New York City is 13th</p> \n<p>However, cities from Manhattan and San Francisco to London and Paris are not only for the rich. Their residents also include undocumented immigrants. The big city offers work opportunities and basic accommodations that they can afford.</p> \n<p>The big, bustling city is also the home of those who are prepared to live in less than ideal conditions to enjoy the opportunity of just being in these places. They include the young and old who prefer constant company over privacy and quiet, families willing to squeeze into a small space to enjoy a wealth of public services.</p> \n<p>Social activists say Tel Aviv’s luxury towers symbolize alienation. However, if they hadn’t built those towers, it would be impossible to improve the atmosphere all around town and to fund quality services for all residents. It takes a lot of money to fix Dizengoff Square, Rothschild Boulevard and the pedestrian mall, to operate the bicycle- and car-sharing systems, to tend to gardens and ecological pools, to install fashionable street furniture, to place comfortable chairs on the squares and beanbag chairs on the boulevards and to offer residents umbrellas and tanning beds for almost free on the beach.</p> \n<p>Municipal taxes cannot cover these ventures because they fund the city’s everyday operations. The only funding source for developing public infrastructure is real estate tax revenue at the point of sale. The more expensive the property, the more the city can invest in the entire town.</p> \n<p>This gentrification process was first identified a little more than 50 years ago in places where rich populations began moving into older areas that had suffered from neglect and were left with mainly poor residents. The result is a change of character in the trade and services that adapt themselves to the preferences of the new residents, improving the sense of safety on the streets and, of course, higher real estate prices.</p> \n<p>The alternative: neglect</p> \n<p>Gentrification often has a negative connotation, pushing poor people out of their homes. It is partly true. Many of them who are poor, usually longtime residents, enjoy the rise on the value of the properties they live in, sell them at a profit and buy a bigger home elsewhere, or another property for themselves or their children.</p> \n<p>True, the new home pushes them from their familiar surroundings, and they have less access to services than they were used to. Longtime residents usually have the option of staying, but most prefer to sell and move. It also happens because they are less comfortable personally and culturally with the more expensive vicinity. But selling and moving is a necessary change, not a forced eviction.</p> \n<p>One could of course decide not to fix roads and lampposts, not to add parks, not to tend to the buildings and let the city sink in neglect, as happened in central Tel Aviv until a few decades ago. The prices will fall for sure. There are examples of neglected neighborhoods with weak populations, but is that preferable?</p> \n<p>Alternative, affordable housing should be created. In a good city, the alternative is created by having apartments above the street-level shops. Their location above a noisy area full of vibrant traffic, particularly buses, makes them much less attractive residences. Most people don’t want to live above a bus stop that has buses stopping every five minutes, a restaurant from which wafts the smell of frying oil or a pub that’s open late into the night. A good city like Tel Aviv also has such apartments, and they are sold and rented out for less than the ones in the quiet streets behind them.</p> \n<p>While all owners of a commercial property or apartment in Tel Aviv have seen their value of their properties shoot up over the past 20 years, the more neglected the area was, the higher the potential was for gain. Owners in the wealthy northern neighborhoods saw their property values rise but at a lower rate than those in poorer areas like Jaffa, Florentin, Neveh Sha’anan and Shapira.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Ariel, WEST BANK — Deep in the heart of the Israeli-occupied territories, this settlement of nearly 20,000 residents is enjoying a building boom like never before. And the signs of it are everywhere.</p> \n<p>At the eastern edge of Ariel, construction of a new hospital, complete with its own medical school, has entered the final stages. Across from the huge complex, a new shopping center has started to sprout up. On a hill that overlooks the main population center, ground is about to be broken on a new neighborhood that will include 839 housing units — the largest project of its kind in many years. And several kilometers to the west, at the Ariel industrial zone, new factory construction, following a period of stagnation, is under way.</p> \n<p>The locals have no doubt who deserves all the credit. “During the Obama years, everything here was frozen,” notes Daniel Kohavi, one of the original Ariel settlers. “But thanks to Donald Trump, we’re starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.”</p> \n<p>Previous U.S. administrations viewed settlement activity as a major obstacle to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Not this one, though.</p> \n<p>Which explains why Mayor Eli Shaviro is feeling far more emboldened these days to discuss future plans. “In 15 years from now, Ariel will be a city with 100,000 residents,” he predicts, “three times as many factories, a huge university with a medical school, and many many young families looking for good education, employment opportunities and quality of life.”</p> \n<p>Until now, all the construction in Ariel has been concentrated on a swath of land that filled up just one quarter of the total area under the municipality’s jurisdiction. The new neighborhood of 839 housing units will for the first time in the city’s history be built outside it — as good a sign as any that a new era has indeed dawned.</p> \n<p>It is one of the biggest settlements in the West Bank, fourth in population size, to be exact. And it is one of the most remote settlements — located almost 20 kilometers beyond the 1967 border — but not the most remote. Still, among the big settlements, it is the most remote, and among remote settlements, it is the biggest. Which is why Ariel, often likened to a finger on the map, has long been a key obstacle to any future peace accord.</p> \n<p>It was 10 years ago that the last serious round of peace talks was held between Israeli and Palestinian leaders. At the time, Israel presented a map for a two-state solution that included Ariel on its side of the border. The Palestinians rejected the notion, saying it violated two of their core principles for any agreement based on land swaps: They would only consider handing over settlements situated near the 1967 border, and even then, only settlements that did not interfere with the territorial contiguity of the future Palestinian state.</p> \n<p>Aware of such problematics, the Geneva Accord of 2003, a civil society effort of prominent Israelis and Palestinians, stipulated that Ariel should remain on the Palestinian side of the border.</p> \n<p>As the city celebrates its 40th anniversary this month, the consensus here is that this isn’t going to happen — certainly not anytime soon. “There’s absolutely no chance,” proclaims Shaviro. “Any talk about such a possibility is completely irrelevant.”</p> \n<p>For years, notes Kohavi, the settlers of Ariel lived under the threat that one day, they might be forced to leave. “If in exchange, Israel would have signed a sustainable peace agreement, then I believe that most people here would have agreed to go without a fight,” says the 71-year-old former gym teacher. “We are a city of law-abiding citizens, after all. But today, it seems to me there is a consensus in Israel that Ariel is not going to be returned.”</p> \n<p>Kohavi, his wife and three children were among the original 40 families that moved here in August 1978. “We were told that a new agricultural settlement was being built in Samaria and that each family would receive 4 dunams (1 acre) of land,” he recounts. “What awaited us upon our a arrival was a tiny box of a house, 46 square meters in area (495 square feet), with an itsy-bitsy garden outside. But who complained?”</p> \n<p>What prompted him and his family to leave their comfortable home in the seaside town of Herzliya for an isolated settlement without any running water or electricity? “Good old Zionism,” responds Kohavi.</p> \n<p>The original group of Ariel settlers was made up largely of employees of the country’s two large military companies — Israel Aircraft Industries (now Israel Aerospace Industries) and Israel Military Industries. Kohavi didn’t work for either, but had heard about the plan to form a new community in the Samarian hills from his father-in-law, then a union leader at Israel Military Industries. “I loved the idea,” he recalls.</p> \n<p>Secular settlement</p> \n<p>Among the first Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Ariel took root soon after the right-wing Likud assumed power in Israel. The document that paved the way for its establishment, however, as locals like to point out, was signed a few years earlier by Shimon Peres, when he served as defense minister in the Labor government.</p> \n<p>The early pioneers, like Kohavi, had no connection to Gush Emunim, an Orthodox, right-wing movement considered the driving force behind the settlement enterprise. Rather, they were secular Israelis, often supporters of the Labor party.</p> \n<p>“We didn’t even have a synagogue here at first,” recalls Kohavi over coffee in his spacious three-story home — a dramatic upgrade from his humble beginnings here.</p> \n<p>The next wave of settlers he describes, in rather derogatory terms, as “Zionist by default.” These were Israelis, he explains, who were less driven by idealism and more by the possibility of obtaining relatively cheap housing fairly close to the center of the country. They were followed in the 1990s by a very large group of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who now account for close to 40 percent of the population. About 10 years ago, Ariel received its first big infusion of religious residents when a contingent of settlers evacuated from Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip moved in.</p> \n<p>You can uproot a settlement, not a city</p> \n<p>During the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, which erupted in the early 2000s, the population of Ariel hardly grew at all. Excluding natural population growth, Central Bureau of Statistics figures show that during that period, when traveling on West Bank roads was often perilous, more people moved out of the settlement than moved in. The population only started to rebound about five years ago.</p> \n<p>In 1998, on its 20th anniversary, Ariel was officially recognized as a city, and in 2012, following years of controversy, the college established within its perimeters several decades earlier was finally accredited as a university.</p> \n<p>Shabtay Bendet, an anti-occupation activist, notes that these were two hard-won achievements for Ron Nachman, one of the original founders of Ariel who served as mayor from 1985 until his death in 2013.</p> \n<p>“Nachman invested huge efforts in normalizing this settlement and making it seem part of Israel proper,” notes Bendet, head of the Settlement Watch team at Peace Now, an organization that has long advocated for a two-state solution. “Most places in Israel don’t get recognized as cities unless they have 20,000 to 30,000 residents. Ariel became a city when it had just 11,000 residents. Why was this so significant? Because maybe you can uproot a settlement, but you don’t uproot a city. The same holds true for the university. Why was it so important for him to get it accredited? Because when a place has a university, that means it’s established — no pulling it out of the ground.”</p> \n<p>Just how badly Ariel wants the rest of the world to ignore its problematic location is evident in its municipal website. The English version describes its geographical setting as “the heart of Israel,” the Hebrew version taking it a step further, using the term “the heart of the State of Israel.” Since Israel never annexed the West Bank, that is a clear misrepresentation of the facts. Indeed, even the current Israeli government, the most right-wing in the nation’s history, does not claim that Ariel or any of the other West Bank settlements are part of the State of Israel.</p> \n<p>Controversial location</p> \n<p>Of the 45 plants located in the Ariel industrial zone, about a five-minute drive out of the city, Achva is among the largest. A manufacturer of halva, tahini and sweets, this privately owned company, with an annual turnover of about 200 million shekels ($54 million), exports to the United States, Canada and South Africa. To enable further growth, it is now building a second factory, just across the way from its existing premises. Of its 235 workers, about half are Palestinians from nearby villages.</p> \n<p>Originally established in Tel Aviv almost 90 years ago, Achva relocated to the West Bank in 1997. “We moved here because it was the cheapest place close to the center of the country,” says Yaakov Malach, the CEO and owner.</p> \n<p>Responding to international calls to boycott products made in the Israeli settlements, a growing number of companies operating in the West Bank have moved back inside the country’s internationally recognized borders in recent years. Malach says he has no plans to relocate again and describes the boycott movement as “more of a nuisance than anything else.”</p> \n<p>“The only thing customers really care about,” he says, “is whether something tastes good or not.”</p> \n<p>Still, he does not flaunt his controversial location. The timeline of key events published on Achva’s website suffices with the following description of its 1997 relocation: “The factory, which has been based in south Tel Aviv and Yehud, moves its facilities to a spacious building that brings all the production lines under one roof.” There is no mention of where that spacious building is. The mailing address is listed as Nes Ziona, a town in central Israel.</p> \n<p>Yuri Smirin, Achva’s production manager, left St. Petersburg in 1990 and has been living in Ariel ever since. Asked if he was worried that the city where he lives and works could one day be handed over to the Palestinians as part of a peace deal, he responds: “Not at all. This area has no future without the existence of Ariel.”</p> \n<p>Guiding visitors on a tour of the plant, he points to a group of Palestinian workers huddled around a machine. “Just look at them,” he says. “You see how they’re all smiling.”</p> \n<p>Actually, they’re not.</p> \n<p>Bendet is a relatively recent convert to the Israeli anti-occupation movement. In his previous life, as a religious settler, he spent quite a few years living not far from here in the small settlement of Rehelim. That gives him some firsthand knowledge of how Ariel impacts the region.</p> \n<p>“By creating a buffer between the northern and southern parts of the West Bank,” he says, “it makes any future Palestinian state unviable. But besides that, it is also causing damage in the present because its continued expansion impinges on the ability of the surrounding Palestinian villages to develop and grow.”</p> \n<p>But won’t the Palestinians in the area at least benefit from the new medical center, which officials in Ariel insist will serve the population of the entire region? Bendet laughs at the suggestion. “For Palestinians to enter Ariel, they need a special permit from the Israeli Civil Administration,” he notes. “Do you think that someone in the throes of a heart attack is going to stand in line at the Civil Administration offices to get that permit?”</p>",

This accusation took on a whole new relevance in the wake of the attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday, in which a white nationalist killed 11 congregants during a baby naming ceremony.</p> \n<p>Trump closed his winning 2016 presidential campaign with an ad that many observers slammed as blatantly anti-Semitic. In his first month in office Trump again sparked scandal when the White House left out any mention of Jews while marking Holocaust Remembrance Day. After topping off a campaign littered with dozens of such incidents, the accusations surrounding Trump and anti-Semitism reached a boiling point at his first solo press conference in February 2017, where, responding to a question about recent threats to Jewish centers across the country and rising anti-Semitism, Trump declared, &quot;I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life.&quot;</p> \n<p>The day before that press conference, Trump hosted a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu where he was also pressed to address rising anti-Semitism in America. Trump answered, &quot;As far as people - Jewish people - so many friends, a daughter, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren. I think that you're going to see a lot different United States of America over the next three, four, or eight years. I think a lot of good things are happening, and you're going to see a lot of love. You're going to see a lot of love. OK? Thank you.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;From lynchings to mass shootings: The history of deadly attacks on Jews in America&nbsp;■&nbsp;Opinion:&nbsp;Trump didn’t pull the trigger on Jews in Pittsburgh, but he certainly prepped the shooter</p> \n<p>After Trump responded, Netanyahu came to his aide saying,“I think we can put that to rest,” despite the fact that Trump never used the word “anti-Semitism.” Trump’s daughter Ivanka is a convert to Judaism and married into an Orthodox Jewish family.</p> \n<p>In the campaign ad that Trump released back&nbsp;on November 5th, 2016, four villains are blamed for the problems the everyday American is facing - which Trump promised to fix as apart of his “make America great again” pitch for the presidency. Those villains were Hillary Clinton, George Soros (financier and philanthropist), Janet Yellen (then Fed Chair) and Lloyd Blankfein (Goldman Sachs CEO). Three out of the four are Jewish.</p> \n<p>As Soros and Yellen come onto the screen in the ad, the narrator says, “The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests. They partner with these people who don’t have your good in mind.”</p> \n<p>In August 2017, Trump stunned the nation when he declared that “both sides” were culpable for violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which claimed the life of a counterprotester. A torchlit march that preceded the day of violence featured white supremacists chanting “Jews will not replace us.”</p> \n<p>Trump later clarified his original remarks and openly condemned the white nationalists. However, veteran journalist Bob Woodward wrote in his recent book “Fear,” that Trump felt, &quot;That was the biggest fucking mistake I've made. You never make those concessions. You never apologize. I didn't do anything wrong in the first place. Why look weak?&quot;</p> \n<p>The book put Bob Woodward in the Trump family’s crosshairs and resulted in an additional anti-Semitism scandal for the Trump clan when Eric Trump, the president’s youngest son, said of some of the claims in the book, that &quot;It’ll mean you sell three extra books, you make three extra shekels.&quot; Using the word “shekel” is a long-standing anti-Semitic trope going back to Judas’ betrayal of Jesus in the New Testament.</p> \n<p>Jewish journalist Julia Ioffe’s April 27 profile of Melania Trump in GQ irked the first lady enough that she tweeted criticism of it calling it, “another example of the dishonest media and their disingenuous reporting” and that Ioffe had “provoked” the deluge of anti-Semitic hate online that followed the publication of the profile, including from the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, which urged its followers to “go ahead and send her [Ioffe] a tweet and let her know what you think of her dirty kike trickery.”</p> \n<p>Jews funding immigration</p> \n<p>Last week both Soros and Clinton were sent bombs in the mail by a Trump supporter who targeted almost a dozen Democrats and CNN - the news network Trump often singles out as “fake news” and as an “enemy of the people.”</p> \n<p>Florida congressman Matt Gaetz, who invited a Holocaust denier to this year’s State of the Union address, posted a video on Twitter this month which shows people in Guatemala being handed money. Gaetz, without citing evidence, suggested in the Tweet that Soros was funding a migrant caravan headed towards the U.S. He wrote on Twitter, “BREAKING: Footage in Honduras giving cash 2 women &amp; children 2 join the caravan &amp; storm the US border @ election time. Soros? US-backed NGOs? Time to investigate the source!”</p> \n<p>Trump tweeted the exact same video a day later, writing, “Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?”</p> \n<p>The gunman in Pittsburgh, Robert Bowers, who yelled &quot;All Jews must die&quot; before opening fire, made anti-Semitic comments online and expressed anger at a Jewish group which helped refugees.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bowers wrote on an alt-right social media platform, that “HIAS likes to bring invaders that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics. I’m going in.”</p> \n<p>HIAS is an American nonprofit organization that provides humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees. &nbsp;Another post from Bowers that apparently referred to HIAS read, “Open you Eyes! It’s the filthy evil jews Bringing the Filthy evil Muslims into the Country!!” Bower’s massacre of worshippers is the deadliest attack on a Jewish community in American history and his motive as of now appears to be a white supremacist driven hate of Jews and his belief that the Jewish community aids refugees and immigrants entering the U.S.</p> \n<p>Bower’s summed this up in post he made weeks before the shooting, “There is no #maga as long as there is a kike infestation.”</p> \n<p>Ungrateful</p> \n<p>In December 2015, Trump again waded into anti-Semitic waters when he said in a speech addressing the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC), “You’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money,” adding, “Is there anyone in this room who doesn’t negotiate deals? Probably more than any room I’ve ever spoken.”</p> \n<p>However, despite his claim at the RJC that he is above transactional politics, Trump in September of this year seemed to complain that the U.S. Jewish community was not more grateful after Trump moved the U.S. Embassy, in a ceremony which included Pastor Robert Jeffress who believes “Jews are going to hell,” &nbsp;from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May.</p> \n<p>Opinion: Donald Trump Thinks the Jews Aren't Grateful Enough</p> \n<p>A report from the Jewish People Policy Institute, a Jerusalem-based think tank, in September quoted a White House official who claimed the move should have generated praise from within the Jewish community, but that Trump is treated unfairly.</p> \n<p>“We can take justified criticism, but if Obama had transferred the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, the American Jewish community would have been united in applauding him!” the official said.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month, Mark Mellman, who once ran Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid campaign in 2015, published a poll with the Jewish Electorate Institute that found roughly seventy-five percent of Jewish Americans plan to vote for the Democrats in the midterm elections, with only a quarter voting Republican.</p> \n<p>Additionally, Fifty-six percent polled said they disapprove of the embassy move, while only 44 percent said they approved.</p> \n<p>Growing anti-Semitism</p> \n<p>A new report released Friday by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) found far-right extremists have increased an intimidating wave of anti-Semitic harassment against Jewish journalists, political candidates and others public figures of next month's U.S. midterm elections.</p> \n<p>ADL researchers analyzed more than 7.5 million Twitter messages from Aug. 31 to Sept. 17 and found nearly 30 percent of the accounts repeatedly tweeting derogatory terms about Jews appeared to be automated &quot;bots.&quot;</p> \n<p>The study also found a &quot;surprising&quot; abundance of tweets referencing &quot;QAnon,&quot; a right-wing conspiracy theory that started on an online message board and has been spread by Trump supporters.</p> \n<p>&quot;There are strong anti-Semitic undertones, as followers decry George Soros and the Rothschild family as puppeteers,&quot; researchers wrote.</p> \n<p>Trump, who has been pushing his “America first,” anti-globalist message since announcing his campaign in 2015, took the unprecedented step last Monday of outright declaring, “I am a nationalist.”</p> \n<p>“A globalist is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much. And you know what? We can’t have that,” Trump said at a rally in Houston.</p> \n<p>&quot;You know, they have a word – it’s sort of became old-fashioned – it’s called a nationalist. And I say, really, we’re not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I’m a nationalist, okay? I’m a nationalist. Nationalist. Nothing wrong. Use that word. Use that word.&quot;</p> \n<p>Trump’s rhetoric helped him win in 2016 by whipping up his base and energizing voters. His rallies have become a central feature of his presidency and while he may say he is “the least anti-Semitic” and “least racist person” ever - his rhetoric has reshaped the Republican Party and deeply divided Americans.</p> \n<p>From Virginia to California, the Republican Party has an unprecedented amount of white supremacists and Neo-Nazis on the ballot this year. The GOP has actively worked to both distance and remove some of these candidates off the ballot in some cases, while unhappily accepting them in others.</p> \n<p>In Virginia, Republican Corey Stewart is running for the U.S. Senate as a self-described neo-Confederate, championing a “take back our heritage” platform. In Illinois, Arthur Jones, a candidate for the state’s 3rd Congressional district boasts of his membership in the American Nazi Party. Anti-Semitic GOP candidate, John Fitzgerald, made it through his open primary and will appear on the ballot in California’s 11th Congressional District. Fitzgerald’s campaign has urged to “end the Jewish takeover of America.”</p> \n<p>The Associated Press contributed to this article</p>",

        "text":["<p>Marcello Foa, the controversial new head of Italy’s public broadcasting company, spoke in Israel this week about the dangers of fake news. The right-wing former journalist has struck some in the italian community of Tel Aviv as an unlikely anti-fake news warrior. Among the fake news stories he has been accused of spreading was that Hilary Clinton participated in satanic dinners before the 2016 Presidential elections in the United States.</p> \n<p>Foa, always immaculately dressed in a suit and a tie, has been described by italian and foreign press as holding pro-Russian, anti-immigrant views. A former journalist at former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Il Giornale, he has been criticized for spreading conspiracy theories about the purported dangers of vaccines and for claiming that some gay rights activists are trying to “eradicate the natural sexual identity” of the majority.</p> \n<p>Foa says he’s made some mistakes in the past, but claims his critics have used cherry-picked statements that were taken out of context and distorted. He insists he supports gay rights and does not back anti-vaccine campaigns, but simply looks at all issues with a critical eye. At 55, he is one of the leading voices in the wave of populist sentiment in Italy and introduced Italy’s anti-immigrant deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, to Donald Trump’s former advisor, Steve Bannon.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Steve Bannon's campaign to conquer Europe marks its first victory: Italy | Opinion</p> \n<p>In an interview with Haaretz, Foa was keen to distance himself from the racist and neo-Nazi groups that are often supportive of the populist surge in Europe. “If these groups express support for the current Italian government they are doing so of their own accord,” he says. “I don’t approve of these extremists, I have no sympathy for those movements.” Foa describes himself as a liberal moderate and shrugs off claims he holds extreme views with a laugh.</p> \n<p>Foa, a Catholic, also emphasized that he feels “a cultural and ethical affinity with Israel and Judaism” because he had a Jewish grandfather and because he was mentored as a journalist by Vittorio Dan Segre, an Italian-Israeli writer and diplomat.</p> \n<p>“Every time I come to Israel it feels like rediscovering my roots,” he said.</p> \n<p>Foa recalls with pride an interview he did with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin weeks before his assassination in 1995. “I was struck by how tense Rabin was at the time, worried by the political atmosphere,” he says. “For me Rabin and [Shimon] Peres were model politicians.” Israel’s greatest strength has always been keeping the moral high ground and staying true to ethical principles, but that tendency is fading, Foa notes.</p> \n<p>He doesn’t think it’s fading in Europe, however. He does not see evidence of xenophobia in the rhetoric or actions of European populist leaders today, be it against migrants or Roma people. Foa says that today, people’s suspicions of migrants and minorities “are based on direct social experience.” In contrast, persecutions of Jews and other minorities during World War II “were based on a racist ideology,” he contends.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Italy’s new populist rulers love Putin, hate immigrants and are confused about Israel | Analysis</p> \n<p>He also does not consider current attacks on Jewish-American billionaire George Soros, a favorite target of right-wing leaders in Europe and the U.S., as anti-Semitic.</p> \n<p>Soros has been vilified by President Trump and his supporters. In 2016, Trump’s Presidential campaign presented Soros as a manipulative demonic puppet master of the “globalists.”</p> \n<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has cast Soros – Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor – as a national hate-figure, accusing him of funding those who “support everything that weakens the nation-state” and “the European human rights activism that encourages the refugees” to reach Europe.</p> \n<p>“Had he been attacked as a Jew it would be anti-Semitism, but this is not what happens and I think it is offensive to use anti-Semitism as an alibi to stifle such a debate,” Foa claimed. “Otherwise, in the long run, you are just encouraging and legitimizing anti-Semitism.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;It's not anti-Semitism if you just hate the bad Jews&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>Foa claims Soros has been attacked because of his actions, and corroborates his argument citing a report he claims showed the progressive philanthropist had financed an “enormous number” of European Parliament members, including “the entire delegation from Italy’s center-left Democratic Party.”</p> \n<p>Haaretz, however, could not confirm the existence of such a report. Italy’s Democratic Party spokesman Roberto Cuillo denied the claim and said Foa was probably referring to a similar allegation that was based on a report by a consulting firm that listed members of the European parliament whose positions were deemed close to Soros’ views, and circulated last year in populist and Eurosceptic media.</p> \n<p>But Foa, who wrote in a book that “the debate about fake news aims first of all at silencing free voices that break official narratives,” says he was a victim of a smear campaign to block his appointment as head of Italy’s state broadcaster, RAI, and insists the main problem today lies in the bias of mainstream media. Speaking at a conference at the Italian Cultural Institute of Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Foa outlined the threat fake news pose to democracy.</p> \n<p>The term “fake news” took hold in 2016 after mainstream media in the U.S. reported on the online spread of fabricated stories aimed at helping Donald Trump win the presidency last year. Meanwhile, Trump accused the mainstream media itself of producing fake news.</p> \n<p>The architect of American populism and Trump’s 2016 victory, Steve Bannon, was also the executive chairman of Breitbart news, a prime example of website that has railed against mainstream media. Foa has met Bannon at least twice during his increasingly frequent trips to Europe, where he has been courting populist leaders to unite Europe’s far-right parties.</p> \n<p>Bannon announced the formation of the Brussels-based “The Movement” as an ideological umbrella to promote his project and protect Europe’s so-called Judeo-Christian heritage, a movement that Salvini’s party, the League, has endorsed. Bannon is also known to be sponsoring the launch of political academies for new far-right leaders in both France and Italy.</p> \n<p>Bannon views the Italian far-right League and its coalition government with the Eurosceptic anti-establishment 5 Star Movement as a success story that he would like to emulate for his pan-European project. The League successfully ran on a nationalist platform promising to put “Italians first” that critics called&nbsp;Islamophobic and xenophobic. Since becoming interior minister, the League's Salvini has attempted to block ships that rescue migrants at sea from docking in Italy and has promoted policies that critics have dubbed racist, such as a plan to make a census of Roma people.</p> \n<p>Foa said that while Bannon is a “very intelligent man,” he is too impetuous and prone to lose his temper. “His vision of European matters is patchy and U.S.-centric in the way he analyses social phenomena,” said Foa. “France is no Tennessee and Italy is no Ohio so I don’t know for now what he will be able to achieve in Europe,” he concluded.</p> \n<p>What Foa is referring to is European populists’ efforts to create an “Internazionale Sovranista.” “Sovranismo” is a term Foa likes to use: It recently became popular in Italian public discourse to describe the country’s new coalition government. For EU countries, Foa explains, “sovranismo” means increased control over national borders in order to stem the flow of immigration and lessen restrictions on economic and budget policies. “Sovranismo” refers to the belief that sovereignty should be restored to the people and away from international institutions - notably away from the European Union. Critics say “sovranismo” and populism are virtually interchangeable.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Far-right 'patriots' are Europe's 'new elite,' Steve Bannon says</p> \n<p>In a book by Foa’s friend and Italian academic Giuseppe Valditara titled “Sovranismo: the last hope for democracy,” he makes the case for the creation of an international movement - a coalition of parties promoting the “sovereignty of the people” against “globalism,” a protest against the rise of international mechanisms and the growing internationalization of the market.</p> \n<p>Steve Bannon’s ideology, what he terms “economic nationalism,” is another way to understand this. Bannon told Haaretz in July that “economic nationalism means a double struggle against the forces that depress the wages of American workers: illegal immigration, and the export of jobs to China and the developing world... It is therefore also a struggle to reinvigorate an international order in which nation-states are the pillars of stability. It is a fight against globalism, internationalism, the EU, and other international organizations that compete for sovereignty against nation-states.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Explained:&nbsp;How Steven Bannon's 'The Movement' is uniting the far right in Europe</p> \n<p>“In many Western countries people feel they are no longer the masters in their own home, and I think this is a legitimate feeling,” Foa says explaining the new movement. “There are many international organizations that have enormous powers and no one knows anything about them, so what we call sovranismo is a self-defense mechanism.”</p> \n<p>Ever the ideologue, Foa however insists this new “sovranismo” is not a nationalist ideology. “Nationalists think their country is superior and has some moral, economic or cultural primacy over other countries,” Foa says. “I reject nationalism, it is dangerous, it belongs to another era and it only caused harm.” Foa is careful to reject the supremacy of nationalism for the isolationism of “sovranismo.” To Foa, the new ideology proposes the return to an order of independent nation-states, which may have relationships of trade and dialogue, without the interference of international mechanisms that aim to connect them. This “people’s sovereignty” is not necessarily supremacist, to Foa, although nationalists, populists, “sovranisti” and economic nationalists all seem to agree that immigration is a phenomenon that must be stopped, or at least severely restricted.</p>",

        "text":["<p>This morning, I woke up from uneasy dreams to find Gideon Levy transformed into Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>Like Bibi, the self-appointed King of the Jews, the veteran Haaretz columnist feels he can ignore what Jewish communities say about the politicians they have to deal with.</p> \n<p>The Israel prime minister has proven his skill in legitimizing those he finds strategically useful, like Viktor Orban and Donald Trump, with his own version of a kosher stamp.</p> \n<p>With his astonishing endorsement of Jeremy Corbyn as Britain’s next prime minister, Levy is giving the Corbynites the same kind of hechsher. He thinks they agree on Israel-Palestine. But, blinded by ideology, he’s wrong.</p> \n<p>It pains me to write this about someone whose journalism I have always admired. For decades, Levy has been steadfastly covering stories otherwise ignored in the Israeli media. And he has endured endless ad hominem attacks because of it.</p> \n<p>(One of the many cliches about Israeli journalism is the number of people who tell you gleefully that &quot;Gideon Levy can’t speak Arabic,&quot; or disclose with a sneer that he lives in Sheikh Munis – the Palestinian village that is now Ramat Aviv, as if this somehow undermines the importance of his journalism.)</p> \n<p>I can also quite understand that, living in Israel, Levy is used to seeing Jews as overwhelmingly the agents of an oppressive state. It looks a little different, here in the Diaspora.</p> \n<p>But it’s not his distance from the events of British politics that is the problem. One of the most important skills for a journalist is to know what they don’t know. Then you can come up with the questions.</p> \n<p>Now he has done what his critics have long accused him of: being so blinded by hatred, he puts ideology before the facts.</p> \n<p>Levy lauds Corbyn for his pro-Palestinian activism and wilfully ignores his record on a host of other issues – Syria, Russia, and acting as mouthpiece for conveniently anti-imperialist oppressive regimes like Iran.</p> \n<p>Corbyn is &quot;one who has fought his whole life for the values he believes in&quot; - and he has indeed stood up for his principles, and continues to do so, even when so many of them are wrong. Opposing apartheid in the 1970s was one thing; refusing to call for the downfall of Assad four decades later is another.</p> \n<p>Levy goes on to combine classic whataboutery with straw men arguments aplenty. He argues that the situation of any Jew in Britain is &quot;better, safer, more egalitarian and freer&quot; than Palestinians in either Israel or the occupied territories (a fact which gives British Jews no comfort at all).</p> \n<p>&quot;When Israel enacts the apartheid law and its soldiers kill 160 unarmed demonstrators on the Gaza border, the only response is to accuse anyone who criticizes this of anti-Semitism,&quot; Levy writes, and, from that point on, he slides unpleasantly close to conspiracy theory.</p> \n<p>The Jewish establishment in Britain and Israeli propaganda have apparently, &quot;taken out a contract&quot; on Corbyn so as to foil the election of a true socialist who will bring freedom to the Palestinian people.</p> \n<p>I don’t really care whether Corbyn is personally an anti-Semite, or not. Somehow, I feel he lacks the imagination and the intelligence to fall on either side of that question. But there is a real problem with anti-Semitism in Labour, and just because the political right is exploiting it doesn’t make it any less true.</p> \n<p>I confess my unease is also personal, not least because I respect Levy’s past body of work. I am baffled. As a Jewish, left-wing and previously dedicated Labour voter, not to mention a journalist who has written reams of critical material about both the Anglo-Jewish establishment and Israel – how am I now part of a Jewish plot to take out Corbyn?</p> \n<p>Was I part of a conspiracy all along and never knew it? Am I part of this &quot;Jewish-Israeli propaganda&quot; machine? If so, my check seems to have been lost in the post.</p> \n<p>It is nauseating to feel you have to try and prove your credentials as the &quot;right&quot; kind of Jew to be heard on this issue.</p> \n<p>But I have no interest in defending Israel from anything. Neither have I any interest in its continuation as a Jewish state; godspeed the day it prioritizes democracy over Judaism. I have argued here before that BDS is a legitimate and legal tactic, and cheered on the ICC’s attempts to investigate the IDF over alleged war crimes.</p> \n<p>The atmosphere in Britain is toxic right now, a catastrophe fed by divisions over Brexit and the plummeting level of discourse on both the right and the left.</p> \n<p>And perhaps the worst thing about the current anti-Semitism crisis in Labour is the sense of betrayal.</p> \n<p>There’s a growing queasiness as you realise that people you thought of as natural allies – colleagues, people you grew up with, those whose convictions you feel you share – are willing to turn a blind eye to the situation within the Corbynite wing of Labour.</p> \n<p>Tribalism on the left is no less nauseating than that on the right. And Levy’s column - virtue signaling rather than journalism – has not helped. What need do Corbynistas have for introspection when given the seal of approval by none other than the venerable Levy?</p> \n<p>I wrote here recently about Seymour Hersh and the sad phenomenon &quot;whereby angry young reporter becomes angry old reporter at the cost of all their critical faculties.&quot;</p> \n<p>Levy has similarly ignored facts in favour of dogma. How ironic that this should turn him into the mirror image of an Israeli leader he so despises.</p>",
