        "text":["<p>Prof. Israel Finkelstein sees no contradiction between holding a proper Pesach seder and telling the story of the exodus from Egypt, and the fact that, in his opinion, the exodus never occurred. The Hebrew edition of the book by Finkelstein and his American colleague, the historian and archaeologist Neal Asher Silberman, &quot;The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts&quot; has just been published. The English edition was published in the United States in January 2001 and a French edition appeared last year. In both countries the book spent many weeks on the best-seller lists and generated considerable public interest. The New York Times dubbed the biblical authors of the seventh century BCE &quot;God's ghostwriters&quot; in a lengthy review of the book. </p> \n<p>Next month the University of California in Los Angeles will hold an event on the archaeology of David and Solomon, with the participation of Finkelstein and Prof. Lawrence Stager of Harvard. On the same occasion Arte, the Franco-German culture channel, will start to film a four-part documentary based on the book, which is scheduled to be broadcast next year. </p> \n<p>What is it about &quot;The Bible Unearthed&quot; that has stirred such interest? Finkelstein, who is director of the Sonia and Marco Nadler Institute of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University, observes that this is the first &quot;comprehensive book in which archaeology is the queen of battle and not some tawdry ornament of Bible scholars.&quot; And Finkelstein is indeed ready to do battle. In addition to the periods of the patriarchs and the exodus, about which most scholars agree that there is only the most tenuous connection between the stories in the Bible and the historical reality, Finkelstein and Silberman place a large question mark over the period up to and including the time of the United Monarchy. </p> \n<p>&quot;Did it happen or not?&quot; he asks at the end of each chapter, and proceeds to explain why it did not, based on his research and archaeological findings, including the discoveries at Megiddo, a site that is considered the jewel in the crown of biblical archaeology. </p> \n<p>An additional innovation in the book is the reverse point of view the authors adopt. &quot;The book does not examine the history chronologically, from earlier to later,&quot; he explains. &quot;It goes from the later to the earlier, and at the end of every chapter there is a &quot;punch line&quot; that examines the authors' intentions.&quot; The authors, in this case, are those who wrote the biblical account in question, and the authorial intention refers to the theological and ideological foundation of the seventh century BCE, the period in which most of the Bible was written, according to Finkelstein. </p> \n<p>He deconstructs this foundation only in order to reconstruct it according to the logic that guided the ancient authors, and arrives at the conclusion that the stories about the conquest of the Land of Israel, the settlement period, the United Kingdom and the attempt to enhance the prestige of the Kingdom of Judah at the expense of the Northern Kingdom (Israel) are part of an ideological - religious and political - manifesto, a master stroke by a creative copywriter. </p> \n<p>The village of Jerusalem </p> \n<p> The Bible talks about the great and magnificent united monarchy of David and Solomon in the 10th century BCE, which split into two kingdoms, Israel and Judah, because of the demand by Solomon's son, Rehoboam (Rehavam), for excessive tax payments from the tribes of the northern hills and Galilee, which thereupon angrily seceded from the united monarchy. The result was two centuries of strife, wars and fraternal hatred. </p> \n<p>The Scriptures treat Israel as a secondary kingdom of no importance, a place of incorrigible sinners, whereas Judah is considered the great and just kingdom whose capital is Jerusalem, where King Solomon established a splendid temple during the glorious era of the united monarchy. Finkelstein is dubious about the existence of this great united monarchy. </p> \n<p>&quot;There is no archaeological evidence for it,&quot; he says. &quot;This is something unexampled in history. I don't think there is any other place in the world where there was a city with such a wretched material infrastructure but which succeeded in creating such a sweeping movement in its favor as Jerusalem, which even in its time of greatness was a joke in comparison to the cities of Assyria, Babylon or Egypt. It was a typical mountain village. There is no magnificent finding, no gates of Nebuchadnezzar, no Assyrian reliefs, no Egyptian temples - nothing. Even the temple couldn't compete with the temples of Egypt and their splendor.&quot; </p> \n<p>Then why was it written? </p> \n<p>&quot;For reasons of ideology. Because the authors of the Bible, people from Judah at the end of the seventh century BCE, in the period of King Josiah, had a long score to settle with the northern kingdom, with its splendor and richness. They despised the northerners and had not forgotten their dominance in forging the Israelite experience, in the competition for the sites of ritual. Contrary to what is usually thought, the Israelites did not go to pray in Jerusalem. They had a temple in Samaria (today's Sebastia) and at Beit El (Bethel). In our book we tried to show that as long as Israel was there, Judah was small and frightened, militarily and internationally. Judah and Jerusalem were on the fringes. A small tribe. There was nothing there. A small temple and that's all.&quot; </p> \n<p>And the kingdom of Israel? </p> \n<p>&quot;The archaeological findings show that Israel was a large, prosperous state, and was the main story until its destruction in the eighth century. Its geographic location was excellent, on the coast, near Phoenicia, Assyria and Syria. It had a diverse demographic composition: foreign residents and workers, Canaanites, Phoenicians; there was an Aramean population in the Jordan Valley, and there were mixed marriages. It was only 150 years after Israel's destruction that Judah rose to greatness, becoming self-aware and developing the monotheistic approach: one state, one God, one capital, one temple, one king.&quot; </p> \n<p>What is the root of the tension between archaeology and the text, and what happened during Josiah's reign? </p> \n<p>&quot;We think these ideas of Judah, that all the Israelites have to worship one God in one temple, and live under the rule of one king, sprang up in the seventh century BCE. If anyone had raised such ideas aloud before 720, he would have been beaten to a pulp by the northern monarchs. Everything started to come together after the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, and it also had a territorial aspect: from 734 to 625 BCE the Assyrian Empire ruled here. Today's American empire is negligible in comparison, in terms of its power and its crushing strength. For example, if someone in Judah had talked about expansion into Assyrian-dominated territories in 720, that would have been the end of him. King Hezekiah tried, and we saw happened to him. Sennacherib, king of Assyria, arrived with a huge army and decimated him. </p> \n<p>&quot;But a few years later, when Josiah was in power, something incredible happened. Assyria, the kingdom of evil, collapsed in front of his eyes. In the same way we saw the Berlin Wall collapse in 1989, that's what happened to Assyria. It fell apart and beat a hasty retreat from the Land of Israel. By this time the kingdom of Israel no longer existed, so Josiah woke up one morning, looked to his left and to his right, and there was neither an Assyrian nor an Israelite to be seen. And then his officials decided to put into practice their religious and territorial ideas.&quot; </p> \n<p>Still, why was the United Monarchy invented? </p> \n<p>&quot;Because they wanted to seize control of the territories of the kingdom of Israel and annex them, because, they said, `These territories are actually ours and if you have a minute, we'll tell you how that's so. `Many years ago, one of our kings, David, reigned in Jerusalem and ruled them, and we are the only ones who have a historical claim to them' - and so the myth was created. `The kings of Israel were scoundrels,' the people of Judah said, `but as for the people there, we have no problem with them, they are all right.' They said about Israel what an ultra-Orthodox person would say about you or me: `Israel, though he has sinned, is still Israel.'&quot; </p> \n<p>Nothing to conquer </p> \n<p> According to Finkelstein's theory, the legends about earlier periods were invented for the same purpose. &quot;The people of Judah started to market the story of Joshua's conquest of the land, which was also written in that period, in order to give moral justification to their territorial longings, to the conquest of the territories of Israel. The story also contains a `laundering' of foreigners, which was exactly the problem Josiah faced when he conquered Israel. So they relate the story of the Gibeonites, who were terrified by the might of Joshua and his army and begged for their lives, and told Joshua that they were not indigenous Canaanites but foreigners who came from afar. Joshua made an alliance of peace with them, but when he found out they had cheated him, he did not expel them but made them hewers of wood and drawers of water - in other words, he laundered them. </p> \n<p>&quot;That is the situation Josiah and his people faced with foreign deportees the Assyrians brought to the Land of Israel, and the biblical text comes and says, `Have no worry, this already happened before: there were strangers in the land then, too, and Joshua laundered them during the conquest. Our conquest is not really what it looks like, it is only the restoration of past glories.' </p> \n<p>So they must have had a good information ministry? </p> \n<p>&quot;I don't believe that there was a department for the invention of stories in Jerusalem. There were folktales that were handed down from generation to generation, local traditions and legends, and they were the basis for the creation of the biblical narrative. Maybe there really was no conquest, and maybe there were vague memories of local events. In any case, the scribes in the period of Josiah collected these materials and forged them into a coherent story containing a message it was important for them to get across. They didn't actually care whether there ever was such a person as Joshua. Jericho and the area of Bethel, and the Shefelah and the Galilee were on the agenda of Judah. They never actually conquered many of these regions. `This was once ours,' they said, `as in the time of Joshua, and all we are doing is putting history back in its track, correcting the course of history and on this occasion renewing the glorious monarchy of David, which was the first to rule these territories.'&quot; </p> \n<p>Are you saying that the story of the conquest of the land is a complete fiction? </p> \n<p>&quot;It is a story which, as it is presented in the Bible, definitely never happened. Archaeology shows that it has no historical grounds. Many of the sites that are cited in the story of the conquest were not even inhabited in the relevant period, so there was nothing to conquer, there were only hills and rocks. Jericho was not fortified and had no walls, and it's doubtful that there was a settlement there at the time. Therefore, in the case of the story of the conquest of Arad, for instance, some scholars said that the war was fought against the forces of one Bedouin sheikh. </p> \n<p>&quot;If one does a calculation backward from the point at which we have historical documentation, such as the external Assyrian writings about the monarchy of Ahab, it turns out that the story of the biblical conquest would have occurred at the end of the 13th century BCE. At that time the Egyptians ruled in the land, but there is no mention of that in the Bible. </p> \n<p>&quot;There is a stela in a Cairo museum on which the word Israel first appears in written form. The son of Ramesses II launched a military expedition to Caanan and conquered Ashkelon and Gezer, and wrote the famous sentence, `Israel is spoiled, his seed is not.' That was in 1207 BCE - after the conquest as related in the Bible.&quot; </p> \n<p>If there was no conquest, where did the Israelites come from? </p> \n<p>&quot;Egypt was a mighty empire that ruled here with an iron fist. In the 14th century BCE there are stories about local kings who ask Pharaoh for help against one another, asking him to send 50 soldiers - in other words, that was the number that was sufficient to impose order here. So how did a few foot soldiers from the desert conquer the land? There was certainly no orderly military conquest. According to the archaeological findings, the Israelites came from the local stock: they were actually Canaanites who became Israelites in a socio-economic process.&quot; </p> \n<p>Lies, no; spin, yes </p> \n<p> Finkelstein did not always hold these views. &quot;I remember that when I was writing my doctoral thesis about the Israelite settlement in the hill region, I was convinced of the accuracy of the theory propounded by the German scholars - which was then dominant in the field - holding that this population came from outside in a quiet infiltration and settled here,&quot; he says. &quot;And I remember well that in the course of the surveys I did in Samaria, at Shiloh and in the areas between Ramallah and Nablus, I began to be aware that this was not a population that had infiltrated here but groups of a local population that moved around the land in circular processes. That it was not a pool of desert nomads who then moved rapidly west, but rather a lengthy process, of hundreds of years, which had already taken place in the past, at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age and in the Middle Bronze Age. </p> \n<p>&quot;For me this was something entirely new. It led me to the thought that the settlement processes in the Land of Israel were circular: in periods of crisis the tribes became nomadic shepherds, and in periods of abundance they had permanent settlements. From this I understood that these were processes that were undergone by the local population and not by a population that marched in a procession and entered the Land of Israel by means of war or peace.&quot; </p> \n<p>The question is why it appears in this form in the Bible. What idea is it meant to serve? </p> \n<p>&quot;The answer is that in order to understand the episode of the conquest, we have to look at the kingdom of Judah in the seventh century BCE and understand that the story serves the authors of the Scriptures, because through it they resolved for themselves the territorial problems of the conquest of the then vanquished Kingdom of Israel.&quot; </p> \n<p>So Joshua did not exist? </p> \n<p>&quot;I don't say that. Perhaps there were memories of some great commander or general. On the other hand, this text describes something that happened in the 13th century and was written in the seventh century - that is, 600 years later - by people who did not have access to newspaper archives, and at the time of the events not one letter of the alphabet had been written anywhere, so it is not reasonable to think that this story contains many early memories.&quot; </p> \n<p>And was there a United Monarchy? </p> \n<p>&quot;A huge number of people talk about the United Monarchy; but the number of people who truly understand the matter is very small. There is a stream in the research that says that David and Solomon were not historical figures, that they are a legend. I don't think so. There is an inscription from Tel Dan from the ninth century BCE that mentions the southern kingdom by the name of `the house of David.' So it stands to reason that they existed, but the question is whether they ruled a large empire, and about that there is not the slightest hint. All the evidence is against it.&quot; </p> \n<p>Yet there are many archaeologists and historians who dispute your view? </p> \n<p>&quot;It's true that until recently there was a great deal of opposition to this conception. Today, though, at least some of my adversaries agree with me. There is a large difference in the text between the David stories and the Solomon stories. The whole character of Solomon is that of an Assyrian king: resplendent, rich, wise, a womanizer and a great trader, a figure of ideology like someone out of a journal. David is not, precisely because he is given a complex description and there are the unpleasant stories about him that make him a human figure. And according to archaeology, there is no hint of magnificence or pomp in 10th-century Jerusalem, and in fact until the end of the eighth century BCE, until the Assyrian period and after the destruction of Israel, when refugees from the north began streaming into the city, it was a small village, remote, wretched and unfortified.&quot; </p> \n<p>So are you saying that the United Monarchy is a lie? </p> \n<p>&quot;I don' believe in lies in history. Spin, yes; lies, no. What I am saying is that if in the seventh century BCE a strong tradition existed in Jerusalem that the temple on the hill had been built by the founders of the dynasty, I see no reason to question that. That doesn't mean it was a huge and magnificent building. On the question of the grandeur of the United Monarchy I find myself in a tough scholarly confrontation: there is still a debate over the archaeological remnants. Two magnificent palaces were found at Megiddo. [The noted archaeologist] Yigael Yadin said they were from the 10th century BCE, the period of Solomon, and could support the account of the great monarchy, whereas I think they are from the ninth century BCE, 70 years later, from the period of the northern kingdom.&quot; </p> \n<p>Doesn't it follow that if there was no United Monarchy, there was also no schism? </p> \n<p>&quot;All the villages in the north in the 10th century BCE were Canaanite villages. David and Solomon ruled in Jerusalem, and probably also the southern hill region, and maybe part of the northern hill region. They did not rule in the northern valleys or in Galilee, and therefore there was no split of the monarchy. From the beginning there were two entities - northern and southern - but the Scripture story about the schism is meant to serve Josiah's conquest in the seventh century BCE. `Now we will establish the monarchy anew,' the authors of the Bible said to their readers, `and it will be united eternally.'&quot; </p> \n<p>The Caananite connection </p> \n<p> If Finkelstein is ready to concede the existence of David and Solomon, albeit as kinks of a small, marginal entity, when it comes to the exodus from Egypt he is absolute in his opinion. &quot;There is no evidence that the Israelites were in Egypt, not the slightest, not the least bit of evidence. There are no clues, either archaeological or historical, to prove that the Israelites built monuments in Egypt, even though the biblical description of the famine in the Land of Israel may be accurate. We know from archaeology that there was a migration of Canaanites to Egypt in the first half of the second millennium BCE, that these migrants built communities in the area of the Nile Delta, and that the Egyptians afterward expelled them from there. Perhaps that is the ancient memory, I don't know. What I can say is that the story, in the form we have it, serves a later situation. It spoke to the exiles in Babylon and to those who returned from the exile. What the story told them is that exile is not the end of the world, it's possible to return, the deserts can be crossed, the land can be reconquered. That gave them hope.&quot; </p> \n<p>The stories of the patriarchs, Finkelstein says - adding that today most scholars accept this view - are folklore about forefathers that the authors of the Bible in the seventh century salvaged from the mists of history in order to reinforce their hold on the cultural heritage. Scientific searches for them have produced nothing. </p> \n<p>&quot;Did these people ever exist? I don't know. They were primeval forbears, and the goal was to create a myth saying that Judah is the center of the world, of the Israelite way of life, against the background of the reality of the later kingdom.&quot; </p> \n<p>So, if there were no patriarchs, maybe we don't have patriarchal rights? </p> \n<p>&quot;I am a great believer in a total separation between tradition and research. I myself have a warm spot in my heart for the Bible and its splendid stories. During our Pesach seder, my two girls, who are 11 and 7, didn't hear a word about the fact that there was no exodus from Egypt. When they are 25, we will tell them a different story. Belief, tradition and research are three parallel lines that can exist simultaneously. I don't see that as a gross contradiction.&quot; </p> \n<p>What about the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron? </p> \n<p>&quot;The building is Herodian. It was built in the time of Herod, hundreds of years after the period of the patriarchs as told in the Bible. There are apparently ancient graves under the building. The question is what the Bible intended to express in the story of the cave's purchase. Its genre is influenced by the Assyrian and Babylonian period, from the eighth and seventh centuries BCE. This particular chapter was probably written in the period of the return to Zion and it may have earlier foundations, from the end of the period of the monarchy, and then the goal would be to exalt the kingdom of Judah and say that the fathers of the nation are buried in &quot;our territory&quot; - not where the Israelites were, but in Judah. If it was written in the period of the return to Zion it is even more interesting, because when the Persians divided the land and redefined its borders, Hebron remained outside Judah. In this context, the tombs of the patriarchs are the Promised Land. They resided in Judah and saw Hebron from afar, and they could only despair over their territorial ambitions. </p> \n<p>&quot;One day, at the time of the withdrawal from Hebron, I visited the Tomb of the Patriarchs with Rabbi Menahem Fruman, from [the nearby settlement of] Tekoah, as part of a television program. I explained that the structure is Herodian, and the interviewer, Emmanuel Rosen, asked Fruman what he had to say about that. He replied, `It's very interesting. He is a man of science, so I assume he knows what he is talking about.' Rosen was absolutely flabbergasted, he was afraid Fruman would attack me, but Fruman went on, `Do you want me to play time games here? For me it's enough that he says Jews prayed here in the Herodian period. If he said that it's been here since the Middle Ages, that would be enough for me, too.' </p> \n<p>&quot;I identified so strongly with him that I almost embraced him, because matters of culture and identity are not measured by a stopwatch and don't work at the pace of politics.' </p> \n<p>Aren't you concerned that your theory will serve those who deny the Zionist argument? </p> \n<p>&quot;The debate over our right to the land is ridiculous. As though there is some international committee in Geneva that considers the history of peoples. Two peoples come and one says, `I have been here since the 10th century BCE,' and the other says, `No, he's lying, he has only been here since the ninth century BCE.' What will they do - evict him? Tell him to start packing? In any event, our cultural heritage goes back to these periods, so this whole story is nonsense. Jerusalem existed and it had a temple that symbolized the longings of the Judahites who lived here, and afterward, in the period of Ezra and Nehemiah, of the Jews. Isn't that enough? How many peoples go back to the ninth or 10th centuries BCE? And let's say that there was no exodus from Egypt and that there was no great and magnificent united monarchy, and that we are actually Canaanites. So in terms of rights, we are okay, aren't we?&quot; </p> \n<p>Turbulent years </p> \n<p> As a child, Prof. Finkelstein, 54, didn't dream of becoming an archaeologist and didn't collect shards of broken vases in order to glue them back together. After his army service he applied to study international relations and political science at Hebrew University and, for good measure, to study archaeology and geography at Tel Aviv University. </p> \n<p>&quot;It transpired like many things in life,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn't fall in love with archaeology at first sight. It grabbed me slowly and surely, until finally I decided to do a second degree.&quot; </p> \n<p>He also obtained his Ph.D. at Tel Aviv University and then went on to teach and conduct research at the University of Chicago, Harvard and the Sorbonne. Professionally, he is today in the forefront of the group of excavators at Megiddo (together with Profs. David Ussishkin of Tel Aviv University and Baruch Halpern of Penn State). He and some of his colleagues reject the possibility that the palaces there are from the period of the United Monarchy. </p> \n<p>&quot;The identification of the strata of the United Monarchy is as though written on ice. It's all circular reasoning, which in the end is based on one source: a verse in I Kings stating that Solomon built Hazor, Megiddo, Gezer and Jerusalem. That is the Yadin structure, and it is incorrect. But we should not pass judgment on Yadin for this, because at the time everyone thought as he did. I didn't agree with this dating, and in 1996 I published my thoughts in a professional journal in England. The seven years since have been turbulent - one unending battle that still continues. What didn't they say about me and some of my colleagues? That we are nihilists, that we are savaging Western culture, undermining Israel's right of existence. One person used the term `Bible denier.'&quot; </p> \n<p>Finkelstein doesn't want people to think that he is being deliberately provocative, that he only wants good headlines. </p> \n<p>&quot;I am not some kind of yuppie nihilist,&quot; he emphasizes. He was born in Petah Tikva and grew up in a farming family. His mother's family came to Palestine in 1860, his father's family eight decades ago. &quot;So what will I do, leave? Where am I supposed to go? To Grodno? I don't want to go there,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe it's quiet and pleasant in Boston or Paris, but if you live here, then you at least have to be part of the ongoing historical experience and understand its power. If you live here only for the parties on the beach on Thursday night, then it would be better if you didn't live here, because this is a dangerous place. Anyone who thinks that Tel Aviv is a type of Goa has missed the point completely.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>One day in 1976, a student entered our classroom at Beit Yaakov Seminar in Tel Aviv, weeping passionately. She informed us that the revered Gerer rebbe - the so-called Beis Yisroel - Rabbi Israel Alter, had died. Classes at the seminar, which was affiliated with the Gur Hasidic sect, were suspended immediately, and all of us, including girls from the Lithuanian community (those ultra-Orthodox Jews historically opposed to Hasidism ) to which I belonged, bawled our eyes out.</p> \n<p>The Beis Yisroel, who ruled Gur Hasidism from 1948 to 1976, was a dominant leader who revolutionized that sect, which in those days won admiration in the ultra-Orthodox world - even though, or perhaps because, it had always been steeped in secrecy when it came to relations between men and women. Over time it emerged that the unusual Gur customs in this realm are tied to the concept of kedusha (sanctity ), from which stems the unique attitude to sexuality and conjugal relations within the sect. (Much of our understanding of the topic is the result of the research of Dr. Benjamin Brown of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem over the last few years ).</p> \n<p>A new study that focuses on the private and public lifestyle of Gur Hasidim lifts the veil further on sanctity in the sect. &quot;Sanctity is the ideology of the art of drawing apart,&quot; says Dr. Nava Wasserman, whose study of private and public life among Gur Hasidism was the subject of her doctoral dissertation (which she wrote under the guidance of Prof. Kimmy Caplan, at Bar-Ilan University ).</p> \n<p>According to Wasserman, &quot;This view dictates the strict separation between the sexes in this Hasidic sect, and primarily the practices of prishut [separation] that guide the relationship between spouses in this society, which is unparalleled in other ultra-Orthodox groups. Hasidism is doing more than is demanded by Jewish law. If in the Western world sexuality is a constant presence, it is precisely against this that Gur Hasidim fight. They don't want to get anywhere near the atmosphere and tension of sexuality, even if matters do not reach the level of prohibition. This is the fulfillment of Hasidism: Separation beyond that which Jewish law requires.&quot;</p> \n<p>Response to Zionism </p> \n<p>More than 20 years ago, Prof. Menachem Friedman, one of the most important scholars of ultra-Orthodox life, claimed that the Ashkenazi Haredi community is built around a &quot;society of learners,&quot; and demonstrated how this was intended to be a fitting response to Zionism. Starting in the 1950s, studying Torah came to be seen as an alternative to the secular sense of having &quot;a calling&quot; in life. Teenage boys began to be sent to small yeshivas at age 15, something that was not commonly done before at that age, and that would be followed by study at a larger yeshiva. Another important development was the alliance struck between the leader of the Lithuanians, the Chazon Ish (Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz ), and Rabbi Zeev Wolf, who sought to educate the girls who would agree to take upon themselves the burden of working for a living. Thus came about the learners' society.</p> \n<p>Whereas Friedman does not distinguish between Lithuanian society and the Hasidim, Wasserman demonstrates that the case of the Gur is unique. &quot;Gur Hasidim did adopt the practice of studying the Torah for many years, but they have an alternate ethos, that of sanctity as an organizing principle and the axis around which life revolves - exactly like the ethos of Torah learning in Lithuanian society. This is a society that has taken upon itself with utter devotion the principle of reducing sexuality, as a way to challenge general society,&quot; she says.</p> \n<p>In her study, which receives its first public exposure here, an honest attempt was made to analyze and understand in depth a culture based on strict gender separation.</p> \n<p>&quot;Quite often, separation of men and women is interpreted as something that is intended against women,&quot; Wasserman explains. &quot;Modesty demands which are made of women are also frequently interpreted as acts of oppression by men, but the Gur case proves that the demands for modest attire made of men are even stricter.&quot;</p> \n<p>Her study is a rare achievement, in that sanctity is an oral tradition, and among Gur Hasidim, it is passed on only via private instruction. She describes the sanctity society through the eyes of women and men who are for the most part from the hard core of the sect. And therein also lies its disadvantage: Wasserman, who is a social worker, acknowledges that she does not address the implications of the strict approach to sexuality for all the &quot;circles&quot; of Gur Hasidim, nor does she deal with the personal price that these Hasidim may pay for their way of life.</p> \n<p>The concept of sanctity, or &quot;drawing apart,&quot; comes into play in four circles: between the Hasid and himself; between the Hasid and other men; between the Hasid and women; and - the great novelty - between the Hasid and his wife.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Gur innovation is that the notion of separation also exists for the men in relation to the women they marry. This is in addition to the limitations of halakha (Jewish religious law ) that the other groups adhere to,&quot; Wasserman says.</p> \n<p>Gur Hasids drew the inspiration for separation from the heritage of Kotzk, a small Hasidic sect that existed in the early 19th century - the path of which Gur saw itself as continuing.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Kotzk Rebbe essentially claimed that love for the Lord and love for a woman do not go together. There is a rivalry between spirituality and sexuality, so sexuality has to be abolished,&quot; notes Wasserman, explaining the rationale.</p> \n<p>&quot;At first it was a matter for a select few. A significant turning point occurred in 1948, when Rabbi Alter, the Beis Yisroel, assumed the position of admor of Gur, and brought all the issues of sanctity to the fore again and made it a requirement for everyone. The move unified Gur Hasidim: From a collection of groups with varied affinity for Hasidism, which included refugees from the Holocaust, it became a homogenous group. To belong to it you had to meet obligatory requirements.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Beis Yisroel appointed commandants, Polish for 'commanders,' whose job was to instruct, and to spread information about the issue of sanctity. The change was introduced through the boys' school system. Instruction on what is permitted and proscribed does not take place in public lectures, because such matters are not discussed in public. And that is the inherent paradox in the system: On the one hand, they stay away from talking about conjugal matters, and on the other hand theseneed to be discussed. Therefore the conversation is a personal one between the young man or Hasid and his counselor, in language that is highly indirect, but at the same time also highly specific.&quot;</p> \n<p>A young man's preparation for having a relationship with a woman is very limited. Only on his wedding day, about two hours before the marriage ceremony, does the counselor reveal to the groom what he must do on his wedding night. The girls receive more extensive counseling.</p> \n<p>&quot;There are grooms who throw up or faint when they hear these things,&quot; Wasserman notes. &quot;But the sect is willing to pay this price, to receive the benefit of sanctity.&quot;</p> \n<p>'Distant closeness' </p> \n<p>Gur Hasidim acquire their level of separation by guarding their eyes - and their thoughts. &quot;The intention is to uproot from consciousness the images that might lead to arousal,&quot; Wasserman says. Therefore, when a Gur Hasid walks down the street, he will direct his gaze downward. On a bus, he might remove his glasses, because &quot;they are taught diversionary practices - how to guide awareness to another place. That way they slowly acquire tools for repressing their sexuality.&quot;</p> \n<p>An entire set of restrictions pertains to ties with friends. Gur men do not embrace and do not kiss; a young man is forbidden to sit on his friend's bed; a young man is forbidden to conduct a conversation unless he is wearing his overcoat. In general, Gur Hasidim must walk around in their overcoats at all times. The strictest instruction is given regarding immersion in the mikveh, or ritual bath, in the most modest manner. &quot;There is a clash of values here,&quot; Wasserman says. &quot;You need to safeguard sanctity, on the one hand, and on the other, the immersion involves nudity.&quot;</p> \n<p>For this reason, children under the age of 13 do not perform the ritual immersion. The young men who do immerse do so quickly and get dressed without dawdling. Young Hasids are instructed to look away so as not to see a naked body.</p> \n<p>Separation between the sexes in Gur is so complete that &quot;the young men do not attend weddings, because the event could create a certain connotation that it is undesirable to create in their consciousness. And also to reduce the opportunity of meeting women,&quot; Wasserman says. In some Gur families, boys of a certain age will stop speaking to their female cousins, and at meals for the extended family, women and men eat at separate tables. A young man who is considered even more devoted will speak only to women from his nuclear family, and not with his sisters-in-law. They will not say hello and goodbye to women, so as not to have contact.</p> \n<p>The relationship between a man and his wife in the Gur sect is definitely unique. Wasserman terms it &quot;distant closeness&quot;: &quot;The couple's relationship takes shape in light of the ethos that sexuality is minimized in marital life. Whereas modern society talks about cooperation between man and woman, unity, friendship and love, Gur Hasidism comes along and tells its members to keep their distance. But distance is not alienation. A couple can be caring and warm, even if they maintain their distance. The Hasid will not call his wife by name. When there are children, this becomes easier: She will be called 'Mother' ordinarily. To address her, he will knock on the table. Or hum. In any event, he will not walk with her on the street. This means that they will never do the shopping or go on a trip together.&quot;</p> \n<p>One example of the emotional restraint demanded of couples was given in a preparatory course for Gur brides: &quot;A woman told me that after the wedding she heard a lecture about how to treat your husband, and how to create a pleasant atmosphere in the home. They said there that everything depends on the woman and her manner of speaking. And when the husband comes from the kollel [yeshiva for married men], you have to welcome him with a nice [greeting like] 'Sholom Aleikhem' - out of warmth and friendliness.</p> \n<p>&quot;The girl took the instruction at face value, and that very day when she heard her husband approach, opened the door to him and said, 'Shalom, how are you?' She had barely got the sentence out when the door was slammed in her face and her husband disappeared. The wife was stunned, close to tears, didn't know what to do. She went back inside and began thinking what had been wrong in her conduct. When the husband [returned and] entered the house, he said to her: 'Tsu gut, is nisht gut' - too good is not good.&quot;</p> \n<p>Necessary evil </p> \n<p>The distance stems from the basic mind-set that sexuality and conjugal relations are a necessary evil, Wasserman says. Conjugal relations exist only because Jewish law demands this - and because you have to bring children into the world. But those relations are marginal and are kept to a minimum.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Lithuanians and the Hasidim have very different concepts of family,&quot; she explains. &quot;Lithuanian society exists within the boundaries of Jewish law, but the basic mindset is, 'Sanctify yourself through those things that are permitted to you' - in fact, devote yourself to conjugal relations, [during the two weeks out of the month] when they are permitted, as something that will benefit your spiritual life. The Gur interpretation is the opposite: 'Remove yourself from those things that are permitted to you.'&quot;</p> \n<p>Thus, the husband and wife from Gur will always behave as if the woman is in niddah (the days during and after a woman's period when she is considered impure ). He will never take something from his wife's hand; she will place it on the table for him to pick up. There will certainly not be any contact between them that expresses warmth. There are also orders regarding frequency of conjugal relations.</p> \n<p>The supervision and strict enforcement reach a climax during the first year of marriage. The avrech (married yeshiva student ) spends the day at the kollel. The entry into married life is gradual, with the object of solidifying it in an asexual manner. Wasserman makes it clear that for Hasidim, marriage is about wholehearted devotion to a supreme cause.</p> \n<p>&quot;When my goals are spiritual, I must do everything to reduce my natural desires,&quot; she explains. &quot;Gur Hasidism contend that it is possible to control sexual urges. To a large extent, in their eyes, Western society blew sexuality out of its natural and necessary proportions.&quot; Sanctity, therefore, is a source of collective pride within Gur.</p> \n<p>At the same, however, Wasserman says, &quot;People were willing to talk about difficulties. There's a feeling that they are prepared: there is talk about the fact that the relationship is slowly forged. One of the counselors told the brides: 'Imagine that you might cry a lot in the beginning, but in the end it will work out.'&quot;</p> \n<p>Toward the age of 40, which Hasidism deems the age at which a man acquires greater control of his urges, some of these directives melt away. Among some couples, they will feel free to act the way they like. Even before this, there is a range of behaviors regarding which there is choice.</p> \n<p>&quot;I think that Gur society is an impressive model of success,&quot; Wasserman says. However, she adds that, &quot;no society succeeds in realizing its ideal all the way through, and there are also people who do not get along with the norms in it.&quot;</p> \n<p>And just as Hasidism and maintaining the Hasidic lifestyle that goes with it is seen mainly as the &quot;work&quot; of men only, so too the issue of maintaining sanctity in Hasidism is a demand addressed to the men.</p> \n<p>Wasserman: &quot;The men have spiritual-Hasidic goals, whereas the women's Hasidism is intended to help that of the men to be executed. That is their role as women. Women identify with the idea and instill it in their children from an early age.&quot;</p> \n<p>According to her, Gur life has also given rise to women's empowerment. &quot;There is something in the lifestyle that makes them highly independent. Gur women have lots of opportunities for self-expression,&quot; she says. &quot;This is because men do not fill any function in the feminine sphere.&quot; For example, it is rare for there to be male teachers or principals at Gur schools for girls.</p> \n<p>Wasserman spent several years teaching educational psychology to female instructors at a Gur seminar in Bnei Brak. Her impression was that the women are not in the least embittered.</p> \n<p>&quot;Happiness or a [personal] connection in marriage does not depend on a model of marriage or on the question of whether people walk together in the street or not. There are many couples that know how to create a sensitive and considerate connection and they are the happy couples, as in any society,&quot; she says. &quot;There is great security in these marriages, in which the spouses feel that someone 'has their back' - that someone cares for them, and that they are realizing their purpose. Love is something that is culturally dependent. It doesn't have to be expressed by gazing into each other's eyes. There isn't one way to express love.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p> Benjamin Netanyahu chose to forgo stately, prudent sentiments when he eulogized Yitzhak Shamir at the government meeting. On this official occasion, the prime minister arrogantly delivered a blood-curdling, racist rant that pointed out, in his view, the accuracy of Shamir's statement that: the &quot;Arabs&quot; will always be the same &quot;Arabs.&quot;</p> \n<p> This is the view of a prime minister of a state in which a fifth of the citizens are Arabs; a leader who needs every particle of legitimacy, internal and external, that he can summon ahead of an external life-or-death struggle.</p> \n<p> Many naively believe that Netanyahu is like Shamir. If only that were the case. Shamir has the quality of a zen master who had the ability to kill and be killed without batting an eyelash, whereas his eulogizer has a manic-depressive, stressed, Medusa-like quality. Shamir brought his colleague Eliyahu Giladi from the Lehi underground to the sea. Giladi had concocted plots to carry out acts of violent hatred against fellow Jews. Shamir ordered his execution and took part in it. He finished the act by naming his own daughter Gilada after his former partner.</p> \n<p> Netanyahu is no Shamir; he is Eliyahu Giladi. In Shamir's case, the sentence conveying a generalization about the &quot;Arabs&quot; constituted ultra-nationalist objection to any compromise. It was rooted in a need to display firm rigidity vis-a-vis a rival for power in territories of the country. In Netanyahu's case, in contrast, incitement is part of his inner nature; it's an ideological imperative. It is that nature which placed Netanyahu at the head of demonstrations that called for the &quot;bloody expulsion&quot; of Yitzhak Rabin. And it is that nature that led him to make comments about how &quot;the left has forgotten what it means to be a Jew.&quot;</p> \n<p> This internal compulsion of malice is what caused Menachem Begin to view Netanyahu's father, Benzion, as a dangerous extremist. Similar dangers apparent within his son's personality caused Shamir to view Netanyahu as a danger to the state. The same compulsion is also what caused his grandson to form an anti-Arab hate group. This compulsive malice is what compelled Netanyahu's administration to appoint the anti-Arab incitement-mongering chief rabbi of Safed, Shmuel Eliyahu, to serve as spiritual leader of the Magen David Adom rescue service.</p> \n<p> This compulsion may also be what caused Netanyahu to declare that he prefers missile fire on Tel Aviv to the Iranian nuclear program. Netanyahu has been quoted as saying that The New York Times and Haaretz are the worst enemies of Israel. All I can say is that the first part of Netanyahu's statement, about the missiles on Tel Aviv, home of Haaretz's office, stands on its own.</p> \n<p> In January 1991, planes were on the runway, prepared for take-off on a mission against Iraq. Shamir concluded a cabinet meeting on the matter by remarking that there wasn't a majority in favor of military action against Baghdad. In fact, there was a cabinet majority in favor of such an action, but Shamir grasped the basic strategic reality: a leader who stubbornly insisted on control of the territories and settlements lacked global legitimacy to carry out wide-ranging strategic actions. The strategic confrontation had to be left to the Americans. In Shamir's view, this price was worth paying, in exchange for diplomatic obstinacy.</p> \n<p> This point eludes those who wake up to the facts belatedly, as in the case of Prof. Yehezkel Dror, who told Haaretz's Ari Shavit last week that his views on the Iranian crisis have changed. He now understands that a nuclear Iran would be a military threat. Dror proposed a remedy to the Iran crisis: first, a preemptive war, and then a peace proposal and compromise. But this remedy has already been proven to be wrong. History has shown - as Dror's friend Ehud Barak pretends to understand - that the key to victory in a preemptive war is the obtainment of wide-ranging internal and external legitimacy. Such legitimacy is accrued by seeking peace prior to the fighting, not after the war.</p> \n<p> Yitzhak Rabin, who woke up to reality 20 years before Dror, veered toward peace in order to create internal and external conditions suited for a successful confrontation with Iran. Begin operated in the same way. When he took the reins of power from Rabin in 1977, Begin became tremendously interested in the Iraqi case. This interest was one prime factor that compelled him toward peace-making with the Egyptians. His love for citizens of this country, which he expressed through neighborhood renewal projects, added to Begin's legitimacy.</p> \n<p> The Iranian nuclear program poses a real threat, and it should be eradicated at virtually any cost. And the cost of a successful action against Iran can already be identified: Israel would need to win legitimacy in the west by showing willingness to pull out of all the territories. Such willingness must be demonstrated before a war.</p> \n<p> Preemptive wars can only be won by leaders and regimes that love their citizens and do not want to actually fight that war. These are leaders in the Levi Eshkol mold. Those who gallop toward preemptive battles because of hatred of the &quot;other&quot; and the &quot;Arabs&quot; merely end up bringing scandal and woe upon themselves, and their people.</p> \n<p> Iran has yet to cross the nuclear bomb threshold. Elections are to be held in coming months in Iran and in the United States. A regime change in Israel that would involve a promise of a full withdrawal from the territories remains a possibility. Only such a government, one which loves its citizens and embraces compromise, could recruit legitimacy needed for victory against Iran.</p>",

The legal opinion will be presented in advance of a High Court of Justice hearing on the matter that is scheduled for next week.</p> \n<p> Two weeks ago, 17 families - constituting one-third of all residents of the settlement outpost - petitioned the High Court to permit them to remain where they are. The residents argued that the al-Watan development company, which is owned by the Mateh Binyamin regional council, had purchased part of the outpost's lands, and therefore the central argument against them - that they were living on land they did not own - was no longer valid.</p> \n<p> The ministerial committee on settlement affairs will convene today to consider the matter of the settlement outpost at Migron. In internal defense establishment discussions, it was agreed to adopt the position that the court's verdict was to be upheld in any event, and that by August 1 all of the outpost's residents were to be evacuated. As for the plots of land acquired by al-Watan, an examination would be conducted to determine the legality of the purchase. If it proves to be valid, the option of enabling a limited civilian presence on the site would be considered.</p> \n<p> Nevertheless, a Justice Ministry source told Haaretz that legally speaking, if the plots were lawfully purchased, it would be possible to permit someone whose home is built on them to continue to reside on the site. The homes built on other plots would be demolished. The political echelons have been informed of this position, and on its basis the state will formulate its response, which is due to be presented to the court tomorrow.</p> \n<p> Any change to the High Court's ruling necessitates affirmation of the justices. To date, Supreme Court President Asher Grunis has adopted the position that rulings that have already been handed down should not be modified, without any connection to further events related to the case. The court hearing on the matter is scheduled for July 22.</p> \n<p> Attorney Michael Sfarad, representing Peace Now, was hard pressed to say whether this position would remain unchanged, given the material that has been presented to the Attorney General's office. &quot;If this is the position, it would be an indication that the right wing's hazing of the Attorney General's office in the past few months has succeeded,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p> Read this article in Hebrew</p>",

        "text":["<p> Back when Ronald Reagan was in the White House and Benjamin Netanyahu was Israel's ambassador to the UN in New York, the big enemy was the Soviet Union - the queen of lies that did not flinch from using any means to attain its objectives. Reagan maintained a firm strategic relationship with the U.S.S.R.; shortly after he left office in 1989, and to the surprise of all parties, the U.S. achieved victory in the Cold War, with the Soviet economy collapsing under the weight of its defense expenditures.</p> \n<p> Now along comes Barack Obama, who in the context of his campaign against Mitt Romney has adopted President Reagan as a go-to example vis-a-vis taxation of the very wealthy. And Obama is essentially telling Netanyahu that it is feasible to do to the Iranians what Reagan did to the Russians. Break them economically, through paralyzing sanctions that will generate internal ferment, and reach agreements with them that will reduce the risk.</p> \n<p> Trust but verify - in the finest American tradition, this is what makes it possible for citizens to base their annual tax return on their own financial assessment. But woe to anyone who is audited and found to be stealing from the general kitty. Then the law will mercilessly come down on the transgressor.</p> \n<p> If only Netanyahu were not married to the idea of a large-scale operation against Iran, he might be able to claim copyright to the Americans' use of his slogan: If they give, they will receive. Except that is precisely what frightens him so much - that the Iranians will deliver their part on a nuclear deal, and end up receiving the other part in exchange. Earlier this week, following the conclusion of the G8 discussions at Camp David, Ben Rhodes, the White House's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, expounded on the idea on which the discussions that began this Wednesday in Baghdad were based. &quot;I think the first round of negotiations in Istanbul [last month] was dedicated to setting the environment for talks, putting forward our views of the Iranian nuclear program,&quot; Rhodes told the White House press briefing. &quot;And one of the things that we were heartened by is that that session very much focused on the nuclear issue. And in the past, some of these negotiations have drawn in many other issues that the Iranians wanted to talk about. But we were heartened that there was a focus on the nuclear program, and, frankly, a clear indication that the Iranians were feeling a degree of pressure from those sanctions.&quot;</p> \n<p> Rhodes went on to say that at this week's session, in Baghdad, between Iran and representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany (the P5 +1 ) &quot;what we expect to do is to begin a discussion around concrete confidence-building measures that could build the confidence in the international community and the peaceful nature of the Iranian program, and move them in line with their international obligations.&quot; The current emphasis, he said, was on forward movement, but not yet on reaching the goal. The aim was to bring recalcitrant Iran to its senses and back into the family of nations.</p> \n<p> &quot;Right now, we are certainly planning to move forward with our sanctions in coordination with our partners. That would include the EU oil embargo. If the Iranians were to fully live up to their commitments, we would obviously take that into account in reviewing our sanctions. But I think what we have said to the Iranians and publicly is that as they take steps to build confidence, we will meet that action with action, and there will be reciprocal steps taken by the international community, but it depends on how dramatic and concrete and irreversible the steps are that the Iranians take. And so right now, in the absence of that action having taken place, we're fully intending to move forward with the oil embargo.&quot;</p> \n<p> Rhodes was then asked by a journalist, &quot;But it doesn't sound like you're expecting anything that dramatic to happen in time to avert the oil embargo.&quot;</p> \n<p> &quot;Well, yes,&quot; Rhodes responded, &quot;we think the discussions in Baghdad will be, again, a beginning of a negotiation around confidence-building steps. I'm sure that there will be concrete proposals that are discussed at that meeting. Just given the way that these negotiations go, we certainly don't expect to resolve completely the issue of the Iranian nuclear program in that particular meeting. There will have to be continued discussions going forward.</p> \n<p> &quot;So it's important for the Iranians to understand that given the status quo,&quot; Rhodes continued, &quot;given where we are right now, they should fully expect and anticipate that oil embargo to go into place. And the onus is on them, frankly, to demonstrate through not just pledges but concrete actions that they're moving in a different direction before we could consider that level of sanctions easing. But we are willing, as I said, to meet them with reciprocal actions if they do begin to move in the right direction.&quot;</p> \n<p> Why, then, does one suspect that Israel, or at least the Netanyahu government, is not exactly praying for the success of sanctions, which ostensibly have the chance to eliminate a worrisome existential threat? One gets the strong impression that these two contrasting strategies, that of Iran and that of Israel, are at broad cross-purposes. Israel is the sane state that is threatening to go insane, while Iran is the wild one that is prepared to be domesticated. And if Obama believes Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's declarations more than he does Netanyahu's warnings, until proven otherwise, this creates an extreme shift in the situation.</p> \n<p> Heavy moral burden</p> \n<p> Right now, Israel's hands are tied. An attack on Iran, which is now being considered, would not be justified. In fact, it would cast Israel in the role of lawbreaker. Bombing Iran would obliterate the most persuasive evidence of a weapons program and leave strong question marks. Over the next few months, then, we will be seeing an intelligence battle, in which each side will lay ambushes, waiting for the other side to commit a hasty or complacent mistake. In this battle, the Iranians will have the advantage: They can restrain themselves. In Israel, the challenge will be an internal one, pitting the tension between the team of Netanyahu and Barak, on the one hand, against the professional echelons of the intelligence community, on the other, both in terms of the facts and in how they are interpreted.</p> \n<p> A heavy moral burden will be placed on the shoulders of Military Intelligence head Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi and the director of his research division, Brig. Gen. Itai Brun, to focus on data gathering and evaluation - with absolute objectivity, without allowing themselves to be lured into co-opting the prestige of Israel's military intelligence to score propaganda or diplomatic points at the behest of the political leadership.</p> \n<p> From the American side, MI and the Mossad will face an intelligence community that is without doubt loyal to President Obama and his secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, a former CIA director. The current CIA director, former army general David Petraeus, is an expert on the Iranian file, dating from his days in Iraq and as commander of the Central Command, where he was responsible for U.S. operations in 20 countries between Egypt and Pakistan. He is friendly with the current and former IDF top brass, perhaps most of all with former Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi, but not necessarily with an Israel that is trigger-happy on Iran, a la Netanyahu.</p> \n<p> Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who was Petraeus' intelligence officer in Afghanistan and was subsequently on loan to the CIA, is the newly appointed head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's intelligence service. The newly nominated chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force is Mark A. Welsh, a general who also served in the CIA during the Panetta era. They and their colleagues, including chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin E. Dempsey - who scrupulously toes the administration's line when it comes to the question of Iran's nuclear program and an Israeli operation against it - would not turn a blind eye to a clumsy Israeli fabrication of evidence.</p> \n<p> The official line, according to which Obama, Panetta and Petraeus would have no advance knowledge of an Israeli decision to flout the administration and mount an attack on Iran, does not jive with Israel's dependence on the American missile shield. In order to complement local systems for the interception of Iran's Shahab missiles, Israel needs the ships of the U.S.'s Sixth Fleet across from Haifa and Ashdod, and the high-powered American radar deployed at the Nevatim air base, near Be'er Sheva. Without them, the home front would be overly exposed. The Iron Dome defense system is ineffective against long-range and heavy-payload missiles.</p> \n<p> It was instructive to watch last week's disagreement between the Pentagon and Congress on the financing of Iron Dome. In their generosity toward Israel, and their expectation that the Israel supporters among their voters would compensate them with similar generosity, the legislators said that a sum of $680 million should be poured into the program, which constitutes a great deal more than Israel is even able to absorb in the next few years. At the same time, they are calling for sharp cuts to the U.S. military budget, amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars. The Pentagon proposed an addition of $70 million to Iron Dome, representing about one-tenth of the congressional grant. Ehud Barak expressed his gratitude to Obama and Panetta, and it is good that he did so. It would be bad if Israel were to come across as the self-serving wedge between the Pentagon and Congress.</p> \n<p> You don't win with defense</p> \n<p> Addressing this week's annual conference of the Fisher Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies in Herzliya, Brig. Gen. Hagai Topolansky, the head of the Israel Air Force staff, cautioned against &quot;falling in love with defense, while neglecting attack.&quot; He reasoned that &quot;anyone who thinks it is possible to win with defense is making an egregious mistake.&quot;</p> \n<p> The IAF's current five-year plan has its strike force acquiring F-35 stealth bombers. Lockheed Martin, which manufactures the plane, may be hot to sell it, but an administration that is furious with Israel in the wake of a foolish attack on Iran is liable to express its displeasure through a slowdown in deliveries. The entire IDF will have to quickly accustom itself to the new and changing realities in the region, such as the conversations held in Tehran by the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, and the presidential elections in Egypt and the talks in Baghdad.</p> \n<p> As it sits down to plot its new multiyear plan, the army has to have a firm idea of where the government is heading. If Netanyahu and Barak signal to the general staff that Israel will have to accept a suspension of the possible conflict with Iran, the IDF would, in the months to come, begin to divert its resources to greater preparedness in nearer arenas, such as Iran's proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and perhaps also Syria.</p> \n<p> There is no practical capability of doing everything at the same time. If circumstances change and the top army brass do not react accordingly, the prolonged need for readiness on the Iran front, which is tying up valuable assets needed in other arenas, will end up being a very expensive whim.</p> \n<p> The last resort</p> \n<p> At the initiative of an organization that is working to foster closer relations between American Jews, the Pentagon and Israel, former chief of staff Dan Halutz paid visits last month to the academies of three branches of the American armed forces - the army's West Point, the navy's Annapolis and the air force's Colorado Springs. At all three, Halutz expressed what the current generation of the IDF general staff and the IAF are thinking: a military operation against the Iranian nuclear program should be a last resort.</p> \n<p> Halutz resigned as chief of staff in 2007, prior to publication of the interim report of the Winograd Commission. Last week, a member of that commission, Prof. Yehezkel Dror, published an essay that called for an attack on Iran. At the same time, Dror wrote, Israel should adopt a regional peace initiative. Perhaps when the next war ends, Halutz will be on the commission of inquiry before which Dror will be called, to explain his support for the adventure.</p> \n<p> History has known instances of countries that tried to outsmart inspectors conducting tours of their nuclear facilities and prevent them from entering corridors that led to the holy of holies of their operation. But not everyone is hankering for ambiguousness. As opposed to states that strove to gain nuclear capability on the sly, keeping their bombs under wraps down in the cellar, it may be that the Iranians are in fact interested in showing off their missiles, out in the open.</p> \n<p> In the end, everything depends on Iranian behavior. Can a liar change his stripes? According to Shaul Mofaz, one of Israel's greatest experts both on Persians and on Netanyahu, there is hope.</p>",

        "text":["<p> It's a day Israelis will never forget: Feb. 1, 2003, when national pride abruptly turned to national tragedy.</p> \n<p> People gathered around their TV screens to watch the anticipated return of Israel's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, from a 16-day journey in space aboard the American Columbia shuttle. A hero's welcome awaited, but as people watched the live broadcast, unbelieving, the shuttle craft disintegrated upon re-entering the atmosphere, killing Ramon and his six crewmates.</p> \n<p> For Ramon's widow, Rona, it was the first in a pair of cruel blows. Six years later, her oldest son, Asaf, who had followed in his father's footsteps to become an Israeli air force fighter pilot, was killed in a training accident.</p> \n<p> Ramon, 48, is still unable to discuss the loss of her son. &quot;I live that every moment, but at the same time try to still look for meaning in life,&quot; Ramon said in a phone interview.</p> \n<p> She said she has slowly tried to recover, leading a foundation formed in memory of her husband and son and counseling others who are coping with tragedy.</p> \n<p> As the country's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon was a national hero, and Israelis closely followed his accomplishments. Ramon's image while floating in space, a big smile on his face, was shown repeatedly on TV broadcasts.</p> \n<p> Though he was not religious, Ramon, who was 48 when he was killed, insisted on keeping Jewish kosher dietary laws in space, since he saw himself a representative of the Jewish people. He consulted a rabbi on how to observe his faith in orbit.</p> \n<p> A son of a Holocaust survivor, he also took several meaningful items into space, including a pencil sketch of the moon drawn by a young Jew who later perished at the Nazi Auschwitz death camp. Ramon also took a miniature Torah scroll rescued from the Holocaust, along with other religious items.</p> \n<p> Ten years later, the memory of the Columbia accident is still strong in Israel. Though the country is accustomed to national tragedies, the Columbia disaster was especially painful. An uplifting journey had captivated a nation and elicited great hope and promise, yet in a minute it turned into an outpouring of grief.</p> \n<p> &quot;What I remember most from that day was the expectation, the joy and the longing to see him return. The great loss that followed left me heartbroken,&quot; Ramon told The Associated Press. With the families of the other astronauts, she was at the Florida landing site, waiting for the shuttle. &quot;I remember the moment we realized what had happened, and they removed us from the landing site. I just looked up at the sky and said 'God, bring him back to me.&quot;'</p> \n<p> Ilan Ramon, a fighter pilot who took part in Israel's bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981, has become a national icon. Dozens of schools and other institutions are named after him. Each year, NASA sends a delegation to a space conference held in his honor. This year's is in progress now.</p> \n<p> Rona Ramon largely stayed out of the public eye for years following his death, trying to make sense of her loss. &quot;Realizing in a moment that your life has changed forever is a huge shock,&quot; she said. But on Sept. 13, 2009, she was forced back into the spotlight by the death of their oldest son.</p> \n<p> Capt. Asaf Ramon, who was 21, was killed when his F-16 warplane crashed in a routine training flight. Inspired by his father, he had excelled in his training and was awarded his pilot's wings by President Shimon Peres. Asaf had expressed hope that he, too, would one day become an astronaut.</p> \n<p> The pair of tragedies inspired Rona Ramon to earn an M.A. in holistic health from Lesley University in Massachusetts. She has branched out to psycho-spiritual coaching in hopes of better helping others cope with personal tragedies.</p> \n<p> &quot;The decision to go study emerged from the crisis I went through,&quot; she said. &quot;Only by directly facing it could I cope.&quot;</p> \n<p> Her studies have helped her recognize that she is now coping with &quot;anniversary grief.&quot;</p> \n<p> &quot;Time is tricky. Over time you lose objectivity,&quot; she said. &quot;Sometimes it feels like it happened ages ago and sometimes it feels like it just happened.&quot;</p> \n<p> Over the past few years she has found comfort in her work at The Ramon Foundation, a nonprofit she established that promotes personal and social excellence through space, flight, science and technology. She also gives speeches across Israel and offers grief counseling to others.</p> \n<p> She has three surviving children. One son is studying music in college. The other, with her consent, is a combat soldier in the army and her daughter is in high school.</p> \n<p> Ilan's parents, who also became well-known figures in Israel during the Columbia mission, have since passed away.</p> \n<p> On her way to Tuesday's opening of the Annual International Ilan Ramon Space Conference, hosting 14 heads of space agencies from around the world, including NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, Rona Ramon said Tuesday that she mostly felt pride in her family.</p> \n<p> &quot;I'm surrounded by so many friends and so much support,&quot; she said. &quot;When I think of Ilan, the first thing I think about is his smile. That is his legacy.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>When R. was a girl, she came into the possession of the books in the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; series, which her parents did not allow her to read. One Yom Kippur, when her family was at synagogue, she slipped away from the women's section. In her parents' room she shed a tear when the protagonists, Anne Shirley and Gilbert Blythe, kissed for the first time. When she became engaged a year later, she expected that some of her innocent, romantic fantasies would come true in her own marriage.</p> \n<p>On her wedding night, her brand-new husband called her into the living room, where a large picture of the Admor of Gur - the rabbinic leader of that Hasidic sect - hung on the wall. He told her she had to imagine the rebbe's face when she observed the mitzvah of ishut (conjugal relations ), so that she would have &quot;righteous&quot; children.</p> \n<p>As she tells this story, R., who is now 30 years old, shakes her short-cropped head as if in disbelief. A few years ago, already the mother of two children, she divorced her husband and left the Gur Hasidic sect.</p> \n<p>R. was outraged by the research, whose findings were described last week in Haaretz, about the concept of kedusha (sanctity ) among Gur Hasidism, which revealed the ethos of prishut (separation ) and its strict practices aimed at restraining sexuality. According to her, the depiction of these sacred strictures as merely a supreme value, to which the Hasidim are prepared to devote themselves totally, is imprecise, to put it mildly.</p> \n<p>Gur is a large Hasidic sect, numbering tens of thousands of members. Most of them follow the &quot;official line&quot; they are taught in their schools and yeshivas. However, quite a considerable number observe the strictures only during the first years of their marriage, and thereafter see them as guidelines that can be relaxed in the privacy of their own homes.</p> \n<p>R. and her girlfriends who were raised in hard-core Gur families - some of whom left Hasidism by the skin of their teeth - speak of the heavy psychological price paid by women living in a world where kedusha constitutes an ongoing, restrictive way of life, imposed with severe emotional coldness. They describe a society in which the men, who until their wedding night hardly ever have looked directly at a woman, keep their distance and alienate themselves from their wives as well.</p> \n<p>The women's descriptions were embellished by male former Gur Hasidim who spoke about the implications of being educated toward a life of prishut. Out of the desire to maintain their relationships with family members who are still part of the Gur community, most of the speakers preferred not to identify themselves by name.</p> \n<p>According to Dr. Benjamin Brown, of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, criticism of the regulations laid down by the late Rabbi Israel Alter (also known as the Beis Yisroel ), who led Gur from 1948 to 1977, goes back as far as the 1960s. Among the critics was Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky (1899-1985 ), known as the Steipler. Kanievsy was the brother-in-law of the world-renowned rabbinical authority Rabbi Avraham Yeshaya Karelitz (the &quot;Hazon Ish,&quot; who lived 1878-1953 ) and the father of Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, one of the leading rabbinical authorities in Bnei Brak today.</p> \n<p>The Steipler wrote that one should not necessarily act according to the sect's strict regulations, which he said mainly cause suffering to women. To this day his views are studied in instruction sessions for bridegrooms in the Lithuanian (non-Hasidic ) ultra-Orthodox community, who are encouraged not to refrain from sexual relations. Among other things, the Steipler wrote: &quot;It is known that a woman's main hope in her world is to have a husband who loves her ... but heaven forfend that he observe the measure of prishut, whereby he hurts his wife.&quot;</p> \n<p>The commandants </p> \n<p>R. was considered a good and pious student at the seminary for young women where she studied. Her family, which had a lofty status within Gur, arranged a match with a groom who did not deviate one iota from the doctrine of kedusha.</p> \n<p>&quot;My family,&quot; R. recalls, &quot;were good people with good values, but my husband was the product of his education. In Gur sex is a sin. He was convinced that if he loved one woman, this would be a slippery slope and he would become a pervert. The men are severely warned about this.&quot;</p> \n<p>At the only encounter she had with him before the engagement, R. did not like her designated groom, she says, &quot;But I thought that if the Rebbe of Gur says it's suitable, then it's suitable. The Rebbe is not God's messenger on earth: He is God.&quot;</p> \n<p>At the wedding, she recalls, &quot;When we were in yihud [where the couple is left alone immediately after the wedding ceremony], he kept making sure that the fabric of my dress wouldn't touch him. My feeling was that he found me disgusting.&quot;</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, R. says she wanted to love the man who was intended for her: &quot;I kept trying to connect with him, even during the time I was fighting the rules [of kedusha]. I tried to explain to him that this [sort of life] was irrational. But that didn't help.&quot;</p> \n<p>In Gur Hasidism, there is a network of men called commandants, who counsel the young grooms regarding marital relations. If there is one thing L., a friend of R.'s, could not stand in her marriage, she notes, it was the commandant's intervention in her intimate life.</p> \n<p>L.: &quot;Early on in my marriage, it sometimes happened that at 1:30 A.M. on the night of my immersion [in the mikveh, or ritual bath, to render her pure for marital relations], he would phone to consult. The commandant told my husband to set a clock for 3 A.M. because only until dawn is it possible to observe the mitzvah. We fell asleep and suddenly the alarm clock rang. It was pitch dark - because in marital relations you cover even the light of the clock. I didn't wake up. The whole evening I had cleansed myself in order to be immersed in the purification pool at the mikveh. I had worked that day. I was tired. And nevertheless he performed the mitzvah. If that isn't rape, what is it? That's how we started out life. Already the next day, you are ritually impure.&quot;</p> \n<p>D., a former Gur member who also fled the sect with her two children, describes entire nights when she sat in the bathroom and wept because her husband treated her cruelly. &quot;While I would cry, he would be fast asleep in his bed, a meter and a half from me, clutching his tzitzit, with an angelic smile on his face,&quot; she relates.</p> \n<p>D.'s husband, who actually came from a more open family and thus presumably wasn't committed to kedusha, used the regulations as a weapon against her. Sara Einfeld, a former Gur Hasid, says: &quot;Men are liable to use this to control their wives and avoid treating them well, in the guise of spiritual 'elevation.'&quot;</p> \n<p>Yiddishkeit </p> \n<p>Y., a Gur Hasid, sent me the following message: &quot;It is important to me that our outcry reach the sane world,&quot; he wrote.</p> \n<p>We met under the cover of darkness in a secular neighborhood in Jerusalem. A fellow in his late 20s, Y. appears to be a full-fledged Gur Hasid, but inwardly he has stopped believing and he abhors the sect's rules.</p> \n<p>&quot;When I was nine or 10 years old,&quot; he recalls, &quot;the mashgiah [supervisor] at the heder called the children in for personal talks. That's how I understood for the first time that there are things about the body that are forbidden. In the conversations with the counselors the feeling is that they are walking on eggshells. On the one hand they are warning you [about sex] and on the other hand trying to withhold information that there is such a thing as sex. There is a code name for this: Yiddishkeit [Jewishness, a Jewish way of life].</p> \n<p>&quot;When I was 15 the mashgiah interrogated me, asking: 'What happens with you at night in bed?' He became all serious when I told him - completely naively. 'These are absolute prohibitions,' he reprimanded me. I was very upset and kept thinking how I could do penitence. This is the main frame of mind in Gur, beating your breast for the terrible sin of sexuality.&quot;</p> \n<p>Y. learned to walk along side streets quickly, and with his eyes cast down: &quot;We didn't know what we were missing out on. I wasn't even thinking about women then. I didn't see my body. At the mikveh we'd compete to see who could go in and get out the fastest. There was one boy who managed to take his dip and get dressed, all in nine minutes.&quot;</p> \n<p>Presumably a young man who has grown up completely separated from any female figure will feel strange when he is brought before a woman on the eve of his engagement. Indeed, says Y.: &quot;The meeting was one big stutter,&quot; he relates. &quot;I felt I was riding in a train and there was an engine pulling me. I did not have an independent opinion, I was so accustomed to my parents deciding for me.&quot;</p> \n<p>Y. did not see his intended at all during the next two months. &quot;You are not allowed to think about her, about the wedding, at all. I would not have recognized her in the street had I seen her. It's a disaster that there is no guidance for bridegrooms before the wedding. When the counselor told me, two hours before the ceremony, about a woman's period and intimate relations - I was in shock. After all, my whole life they had taught us that this was something forbidden.&quot;</p> \n<p>Like many grooms, Y. fainted during the conversation with the counselor. There are others who throw up. &quot;I saw black circles in front of my eyes and all of a sudden I found myself on the sofa,&quot; he recalls.</p> \n<p>But the greatest crisis of all came when Y. realized he could not establish a relationship with his wife: &quot;I was not supposed to know anything about love, but I remember myself praying to God to bring me a match that would grant me love and a real relationship.&quot;</p> \n<p>Y.'s wife did not want to budge from the strictures of the sect, he adds: &quot;She believes that if she opens up to my love, she will damage her 'paradise.'&quot;</p> \n<p>Nor did Y.'s counselor leave him alone. &quot;I got a phone call. They had told him I had walked in the street with my wife&quot; - which is against Gur regulations. &quot;After that I got it. I would wait for my wife at the bus stop to help her with the stroller and the children. In Gur it is forbidden to help a woman.&quot;</p> \n<p>A., also a young man in his twenties, has had doubts about being a Gur Hasid, but has decided to remain in the sect. He says he keeps making efforts to lessen the feeling of alienation he feels from his wife, and she - whom he defines as &quot;one of the strong ones&quot; (in terms of faith ) - has made some concessions. Today this enables him to live within the community, and yet he still does not forgive it for meddling in his life when he was an adolescent.</p> \n<p>&quot;The institution of the commandants is a disgusting mechanism in my opinion,&quot; he says. &quot;When I was about 14 years old, a mashgiah interrogated me about some strange thoughts that I was having. I was an innocent lamb. He succeeded in exposing my innermost self, he drew out the marrow of my bones. I am damaged to this day because they did not respect my intimacy. I think this is sexual abuse in every respect. They gave me to understand that hell awaited me if I didn't confess.&quot;</p> \n<p>A. believes that the institution of the commandants serves as a refuge for Hasidim, who satisfy their own lustful urges by means of voyeurism and conversations about the sexuality of married couples and young boys.</p> \n<p>&quot;They are obsessively concerned with this,&quot; he says. &quot;There are also wonderful people, counselors who help in matters of fertility, for example, but they are few.&quot;</p> \n<p>According to A., the commandants have total independence, and in the absence of a written code of kedusha, also encourage extremism.</p> \n<p>A. himself was released from some of the constraints of kedusha thanks to his financial independence. According to him, &quot;Gur Hasidism applies force mainly upon the young learners, who are 'nourished' around the community table. The moment the Hasid starts working, like me, he is not dependent on them.&quot;</p> \n<p>By force of pride </p> \n<p>In R.'s former environment, she says, they continue to this day to live by the rules of kedusha. &quot;The girls in my class, my aunts, my sisters-in-law, my sisters - all of them are living that way.&quot;</p> \n<p>At one time she went along with them: &quot;I wasn't educated to be critical. I lived in a sheltered world. I thought people only do good. That it's necessary to admire the admor. I didn't wake up until my marriage. Then I realized that a woman in Gur is a vessel in the service of the man. I envied men for going to learn when I had to clean and cook. I was strangled by the kedusha rules, and in the end it was a matter of life and death for me - and I preferred to leave.&quot;</p> \n<p>R. adds, &quot;Most of the women are submissive because they don't know anything about rabbinical law or Gemara. In the Gemara there are stories that are full of sexuality, but [the authorities] only teach the line about Rabbi Eliezer, who had intercourse with his wife as though possessed. The women can't fight it because they don't know that both things exist.</p> \n<p>&quot;Women hold themselves together thanks to the pride instilled in them for being part of a select unit. Look at the others, they are told - look at the secular, look at the Lithuanians: They are like cats. We are angels, ascetics. And if the women want something different, they are ashamed. You are not supposed to want your husband to stay home and not travel to the Rebbe [in Jerusalem] every three weeks. After all, you are driving him to sin, and causing him to stray from the path of Hasidism - and you definitely don't want him to hug you.&quot;</p> \n<p>R. agrees that it is possible for relations of mutual respect and caring to develop even in the most pious Gur families. But that is not enough, she notes: &quot;There is emotional alienation. There are no demonstrations of affection, the whole matter is taboo. It reminds me of marriages in royal dynasties in Europe intended for the perpetuation of the kingdom.&quot;</p> \n<p>S., a Gur Hasid of 30 who has left religion, recently attended his sister's wedding. &quot;I saw how she was dragged to the wedding canopy with an opaque cloth covering her face,&quot; he relates. &quot;I thought about how she was feeling, thinking that soon someone would be touching her in an automatic and insensitive way, and I wept. I think this is traumatic, but I know that her culture and her locked-up world prevent her from feeling what they are doing to her.&quot;</p> \n<p>This is the second of two articles.</p>",

The incident began when the driver of a small car refused to heed the police's demand to stop. The Border Policeman, part of a back-up force that was called in, was injured in the shoulder and hand when he got out of his vehicle to wave down the car. The driver, from the Palestinian part of Bartaa, and his two passengers, were arrested.

Kiryat Shmona police said the man, a local resident, was bruised on his face, but they were unable to ascertain whether he had died as the result of a criminal act. Investigators, led by station commander Chief Superintendent Fares Faraj, are looking into the possibility that the man had been hit by a car or had fallen for some reason.

Abargil, who appeared uninjured when he arrived at the police station, despite reports of a broken nose, is believed to have been fighting with his men, against forces of the rival Alperon clan. The incident shook up both the underworld and the police, because the two groups were believed to be collaborating with each other. The brawl supposedly began as a disagreement over control of the bottle-recycling industry.

        "text":["<p>&quot;The Tree of Life: A Trilogy of Life in the Lodz Ghetto&quot; by Chava Rosenfarb, translated from the Yiddish by the author, in collaboration with Goldie Morgentaler - &quot;Book One: On the Brink of the Precipice, 1939,&quot; University of Wisconsin Press, Terrace Books, 314 pages, $16.95; &quot;Book Two: From the Depths I Call You, 1940-1942,&quot; University of Wisconsin Press, Terrace Books, 398 pages, $21.95; &quot;Book Three: The Cattle Cars are Waiting, 1942-1944,&quot; University of Wisconsin Press, Terrace Books, 376 pages, $21.95 </p> \n<p>The Holocaust didn't annihilate Judaism or the Jewish people or its languages or their literatures, but it did cause all this to become if not reinvented, then greatly rethought. The most modern or revised of this rethinking holds that the most necessary works of art created about such disasters as war or genocide must themselves internalize that disaster, make it not only subject, but also style - imbuing the very flesh of the text or canvas, marble or musical score with all the scars and the wounds; literally representing its images in the exorcism of words that have become almost horrifically too familiar by now, words such as gas, trains, ovens and ghetto. </p> \n<p>The best of this canon embodies its trauma, as in the poems and novels of Paul Celan, Nelly Sachs, the early Jakov Lind and the late Hermann Broch, all of whom continued to write in the murderers' German. In their works, words become utterances; phrases are left unfinished, or unmade. Theirs is the practice of a negative tikkun [mending of flaws], a literature made proudly of shards. But what then to make of Yiddish, a language without vocabulary for most of the technology and officialdom that spelled out the deaths of its speakers, a tongue subsuming any great distinction of rank or inflection between its highest literary utterances and its lowest gutter expression? </p> \n<p>What then of the achievement of octogenarian Yiddish master Chava Rosenfarb, native of Lodz, now resident of Toronto? Recently translated by her, with the help of her daughter, Rosenfarb's three-volume opus offers no suffering internalized as typography, no narrative manner made servant to subject. &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; is a novel - in the oldest, most genuine sense. Rosenfarb begins her plot nine months before Nazi occupation, and ends it upon the eve of Lodz's deportation to Auschwitz - two enormous events that serve to bookend the daily existences of over 50 characters whom history failed. </p> \n<p>The ghetto beckons  </p> \n<p> With the trilogy's enormous cast, canvas and multitudes of notes and strokes, its touches of Tolstoy and Proust and just about anyone else who ever attempted an epic, Rosenfarb's novel might seem an anachronism. Here are nearly 1,000 pages of small-font text, written in the third person; there are many, many people here all saying many, many things (about Bundism, communism, Zionism - every &quot;ism&quot; under the European sun, it seems); various ideas are debated, letters are written, loves are won and lost; the prose is quiet and expert with the most confident culture. Rosenfarb's is civilized, controlled art made of and about one of the worst historical hells: Lodz, Poland, the decline and fall of its Jews, their ghetto and its eventual liquidation in the fires of Auschwitz. </p> \n<p>&quot;Book One: On the Brink of the Precipice, 1939&quot; begins with the New Year and its celebration, giving a taste of what life had been for Lodz's most prominent Jews; its turn, despite all the food, drinking and music, will bring only destruction. These are assimilated people, industrialists and artists, hyphenated-Poles. All indications are subtle and smart, right from the very first sentence. &quot;Samuel Zuckerman was born in Lodz. His great-grandfather Shmuel Ichaskel Zuckerman had been among the first Jews to leave the Ghetto and settle downtown.&quot; Though the Yiddish Shmuel begets an assimilationist Samuel with a fine house and attractive, educated daughters and a lifestyle seemingly second to only that of the Rosenbergs, to be introduced later - the ghetto beckons, calls in its strays. Samuel, the inheritor of Shmuel's Talmud and Torah, considers writing a history of his family's rise; his first page is about the brink of its fall. This ghetto is the setting for the two following volumes, &quot;From the Depths I Call You, 1940-1942,&quot; and &quot;The Cattle Cars are Waiting, 1942-1944.&quot; </p> \n<p>The fall of the Zuckermans' fortunes is intelligently wrought as Rosenfarb soon shuffles her focuses between the lives of that clan and those of the natives of the ghetto, those families who'd always lived in Baluty not because they'd been forced to yet, but because its small, cramped flats were all they could ever afford. &quot;'The Jews of Baluty are privileged. They don't have to move into the ghetto,'&quot; says Sheyne Pessele, the woman upon whose shoulders much of this trilogy's symbolism becomes rooted. Like an eastern Zola or Balzac, Rosenfarb ably engages the economic, educational and social stratifications at work here, the class lines like barbed wire that keep people imprisoned in circumstances of birth and of luck. Pessele, wife of Itche Mayer, whose family's fortunes are actually improved in the resettlement, refuses to join the other women in gloating, &quot;taking delight in the fact that they had lived to see their hour of vengeance on the rich, who must now move to the slums of Baluty.&quot; </p> \n<p>The Zuckermans soon exit to make room for the Haggadic four sons of Mayer and Pessele: Israel, Mottle, Yossi and Shalom, each of them enamored of a different political movement, none of which would offer salvation. Besides Mayer, a carpenter earthier than Christ, and Pessele, who used to make wigs, we have Mietek, a fallen ghetto policeman, and Mayer's uncle, Blind Henech, a baker of loaves; there is a doctor, Michael Levine, and a teacher, Dora Diamand, whose name seems an homage to Kafka's last love. Any roll call must have echoes of the Appellplatz to come: Guttman is a painter, Bunim Berkovitch a poet; there are historical personages reborn here as David and Rachel and Miriam, Adam the first man and Abraham the first Jew. </p> \n<p>In all their circumscribed existences, these characters are as rings within rings, the setting or amassing of growths, the trunk's layers - perhaps that of the titular Tree. And not a tree of Eden, but one more mundane, more real: a cherry tree, planted by Pessele in the yard just off Hockel Street, bearing its small sour berries in spring, weathering winter. &quot;It seemed strange, almost abnormal that a tree should burst into bloom in such surroundings. And this marvel, which bordered on the miraculous, filled people's hearts both with hope and with a kind of philosophical resentment - that the world, that Mother Nature carried on as if nothing had happened.&quot; Its very existence sustains the soul as much as its fruit sustains hunger, starvation; its cherries comfort Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski toward the third volume's end. In a cattle car: &quot;Abraham tried to free himself from Old Rumkowski's body pressing against him. He finally succeeded. He reached out for his breadsack and drew a little cup out of it. He touched the old man's knee, 'Here, Mr. Rumkowski, taste a cherry from our cherry tree ... It's a remedy for the heart.'&quot; </p> \n<p>Haunting personages  </p> \n<p>Rumkowski, too, is deported, but not without first being welcomed back into the community with the fruit of a terrible knowledge. One of a few real historical personages who haunt these pages (including his Nazi double, the terrifying Hans Biebow, the ghetto's Nazi administrator), Rumkowski was king of the ghetto, the president of the Jews. And he is presented here, as he has been in many other accounts, both fictive and testimonial, as a colloquy of too many selves - self-important one moment, self-sacrificing the next. He begins as a laughable character, almost a caricature, a schnorrer always scraping for funds for his orphanage, an unwanted guest, the community's necessary burden. He ends as a king the equal of Lear, sad and mad, a victim of his own megalomania. </p> \n<p>As this Book of Life turns its final pages, the tapestry becomes unwound; the Mona Lisa is turned around, to smile herself at the wall. The entire greater fiction that is the epic novel of characters and events and invention and dialogue and explanation ad infinitum comes to a halt; the trains whistle; the station is silent; the culture of Europe has become overturned. After page 362, it seems no longer possible for Rosenfarb to write novels or poems in which various things happen to various people, in which punctuation indicates breath, in which sentences come to an end; as the deportations pull out of Lodz, Rosenfarb gives headings in bold: Chapter Twenty-nine ... Thirty ... Thirty-one ... ad infinitum. We readers witness the breakdown of language and literature, finally countenanced and itself mourned after almost 1,000 pages of realism doomed. The text of these massed chapters is short and capitalized, bringing death-final closure: &quot;AUSCHWITZ. WORDS STOP, UNDRESSED, NAKED, THEIR MEANING, THEIR SENSE SHAVEN OFF. LETTERS EXPIRE IN THE SMOKE OF THE CREMATORIUM'S CHIMNEY ...&quot; </p> \n<p>Joshua Cohen's latest books are a novel, &quot;Cadenza for the Schneidermann Violin Concerto&quot; (Fugue State Press), and a translation from Czech of &quot;I, City,&quot; a collection of stories by Pavel Brycz (Twisted Spoon). </p> \n<p>By arrangement with the Forward </p>",

        "text":["<p>It's undoubtedly true that the current financial crisis is hitting the Jewish world hard, but it just might offer a great opportunity for reshaping the relationship between donors and recipients. Let me offer three personal experiences that I see as emblematic of what Jewish organizations are going through. </p> \n<p>Next week, the European Jewish Congress will hold a presidential election. Roger Cukierman, the former president of CRIF, French Jewry's representative body, has challenged the current president, Russian-born Moshe Kantor. Cukierman might not be the revolutionary leader that world Jewry seeks in these murky times, but he is a decent man by all standards, entirely devoted to his fellow Jews. But one of Cukierman's people told me last week that when they called on European community leaders to ask for their support, the general response they received has been in the following vein: &quot;We feel closer to Cukierman, but at the end of the day, the question is who has deeper pockets. Kantor proved that he has got very deep pockets. You know, we are in dire financial straits ...&quot; </p> \n<p>A few weeks earlier, I attended the 4th Limmud Conference in Istanbul, where 1,200 people gathered to learn and share their ideas about the future of their community. One evening, at a meeting with some of them, I listened to a discussion about the financial hardship facing the local Jewish day school, renowned for its quality and vitality. A generous American supporter of the school had recently reported that he was not renewing his multi-million dollar pledge, asserting his belief that long-term support for the school should come from local Jews. The announcement could not have come at a worse time, with donations within the community shrinking, as donors are caught in the claws of the financial monster. </p> \n<p>A week later, on my way to a conference in England, I read the London Jewish Chronicle of November 14, whose front page boasted a headline reading, &quot;Cash Crisis Rocks Chabad.&quot; Chabad, as we all were subsequently reminded, in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks, is an empire, with 4,000 emissaries worldwide, 3,300 community centers spread throughout 70 countries, and 129 schools in benefactor Lev Leviev's Or Avner network. According to the report, Leviev is the problem: &quot;The world's biggest Jewish outreach group faces a cash crisis fueled by fears that its biggest donor, billionaire diamond mogul Lev Leviev, may slash funding due to his own financial difficulties.&quot; </p> \n<p>These are but three examples among thousands of how the crisis is striking at Jewish organized life. None of this is exactly surprising. A group of humans linked globally is fated to be affected by a global financial crisis. I would propose, however, that we ask ourselves how we managed to respond so well to the challenges of the past. </p> \n<p>One of the strengths of the post-war Jewish world has been its ability to harness critical philanthropic resources to respond to crises and to recognize that sometimes a crisis can be an opportunity. Our proudest moments were when we rallied to rescue Ethiopian Jews, or reached out to Jews left impoverished by the collapse of the USSR, let alone the most dramatic case, when Jews worldwide channeled critical donations to the new State of Israel in its early decades. All of these efforts were funded by precious Jewish philanthropy. </p> \n<p>Today's challenges may be different, but they are no less critical to our prospects of surviving and thriving. There are Jews in poverty and distress in scores of communities around the world. Israel's many vulnerable citizens continue to strive to be integrated in a growing and prospering society. And Jews globally still need transformative community experiences - educational, cultural and spiritual - to ensure the next generation's connection to Jewish life. </p> \n<p>The financial crisis should be a time for Jewish communal institutions to be increasing their activities, not cutting back. Let's not forget that after the tragedy of the Holocaust, when so much had to be reconstructed on the ruins of European Jewry, when so many members of world Jewry were but refugees on the march, there was little money, but plenty of commitment and a lot of vision. </p> \n<p>Here are three principles that served us well in the past, and that could help the Jewish world get over this crisis: For one, collective Jewish responsibility is global, not local. We should remember that each of us is committed to helping those who are far away as well as nearby. Second, we must coordinate so that resources go to where they are most critically needed. Today's Jewish philanthropy is more complex than ever. However, resource decisions must not be made arbitrarily but by shared wisdom and shared action. Ultimately, coordination can reduce dependence on individual donors. Finally, even in a time of crisis we should not only act in the interest of those who are needy - the hungry, the vulnerable - but also continue to invest in our community's future, for example in schools and Jewish community centers. </p> \n<p>Major donors are not going to stop giving, but they will give less. And as the basket shrinks, organizations will be left fighting for a diminished pool. This challenge should be seen as an opportunity for Jewish institutions to reform their programs and renew their vision, as they focus on what is the most important and relevant. The three principles can help us all achieve this. </p> \n<p>A century ago, during the heroic days of the Galilee colony of Sejera, a group of workers came to David Ben-Gurion to demand bread. &quot;Bread, I have not,&quot; was reportedly Ben-Gurion's answer, &quot;but I have a dream.&quot; Ben-Gurion was a practical man and a dreamer. We are tested more than ever in times of crises. Let us rise to the test with Ben-Gurion's leadership in our mind. </p> \n<p>Claude Kandiyoti is a Brussels-based entrepreneur and the publisher of Contact J, a monthly of the Belgian Jewish community. </p>",

        "text":["<p>Israeli-born Yonatan, 35, works in marketing and has lived in New York for a few years. He travels a lot on business, to Israel and elsewhere, yet never misses a single therapy session. He's known his therapist for years, and when he moved to New York six years ago, he wasn't prepared to give his sessions up. Since then, his therapy has been conducted via the Internet, and he describes it as one of the most intimate relationships in his life. Yonatan converses with his therapist from his living room, from the conference room in his office, from a hotel in a remote part of Russia and from all kinds of other places in America and Europe. In his view, his physical location is unimportant. </p> \n<p>Our conversation takes place via Skype, and touches on very personal subjects: He tells us about how he has coped with various crises in his life, about his therapy and how his relationship with his therapist has developed. In the background, we can hear the noise of his workplace around him. After about 15 minutes, one of the employees, sounding amused, says something. Yonatan listens to her for a moment, and then laughs. </p> \n<p>&quot;She's asking if there's really anyone on the other side of this conversation,&quot; he tells us, &quot;because I'm talking nonstop.&quot; </p> \n<p>We ask if it isn't difficult to talk about such personal things in front of others. &quot;Not at all,&quot; Yonatan says. &quot;I'm used to it.&quot; </p> \n<p>Two decades ago, a new concept was introduced into the ever-changing, tumultuous world of psychological therapy: that of two people - therapist and patient - engaging in genuine therapy without being in the same physical location. The dialogue is conducted by phone, via written messages or, increasingly, by means of video. E-therapy, as one method based on the Internet is called, is being used today by therapists all over the world, but not everyone welcomes the new technique with open arms, and some insist that it simply cannot work. </p> \n<p>The first foray into virtual therapy apparently occurred somewhere back in the early 1990s, in the United States. It was mostly conducted via e-mail, in forum chat rooms or by instant messaging. Since then, technology has advanced considerably and today it's possible to have a session on video, in real time and with a high degree of technical quality. </p> \n<p>Many therapists already work via the Internet as a matter of routine, but many others still regard online therapy with wariness or worse, and warn of the dangers lurking on either side of the Internet, for both therapists and patients. </p> \n<p>Dr. Jordan Lewinsky, a psychiatrist and Internet entrepreneur, has for years straddled the worlds of therapy and technology. He sees some patients online, in the framework of the Resolution Center, which he founded with a group of local therapists including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and coaches. </p> \n<p>&quot;We chose from the outset to work in this area, of Internet therapy, with the understanding that this is part of an inevitable process,&quot; says Lewinsky. &quot;It's clear that the whole world is going online, and that includes the therapeutic world. This is a process that is very frightening to the therapeutic community, both because of the newness of it and because it undermines many of the conventions to which we've grown accustomed.&quot; </p> \n<p>Lewinsky explains that beyond the convenience, in certain situations, online therapy is the ideal, and even the only solution. &quot;A good example is people who have difficulty leaving the house. In the past they were isolated, but now it's possible to offer them something. The same goes for people who have difficulty in forming a direct visual relationship: Now you can communicate with them via chat or e-mail. </p> \n<p>&quot;And of course there are less serious circumstances; like a person who happens to live in the far north where there are no psychiatrists within easy traveling distance, and nothing to serve his mental health needs. Or perhaps there is help available but he doesn't want people to know he's seeing a psychiatrist. Or he wants a certain type of therapy that isn't offered in his area. Today, someone like that can obtain therapy online. </p> \n<p>&quot;In fact,&quot; adds Lewinsky, &quot;this year, The Lancet, one of the most prestigious medical journals, published an article on a study done in England about treatment for depression. They examined two groups of patients from all over England. Half received regular therapy: They went to the family doctor and were given some kind of treatment, with or without drugs. </p> \n<p>&quot;The second group also obtained treatment via the clinic, but in addition, was also treated by psychotherapists via online chat. Of course, this group, recovered better. And eight months later, they were checked again and were still much better off than the group that didn't receive the extra therapy. It works. </p> \n<p>&quot;One has to remember that the new therapy methods just give us more opportunities. I'm not saying it's better or worse. I have never argued that it's preferable to face-to-face therapy. I'm just saying that, as in other areas, the Internet makes things possible that we couldn't do before.&quot; </p> \n<p>According to Lewinsky, many people today are interested in this method of treatment. Such as Yonatan. His therapy began in Israel, in the classic and familiar setting: the clinic. He was in his early twenties and in a very bad mental state, as he describes it. For three years, he met with a psychologist twice a week, face to face. When he moved to New York, his therapy ended. But three years later, after one meeting with his psychologist during a visit to Israel, he decided that it was time to go back to therapy, and asked her if she would treat him by phone. </p> \n<p>&quot;At first she wasn't very comfortable with the idea,&quot; he recalls. &quot;She uses a dynamic approach in her therapy, in which the dialectic - of facial expressions and body language [and verbal expression] - is important. She considered it for a long time and wanted to be sure I was aware of the drawbacks of such therapy. At one point, she even suggested I try seeing someone else. In the end, since we'd known each other for so many years, she consented. </p> \n<p>&quot;For the first two years we just talked on the phone, and when the technology advanced, we shifted to video chats. The change was amazing, because with the camera you see and not only hear, and that's a very important feeling. Having someone looking at you is a central component of the experience of intimate human contact.&quot; </p> \n<p>Online psychotherapy still seems almost subversive even today, and it must have felt that way when you started six years ago. </p> \n<p>Yonatan: &quot;True, but even then I was already very comfortable with the technology and that's part of it. But remember that when I proposed continuing the therapy long-distance, I'd already been living abroad for three years. Most of my communication with the people I cared about in the world was already taking place by phone and e-mail. To me it was a welcome addition, and quite natural.&quot; </p> \n<p>Glitches and silences  </p> \n<p>Therapeutic treatments by phone or by letters are familiar, albeit not very popular, methods, which are subject to certain professional ethical codes and established rules. Online therapy is similar to them, but also different. Ostensibly, it is like an ordinary conversation conducted by Internet chat. But the technology also creates a number of serious difficulties, and one of the biggest, say both therapists and patients, involves dealing with silence: What happens when one side is silent and the other is unable to observe accompanying signs or to decipher them: posture, body language, sighs? As any Internet user knows, silence during a chat can quickly give rise to all sorts of thoughts and fears. </p> \n<p>About 10 percent of the patients &quot;seen&quot; by Dr. Arnon Rolnick, a clinical psychologist from Ramat Gan, receive therapy online. Rolnick is a big believer in technology and its contribution to therapy, and he is currently working on a new biofeedback project that will enable him to also offer that type of therapy via the Web. </p> \n<p>&quot;Technical problems can hamper therapy&quot; he explains, &quot;even to the point of giving up on a session because one side can't get an Internet connection. These sorts of things happen. I, for one, do not schedule a session with a virtual patient between real patients, because it is hard to keep these sessions within a clear time frame.&quot; </p> \n<p>Real patients? </p> \n<p>Rolnick: &quot;That's an interesting expression, isn't it? The problem with online patients, even though they are completely real, is that sometimes the connection goes down, or gets slow, and then you have to extend the session. But problems can also come to the fore in other ways. Someone on the other side is silent while thinking, and you wonder if it's a very meaningful silence or something simpler. In psychology, silence is a key thing, but on the Internet, without the concrete presence, the ability to be silent is impaired.&quot; </p> \n<p>Yonatan also mentions technological glitches and silence. &quot;There are lots of problems with Internet communication,&quot; he says. &quot;And I'm definitely aware of all the dangers. I have a doctorate in online misunderstandings and unrequited love. In a phone conversation it's a little easier... </p> \n<p>&quot;Over time, I developed a particular sensitivity to my therapist's silences. Instead of speculating about them and trying to guess what she's thinking, I've learned to say something along the lines of: 'Because of the medium, I don't know what's happening. Explain to me where you stand.' Actually, we've both learned to do this.&quot; </p> \n<p>Many of the questions that came up in conversations with therapists concerned the treatment setting, and creation of a safe and conducive atmosphere for patients. Boaz, a 56-year-old lecturer in the humanities, works in Israel but spends about 70 percent of his time abroad. His therapy, however, continues: When he's here, he goes to his psychologist's office, and the rest of the time they converse via Skype. </p> \n<p>Boaz devotes a lot of effort to preserving a therapeutic setting. &quot;I get up very early in the morning, make coffee and settle into my spot. I'm very particular about this: always the same spot, in the armchair, with a cup of coffee and breakfast. It's important not to be doing anything else at the same time. This is my therapy time. I turn off my cell phone and people know they can't call me during this time. There's a careful ritual here.&quot; </p> \n<p>At the start of his therapy the boundaries were less clear. &quot;During one session, I suddenly found myself checking e-mails,&quot; relates Boaz. &quot;And one time I caught my psychologist doing something else on the computer during our conversation. It took us both some time to really understand that we couldn't simultaneously be doing anything else. </p> \n<p>&quot;At first, everything disturbed our concentration: a barking dog, a slamming door, someone talking out in the hall. We had to make an effort to see what was a disturbance and what wasn't, and to get rid of the disturbances so we could focus on the therapy.&quot; </p> \n<p>Yonatan is more flexible. &quot;I'm kind of like a turtle,&quot; he says, &quot;taking my home on my back for many years now. Give me a laptop and a connection and I'm able to focus, even in a noisy environment. The concept of setting in therapy is virtual to begin with. The therapeutic setting is a sort of cyberspace concept. From this standpoint, the therapeutic setting for me and my therapist is a result of our many years of interaction. Yes, there are also some circumstances here in which the medium is the message, but the main thing is the connection between us, and the psychological connection is not medium-dependent.&quot; </p> \n<p>'Looser' boundaries  </p> \n<p>When psychiatrist Tali Vishne from the Nes Tziona Psychiatric Hospital was abroad, she maintained contact online with a patient - a process she describes as &quot;preserving existing therapy.&quot; </p> \n<p>&quot;I usually work with serious disorders,&quot; she explains. &quot;And ongoing therapy that is based completely on the Internet is less suited for patients of this type. It may not be so right for me either.&quot; </p> \n<p>Vishne agrees that therapy via the Internet is likely to develop and expand, but she understands those who are leery of it. &quot;There are therapists who react very badly to any change in the therapeutic setting,&quot; she says. &quot;They even consider changing appointment times to be of critical significance. For them, online therapy is a giant leap. </p> \n<p>&quot;Boundaries are still a central issue in therapy, and here the boundaries become looser. There are theoreticians who talk about changing the therapeutic setting as a postmodern process. Online therapy clearly constitutes a radical break in terms of the setting. On the other hand, I once heard a professor say that the setting is more important to the therapist than to the patient; it's the therapist's safety net. Maybe the transition is harder for therapists than for patients.&quot; </p> \n<p>Vishne attributes the uneasiness vis-a-vis virtual therapy to problems endemic to the online world. &quot;I had a case with a guy who wrote me anywhere from dozens to hundreds of e-mails a day for a long time, and one day he just disappeared. Another patient sent me an e-mail in which she wrote that I'd offended her and she was cutting off the relationship and refused to explain why. After a lot of effort on my part, I found out that she had tried to contact me via an old and inactive ICQ account, and was insulted when I didn't respond. It really hurt.&quot; </p> \n<p>Adds Vishne: &quot;There's something scary about the Internet, about Skype. Somebody can just close the program one day and never open it again. Totally disappear. Certain aspects of the classic therapy setting are responsible for creating a sense of commitment. The need to come to a certain place at a certain time, for instance. In a situation like that, it's a lot harder for a person to disappear. I've never yet had a patient disappear on me without leaving a trace. It's important to state that the disappearance of a patient is a very traumatic experience for the therapist.&quot; </p> \n<p>But less dramatic situations can also be problematic. &quot;Generally speaking, something gets lost in communication without the personal encounter. Even on the phone. Just think of how we make a big effort to hold job interviews face to face. There are people who feel that there is something cold and impersonal about an online therapy session. We need commitment, eye contact, body language. </p> \n<p>&quot;I have patients from Be'er Sheva to Kiryat Shmona and I do treat them over the Internet, too, but it's conditioned upon our meeting face to face at certain intervals. To me, it's this meeting that makes the therapy possible.&quot; </p> \n<p>Lewinsky also acknowledges the challenges posed by the new virtual methods. &quot;It's harder to detect nuances, and distractions can be a problem, but all these are problems that are solvable. The most serious problem is that it is definitely easier to control things inside the therapy room. Part of what happens with online therapy is that the therapist loses some of his or her control. Some people want to have more of it during therapy and are not prepared to work this way.&quot; </p> \n<p>However, Lewinsky himself is not as adamant about maintaining a traditional setting: &quot;People are clinging so tightly to the clinic, but is it really the one and only true venue? It is just a setup that someone, somewhere, once decided upon - that there has to be a couch, a table in the middle of the room with a potted plant. So they decided. Did anyone ever say the familiar setting is the best? It's clear to everyone, for example, that some types of therapy are best done in a group. In a group there's no plant in the middle, so is the therapy less effective? I've treated people via Internet chat, and it's appropriate and effective treatment.&quot; </p> \n<p>What does the experience look like from the therapist's point of view? </p> \n<p>Lewinsky: &quot;It's not easy. It requires a lot more concentration because the patient is somewhere else and there are filters between you. You may think you're immediately grasping what's going on with him, but since I also have more distractions, I have try harder. I'm very aware of these things, so I create the optimal conditions.&quot; </p> \n<p>And what happens when a patient cries? Is it hard to be physically distant? </p> \n<p>&quot;It's not hard, it's part of that particular setting. It doesn't make me more empathetic just because I offer him a tissue. Since it's impossible to express yourself with movements or actions, you have to project empathy through words. But I don't think I talk a lot more than in ordinary therapy.&quot; </p> \n<p>Another thing that has brought the Internet into the therapeutic world is the patient's access to information. Patients search the Internet for information about the therapist - articles he's published, the names of his wife and children. Lewinsky says that this sort of exposure can be problematic. On his own Web site he has a guide for therapists on how to use Facebook, the main suggestion being: &quot;Never publicize things which you don't want to end up in places you've never thought about.&quot; </p> \n<p>Vishne has also had to deal with patients who have known a lot about her. &quot;I've had patients come to therapy knowing more information about me than I would ever have imagined. Therapists talk about the [patients'] initial Google search as an invasive and intrusive act. You can find my articles there, see my husband's academic status, what my children do. As a result, I try to be on the Internet less. It's not the best solution, because I want to be on it, but I understand that the attempt to hide behind a veil of secrecy is hopeless. There's no escaping Google. And besides being unrealistic, I also believe that this kind of research [by the patient] is legitimate.&quot; </p> \n<p>Vishne also points out that it is very difficult to remove information that has been posted. &quot;Whatever's written and said there remains there. Every word may end up being quoted. In terms of therapy, this can be inhibiting, because you're more cautious about what you say, about the way things are said. You have no control over how something you said at a certain moment might be interpreted 20 minutes later or three years later. The way the conversation is recorded alters the positions of both sides and can be perceived as threatening by both.&quot; </p> \n<p>Such a danger is not merely theoretical: Confusion and breaching of boundaries are evident on psychotherapy forums hosted by major sites. The managers of such forums talk of patients who use manipulation, invent false identities and try to use virtual means to get close to the therapist. Such complexities mean that online therapy is not right for every therapist, according to Lewinsky. </p> \n<p>&quot;A therapist needs to make a certain adjustment in order to work on the Internet,&quot; he says. &quot;It's important that the setting be comfortable for you. A lot of people, especially old-timers but some very young therapists, too, have a conception of what therapy is supposed to be. But there are truly many ways to conduct it, and this is one of them.&quot; </p> \n<p>He adds that some of the problems mentioned in connection with virtual therapy can also appear in the classic clinical setting: &quot;In the classic setting there can also be noise outside, and it's not always comfortable. The patient may sometimes meet the therapist's spouse. Every setting has its limitations; as soon as you accept those limitations, the possibilities open up. I start with the patient - with what is comfortable and suitable for him.&quot; </p> \n<p>The patient as project  </p> \n<p>Jordan Lewinsky believes people need therapy that is focused and of limited duration. As he puts it, he and his staff at the Resolution Center &quot;tailor a package of solutions according to the patient's needs.&quot; </p> \n<p>How does it actually work? </p> \n<p>Lewinsky: &quot;We start with an evaluation session, where there are always two staff members from two different disciplines present, to ensure at least two points of view. Let's say a person comes in and says his life isn't going anywhere. He's in a rut at work, unable to advance, he thinks he has all kinds of troubles from childhood that are holding him back. </p> \n<p>&quot;We conduct an evaluation and see that there is also an element of attention deficit, a history of unstable employment and difficulty maintaining relationships with the opposite sex. So it's not just an attention deficit issue and medication won't solve the problem. He has self-image problems - problems with employment, with work relationships, things that are organizational in nature. And all of these things need to be addressed, otherwise you won't really be helping him. I see a patient as a project.&quot; </p> \n<p>Is this new? </p> \n<p>&quot;To a certain extent. Not that I purport to say I've invented something new. Short-term therapy has been around for years. I didn't invent psychology or psychotherapy, I'm just trying to adapt the profession to a changing reality.&quot; </p> \n<p>Between evaluation sessions every few weeks, a connection with the patients is maintained via the Internet. Is this focused approach suitable for everyone? </p> \n<p>&quot;No. When someone comes along with a personality disorder, we're not going to solve it in three months of therapy. But I can perhaps substantially change his behavior vis-a-vis his mother. A small goal, no magic necessary.&quot; </p> \n<p>So what's really changed? </p> \n<p>&quot;The biggest change is the decline in our degree of faith in the therapist. With Freud, you were ready to accept that the therapy could be five times a week, for an hour, for three to five years, and then we'll see what happens. Today you want to know exactly what to expect.&quot; </p> \n<p>You're talking about a change that is essentially capitalist. </p> \n<p>&quot;It's not just a capitalist change. People also have a desire to see that some kind of change is taking place. People today don't have the patience for processes that go on for years.&quot; </p> \n<p>Bottom line: All the therapists we spoke with agree that the practice of Internet therapy is not about to disappear. Nor is it a substitute for face-to-face therapy, because there is no real substitute for that. </p> \n<p>&quot;If in the past eight years I can say I've had 20 real breakthrough therapy sessions,&quot; says Boaz, &quot;the kind that really helped me, then I'd have to say that the vast majority took place in an actual clinic.&quot; W </p>",

        "text":["<p>&quot;There are judges who are not familiar with the word 'acquittal.' As soon as they see an indictment they can already write the verdict,&quot; says Judge Shelly Timan. &quot;Once I told a judge on a panel that I saw certain problems with the evidence in the case. I didn't even mention an acquittal. He said, 'Do you have any idea what they will do to us if we acquit?'&quot; </p> \n<p>Timan, 64, retired last week after 27 years on the bench, 13 of them in the Tel Aviv District Court. From 2003 onward, he headed a district court panel that dealt with cases of serious crime, including those involving Tali Fahima, who acted as a &quot;human shield&quot; for a wanted individual in Jenin; Ofer Maximov, who was complicit in a huge bank embezzlement; the &quot;Benny the Fisherman&quot; murder case; the Ohana brothers, also a murder case; Nahum Manbar, convicted of arms dealing with Iran; Miss World, Linor Abargil, who was a rape victim; the murder of underworld kingpin Yehezkel Aslan; the &quot;AIDS rapist&quot; Chris Sarfo; and cases of white slavery. He also heard countless cases involving sex offenses. </p> \n<p>In the &quot;Benny the Fisherman&quot; case - the name refers to a Jaffa restaurant, the case involved the murder of a Jaffa resident who was stuffed into the trunk of a car and shot - the State Prosecutor's Office reached a plea bargain with the defendants after the court demanded that the police reveal the source who had incriminated them. The panel of judges, headed by Timan, questioned the validity of the prosecution's evidence. </p> \n<p>Timan was also on bad terms with some of his colleagues, among them the president of Tel Aviv District Court, Judge Uri Goren. According to Timan, Goren did not back him when the prosecution in the Ohana case alleged that he was biased in favor of the defendants. Goren ordered the case be sent to mediation without informing the sides or the head of the panel. Timan read about the decision in a newspaper and announced last July that he was going to retire and would not take additional cases. In November, after the lawyer of a defendant in the trial of the Ohana brothers died - the accused were charged with hiring assassins to avenge their brother's death - the defendant petitioned the High Court of Justice against Tel Aviv District Court and against the state prosecution, in order to block the trial's continuation without the appointment of a defense counsel. </p> \n<p>The Supreme Court held up the proceedings for an indefinite period. Timan thought the Supreme Court decision was correct, but was unwilling to wait for the proceedings to resume, and last week announced the date of his resignation. </p> \n<p>&quot;The resignation was forced on me,&quot; he told Haaretz in an interview. &quot;I did not feel I was getting support and backing from people in the judicial system, particularly in conducting the Ohana case and in the light of the reports that appeared about the &quot;Benny the Fisherman&quot; case. The background to my resignation is mainly a foul atmosphere and lack of backing.&quot; </p> \n<p>The courts' spokeswoman, speaking in Goren's name, stated that after some three-and-a-half years of various procedures in the Ohana case, during which some of defendants were released from prison, Goren initiated the transfer of the case to mediation by a retired judge, Sara Sirota, for the good of the proceedings and the benefit of the sides. This was done with the knowledge of the judges and the sides and without causing delays. The spokeswoman added that Goren had given Timan full backing and support during his tenure on the bench. </p> \n<p>Timan was born in Tel Aviv in 1944. His father, Yaakov Timan, was a leading actor in the Matateh (&quot;Broom&quot;) Theater. Timan studied law at the Tel Aviv branch of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (which later became Tel Aviv University). Among his classmates were two of the country's top lawyers, Dov Weissglas and Nahum Feinberg, and the judges Ruth Lebhar-Sharon, Drora Pilpel, Yadin Timor and Tchia Shapira. Shapira was later a member of Timan's serious-crime panel. </p> \n<p>In 1969, Timan clerked for attorney Amnon Goldenberg in the prestigious S. Horowitz &amp; Co. law firm. After being admitted to the bar, he opened an office with attorney Mibi Moser, who left after a short time. In 1981, Timan was appointed a judge in Petah Tikva Magistrate's Court. There he decided twice against the closure of a movie theater on Sabbath eve and also heard cases involving criminal charges against Haredim who took part in rioting in the &quot;Shabbat wars.&quot; </p> \n<p>Timan was considered a colorful, somewhat eccentric judge. He always called defendants and lawyers by their name, in contrast to other judges. He joked with lawyers and leveled criticism at the police, prosecutors and defense counsel. </p> \n<p>Agenda, outlook and background  </p> \n<p>What is the explanation for the huge proportion of convictions in Israel? </p> \n<p>&quot;Judges are flesh and blood. Each of them brings with him the education he received at home, an agenda, his past, his outlook, his professional background. Even though not every judge who comes from the ranks of the state prosecution is pro-prosecution, you can't get away from that. People who spent most of their career in the prosecution have a hard time being defense-oriented. But beyond that, it's an attitude.&quot; </p> \n<p>Do judges help &quot;promote&quot; acquittals? </p> \n<p>&quot;The prosecution sometimes is not successful enough, and the judge is a lot smarter or more experienced. Or the prosecution cannot, under the laws of evidence, ask a leading question, and sometimes judges ask questions of clarification to help the prosecutor. </p> \n<p>&quot;This state of affairs,&quot; he continues, &quot;is especially discernible in sex-offense cases. It is due to social pressure, media pressure, or pressure by the women's lobby. The fact is that most cases of rape are not street rape but are perpetrated by someone the victim knows. The question under consideration is whether she 'consented' or did not 'consent.' </p> \n<p>&quot;It is not necessary to prove use of force. The present court situation is such that a woman who alleges she has been raped doesn't have to budge, because she is apparently fossilized and cannot utter a sound. The judge is not given additional tools apart from placing his belief in one of the parties - the complainant or the accused. </p> \n<p>&quot;The problem is that it is very difficult to fight against this after 25 years, when there is no evidence. A person can complain about something his parents did to him until the age of 38. With the exception of crimes perpetrated by the Nazis and their henchmen, there is no other offense like this, to which the statute of limitations does not apply. </p> \n<p>&quot;I want to emphasize: if it is an honest complaint, the victim must be given all the conditions to ensure that she does not become a mockery in court and will not talk about her sexual past and is accompanied by an aid center. At the same time, I am apprehensive of false complaints. Take note that a woman who makes a false complaint is not placed on trial, on the grounds that complainants [in sexual-abuse cases] should be encouraged.&quot; </p> \n<p>Timan's approach outraged lawyers who represent victims of sexual assault. In contrast to the prevailing trend of focusing on the suffering of the victim, Timan places the accused and the victim on the same footing. Within the state prosecution, opinion about him is divided. There are those who cannot abide his criticism of the prosecution's handling of certain cases, but in general his judgments are considered fair. </p> \n<p>How far does public opinion influence a judge's decision? </p> \n<p>&quot;We have fear, which in part is fear of public opinion. One cannot ignore it. If certain groups campaign more than others and speak out, this actually works. The result is that the feminists, who do excellent work from their point of view, persuade judges to hand down more rigorous sentences with their lobby. </p> \n<p>&quot;And I say: What about the lobby for the war against drugs? Against attacks on the elderly? You don't hear them. In this state of affairs, the court has fewer and fewer tools to determine who is telling the truth. It gives the accused less chance to defend himself. It creates fear in all the agencies that are engaged in law enforcement.&quot; Including judges? </p> \n<p>&quot;I will add no more.&quot; </p> \n<p>Can you cite an example of how the image of a certain type of crime is influenced by the media? </p> \n<p>&quot;White slavery. There is no trade in women in Israel now. At first people brought girls who did not know where they were being taken. They abducted and raped them and passed them from one person to another. That has stopped. These days the police target some particular parlor and 'carry out a raid.' </p> \n<p>&quot;A woman who wants to talk about her boss immediately receives a visa for a year or more and also a kind of work permit. When the time comes to testify, some women disappear and those who do testify have nothing to tell, because they didn't see the act in which they were paid for, didn't see who the real boss is. So most of these cases result in a conviction for keeping a place of prostitution, pimping - minor offenses. And heaven forbid that we should not also award compensation to the girl, who in any case makes a fortune.&quot; If there is no sexual slavery, why does the impression exist that there is? </p> \n<p>&quot;Because there are people who give lectures on the subject, who make a living by talking about trade in women.&quot; </p> \n<p>Moral turpitude and Ramon  </p> \n<p>&quot;When I studied criminal law, I was taught the sanctity of the defendant's rights. Nowadays there are no rights in sex offenses,&quot; Timan says. &quot;Anyone who is accused of sex offenses will almost certainly land in prison, his family destroyed. And if, heaven forbid, the accusation is false, that will not help him. That is the atmosphere today. Every acquittal is assailed.&quot; </p> \n<p>Are there tools to identify a false accusation? </p> \n<p>&quot;If the prosecution did not discover that it originated in a childhood bond with the mother to eject the father from the house, or does not expose the lie, because one must not offend the victim by administering a lie-detector test, then no. There is a vast collection of false complaints that I uncovered. It is clear to me that if the false complaint had not been uncovered, the man would have been tried and convicted.&quot; Is there concern about unjustified convictions? </p> \n<p>&quot;I had butterflies in the stomach about two cases. In neither case was I able to change anything.&quot; </p> \n<p>In the Haim Ramon case, which was heard in Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court, was the indictment justified? </p> \n<p>&quot;If things happened as they were depicted, and precisely because a public figure was involved, an indictment was the right course. On the ethical plane he certainly deserved to be shaken up. I know that the judgment and the verdict are badly written, confused, off the mark.&quot; And the decision that there was no moral turpitude Ramon's act? </p> \n<p>&quot;In fact, the moral turpitude is more important than the punishment, because it is inherently wrong for a justice minister in Israel to grab a girl and kiss her on the mouth. From this point of view, the verdict does not correspond with the judgment, because after such terrible things were written, there should at least have been an ascription of moral turpitude.&quot; </p> \n<p>In the case of former president Katsav, should a finding of moral turpitude have been included in the plea bargain? </p> \n<p>&quot;What I find odd, without knowing the details, is the change between the draft indictment and the attorney general's declarations, and the present indictment. If the hearing that the president received helped, I would have expected the police, the prosecution and the attorney general to reach that outcome by themselves, before the hearing. But you cannot turn black into white. If the complainants do not make a good impression, then either do not submit a draft for a hearing or submit a tough indictment and let the court decide.&quot; And as for moral turpitude? </p> \n<p>&quot;My personal view is that even this negligible offense carries moral turpitude. It is unconscionable for someone with Katsav's status to perform such acts. It is inconceivable that the president of the state should caress the leg of a woman who is his subordinate and get off without moral turpitude. There is no such animal.&quot; </p>",

        "text":["<p>For hundreds of thousands of people in Israel, the first e-mail they get every morning is not from a relative or friend, nor from a colleague or client. The first message, which will be followed by another three or four throughout the day, is from a dubious marketer of drugs for erectile dysfunction like Viagra, Cialis or Levitra that lauds the medication, reminds us of the importance of a functional sex life and offers quite attractive prices - without, of course, anything annoying like getting a prescription. </p> \n<p>For most such e-mail recipients, it's clear that they should stay away from an anonymous Internet source offering medications, but not a few people are swayed by the convenience and discretion in the offer and do purchase medicine from the Web, without really knowing what they're buying or from whom. </p> \n<p>Whoever thinks that only a few small-time criminals are involved in the phenomenon of selling counterfeit or stolen anti-impotence pills and other drugs is sorely mistaken. These e-mails are the tip of the iceberg of a major crime industry here and around the world. In effect, all of us could innocently and routinely end up purchasing counterfeit or stolen drugs without knowing it. </p> \n<p>Israel's first conference on the phenomenon - and how to deal with it - was held this month, attended by health-care workers, pharmacists, Health Ministry officials and the police. It was tough not to be worried by the issues discussed. The facts, numbers and predictions were quite depressing: Apparently the burgeoning counterfeit drug industry poses appreciable and potentially lethal dangers to the end-users - we who purchase and consume the medication - and does financial damage to the legitimate pharmaceutical industry, which is worried. </p> \n<p>Pharmaceutical crime here and abroad centers around two main areas: counterfeit drugs and stolen ones. The stolen drugs are typically taken from pharmacies, importers and wholesalers, and reach the market through various distribution channels: newspaper and Internet advertisements and, more worrying, pharmacies that sell the medications to customers. </p> \n<p>Stolen drugs may well have been stored in inadequate conditions; those that reach Israel regularly pass through the West Bank first. The owner of a pharmacy who purchases and markets such merchandise cannot know the quality of the drugs and, in effect, cannot prevent counterfeit or dangerous products from reaching patients in Israel. </p> \n<p>Drugs sold via the Internet are purchased with credit cards and sent through the mail from the United States or Europe. Israeli Web sites also mediate deals between Indian and Chinese marketers and customers around the world. An estimated 170 types of counterfeit drugs are being sold around the world. </p> \n<p>The World Health Organization estimates that 10 percent of drugs in the world market are counterfeit, although the figure rises to 25 percent in developing countries. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that in some countries, patients have a better chance of receiving a counterfeit drug than a bona-fide one. But this problem is not limited to the Third World. </p> \n<p>Marcel Daniels, a senior director at the MSD Europe drug company who participated in the conference, quoted a WHO survey conducted between January 1999 and October 2000 that found that 60 percent of the counterfeiting incidents occurred in developing nations, the rest among industrialized nations. There are major financial ramifications as well: According to the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, an American group, counterfeit drugs sold for a total of $5.7 billion last year, and the total is expected to be 10 times as high in 2010. </p> \n<p>Worse news for Israeli consumers is that this country has a place of dishonor in this flourishing counterfeiting industry. An international survey by the Trading Standards Institute survey found that Israel is No. 8 in the world. The FDA places Israel in the same category as China, India and Mexico - all countries where all drugs imported from there are suspected of being counterfeit. Drugs worth more than NIS 10 million were stolen from Israeli clinics last year. This figure apparently does not reflect the full extent of drugs stolen, as it does not include drugs stolen from private pharmacies, which do not report to the Health Ministry. </p> \n<p>&quot;This is a ticking time bomb,&quot; warned Miki Ofer, a leading member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Israel. &quot;Every counterfeit drug or drug that was stolen and stored under wrong conditions endangers the user. The drugs include relatively sensitive chemical substances that are liable to break down into other substances above certain temperatures, or simply cease being effective. In addition, the counterfeit drugs are liable to include a lower dosage of the active ingredient, not include an active ingredient at all, include a different medication altogether or be contaminated with poisonous substances.&quot; </p> \n<p>The counterfeit or stolen drugs are generally sold without a prescription, which is problematic, in part because it could mean mistaken self-diagnosis and buyers' ignorance of important safety information regarding the medication being purchased, such as possible side effects, unusual reactions and the way the drug interacts with other medications. </p> \n<p>One of the most frightening scenarios has to do with vaccines for children, which are largely based on proteins and must be kept chilled. The prospect of children's being treated with stolen vaccinations that are no longer effective is enough to wake up those involved in the health-care field; the damage caused might only be visible years after the vaccinations were administered. </p> \n<p>However, it is not just vaccinations that are involved. Other medications that must be kept chilled include chemotherapy drugs, eye drops, drugs that include proteins (&quot;biological drugs&quot;) and certain ointments. These medications will lose their potency, and thus their value, if they are, for instance, packed into a vehicle without refrigeration for a significant amount of time. </p> \n<p>Miki Arieli, the central district deputy pharmacist for the Health Ministry, is just about the only person responsible for the daily war on pharmaceutical crime in Israel. Arieli, known in the field as the country's &quot;first pharmaceutical sheriff,&quot; explained how exactly pharmaceutical criminals operate: </p> \n<p>&quot;On the side of the sure supply chain, which today goes by way of the pharmacies, health clinics and businesses allowed to sell medication without a prescription, a crime and counterfeit organization operates that includes a wide range of criminal activity,&quot; said Arieli - &quot;from breaking in to pharmacies to producing counterfeit drugs to smuggling in order to distribute in Israel and abroad. </p> \n<p>&quot;Counterfeit drugs smuggled in from the Far East, generally India and China, are packaged in Israel in packaging printed and produced in Israel for distribution [here] and export to the United States and Europe. In parallel, there have been incidents in which legal raw materials, purchased with a Health Ministry import license, were diverted for illegal uses. For instance, the raw material to produce 1.5 tons of paracetamol was bought for the purpose of diluting heroin and a machine for manufacturing pills (capsulization) that was bought in a tender for used equipment from an Israeli drug company were found in a lab for creating Ecstasy.&quot; </p> \n<p>Experts said those involved in producing counterfeit drugs or selling stolen ones were professional. &quot;The theft in our company was totally selective,&quot; said Dr. Ron Tomer, deputy director general of Israeli drug manufacturing company Unipharm. &quot;The thieves knew to take precisely the most expensive and most in-demand drugs on the market.&quot; </p> \n<p>A private investigation initiated by Unipharm turned up some of the stolen merchandise in pharmacies in the north. The inquiry discovered that the thieves had taken the drugs to the West Bank city of Nablus, where they altered the identity numbers of the medication and sold it to the Israeli market. </p> \n<p>&quot;We are in the midst of a pharmaceutical crime wave,&quot; said Chief Superintendent Orit Heiman, head of the research division for the police investigative and intelligence branch. &quot;These are professional property criminals, for whom this is their occupation and their lifestyle.&quot; </p>",

        "text":["<p>COLOGNE, Germany - A partial list of the things not included in the new television series &quot;The Jews - Story of a Nation&quot;: pictures of Hitler (there are about two to three minutes in all about the Third Reich); the myth of Jewish genius as represented by Einstein and Freud; the myth of Jewish money as represented by the Rothschilds; Jewish humor and Jewish creative artists such as Bashevis-Singer, Woody Allen and Seinfeld; discussion of the State of Israel and the Palestinians; Jewish gangsters, or any bad Jews. </p> \n<p>But what there is in this series, the first of its kind created in German, is exceptional frankness and a certain understanding of national psychology. After the first two installments, which deal with the periods of the Bible, the Mishna and the Talmud, the series becomes a detailed and precise exposition of what can be described as unjustified hatred and inhuman cruelty on the part of the Christian world toward the Jews of Europe. </p> \n<p>The series is full of &quot;docu-drama&quot; reconstructions of historical events by actors. Viewers are spared the actual sight of blood in these scenes, but not the sight of Jews being led to torture or brought to the stake. In addition to the reconstructions, much effort has been made to find documents about the Inquisition, anti-Jewish legislation in Czarist Russia, and reports by cities in Germany of a decline in tax income due to the massacre of the Jews. The cumulative result is almost a pornography of evil, void of ideology. </p> \n<p>Arte, which first broadcast the series, screened the installments in sequence so that the viewing experience causes an almost physical upset, with a constant fear about the coming scene. After about four hours of viewing, pictures of the Statue of Liberty and the port of New York provide a respite. German national television, ARD, will show one installment a week. </p> \n<p>During the past seven years, Nina Koshofer initiated, wrote and directed the five installments of the series, 50 minutes each, whose production cost 1.5 million euros. Koshofer, 38, is not Jewish, but at the age of 11 she found out her grandfather had been removed in disgrace from the German army during World War II after the chance discovery that his father was a Jew (who was killed in Auschwitz). </p> \n<p>In discussions after the public screenings of the series, the question of its failure to deal with the Holocaust came up. But in effect, the series seems to deal with the Holocaust, with its technical essence: the murder of the Jews in the Christian countries of Europe. One gets a sense the Nazi Holocaust was not a turning point in the plot, but its continuation. </p> \n<p>Philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz used to explain the Jewish-Christian confrontation and his hatred of Christianity as stemming not from the story of Jesus' death and the betrayal by Judas Iscariot, but from something more profound. He talked about two religions that presumed to be the same religion, and therefore could not live together under one roof. </p> \n<p>Koshofer does not presume to explain the psychological aspect that led the Christians to hate the Jews. &quot;There is a matter of xenophobia. We find that the Jewish-European conflict began even before Christianity, with Jewish rejection of Greek culture. But we found in many churches, mainly in the East, a real ritual of the story of Judas Iscariot. So we cannot underestimate the hatred sown by the Holy Scriptures.&quot; </p> \n<p>However, she emphasizes that the Christian world was not all of one mind. &quot;We found many instances of bishops and popes who protected Jews. Sometimes for moral reasons, and sometimes because of vested interests. Even those who perpetrated the horrors did not operate only out of a religious background, but often because of vested interests.&quot; </p> \n<p>But Koshofer does not spare the Christian theologians. According to the series, Martin Luther, who brought about the Reformation, actually demonstrated a certain sympathy for the Jews at the start of his career, saying they were not involved in the moral corruption of the Christians. But he later changed his view and called for the destruction of the Jews, the demolition of their homes and the theft of their property. In the 20th century, the Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbels made direct use of these words of Luther. </p> \n<p>The leftist French newspaper L'Humanite pointed out in its uncomplimentary criticism of the series that &quot;the wagons traveling from one side of the screen to the other lend a feeling of a persecuted nation.&quot; The newspaper's critic felt the main thing missing was the place of Jews in social revolutions. </p> \n<p>Koshofer admits that in the series she often tried to reconstruct feelings, something reflected in staging historical events. For example, in one of the installments the figure of Meshulam son of Kalonymus, who lived in the Middle Ages, is in fact a combination of two historical figures - Kalonymus son of Meshulam and Moshe son of Kalonymus. &quot;Sometimes you have to simplify the story a little,&quot; explains Koshofer, &quot;especially when it comes to a confusing story like that of the Kalonymus family, which produced many famous people - the historical sources confuse them.&quot; </p> \n<p>In 1096 the Jews of France warned the Jews of Mainz in Germany - where the Kalonymuses were the most distinguished family - about Crusader knights who were massacring Jews. Moshe son of Kalonymus tried to organize a Jewish self-defense force. The Jews of Mainz, many of whom were known for their swordsmanship, surrendered to the numerical superiority of the Crusaders. The scene ends with the image of a Jewish fighter who is about to kill his wife and children for kiddush hashem - to sanctify God's name. The director insists on using a photo of a manuscript that describes the massacre in Mainz. The issue of kiddush hashem, which may seem controversial to modern eyes, is repeated a number of times in the series. </p> \n<p>The installment that deals with the period of the Black Plague describes the tortures suffered by Jews so that they would confess they had poisoned the waters of Venice. Of dozens of Jews who were tortured, one gave in after his stomach was pierced with a white-hot iron, confessed to the baseless accusation, and thus dozens of Jews were convicted. In light of the death of one-third of the inhabitants of Europe during the plague, this confession led to slaughter all over the continent. </p> \n<p>Koshofer says she has heard about the affair of Prof. Ariel Toaff, who claimed in his book that there was a kernel of truth in one of the blood libels, relying on testimony extracted by torture. She claims that during the years she spent working on the series, she did not come across a single factual detail likely to support Toaff's claims. When asked whether the book is provocation or foolishness, she shrugs her shoulders and refuses to answer. </p> \n<p>Do any of the stories you came across make you particularly furious? </p> \n<p>&quot;The horrific acts of the Cossacks during the Chmielnitzki pogroms, maybe because this story was less familiar to me. The extent of this slaughter goes beyond anything that preceded it. The cruelty also surpasses what occurred before that.&quot; The Chmielnitzki pogroms were one of the places where the director chose not to tell the viewers the harshest facts like the stabbing of pregnant women and the removal of their fetuses, or the placing of kittens into the wombs of Jewish women so they would eat their way out. </p> \n<p>People are liable to claim you are presumptuous, that you have no doctorate or exceptional academic background, so how do you deal with such a fraught subject? </p> \n<p>&quot;I don't think that a series like this can be created only by an outstanding intellectual. We are living in a generation that knows so little about Jews. Most of those who will be exposed to the series will be laymen for whom this will be their first encounter with Judaism.&quot; </p> \n<p>The funding of the series came from the religious department of the government channel. Didn't they have any comments? </p> \n<p>&quot;Once they corrected a mistake, I showed a picture of Rome in connection with a certain pope and they pointed out that during that period he lived in France. But aside from that, no. They totally accepted the spirit of the series. </p> \n<p>&quot;I really did not plan to create a series about hatred and cruelty,&quot; says Koshofer, &quot;I tried to balance between these things and many instances where one can find good neighborly relations between Jews and Christians. I sometimes walk down the street in Cologne and see the stolpersteine (&quot;stumbling stones&quot; - a project by a German artist who places plaques with the names of Jewish families who lived there at the entrances to homes -- RD). That is a monumental work. You understand from it what the fabric of life once was. What German culture has lost.&quot; </p>",

        "text":["<p>Imagine you love a man and devote most of your life to him. Slowly, however, not only do you notice that he cares little about you, but you also begin to discover he has lied to you about his past (presenting it as more glorious than it was in reality); about his current emotional whereabouts (pretending to be with you when hes actually devoting his energies to someone else); and about his future intentions (pretending to be exclusively committed to you, when he holds many divided loyalties).</p> \n<p>Such discovery is obviously terrible, but not only for you: It is in fact mostly terrible for him, because this discovery transforms him into a non-person, someone whose words and deeds become of no importance, do not matter, to you or to anyone else in the know. Trust is not only an important ingredient of social relations, it is a precondition: People or institutions unable to inspire trust in and from others become irrelevant entities; we simply stop listening to them; we laugh at them; and we ultimately expunge them from our lives.</p> \n<p>Many have drawn analogies between our street protests and those that have been shaking the Arab world since the beginning of this year (the protesters are young, without particularly prominent leaders, and have spontaneously organized, via Facebook and blogs). But the analogy hides an important difference: Tahrir Square happened because the Arab world wanted democracy; our versions of it are taking place in the context of a full-fledged democracy in which the organs of civil society have collapsed. The protests in Israel are about a general lack of trust not only in government officials but in political parties, politicians in general, and such institutions as the Histadrut labor federation. The Arab protests reflect a great hope for the establishment of brand-new democratic institutions; our protests, on the contrary, reveal the collapse of our trust in the representatives of such institutions.</p> \n<p>Israeli citizens have always been model citizens: extraordinarily, exceptionally, uncannily disciplined; devoted to their state, accepting peacefully some of its strangest decrees; paying very high taxes, seeing very little of these taxes invested in public goods; sacrificing vacations, work and sometimes their very lives to a demanding army; and responding with docility to the often-unreasonable demands of various groups and government coalitions.</p> \n<p>Israels hard-working citizens have, generation after generation, devoted themselves to their state as the citizens of no other country in the world have. Governments, political parties and institutions supposed to represent the working, productive classes, have abused and betrayed this devotion. But the disgust with politics as usual must not make the protesters forget that they are waging their struggle in a political arena.</p> \n<p>The two revolutions that are most relevant to our times are the French and the American revolutions. Both started as uprisings sparked by fiscal issues. The Boston Tea Party of 1773 was a harbinger of the American War of Independence, as colonists refused to pay the taxes on tea that were imposed by the British power that ruled them. The French Revolution, too, began because both peasants and bourgeois merchants were overburdened by the taxes levied on them by aristocrats, the clergy and the monarchy. Yet what made these revolutions truly historic is the fact that they were also political, not only about wages and taxes. The American and the French protesters understood that the problem went far beyond taxes: It concerned the very structure of political power.</p> \n<p>In France it was the whole institution of the monarchy and the structure of feudal power that were dispensed with; in America, the tea party was the catalyst for a crisis between the British and the American powers, as the colonists refused to be taxed if they didnt have representation, ultimately leading to the cut of the colonies from the British power.</p> \n<p>I was at last Saturday nights demonstration in Jerusalem, and the slogan repeated most often was: The response to privatization is revolution. This is a great and valuable idea, but real revolutions happen when protesters become clearer about the structure of power they want to change. In the case of Israel, this means when protesters question how the total economic distribution of wealth is organized; why the settlements and the ultra-Orthodox bear so much less of the burden than the secular and traditionalist middle and working classes; and why politicians are so consistently oblivious to the needs of citizens and to the question of equality between them. By equality, I mean not only between rich and poor, but also between those who enjoy privileges without duties, and those who carry out many duties with very few privileges.</p> \n<p>True revolutions can begin only when protesters connect between their livelihood and the structure of political power, and when different social groups build solidarity with each other, out of an understanding that their fates are inextricably intertwined.</p> \n<p>Nota bene: Golda Meir was right: People who make revolutions are not nice.</p> \n<p>Prof. Eva Illouz holds the Rose Isaacs Chair in Sociology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>",

        "text":["<p>BUDAPEST, Hungary - Hungary's health minister said Wednesday that his country has developed a vaccine that could protect both humans and animals from the virus causing bird flu. </p> \n<p>Health Minister Jenoe Racz was among several dozen Hungarians who underwent bird flu test vaccinations three weeks ago. He said preliminary tests showed that the antibodies to the virus had appeared in his blood. </p> \n<p>&quot;The results are preliminary but I can say with 99.9 percent certainty that the vaccine works&quot; against protecting living organisms from the H5N1 virus, Health Minister Jenoe Racz said. </p> \n<p>However, the World Health Organization said it was unaware of the details of the Hungarian tests, and was unable to comment on their validity. </p> \n<p>Scientists in the United States have already reported positive results from tests on their own H5N1 vaccine, but so far they have not been able to make the vaccine a practical option because it uses too much of a scarce ingredient and it takes two doses to work. </p> \n<p>Similar studies have been done in France, where experts have been working with a more technologically sophisticated approach than the Americans. The French are scheduled to reveal the results of their experiments to WHO in two weeks. </p> \n<p>Several other countries, including Britain and Germany, are also working on H5N1 vaccines. </p> \n<p>Racz, along with the country's chief health officer and the government's health care commissioner, were the first volunteers to receive the vaccine. </p> \n<p>Laszlo Bujdoso, the chief health officer, told reporters at the time the experimental inoculations began that the new vaccine will only be widely introduced if bird flu and human flu viruses develop a mutated version that can spread from human to human. </p> \n<p>Hungary has the capacity to produce 500,000 vaccinations per week in the event of a world epidemic, Bujdoso added. </p> \n<p>The H5N1 strain of bird flu has swept through poultry populations in large swaths of Asia since 2003, jumping to humans and killing at least 65 people - more than 40 of them in Vietnam - and resulting in the deaths of tens of millions of birds. </p> \n<p>Global health experts are keeping a close eye on bird flu because they fear the lethal H5N1 strain could mutate and trigger a human pandemic. </p> \n<p>Israeli, Jordanian health officials to meet Israeli and Jordanian agriculture officials plan to meet Thursday to coordinate the handling of any domestic outbreak of the avian flu virus. </p> \n<p>An official at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem said the meeting would take place at a border crossing between Jordan and the West Bank. </p> \n<p>A United Nations agency said Wednesday that the risk of bird flu spreading to the Middle East and Africa has markedly increased following the confirmation of outbreaks in Romania and Turkey. </p> \n<p>Health Minister Dan Naveh also warned earlier Wednesday that Israel would be unlikely to escape the global outbreak of avian flu, which has recently been identified in Greece and Turkey, Israel's near neighbors. </p> \n<p>&quot;Avian flu is a global problem, and there is a reasonable assumption that it will also reach Israel,&quot; Naveh told Israel Radio. </p> \n<p>Naveh said that if there is a case of bird flu in Israel, all fowl within a three-kilometer radius will be destroyed. Other birds would be innoculated. </p> \n<p>He stressed that even if a person became infected with the disease, that did not mean that he or she would go on to infect other people. </p> \n<p>He said that contrary to reports, the Health Ministry had sufficient medical technicians and laboratories to carry out bird flu tests and could cope with a heightened demand for them. He declined to comment of the level of preparedness at the Agriculture Ministry. </p> \n<p>The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said in a statement that recent confirmation of the H5N1 bird flu strain in Romania and Turkey confirmed the virus is spreading along the pathways of migratory birds outside southeast Asia. </p> \n<p>The Agriculture Ministry's chief veterinarian for fowl, Dr. Shimon Pokomonsky, has warned that the fears over an Israeli outbreak of avian flu center on the possibility that a bird whose migratory path passes through Israel may contract the disease in one of the countries in which there is an epidemic, and then somehow come into contact with domestic fowl. </p> \n<p>A veterinarian for a commercial company in the chicken farming sector says that when it comes to fowl raised for eating, the coops are almost hermetically sealed, with little chance of infiltration by an affected bird. The same goes for the breeding flocks. </p> \n<p>The big problem comes with the coops that house chickens raised for their eggs. According to the veterinarian, these coops are often primitive structures in small communities - moshavim and villages in the periphery. </p> \n<p>These coops, which contain &quot;just&quot; a few hundred chickens (as opposed to some 8,000 in a &quot;small&quot; coop used for raising chickens for meat), are open and relatively accessible to birds from the outside that could be carrying diseases. </p> \n<p>&quot;There are moshavim on which the coops serve as `occupational therapy' for elderly farmers; and there, one can sometimes see more songbirds than chickens enjoying the feed mixture,&quot; the veterinarian says. </p> \n<p>Dr. Pokomonsky says he, too, is concerned about these coops, noting that farmers today must be more aware of signs of diseases among their birds. The Agriculture Ministry official adds that veterinarians have been explicitly told to be on the lookout for symptoms that may be an indication of avian flu. </p> \n<p>Raising poultry accounts for some 18 percent of Israel's agricultural sector, and some 40 percent of the Israeli livestock industry. At any given moment, there are some 40 million to 42 million chickens in Israel, with around 40 percent of them raised for eating. </p> \n<p>The industry yields some 340,000 tons of meat and 1.6 billion eggs a year. And the entire sector is now on the defensive due to concerns that the avian flu will spread to the Middle East. </p> \n<p>Palestinian Agriculture Minister Walid Abed Rabbo, who was unaware of the meeting between Jordan and Israel, said the Palestinian Authority had stopped the import of all birds and bird products, but that migrating birds were also a risk.</p>",

        "text":["<p>BRUSSELS - European Jews are tired of hearing about their imminent demise. When discussions turn to disaffiliation, ambivalence toward Israel or Jewish leaders without vision, observers of world Jewry often point to Europe as an example not to follow. Negativity takes over, and sometimes we even wonder to ourselves: Do we have a future? </p> \n<p>At such moments, Jews fall back on traditional responses. We can wait for the &quot;messiah,&quot; who will bring about the hoped-for European Jewish renaissance. Or we can take our fate into our own hands and work to make our European Jewish communities thrive. But how do we do that? </p> \n<p>In search of answers, I traveled to New York City, to the New World, and what I found took my breath away. With 1.4 million people, a staggeringly diverse population, the city's Jewish community has thousands of entry gates to Jewish life. How did New York's Jews achieve this? How have they made Jewish life attractive in the world's most competitive market of beliefs, lifestyles and cultures? </p> \n<p>Most striking is that everything in New York is exactly the opposite of what we European Jews know about communal life. I came away understanding that the enterprise of American Jewish life works because of incredible philanthropic commitment, dedication to professionalism and quality, and openness to creativity. In Europe, however, we have a centralized corporate structure, with leaders who are well-meaning, but haven't a clue about renewing Jewish life. </p> \n<p>Money is the fuel that makes it all run, and American Jewish philanthropy is a marvel unmatched anywhere else in the Jewish world. Recently, a major shift has taken place in this world: While money was once directed to major institutions like federations and the Jewish Agency, in the past decade, donors have begun to view giving as an investment opportunity with a very clear agenda. What was once a monopolistic industry has emerged as a free market, and this entrepreneurial atmosphere has given rise to new initiatives. </p> \n<p>As Alan Cohen, a senior planner at the UJA-Federation of New York, puts it: &quot;Big funders want to play a role in shaping the projects they invest in, and so they use their professional skills to set up new benchmarks for success.&quot; These two trends - an open market and increased demand for impact - have left the major institutions with a simple choice: Open up to creative initiatives or stagnate. </p> \n<p>Heavyweight philanthropists have stirred up the community by matching creative ideas with resources. The big names in philanthropy - Charles Bronfman, Lynn Schusterman, Michael Steinhardt, among others - still pay their dues to the establishment organizations, but seem most alive when speaking about what they have created outside of the rubric of the Jewish institutions. It is well known that Birthright (founded by Bronfman and Steinhardt) has to date brought 170,000 young Jews to Israel, but it is too often forgotten that philanthropists had to battle a reluctant and turf-obsessed establishment to get the program off the ground. </p> \n<p>In New York, I encountered a number of &quot;Jewish professionals&quot; of an orientation that was simultaneously new and familiar. These people were actually professionals! In Europe we know tired and tiring emissaries from Israel, on the one hand, and amateur office minders, on the other. In New York, I met strategic thinkers, program planners, professional coaches - the same people I encounter in my commercial life. But here &quot;the firm&quot; is &quot;the Jewish people.&quot; When these professionals generate or are given ideas, they can deliver. </p> \n<p>This is when the contrast between Old and New World became clearest to me. Without losing the sense of peoplehood, American Jews are reinventing themselves to remain competitive in values, identity and lifestyle. Synagogues are becoming &quot;synaplexes.&quot; JCCs are becoming beehives of new culture. </p> \n<p>The lessons we Europeans can learn are clear: We need to invest in professionals and professionalism, using the same logic we apply in our working lives. We must forget about organizations that are obstacles, and not agents of change. We must look to the networks of interaction between Jews, and create programs that draw on their strength and communication patterns. Finally, we must encourage young philanthropic-minded Jews to invest in their own communities. </p> \n<p>Europeans Jews should not despair, for we have much to contribute: ideas, energy and money. An example of a home-grown European concept originating in the margins of organized Jewish life is Limmud, initiated in the United Kingdom by maverick educator Clive Lawton 25 years ago. Limmud was a surprising idea that succeeded because it reinvented Jewish learning, attracted outsiders as well as insiders, and ignored the familiar boundaries between Jews. Today Limmud is being replicated across the world, and is infusing organized communities with new members, new flexibility and a greater commitment to Jewish vitality. </p> \n<p>American Jews taught me that we cannot navigate around philanthropy. If we want to build a house, we invest. If we want to develop our businesses, we invest. If we want to revive and grow our communities we must invest. </p> \n<p>We shouldn't wait for the current structures in Europe to lead us, for they will deliver more of the same. It's time to leap in new directions by matching new ideas and energy with an investment in ourselves. </p> \n<p>Claude Kandiyoti is a Brussels-based entrepreneur and publisher of &quot;Contact J,&quot; a monthly of the Belgian Jewish community. </p> \n<p>More Jewish World news and features </p>",

        "text":["<p>Top military commander Mustafa Badreddine, who died in an explosion in Damascus, is the latest of a number of senior figures from the Lebanese Shiite terror group to be killed in past years.</p> \n<p>In the past, Israel was the prime suspect in any assassinations, but since Hezbollah joined Syria's civil war in 2012 to support President Bashar Assad, it has lost several prominent members in combat and has gained a broader range of enemies. More than 1,000 of its foot soldiers have been killed in the Syria war, which began in 2011, compared to the 1,276 fighters killed during its 18-year guerrilla war with Israeli forces that occupied southern Lebanon until 2000.</p> \n<p>Here's a look at possible culprits in Badreddine's killing as well as a glance of previous senior members killed.</p> \n<p>Suspects</p> \n<p>Israel: Enmity runs deep between Israel and Hezbollah. The militant group touts itself as Lebanon's defender against Israel after the long fight against the Israeli occupation, and Israel as well as the United States considers the group a terrorist group bent on its destruction. Since the Israeli withdrawal, the two sides have come to blows several times, most disastrously in 2006, when weeks of fighting and Israeli bombardment devastated much of the south.</p> \n<p>Experts say Israel may seize the opportunity while Hezbollah is deeply involved in Syria to take out senior group members. A Lebanese TV station close to Hezbollah initially reported an Israeli airstrike killed Badreddine but it withdrew the report. Israel has not commented.</p> \n<p>Extremist groups: Sunni extremists linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group dominate the Syrian battlefield and are staunch opponents of Hezbollah. Though rivals on the ground, IS and al-Qaida's Syria branch, called the Nusra Front, consider Shiites to be apostates whose blood may be shed. Both have claimed responsibility for most of the suicide bombings in the war and attacks in Lebanon, including one against a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut in 2015 that killed nearly 50 people. They have killed Hezbollah officers during combat in Syria, but neither group is known to have carried out targeted assassinations against Hezbollah.</p> \n<p>Syrian rebels: Syrian rebels have been threatening Hezbollah since the group sent fighters to Syria. They have hit its positions in Syria with rockets and car bombings and battled Hezbollah forces directly on the ground.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia: The kingdom does not have a known history of sponsoring assassinations or of targeting Hezbollah directly, but tensions between it and the Lebanese Shiite group are at an all-time high. Saudi Arabia backs Syria's rebels and is a bitter opponent of Iran, Hezbollah's patron. Saudi Arabia suspended a $3 billion program funding Lebanon's security forces because of Hezbollah's power there and it backed an Arab League decision to label the group a terrorist organization. Saudi Arabia has also taken a more aggressive stance around the region, fighting Shiite rebels in Yemen that it says are a proxy for Iran and calling for the creation of a Muslim military force.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah regularly lashes out at Saudi Arabia in his public speeches, recently likening it to Israel, saying both are fueling Sunni-Shiite hatreds in the region. &quot;There is a history, there is a tension,&quot; said Matthew Levitt, a Washington Institute expert of Hezbollah, though he underlined that any talk of a culprit in Badreddine's death is speculation at the point.</p> \n<p>Past senior Hezbollah figures killed</p> \n<p>2016: Mustafa Badreddine, Hezbollah's top military commander, was killed in a blast in the Syrian capital of Damascus. Hezbollah, which announced his death on May 13, says it is investigating whether he was killed in an airstrike, missile, or artillery shelling.</p> \n<p>Ali Fayyadh, better known as Abu Alaa Bosna, who led some of Hezbollah's military operations in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Bosnia was killed in February during battles with the Islamic State group near the town of Khanaser in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo.</p> \n<p>2015: Samir Kantar, who spent 30 years in an Israeli prison for the 1979 killing of an Israel man his daughter and a policeman, was killed in December along with eight others in a suspected Israeli airstrike on a residential building in Jaramana, a Damascus suburb.</p> \n<p>Hassan Hussein al-Haj, a top Hezbollah commander, was killed in October while fighting al-Qaida-linked fighters in the northwestern province of Idlib. A week later, his replacement, Mahdi Hassan Obeid, was killed during fighting in the same province.</p> \n<p>An Israeli airstrike in southern Syria killed Jihad Mughniyeh and five other Hezbollah fighters in January. Mughniyeh, the son of slain Hezbollah military chief Imad Mughniyeh, was apparently in charge of operations in the Golan Heights.</p> \n<p>2014: A senior military officer, Fawzi Ayoub, a dual Lebanese-Canadian citizen who was wanted by the FBI on charges of trying to use a forged U.S. passport to enter Israel, was killed in May in Syria's northern province of Aleppo, reportedly in an ambush by Western-backed rebels.</p> \n<p>2013: Senior Hezbollah commander Hassan al-Laqis was assassinated by gunmen in southern Beirut in December. Hezbollah blamed Israel for the killing.</p> \n<p>2008: Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah's military chief, was killed when a bomb planted in his car exploded in Damascus. Mughniyeh was one of the world's most elusive militants, accused of engineering suicide bombings during Lebanon's civil war and of planning the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed. He had vanished from public view for 15 years before his death but had become one of the most powerful figures within Hezbollah during that time. Hezbollah blamed his killing on Israel. Mughniyeh was the brother-in-law and mentor of Badreddine, who replaced him after his death.</p> \n<p>1992: Sheikh Abbas al-Musawi, one of the founders of Hezbollah, was killed along with his 5-year-old son and four others in an airstrike by Israeli helicopters on his motorcade in southern Lebanon.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In front-line villages of south Lebanon, the posters of Hezbollah members killed fighting Israel 10 years ago still stand, but have faded. Now rising up around them is a new generation of posters, bearing the faces of young fighters from the militant group killed in Syria.</p> \n<p>They reflect the Shi'ite group's radical shift from decades fighting Israel, a cause that at one time earned it soaring popularity across the Arab and Muslim world, to the far less popular role fighting fellow Arabs in defense of Syria's president, Bashar Assad.</p> \n<p>It is a venture that is proving costly. The war in neighboring Syria is bleeding Hezbollah of fighters and experienced military commanders, and has left the group more vulnerable to accusations of complete subservience to Iran, which rallied Hezbollah to intervene in the war. So far, more than a thousand of the group's fighters, including several founding members, have been killed in Syria, a toll higher than the one incurred by the group in nearly two decades of fighting Israeli occupation&nbsp;forces.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah's involvement in Syria has also changed the public discourse around the group in the Arab world in general and at home in Lebanon, where it continues to dominate politics but is much more publicly criticized. Public opinion is sharply polarized among those who see the group as dragging Lebanon into the Syria morass, and others who support it.</p> \n<p>&quot;I think that we're seeing rumblings of discontent. I mean some families obviously aren't happy. We've heard a lot of stories about families saying why are our kids dying in Syria, we can understand them dying in the fight against Israel but why are they dying in the fight in Syria,&quot; said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.</p> \n<p>But whatever criticism of Hezbollah exists among Lebanese Shiites, it tends to remain inside the Shiite community. Public support for the group so far appears intact because the majority of Shiites still see supporting Assad, a member of the minority Alawite sect that is an offshoot of Shiite Islam, as crucial and vital to their interests.</p> \n<p>That's in part because of how Hezbollah frames the war to its supporters. The group has depicted itself as battling Sunni extremists intent on wiping out Shiites, arguing it must fight them in Syria to keep them away from Lebanon. It also calls the war an extension of its fight against Israel, saying that Syria is under attack from Western powers seeking to eliminate Assad as a &quot;center of resistance&quot; to Israel.</p> \n<p>&quot;Syria has been the worst imaginable piece of news for Hezbollah. A challenge that has transformed the party into something it does not want: the perception of a Sunni killer,&quot; said Bilal Saab, a senior fellow for Middle East Security at the Atlantic Council.</p> \n<p>It is difficult to measure sentiment within Hezbollah, a highly secretive and disciplined organization. On the 10th anniversary of the 2006 war with Israel, an Associated Press team gained rare access into the homes of slain fighters in south Lebanon, where relatives grieved but said they supported the group's justifications for fighting in Syria.</p> \n<p>In one home, the socks and boots stained with the blood of a Hezbollah fighter killed in 2006 are on display in the sitting room of his parents' house. In another, the military uniform worn by a fighter killed in Syria lay on his bed, laid out carefully by his grieving mother.</p> \n<p>&quot;Khalil was my soul but I won't hide my son and say, let other people send their children,&quot; said Hanan Ibrahim, whose son Khalil was killed near Damascus on Dec. 27, 2013. &quot;He should go (fight in Syria), and my other son too and if I had a third son I would also send him,&quot; she said, speaking in her living room, decorated with a giant picture of her son Khalil on a&nbsp;front line in Syria.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah's popularity across the Arab world and in Lebanon had taken a major hit beginning in 2005, when it was accused by some of being behind the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri with a massive bombing in Beirut. In 2008, the group briefly seized several Sunni neighborhoods of west Beirut after the government closed down its secret telecommunications network, pointing its weapons internally for the first time since the end of Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian war has, according to its critics, left the group looking even more like an Iranian tool fighting for its own self-interest.</p> \n<p>It is a far cry from back in 2000, when Hezbollah was celebrated across much of the Arab world, including among Sunnis, for its guerrilla campaign that eventually forced Israeli troops to pull out of a slice of southern Lebanon they had occupied for 18 years. And despite some criticism, the group was supported by the majority of Lebanese during the 2006 war with Israel, which began with a cross-border Hezbollah raid that kidnapped two Israeli soldiers, triggering a massive Israeli air and ground campaign.</p> \n<p>The 2006 fighting killed about 1,200 Lebanese, including hundreds of civilians, and about 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers. The war failed to neutralize the group's rocket threat, and Israeli officials say Hezbollah's improved missile arsenal is now capable of striking virtually anywhere in the country.</p> \n<p>Israeli political and military leaders, however, say that the war succeeded&nbsp;in re-establishing Israeli deterrence and provided a decade of quiet on its northern front — and gleefully note that the group's leader Hassan Nasrallah is still in hiding 10 years later.</p> \n<p>Israeli officials also acknowledge that as a group, Hezbollah is amassing more combat experience and has more than replenished its arms via smuggling from Syria. That pipeline is one key reason why preserving the existing Syrian regime is seen as so existential for Hezbollah.</p> \n<p>In the front-line village of Aynata, only few miles away from the Israeli border, residents vividly recall the 2006 war. The village was heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes and ground fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters. Fourteen Hezbollah fighters and 28 civilians were killed.</p> \n<p>Since Hezbollah began sending fighters to Syria in 2012, six other fighters from the village have died.</p> \n<p>&quot;What is common between these two wars is that they are existential wars against Hezbollah, and to be more precise, it is a war against Shiites,&quot; said Hisham Khanafer, whose two younger brothers, Moussa and Abbas, were killed — one fighting Israel in 2006 and one in Syria last year.</p> \n<p>Abbas, who was 25, had planned to marry his fiancee as soon as he returned from Syria. Moussa was 29, his third daughter born on the day he was killed.</p> \n<p>Khanafer wears a yellow shawl, the color of the Hezbollah flag, with portraits of his slain brothers on each side. &quot;Every war has a price,&quot; he says.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah first began sending fighters in small numbers to Syria in 2012, to help protect Shiite shrines near the capital, Damascus, and has gradually escalated its involvement, dispatching fighters to ever more distant places to shore up the battered forces of Assad. Nearly 30 Hezbollah fighters were killed in one single battle around the city of&nbsp;Aleppo near the Turkish border last month.</p> \n<p>&quot;For Israel, this is a dream scenario. All its enemies are killing each other in Syria... without them having to fire a bullet or place even one soldier in the line of fire,&quot; said Yahya of the Carnegie Middle East Center.</p> \n<p>She said although Hezbollah's overall control is not as tight as it used to be, the group is nowhere near a breaking point yet.</p>",

Several planned visits have been scrapped for security reasons. </p> \n<p>UNICEF says at least 573 Palestinians under 18 and 104 children on the Israeli side have been killed in violence that erupted in Sept. 2000.

        "text":["<p>Archaeologists announced Monday that they have found a cave in the Judean Hills leading to the oldest baptismal site discovered to date - a huge water cistern decorated with evocative wall carvings where they believe John the Baptist anointed many disciples. </p> \n<p>During a tour of the cave at Kibbutz Tzuba, south of Jerusalem, archaeologists presented the ancient wall decorations, as well as a stone they believe was used for ceremonial foot washing. </p> \n<p>They also reported sifting about 250,000 pottery shards from the cave, the apparent remnants of small water jugs used in baptismal ritual. The oldest shards are from the mid-second century B.C.E. </p> \n<p>&quot;The site we've uncovered is seemingly the connecting link between Jewish and Christian baptism,&quot; said British archaeologist Shimon Gibson, who heads the private Jerusalem Archaeological Field Unit and supervised the dig. </p> \n<p>However, others said there was no actual proof that John the Baptist ever set foot in the cave, located about four kilometers from Jerusalem's Ein Kerem neighborhood, birthplace of the preacher and the site where, Christian tradition holds, he baptized Jesus. </p> \n<p>&quot;Unfortunately, we didn't find any inscriptions,&quot; said James Tabor, a religious studies professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, which helped sponsor the dig. </p> \n<p>Both Tabor and Gibson said it was very likely that the Byzantine-era wall carvings, including one showing a man with a staff and wearing animal skin, referred to John the Baptist. </p> \n<p>The discovery, if confirmed, would be among the most significant breakthroughs for biblical scholars in memory. </p> \n<p>Kibbutz Tzuba members led Gibson to the cave in 1999, and he proceeded to measure it as part of an environmental-archaeological survey he was conducting. To his surprise, he uncovered drawings carved into the walls when he crawled through the small opening and began removing boulders near the wall. The drawings, dated to the fourth or fifth century C.E., display symbols related to John the Baptist, including his image, decapitated head, hand (the only bodily remnant, according to scripture), and a cross shape. </p> \n<p>Gibson and his assistant, Rafi Lewis, spent three years excavating the cave, which measures 26 meters long and around 4 meters wide, with an average height of 5 meters. </p> \n<p>Archaeologists said the cave was carved in the Iron Age, somewhere between 800 and 500 B.C.E., by Israelite monks who apparently used it as an immersion pool. </p> \n<p>The most striking discovery dates from the first century C.E.: it indicates &quot;a ritual that differed from the normative Jewish ritual&quot; of the time. Believers would have walked down 28 stone steps, at the bottom of which they would have placed their right foot onto a stone with an imprint of a foot, about shoe size 45. A small depression to the right of the imprint would have contained oil, to be poured over the foot for cleansing, Gibson said. </p> \n<p>No less striking was the discovery that the whitewash covering the cave walls and steps dates from the eighth-sixth centuries BCE, a finding confirmed in tests by both the Weizmann and Geological Institutes. That means that activity at this site began during the reign of the Judean kings and ended with the destruction of the First Temple. </p>",

        "text":["<p>At the age of 25 his future was assured, attached to the tail of a cat. Even if he harbored a teeny bit of hate for the cat that had taken over his life, thanks to the legend of &quot;Shmil the Cat,&quot; Natan Datner was able to buy his first car, an orange Volkswagen. This was back in the 1980s, the heyday of state-run Channel 1 (then a monopoly) and of Educational Television. In those days, Thursday at 4 P.M. was a sacred time for the whole family because that was when the madcap program &quot;Zehu Zeh&quot; was broadcast, followed by Shmil, who entertained the kids at 5:30. </p> \n<p>Back then, Datner drove his Volkswagen from the Educational TV studios in Tel Aviv to Be'er Sheva every day. It was a long drive, and the man inside the cat used the time to slough off the furry mask and transform himself into one of the actors most identified with the southern theater company. Now, 23 years later, Datner is smiling. He looks at the first article ever published about him and spreads the two pages on the desk in his new office. He leans back and stretches, and the black executive chair changes position, allowing him to sink deeply into it. Now he is the managing director and the artistic director of the theater that took him on as a young man. He never stops smoking for a second, draws imaginary lines in the air as he stretches and smiles his, well, cat-like smile, enjoying the idea of having come full circle. </p> \n<p>Datner gazes at his image on the pages of the old newspaper (Haaretz, as it happens). &quot;I remember my mother, of blessed memory, waking me up with that copy of Haaretz in her hands, with the first newspaper article ever about me. It was first thing in the morning.&quot; </p> \n<p>In the winter of 1981, Haaretz correspondent Michael Ohad informed the paper's readers that a new star had been discovered. Ohad was reviewing a production of Moliere's &quot;The Rogueries of Scapin,&quot; directed by Dan Ronen. Ohad couldn't get over the fact that a provincial theater like the one in Be'er Sheva, &quot;which exists on a shoestring budget,&quot; was succeeding in the mission. &quot;This is the most entertaining play you will be able to see this month on any Israeli stage,&quot; Ohad declared, adding, &quot;Natan Datner is a sabra [Israeli-born] Scapin who is the equal of any of the great Frenchmen who preceded him.&quot; </p> \n<p>Some Be'er Sheva high-school girls also noticed this phenomenon. They stormed the doors of the theater during the preview performances, looking for Scapin/Shmil the Cat. After one performance the theater's maintenance man had to whitewash an entire wall of the bathroom, which was covered with scrawled hearts and declarations of love for Datner from a girl named Shula. </p> \n<p>Saving the club </p> \n<p> Datner was appointed to his new position half a year ago, a month before his 48th birthday. &quot;My friends asked me why I was looking for trouble. They thought I was off my rocker,&quot; he says. </p> \n<p>Datner took over when the Be'er Sheva Theater appeared to be in real danger of closing for good. There wasn't even enough money for a shoestring. Cuts in the state budget and the inability of the Be'er Sheva local government to support the theater at a sufficient level had generated a deficit of NIS 3 million, creating serious operating problems. Only a donation of NIS 1.5 from U.S.-based Israeli tycoon Haim Saban and a special allocation from the government prevented the theater's closure. That narrow escape occurred just as Datner was taking over; today the theater has a balanced budget and all systems are go. </p> \n<p>In the early afternoon Datner is sitting in front of the computer in his office, his arms resting on a photocopy of a play in English, with a schedule of performances on the screen. &quot;This is the skeleton of the theater,&quot; he explains with the excitement of someone who is still learning. &quot;Every wrong move here can cost me a lot of money. Creating this schedule is an art, but that's something else that probably doesn't interest you,&quot; he says evasively, organizing week after week of the schedule. </p> \n<p>Datner is one of the few actors in Israel who has been appointed managing director and artistic director of an establishment theater (others include Oded Kotler and Ronny Pinkovitz at the Haifa Theater and Shlomo Bar Shavit at Habimah Theater). Datner was passionately eager to get the job for years. He submitted his candidacy as early as 1994, but lost out to Gadi Rol, who replaced the veteran Tzippi Pines, who had been the theater's director for 12 years, since 1982. Datner wanted another type of professional recognition: The stage was not enough. &quot;I always looked for more challenges - there is something boring about the actor's work routine. I get a thrill from performing, but is that all there is? Will that be my whole life? I felt that I wanted something more.&quot; </p> \n<p>His appointment, succeeding Dr. Razi Amitai (who followed Rol), came as no surprise. Despite a lengthy list of candidates, and notwithstanding his lack of experience at the managerial end, the theater wanted him. The committee that chose him was out to create a &quot;star aura&quot; for the theater - to install someone who would regenerate interest in the faltering repertoire company. </p> \n<p>Datner: &quot;When I took over, the theater company was in poor shape. The Be'er Sheva Theater had a poor image in the Israeli theater world. The feeling was that the theater wasn't attractive, that it wasn't succeeding in doing something that was appealing enough to the public. It was a theater that didn't communicate. In the situation of the theater today, whatever you do will look good.&quot; </p> \n<p>For many, though, the situation has not changed and the disappointment has been bitter. Prof. Haim Finkelstein, chairman of the arts department at Ben-Gurion University (BGU) of the Negev in Be'er Sheva, insists that he cannot render an opinion about the local Theater. Finkelstein lives in Omer, a posh Be'er Sheva suburb, just minutes from the theater, but hasn't been to a production there for the past three years. It has something to do with a general flight of a particular elite from the theater in Israel, but in Be'er Sheva the &quot;divorce&quot; is far more acute. Many culture devotees perceive the theater as being amateurish, from the level of the text to the level of the acting. </p> \n<p>Prof. Yisrael German, vice president of BGU and a member of the theater's public board, makes no secret of this: &quot;The selection of Natan was part of an effort to bring about a breakthrough; it was a statement that said we were not giving up. It's a move that is intended to being us from a relatively low point, regrettably, to new heights. People here are very patriotic, and those who are attached to the place are also very critical about what's going on. The situation hurts them. I don't know if it's bitterness, but they don't think they are getting satisfaction from the local theater, so they simply go to Tel Aviv. In my opinion, the bottom line is that we have to present a quality product. At the end of the day people have to say, `That's the kind of club I want to belong to.'&quot; </p> \n<p>Datner is aware of the feeling of alienation, of the unwillingness of potential theatergoers to be part of the club. </p> \n<p>&quot;I know, I know, it will take me at least two seasons to make everyone who doesn't come to the theater feel that they are missing something,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope I will succeed in creating a stimulus that will make them want to come to the theater. I promise an interesting repertoire, some classics, original plays, contemporary drama from the international scene, along with a number of select plays that we will host here. The overall effect will be a theatrical encounter, a feeling that there is somewhere to go in the evening and have a good time. For 10 years there was a certain process here that led to mistaken decisions that landed the Be'er Sheva Theater in the condition it now finds itself. Apparently, bad decisions were made here. The task now is to restore the theater's status both in the city and in the country as a whole. That can't be done in a day, but it definitely can be done.&quot; </p> \n<p>Overcoming Be'er Sheva </p> \n<p> Datner brings positive energy and also incipient signs of pay dirt. The &quot;Guide to the Good Life,&quot; written and directed by Yael Ronen, the daughter of veteran director Ilan Ronen, augurs well. The play began as a production of third-year acting students at the Seminar Hakibbutzim Teachers College. The number of subjects the play touches on might sound a bit too much - laid-back backpackers who did the India scene, a newsman who reports on a terrorist attack while he is in bed with a young girl, army service in the territories, the bourgeoisie and MachsomWatch [a voluntary women's group that observes goings-on at army checkpoints] - but on the stage the play comes off as credible and convincing. </p> \n<p>Datner decided to buy the play as his first strategic move: &quot;I am the only one who was brave enough to take it. The subject matter is problematic and it's a group of young actors, too, but despite all that I decided to give them a full stage. I could have taken the play as a guest production, but I wanted it as my own, as a play I will sell around the country. The audience that comes to see the play won't have an easy time, because it's a daring work, but they will see a good play, which has all the artistic class you could want. At Habimah [in Tel Aviv] it's a sellout.&quot; </p> \n<p>For the Be'er Sheva Theater, the play is the trumpet fanfare that begins the parade. It's a call to the audience but also to theater people all over the country. Directors who are just starting out, such as Yael Ronen, who would have been swallowed up in other theater companies, will get exposure and appreciation in Be'er Sheva. Datner is out to bring new talent to the Israeli theater world from the south. &quot;Just as the Be'er Sheva Theater once gave me the opportunity of a lifetime, I will now give others an opportunity.&quot; </p> \n<p>The rest of the repertoire reflects an attempt to come up with communicative quality. The Be'er Sheva Theater staged the children's play &quot;Alei Kinor,&quot; adapted, 30 years ago, by Hanan Shnir and Ada Ben Nahum from a story by Sholem Aleichem, and the new production is generally considered to be an alternative to the commercial trap of children's theater in the center of the country. &quot;Between Us,&quot; by the American playwright Joe Hortua (translated and directed by Avishai Milstein), which had its Israeli premiere earlier this month, tells the story of the complicated marriages of two American couples with the help of two Israeli television stars, Nir Levy and Tamar Michael, and also features David Kigler, a Be'er Sheva native, who is married to his partner in the play, Edwa Adani. At the height of the drama, Levy and Michael are electrifying, but the tension fades for long stretches. Maybe that's why, in addition to the hearty laughter at the performance last Wednesday, one member of the audience was overheard to say, in a soft Russian accent, &quot;the revealing dress of the actress with the light hair [Michaeli] was the most interesting thing about the play.&quot; </p> \n<p>Three more intriguing projects are on tap in the current season. The first is a classic comedy, &quot;The Coffee House,&quot; by the 18th-century Italian dramatist Carlo Goldoni (author of &quot;Servant to Two Masters&quot; and &quot;The Venetian Twins&quot;), which will be directed by Ronny Sinai and feature a group of young actors from the Be'er Sheva Theater. A second project will be an adaptation by Yael Ronen of Emir Kusturica's film, &quot;Underground,&quot; in which a Bosnian soldier and a Serbian soldier meet in the midst of the fighting and get to know each other. Finally, Hagit Rehavi, who formerly managed the Orna Porat Theater for Children and Youth, and this year wrote and directed the play &quot;A Child of My Own,&quot; will direct a play next season about a group of Habimah actors who put on a play in Moscow. </p> \n<p>But Amitai, the outgoing director of the Be'er Sheva Theater (and now the director of a cultural center in Holon), notes that it is not going to be easy. He recalls the brutal image that he says will plague the Datner era, too: &quot;It always seemed that a play that arrived from the center of the country was better than any play the Be'er Sheva Theater could mount. That was a bit if a pose: The people who loved not to love the Be'er Sheva Theater were the same people who found the coffee in Tel Aviv tastier than the coffee in Be'er Sheva. One of Natan's challenges will be to fight the image of Be'er Sheva, to overcome the word Be'er Sheva.&quot; </p> \n<p>Amitai, who recommended Datner's appointment, believes that &quot;the name of the game today is marketing, period. That takes resources. Today it's easier to sell a play of Habimah or the Cameri Theater or Beit Lessin than to sell a play of the Be'er Sheva Theater. They are stronger theaters and they have a larger marketing budget. From my present position in the cultural center, when I see the tools I have at my disposal here, I understand how blocked I was in Be'er Sheva.&quot; </p> \n<p>Datner understands, too. According to the data of Yael Alter, the theater's administrative director, the Be'er Sheva Municipality is not supporting the theater as it is required to do - by donating NIS 1 for every NIS 1 of the state budget. Even though the Education Ministry allocated NIS 5.2 million for the theater this year, the municipality responded with only NIS 1.1 million. The Cameri Theater gets at least four times that amount from the Tel Aviv Municipality. </p> \n<p>&quot;When Limor Livnat took over as education minister the criteria changed,&quot; Rubik Danilovich, Be'er Sheva deputy mayor in charge of education, explains. &quot;The Be'er Sheva Municipality was forced to allocate 50 percent [of the theater's expenses], with the other 50 percent coming from the ministry, as opposed to 10 percent according to an earlier agreement. The total budget transferred by the municipality to the theater in 2004 is NIS 2.7 million. Following a change that was decided upon and agreed upon by the city council in recent weeks, the theater will become a non-institutional corporation so that it will be possible for it to receive a larger budget from the government: 85 percent with 15 percent local participation.&quot; </p> \n<p>Because of the meager external sources of revenue, the theater's self-generated income needs to fill the gap. According to Datner's figures, 70 percent of the theater's revenues are self-generated. </p> \n<p>&quot;This is where the trap starts,&quot; he says, taking a deep breath. &quot;The buyers - the people who buy plays for large audiences - want big names, because selling plays and raising funds is interconnected with big-name actors. And I have a serious problem holding onto well-known actors. In principle, such actors make very good salaries, because they bring money into the theater. For the most part they are free-lancers, getting a salary according to the number of plays they perform in. So they prefer Tel Aviv - the big theaters in the center offer those actors more plays up front. I can't provide that in Be'er Sheva.&quot; </p> \n<p>If famous actors can't get a good economic deal in Be'er Sheva, Datner will have to find other ways to tempt them - such as offering them roles they wouldn't get in metropolitan Tel Aviv. </p> \n<p>&quot;It's a jungle,&quot; Datner sighs. &quot;I have to fight lions like Noam Semel [director of the Cameri Theater], Yaakov Agmon [Habimah] and Tzippi Pines [Beit Lessin]. At the same time, I have to fight the buyers, because today the buyers are setting the tone in Israeli theater, and that is a major problem. They do what they want, or what the subscribers want, and the subscribers are usually a pampered audience. In a situation like this you must not fail and you must not be daring - you always have to come up with something that the buyer likes. That's the first thing I hear in meetings with them. The second question is who the actors in the play are, and if I don't bring them a top name, I'm in trouble right off the bat.&quot; </p> \n<p>He falls into a contemplative silence. He has two options: either to become a cheap imitation of the Tel Aviv-area theaters, or try to be something else. &quot;If things go on this way,&quot; he cautions, &quot;the way singers' performances at Caesarea have become slapdash, because the audience comes not to listen but to sing along with the artist, the same thing will happen to the Israeli theater.&quot; </p> \n<p>The cat in the mask </p> \n<p> Datner - who is married to Smadar, an industrial and management engineer, and is the father of Sharon, 16, and Yuval, 8 - was born and raised in Ramat Gan. He spent his childhood with a knitted skullcap on his head (an identifying mark of the national-religious public) and a violin in his hand, in the image of his parents, Tzipora and Yosef, both Holocaust survivors. His mother, who was imprisoned in Auschwitz, decided that her son would receive a religious education, even though Datner's older sister was sent to a secular kindergarten. </p> \n<p>Datner: &quot;Mother was very religious, Father was not. There are two genres among Holocaust survivors: those who said there is no God because there was a Holocaust - that was my father - and those who said there is God because you were spared, which was my mother.&quot; </p> \n<p>In the religious kindergarten Datner was Mordechai the Jew at Purim and Bar Kochba at Hanukkah. He acted out the whole Bible. He was one of those children who the theater simply chooses, in whose blood the theater flows without control. In high school he dispensed with the skullcap and devoted himself to parties in Givatayim. Like American high-school parties in the 1970s, rock groups got the whole school dancing in the gym. Datner still has a place in his heart for those special rock `n roll moments. </p> \n<p>Before army service, he and some friends set up a Nahal paramilitary garin (&quot;core group&quot;) that was supposed to settle in one of the kibbutzim in the southern Arava or in the Jordan Valley. Datner was the group's coordinator, and all their meetings took place in the bomb-shelter of his apartment building. However, when he was accepted to a military entertainment troupe, the ardent ideology vanished quickly. The others in the group made his life miserable, accusing him of deserting them for frivolous ends. In the end his father put a stop to the conflict. </p> \n<p>Datner: &quot;I decided to leave the core group and go to an army troupe after my father intervened. He pushed me like crazy, telling me nonstop to do an audition. It was amazing. He was my driving force - that was his life's dream and that's why he was so insistent. I fulfilled what he dreamed for himself.&quot; </p> \n<p>The period between 1967 (the Six-Day War) and 1973 (the Yom Kippur War) was a time of glory for the army entertainment troupes. Datner was inducted in 1974. &quot;No one knew about us and no one heard of us, the media were no longer interested,&quot; he recalls. &quot;When I left the troupe I knew I was totally anonymous.&quot; The decision to go for &quot;Shmil the Cat,&quot; the children's television program, was not all that obvious. &quot;I was afraid people wouldn't know who I was, because I had to wear a mask. We talked it over at home, but Dad said not to worry, people would know me, and he said going into television was the best way to meet people in the profession. The truth is that he pushed me again at the right moment.&quot; </p> \n<p>The cat launched Datner's career. The Be'er Sheva Theater, which was founded a decade earlier, in 1973, was looking for an actor-singer for one play, and Datner got the part. In the office where Datner is now sitting was Gary Bilu, and he promised to make an actor out of Datner. And so he did, according to that old article in Haaretz. </p> \n<p>The 1980s were a unique experience for actors in Israel. The theaters operated on the basis of ensemble groups, and in Be'er Sheva the actors lived in a full-fledged commune. </p> \n<p>&quot;Life was a mixed bag,&quot; Datner says. &quot;We lived a community life, in the city, and created our own thing. We were 15 young people, including Gadi Rol, Rivka Neuman, Doron Tavori and Hannah Roth. After the play we went for drinks at each other's places and we kept up the ensemble atmosphere. There were loves and hates. I remember being in the theater all the time, even in the morning, when I didn't have rehearsals, I would be here - it was my home. If I didn't have a performance in the evening I watched the plays of others. I lived the theater 24 hours a day. Those three years were my formative period.&quot; </p> \n<p>The continuation of his career, now past the &quot;hopeful&quot; phase, was as a freelance actor. He worked everywhere - at Beit Lessin, the Jerusalem Khan (in an adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer's &quot;Gimpel the Fool&quot;) and at Habimah, where he appeared with the actress Yona Elian. In 1987 he hit the big time when he, along with Avi Kushnir, represented Israel at the Eurovision song contest. The two called themselves Habatlanim (&quot;The Bums&quot;) and wore dark suits and dark glasses, &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; style. They didn't take Europe by storm (they finished in eighth place), but in Israel they were a huge hit. &quot;I met Kushnir at the Be'er Sheva Theater when we performed together in `The Taming of the Shrew,'&quot; he recalls fondly, adding that he considers that production one of the high points at the Be'er Sheva Theater. &quot;We represented the theater in Europe. When people asked us what we did, we always said we were actors from the Be'er Sheva Theater.&quot; </p> \n<p>Datner went on to the Cameri Theater (&quot;A Comedy of Errors&quot;) and then returned to Beit Lessin where, under the tutelage of Pines, he did the bulk of his theater work, appearing in major productions such as &quot;The Odd Couple,&quot; &quot;Desire,&quot; &quot;Ismailiya&quot; and &quot;Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks,&quot; which is still running. </p> \n<p>To help make ends meet, he still relies, as his father suggested, on television, where he can be seen frequently both in one-time dramas (&quot;Sherman in Winter,&quot; &quot;Silence of the Birds&quot;) and in series. The latter have undoubtedly done more than anything else to influence his public image. For many viewers Natan Datner is not the director of a theater, but the father of the adoptive family in the series &quot;Family and a Half.&quot; Yet above all he is Amnon Dvir, the father of Yehuda Levy (and the lover of Dafna Rechter) in the telenovela &quot;Love Around the Corner.&quot; That's the bit of moonlighting that Datner has stuck with, devoting one day a week to it when new episodes are shot. </p> \n<p>Things are happening </p> \n<p> Some people ask: If the director of the Be'er Sheva Theater lives in the Zahala neighborhood of Tel Aviv (&quot;We are not moving to Be'er Sheva because of the children&quot;) and if the actors come to the performances from their homes in Tel Aviv and if the rehearsals take place in Tel Aviv and if at the end of the performance the actors return to Tel Aviv - why not just bring in plays from the Cameri or Habimah? For many people, including residents of Be'er Sheva and the area, the reason for the local theater's right of existence is not entirely obvious. </p> \n<p>How can it be made clear to them that the mandate given to the city theater is important? Start a day camp. </p> \n<p>Last summer, Datner organized a day camp, during which 300 children showed up at the theater every morning and gladdened the director's heart. They made masks and built props, they sewed costumes and rehearsed. Their parents were utterly thrilled. After the day camp, drama groups were started. &quot;I now have 170 kids and 70 adults in the theater group,&quot; Datner exults. </p> \n<p>The next project along these lines is the establishment of the first acting school in Be'er Sheva. The municipality has given the go-ahead and Datner is working tirelessly to turn the dream into reality. The first class is expected to open at the end of 2005 or the beginning of 2006. </p> \n<p>&quot;There is no reason why a city like Be'er Sheva, the metropolis of the south, shouldn't have an acting school,&quot; he says. &quot;Why should youngsters who want to learn acting have to go to Tel Aviv? Here they will have a school that will gather them together and integrate them into productions of the theater.&quot; </p> \n<p>Now comes the turn of the Be'er Sheva Municipality. Holon is a prime example of a city that is becoming more attractive from one month to the next thanks to the burgeoning arts scene there. Datner discovered, for example, that the construction of the new home of the Be'er Sheva Theater, in the city center, wasn't yet completed. &quot;People say that the only workers who show up at the site are the ones who change the sign that announces the postponement of the opening, from summer 2004 to summer 2005, and maybe to summer 2006.&quot; </p> \n<p>Toward the end of the interview, night descends swiftly, the sky is in a meltdown from red to black. Datner will make it to the train station right on time. </p> \n<p>&quot;I am going home with the feeling that it's happening,&quot; he says, tired but manifestly happy. &quot;I remember my friends, who asked me why I needed this craziness, why I had to take on all the difficulties of management. They wanted me to be stuck with acting only. On the train, after a long day of work, I feel that things are happening, that my apprehensions are fading away. When I leave Be'er Sheva, knowing that at 8:30 P.M. exactly the audience will enter the theater hall, the feeling is that it really is succeeding.&quot; n</p>",

        "text":["<p>At the age of 25 his future was assured, attached to the tail of a cat. Even if he harbored a teeny bit of hate for the cat that had taken over his life, thanks to the legend of &quot;Shmil the Cat,&quot; Natan Datner was able to buy his first car, an orange Volkswagen. This was back in the 1980s, the heyday of state-run Channel 1 (then a monopoly) and of Educational Television. In those days, Thursday at 4 P.M. was a sacred time for the whole family because that was when the madcap program &quot;Zehu Zeh&quot; was broadcast, followed by Shmil, who entertained the kids at 5:30. </p> \n<p>Back then, Datner drove his Volkswagen from the Educational TV studios in Tel Aviv to Be'er Sheva every day. It was a long drive, and the man inside the cat used the time to slough off the furry mask and transform himself into one of the actors most identified with the southern theater company. Now, 23 years later, Datner is smiling. He looks at the first article ever published about him and spreads the two pages on the desk in his new office. He leans back and stretches, and the black executive chair changes position, allowing him to sink deeply into it. Now he is the managing director and the artistic director of the theater that took him on as a young man. He never stops smoking for a second, draws imaginary lines in the air as he stretches and smiles his, well, cat-like smile, enjoying the idea of having come full circle. </p> \n<p>Datner gazes at his image on the pages of the old newspaper (Haaretz, as it happens). &quot;I remember my mother, of blessed memory, waking me up with that copy of Haaretz in her hands, with the first newspaper article ever about me. It was first thing in the morning.&quot; </p> \n<p>In the winter of 1981, Haaretz correspondent Michael Ohad informed the paper's readers that a new star had been discovered. Ohad was reviewing a production of Moliere's &quot;The Rogueries of Scapin,&quot; directed by Dan Ronen. Ohad couldn't get over the fact that a provincial theater like the one in Be'er Sheva, &quot;which exists on a shoestring budget,&quot; was succeeding in the mission. &quot;This is the most entertaining play you will be able to see this month on any Israeli stage,&quot; Ohad declared, adding, &quot;Natan Datner is a sabra [Israeli-born] Scapin who is the equal of any of the great Frenchmen who preceded him.&quot; </p> \n<p>Some Be'er Sheva high-school girls also noticed this phenomenon. They stormed the doors of the theater during the preview performances, looking for Scapin/Shmil the Cat. After one performance the theater's maintenance man had to whitewash an entire wall of the bathroom, which was covered with scrawled hearts and declarations of love for Datner from a girl named Shula. </p> \n<p>Saving the club </p> \n<p> Datner was appointed to his new position half a year ago, a month before his 48th birthday. &quot;My friends asked me why I was looking for trouble. They thought I was off my rocker,&quot; he says. </p> \n<p>Datner took over when the Be'er Sheva Theater appeared to be in real danger of closing for good. There wasn't even enough money for a shoestring. Cuts in the state budget and the inability of the Be'er Sheva local government to support the theater at a sufficient level had generated a deficit of NIS 3 million, creating serious operating problems. Only a donation of NIS 1.5 from U.S.-based Israeli tycoon Haim Saban and a special allocation from the government prevented the theater's closure. That narrow escape occurred just as Datner was taking over; today the theater has a balanced budget and all systems are go. </p> \n<p>In the early afternoon Datner is sitting in front of the computer in his office, his arms resting on a photocopy of a play in English, with a schedule of performances on the screen. &quot;This is the skeleton of the theater,&quot; he explains with the excitement of someone who is still learning. &quot;Every wrong move here can cost me a lot of money. Creating this schedule is an art, but that's something else that probably doesn't interest you,&quot; he says evasively, organizing week after week of the schedule. </p> \n<p>Datner is one of the few actors in Israel who has been appointed managing director and artistic director of an establishment theater (others include Oded Kotler and Ronny Pinkovitz at the Haifa Theater and Shlomo Bar Shavit at Habimah Theater). Datner was passionately eager to get the job for years. He submitted his candidacy as early as 1994, but lost out to Gadi Rol, who replaced the veteran Tzippi Pines, who had been the theater's director for 12 years, since 1982. Datner wanted another type of professional recognition: The stage was not enough. &quot;I always looked for more challenges - there is something boring about the actor's work routine. I get a thrill from performing, but is that all there is? Will that be my whole life? I felt that I wanted something more.&quot; </p> \n<p>His appointment, succeeding Dr. Razi Amitai (who followed Rol), came as no surprise. Despite a lengthy list of candidates, and notwithstanding his lack of experience at the managerial end, the theater wanted him. The committee that chose him was out to create a &quot;star aura&quot; for the theater - to install someone who would regenerate interest in the faltering repertoire company. </p> \n<p>Datner: &quot;When I took over, the theater company was in poor shape. The Be'er Sheva Theater had a poor image in the Israeli theater world. The feeling was that the theater wasn't attractive, that it wasn't succeeding in doing something that was appealing enough to the public. It was a theater that didn't communicate. In the situation of the theater today, whatever you do will look good.&quot; </p> \n<p>For many, though, the situation has not changed and the disappointment has been bitter. Prof. Haim Finkelstein, chairman of the arts department at Ben-Gurion University (BGU) of the Negev in Be'er Sheva, insists that he cannot render an opinion about the local Theater. Finkelstein lives in Omer, a posh Be'er Sheva suburb, just minutes from the theater, but hasn't been to a production there for the past three years. It has something to do with a general flight of a particular elite from the theater in Israel, but in Be'er Sheva the &quot;divorce&quot; is far more acute. Many culture devotees perceive the theater as being amateurish, from the level of the text to the level of the acting. </p> \n<p>Prof. Yisrael German, vice president of BGU and a member of the theater's public board, makes no secret of this: &quot;The selection of Natan was part of an effort to bring about a breakthrough; it was a statement that said we were not giving up. It's a move that is intended to being us from a relatively low point, regrettably, to new heights. People here are very patriotic, and those who are attached to the place are also very critical about what's going on. The situation hurts them. I don't know if it's bitterness, but they don't think they are getting satisfaction from the local theater, so they simply go to Tel Aviv. In my opinion, the bottom line is that we have to present a quality product. At the end of the day people have to say, `That's the kind of club I want to belong to.'&quot; </p> \n<p>Datner is aware of the feeling of alienation, of the unwillingness of potential theatergoers to be part of the club. </p> \n<p>&quot;I know, I know, it will take me at least two seasons to make everyone who doesn't come to the theater feel that they are missing something,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope I will succeed in creating a stimulus that will make them want to come to the theater. I promise an interesting repertoire, some classics, original plays, contemporary drama from the international scene, along with a number of select plays that we will host here. The overall effect will be a theatrical encounter, a feeling that there is somewhere to go in the evening and have a good time. For 10 years there was a certain process here that led to mistaken decisions that landed the Be'er Sheva Theater in the condition it now finds itself. Apparently, bad decisions were made here. The task now is to restore the theater's status both in the city and in the country as a whole. That can't be done in a day, but it definitely can be done.&quot; </p> \n<p>Overcoming Be'er Sheva </p> \n<p> Datner brings positive energy and also incipient signs of pay dirt. The &quot;Guide to the Good Life,&quot; written and directed by Yael Ronen, the daughter of veteran director Ilan Ronen, augurs well. The play began as a production of third-year acting students at the Seminar Hakibbutzim Teachers College. The number of subjects the play touches on might sound a bit too much - laid-back backpackers who did the India scene, a newsman who reports on a terrorist attack while he is in bed with a young girl, army service in the territories, the bourgeoisie and MachsomWatch [a voluntary women's group that observes goings-on at army checkpoints] - but on the stage the play comes off as credible and convincing. </p> \n<p>Datner decided to buy the play as his first strategic move: &quot;I am the only one who was brave enough to take it. The subject matter is problematic and it's a group of young actors, too, but despite all that I decided to give them a full stage. I could have taken the play as a guest production, but I wanted it as my own, as a play I will sell around the country. The audience that comes to see the play won't have an easy time, because it's a daring work, but they will see a good play, which has all the artistic class you could want. At Habimah [in Tel Aviv] it's a sellout.&quot; </p> \n<p>For the Be'er Sheva Theater, the play is the trumpet fanfare that begins the parade. It's a call to the audience but also to theater people all over the country. Directors who are just starting out, such as Yael Ronen, who would have been swallowed up in other theater companies, will get exposure and appreciation in Be'er Sheva. Datner is out to bring new talent to the Israeli theater world from the south. &quot;Just as the Be'er Sheva Theater once gave me the opportunity of a lifetime, I will now give others an opportunity.&quot; </p> \n<p>The rest of the repertoire reflects an attempt to come up with communicative quality. The Be'er Sheva Theater staged the children's play &quot;Alei Kinor,&quot; adapted, 30 years ago, by Hanan Shnir and Ada Ben Nahum from a story by Sholem Aleichem, and the new production is generally considered to be an alternative to the commercial trap of children's theater in the center of the country. &quot;Between Us,&quot; by the American playwright Joe Hortua (translated and directed by Avishai Milstein), which had its Israeli premiere earlier this month, tells the story of the complicated marriages of two American couples with the help of two Israeli television stars, Nir Levy and Tamar Michael, and also features David Kigler, a Be'er Sheva native, who is married to his partner in the play, Edwa Adani. At the height of the drama, Levy and Michael are electrifying, but the tension fades for long stretches. Maybe that's why, in addition to the hearty laughter at the performance last Wednesday, one member of the audience was overheard to say, in a soft Russian accent, &quot;the revealing dress of the actress with the light hair [Michaeli] was the most interesting thing about the play.&quot; </p> \n<p>Three more intriguing projects are on tap in the current season. The first is a classic comedy, &quot;The Coffee House,&quot; by the 18th-century Italian dramatist Carlo Goldoni (author of &quot;Servant to Two Masters&quot; and &quot;The Venetian Twins&quot;), which will be directed by Ronny Sinai and feature a group of young actors from the Be'er Sheva Theater. A second project will be an adaptation by Yael Ronen of Emir Kusturica's film, &quot;Underground,&quot; in which a Bosnian soldier and a Serbian soldier meet in the midst of the fighting and get to know each other. Finally, Hagit Rehavi, who formerly managed the Orna Porat Theater for Children and Youth, and this year wrote and directed the play &quot;A Child of My Own,&quot; will direct a play next season about a group of Habimah actors who put on a play in Moscow. </p> \n<p>But Amitai, the outgoing director of the Be'er Sheva Theater (and now the director of a cultural center in Holon), notes that it is not going to be easy. He recalls the brutal image that he says will plague the Datner era, too: &quot;It always seemed that a play that arrived from the center of the country was better than any play the Be'er Sheva Theater could mount. That was a bit if a pose: The people who loved not to love the Be'er Sheva Theater were the same people who found the coffee in Tel Aviv tastier than the coffee in Be'er Sheva. One of Natan's challenges will be to fight the image of Be'er Sheva, to overcome the word Be'er Sheva.&quot; </p> \n<p>Amitai, who recommended Datner's appointment, believes that &quot;the name of the game today is marketing, period. That takes resources. Today it's easier to sell a play of Habimah or the Cameri Theater or Beit Lessin than to sell a play of the Be'er Sheva Theater. They are stronger theaters and they have a larger marketing budget. From my present position in the cultural center, when I see the tools I have at my disposal here, I understand how blocked I was in Be'er Sheva.&quot; </p> \n<p>Datner understands, too. According to the data of Yael Alter, the theater's administrative director, the Be'er Sheva Municipality is not supporting the theater as it is required to do - by donating NIS 1 for every NIS 1 of the state budget. Even though the Education Ministry allocated NIS 5.2 million for the theater this year, the municipality responded with only NIS 1.1 million. The Cameri Theater gets at least four times that amount from the Tel Aviv Municipality. </p> \n<p>&quot;When Limor Livnat took over as education minister the criteria changed,&quot; Rubik Danilovich, Be'er Sheva deputy mayor in charge of education, explains. &quot;The Be'er Sheva Municipality was forced to allocate 50 percent [of the theater's expenses], with the other 50 percent coming from the ministry, as opposed to 10 percent according to an earlier agreement. The total budget transferred by the municipality to the theater in 2004 is NIS 2.7 million. Following a change that was decided upon and agreed upon by the city council in recent weeks, the theater will become a non-institutional corporation so that it will be possible for it to receive a larger budget from the government: 85 percent with 15 percent local participation.&quot; </p> \n<p>Because of the meager external sources of revenue, the theater's self-generated income needs to fill the gap. According to Datner's figures, 70 percent of the theater's revenues are self-generated. </p> \n<p>&quot;This is where the trap starts,&quot; he says, taking a deep breath. &quot;The buyers - the people who buy plays for large audiences - want big names, because selling plays and raising funds is interconnected with big-name actors. And I have a serious problem holding onto well-known actors. In principle, such actors make very good salaries, because they bring money into the theater. For the most part they are free-lancers, getting a salary according to the number of plays they perform in. So they prefer Tel Aviv - the big theaters in the center offer those actors more plays up front. I can't provide that in Be'er Sheva.&quot; </p> \n<p>If famous actors can't get a good economic deal in Be'er Sheva, Datner will have to find other ways to tempt them - such as offering them roles they wouldn't get in metropolitan Tel Aviv. </p> \n<p>&quot;It's a jungle,&quot; Datner sighs. &quot;I have to fight lions like Noam Semel [director of the Cameri Theater], Yaakov Agmon [Habimah] and Tzippi Pines [Beit Lessin]. At the same time, I have to fight the buyers, because today the buyers are setting the tone in Israeli theater, and that is a major problem. They do what they want, or what the subscribers want, and the subscribers are usually a pampered audience. In a situation like this you must not fail and you must not be daring - you always have to come up with something that the buyer likes. That's the first thing I hear in meetings with them. The second question is who the actors in the play are, and if I don't bring them a top name, I'm in trouble right off the bat.&quot; </p> \n<p>He falls into a contemplative silence. He has two options: either to become a cheap imitation of the Tel Aviv-area theaters, or try to be something else. &quot;If things go on this way,&quot; he cautions, &quot;the way singers' performances at Caesarea have become slapdash, because the audience comes not to listen but to sing along with the artist, the same thing will happen to the Israeli theater.&quot; </p> \n<p>The cat in the mask </p> \n<p> Datner - who is married to Smadar, an industrial and management engineer, and is the father of Sharon, 16, and Yuval, 8 - was born and raised in Ramat Gan. He spent his childhood with a knitted skullcap on his head (an identifying mark of the national-religious public) and a violin in his hand, in the image of his parents, Tzipora and Yosef, both Holocaust survivors. His mother, who was imprisoned in Auschwitz, decided that her son would receive a religious education, even though Datner's older sister was sent to a secular kindergarten. </p> \n<p>Datner: &quot;Mother was very religious, Father was not. There are two genres among Holocaust survivors: those who said there is no God because there was a Holocaust - that was my father - and those who said there is God because you were spared, which was my mother.&quot; </p> \n<p>In the religious kindergarten Datner was Mordechai the Jew at Purim and Bar Kochba at Hanukkah. He acted out the whole Bible. He was one of those children who the theater simply chooses, in whose blood the theater flows without control. In high school he dispensed with the skullcap and devoted himself to parties in Givatayim. Like American high-school parties in the 1970s, rock groups got the whole school dancing in the gym. Datner still has a place in his heart for those special rock `n roll moments. </p> \n<p>Before army service, he and some friends set up a Nahal paramilitary garin (&quot;core group&quot;) that was supposed to settle in one of the kibbutzim in the southern Arava or in the Jordan Valley. Datner was the group's coordinator, and all their meetings took place in the bomb-shelter of his apartment building. However, when he was accepted to a military entertainment troupe, the ardent ideology vanished quickly. The others in the group made his life miserable, accusing him of deserting them for frivolous ends. In the end his father put a stop to the conflict. </p> \n<p>Datner: &quot;I decided to leave the core group and go to an army troupe after my father intervened. He pushed me like crazy, telling me nonstop to do an audition. It was amazing. He was my driving force - that was his life's dream and that's why he was so insistent. I fulfilled what he dreamed for himself.&quot; </p> \n<p>The period between 1967 (the Six-Day War) and 1973 (the Yom Kippur War) was a time of glory for the army entertainment troupes. Datner was inducted in 1974. &quot;No one knew about us and no one heard of us, the media were no longer interested,&quot; he recalls. &quot;When I left the troupe I knew I was totally anonymous.&quot; The decision to go for &quot;Shmil the Cat,&quot; the children's television program, was not all that obvious. &quot;I was afraid people wouldn't know who I was, because I had to wear a mask. We talked it over at home, but Dad said not to worry, people would know me, and he said going into television was the best way to meet people in the profession. The truth is that he pushed me again at the right moment.&quot; </p> \n<p>The cat launched Datner's career. The Be'er Sheva Theater, which was founded a decade earlier, in 1973, was looking for an actor-singer for one play, and Datner got the part. In the office where Datner is now sitting was Gary Bilu, and he promised to make an actor out of Datner. And so he did, according to that old article in Haaretz. </p> \n<p>The 1980s were a unique experience for actors in Israel. The theaters operated on the basis of ensemble groups, and in Be'er Sheva the actors lived in a full-fledged commune. </p> \n<p>&quot;Life was a mixed bag,&quot; Datner says. &quot;We lived a community life, in the city, and created our own thing. We were 15 young people, including Gadi Rol, Rivka Neuman, Doron Tavori and Hannah Roth. After the play we went for drinks at each other's places and we kept up the ensemble atmosphere. There were loves and hates. I remember being in the theater all the time, even in the morning, when I didn't have rehearsals, I would be here - it was my home. If I didn't have a performance in the evening I watched the plays of others. I lived the theater 24 hours a day. Those three years were my formative period.&quot; </p> \n<p>The continuation of his career, now past the &quot;hopeful&quot; phase, was as a freelance actor. He worked everywhere - at Beit Lessin, the Jerusalem Khan (in an adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer's &quot;Gimpel the Fool&quot;) and at Habimah, where he appeared with the actress Yona Elian. In 1987 he hit the big time when he, along with Avi Kushnir, represented Israel at the Eurovision song contest. The two called themselves Habatlanim (&quot;The Bums&quot;) and wore dark suits and dark glasses, &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; style. They didn't take Europe by storm (they finished in eighth place), but in Israel they were a huge hit. &quot;I met Kushnir at the Be'er Sheva Theater when we performed together in `The Taming of the Shrew,'&quot; he recalls fondly, adding that he considers that production one of the high points at the Be'er Sheva Theater. &quot;We represented the theater in Europe. When people asked us what we did, we always said we were actors from the Be'er Sheva Theater.&quot; </p> \n<p>Datner went on to the Cameri Theater (&quot;A Comedy of Errors&quot;) and then returned to Beit Lessin where, under the tutelage of Pines, he did the bulk of his theater work, appearing in major productions such as &quot;The Odd Couple,&quot; &quot;Desire,&quot; &quot;Ismailiya&quot; and &quot;Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks,&quot; which is still running. </p> \n<p>To help make ends meet, he still relies, as his father suggested, on television, where he can be seen frequently both in one-time dramas (&quot;Sherman in Winter,&quot; &quot;Silence of the Birds&quot;) and in series. The latter have undoubtedly done more than anything else to influence his public image. For many viewers Natan Datner is not the director of a theater, but the father of the adoptive family in the series &quot;Family and a Half.&quot; Yet above all he is Amnon Dvir, the father of Yehuda Levy (and the lover of Dafna Rechter) in the telenovela &quot;Love Around the Corner.&quot; That's the bit of moonlighting that Datner has stuck with, devoting one day a week to it when new episodes are shot. </p> \n<p>Things are happening </p> \n<p> Some people ask: If the director of the Be'er Sheva Theater lives in the Zahala neighborhood of Tel Aviv (&quot;We are not moving to Be'er Sheva because of the children&quot;) and if the actors come to the performances from their homes in Tel Aviv and if the rehearsals take place in Tel Aviv and if at the end of the performance the actors return to Tel Aviv - why not just bring in plays from the Cameri or Habimah? For many people, including residents of Be'er Sheva and the area, the reason for the local theater's right of existence is not entirely obvious. </p> \n<p>How can it be made clear to them that the mandate given to the city theater is important? Start a day camp. </p> \n<p>Last summer, Datner organized a day camp, during which 300 children showed up at the theater every morning and gladdened the director's heart. They made masks and built props, they sewed costumes and rehearsed. Their parents were utterly thrilled. After the day camp, drama groups were started. &quot;I now have 170 kids and 70 adults in the theater group,&quot; Datner exults. </p> \n<p>The next project along these lines is the establishment of the first acting school in Be'er Sheva. The municipality has given the go-ahead and Datner is working tirelessly to turn the dream into reality. The first class is expected to open at the end of 2005 or the beginning of 2006. </p> \n<p>&quot;There is no reason why a city like Be'er Sheva, the metropolis of the south, shouldn't have an acting school,&quot; he says. &quot;Why should youngsters who want to learn acting have to go to Tel Aviv? Here they will have a school that will gather them together and integrate them into productions of the theater.&quot; </p> \n<p>Now comes the turn of the Be'er Sheva Municipality. Holon is a prime example of a city that is becoming more attractive from one month to the next thanks to the burgeoning arts scene there. Datner discovered, for example, that the construction of the new home of the Be'er Sheva Theater, in the city center, wasn't yet completed. &quot;People say that the only workers who show up at the site are the ones who change the sign that announces the postponement of the opening, from summer 2004 to summer 2005, and maybe to summer 2006.&quot; </p> \n<p>Toward the end of the interview, night descends swiftly, the sky is in a meltdown from red to black. Datner will make it to the train station right on time. </p> \n<p>&quot;I am going home with the feeling that it's happening,&quot; he says, tired but manifestly happy. &quot;I remember my friends, who asked me why I needed this craziness, why I had to take on all the difficulties of management. They wanted me to be stuck with acting only. On the train, after a long day of work, I feel that things are happening, that my apprehensions are fading away. When I leave Be'er Sheva, knowing that at 8:30 P.M. exactly the audience will enter the theater hall, the feeling is that it really is succeeding.&quot; n</p>",

Gen. Peter E. Gersten, deputy commander for operations and intelligence for the anti-ISIS Operation Inherent Resolve, described an operation in Mosul targeting an ISIS finance operation.</p> \n<p>Gertsten said that&nbsp;in order to avoid killing women and children in the same building, the U.S.&nbsp;&quot;went as far as actually to put a Hellfire on top of the building and air-burst it so it wouldn't destroy the building, simply knock on the roof to ensure that she and the children were out of the building,&quot; he recounted. &quot;And then we proceeded with our operations.&quot; One woman did indeed flee the building after the 'knock', but ran back after the attack order was given and eventually died of her wounds as a result.</p> \n<p>Gersten acknowledged the Israeli military's influence, saying, &quot;that's exactly where we took the tactics and technique and procedure from.&quot; However, he did not say whether the Israel Defense Forces&nbsp;briefed the U.S.&nbsp;on the roof-knocking operations.</p> \n<p>The IDF frequently employed the&nbsp;method during the past few Gaza wars. The procedure was first exposed in 2009 and has since become common practice during operations in Gaza, the most recent of which in 2014's Operation Protective Edge. The method also involves calling the house about to be attacked to inform civilians inside in advance.</p> \n<p>After the 2014 summer conflict, a group of U.S. military experts from the Pentagon arrived in Israel to learn about the operation and the IDF's attempts to minimize civilian casualties. The procedure has been put on hold in the past after Palestinians began congregating on rooftops to prevent attacks on buildings.</p> \n<p>A UN Human Rights Council commission of inquiry's report on 2014's Operation Protective Edge concluded that while the method &quot;may have been effective&quot; in minimizing civilian casualties in specific instances, &quot;'roof-knocks' cannot be considered an effective warning given the confusion they often cause to building residents and the short time allowed to evacuate before the actual strike.&quot;</p> \n<p>The method has also faced criticism from human rights groups, who have voiced doubts at its efficacy. The Israeli group B'Tzelem also said that the warnings provided by the IDF were insufficient, and claimed that its investigation revealed that 70 percent of those killed in aerial attacks during Operation Protective Edge were civilians. A report by human rights group Amnesty International said a number of Palestinians who fled their house after receiving warning by the IDF were still killed in the attacks in Gaza and cited instances in which no prior warning was given.</p>",

Primary school children ran crying from the clouds of tear gas while tourists caught by surprise scurried to get back to luxury hotels lining the square.</p> \n<p>The unrest reflects growing disquiet at the authoritarianism of Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP).</p> \n<p>Riot police clashed with tens of thousands of May Day protesters in Istanbul this month. There have also been protests against the government's stance on the conflict in neighboring Syria, a tightening of restrictions on alcohol sales and warnings against public displays of affection.</p> \n<p>&quot;We do not have a government, we have Tayyip Erdogan ...Even AK Party supporters are saying they have lost their mind, they are not listening to us,&quot; said Koray Caliskan, a political scientist at Bosphorus University who attended the protest.</p> \n<p>&quot;This is the beginning of a summer of discontent.&quot;</p> \n<p>The protest at Taksim's Gezi Park started late on Monday after trees were torn up under a government redevelopment plan but has widened into a broader demonstration against Erdogan's administration. Friday's violence erupted after a dawn police raid on demonstrators who had been camped out for days.</p> \n<p>&quot;This isn't just about trees anymore, it's about all of the pressure we're under from this government. We're fed up, we don't like the direction the country is headed in,&quot; said 18-year-old student Mert Burge, who came to support the protesters after reading on Twitter about the police use of tear gas.</p> \n<p>&quot;We will stay here tonight and sleep on the street if we have to,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>Thousands chanting for the government to resign gathered at a park in the center of Ankara, where police earlier fired tear gas to disperse several dozen opposition supporters trying to reach the AKP headquarters. Protesters also rallied at two locations in Izmir, according to pictures on social media.</p> \n<p>A Turkish woman of Palestinian origin was in a critical condition after being hit by a police gas canister, hospital sources said. The 34-year-old, who doctors had earlier identified as Egyptian, was undergoing an operation after suffering a brain haemorrhage.</p> \n<p>A total of 12 people, including a pro-Kurdish MP and a Reuters photographer, suffered trauma injuries and hundreds suffered respiratory problems due to tear gas, doctors said.</p> \n<p>Some people were injured when a wall they were climbing collapsed as they tried to flee clouds of tear gas.</p> \n<p>Amnesty International said it was concerned by &quot;the use of excessive force&quot; by the police against what had started out as a peaceful protest. Ria Oomen-Ruijten, the European parliament rapporteur on Turkey, also voiced concern.</p> \n<p>Interior Minister Muammer Guler promised that claims that police had used disproportionate force would be investigated.</p> \n<p>Erdogan has overseen a transformation in Turkey during his decade in power, turning its economy from crisis-prone into Europe's fastest-growing. Per capita income has tripled in nominal terms since his party rose to power.</p> \n<p>He remains by far Turkey's most popular politician, and is widely viewed as its most powerful leader since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk founded the modern secular republic on the ashes of the Ottoman Empire 90 years ago.</p> \n<p>But Erdogan brooks little dissent. Hundreds of military officers have been jailed for plotting a coup against him in recent years. Academics, journalists, politicians and others face trial on similar charges.</p> \n<p>He has made no secret of his ambition to run for the presidency in elections next year when his term as prime minister ends, increasing opposition dismay.</p> \n<p>&quot;These people will not bow down to you&quot; read one banner at the Gezi Park protest, alongside a cartoon of Erdogan wearing an Ottoman emperor's turban.</p> \n<p>Postings on social media including Twitter, where &quot;Occupy Gezi&quot; - a reference to protests in New York and London last year - was a top-trending hashtag, and Facebook said similar demonstrations were planned for the next few days in other Turkish cities including Ankara, Izmir, Adana and Bursa.</p> \n<p>&quot;Kiss protests&quot;, in which demonstrators are urged to lock lips, had already been planned for Istanbul and Ankara this weekend after subway officials were reported to have admonished a couple for kissing in public a week ago.</p> \n<p>Erdogan is pushing ahead with a slew of multi-billion-dollar projects which he sees as embodying Turkey's emergence as a major power. They include a shipping canal, a giant mosque and a third Istanbul airport billed to be one of the world's biggest.</p> \n<p>Speaking a few miles from Gezi Park at the launch on Wednesday of construction of a third bridge linking Istanbul's European and Asian shores, Erdogan vowed to pursue plans to redevelop Taksim Square.</p> \n<p>Architects, leftist parties, academics, city planners and others have long opposed the plans, saying they lacked consultation with civic groups and would remove one of central Istanbul's few green spaces.</p>",

She said she felt targeted because the sign didn't appear anywhere else in her Havertown neighborhood, where she's lived for almost 20 years.</p> \n<p>&quot;It's not like someone wrote some obscenity on my trash can or gave me the finger,&quot; she said in a telephone interview Thursday. &quot;The swastika is such a deep-rooted sign of hatred for everyone, especially Judaism, that I felt so targeted.&quot;</p> \n<p>She spoke to her husband and called police, who have begun an investigation.</p> \n<p>She called a friend for advice and he told her: &quot;The only way to triumph hate is with love.&quot; Hearing that, Cohen-Eskin, an artist, decided to paint over the swastika with flowers, and to stick letters in mailboxes asking her neighbors to paint their trash bins as well, turning symbols of hate into symbols of love.</p> \n<p>&quot;We decided that painting something over this ... it kind of made the swastika completely meaningless,&quot; Cohen-Eskin said.</p> \n<p>In this tight-knit community of different religions and creeds, the searing symbol of hate made Cohen-Eskin's letter electrifying.</p> \n<p>&quot;I still get goosebumps,&quot; said Megan Connell, one of Cohen-Eskin's neighbors. &quot;I had to explain to my three-year-old that someone could do something so ugly, and we took it as a family thing.&quot;</p> \n<p>A local bar, Connell's mailman, and others spread word across town, and people online started passing around Cohen-Eskin's story. After she sent the letters, she went out for an art show — and came back to hundreds of messages and phone calls from people as far afield as Canada, Germany, and Ireland. Many sent pictures of trash cans they painted in a show of support.</p> \n<p>A tough part of Cohen-Eskin's request was that neighbors first paint a swastika, and then cover it with images of love and peace. Connell said that part of the task was &quot;very, very difficult.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;It's something you would never want to put ever, and not anything I ever thought I would be painting on anything,&quot; she said.</p> \n<p>Connell decorated her bin with an owl to send the message that the neighborhood is watching, even at night. Other neighbors painted the word &quot;unity&quot; on their bins up and down the block.</p> \n<p>&quot;I was so sad and I just wanted to do anything I could do to help,&quot; said Jenny Farley, recalling how Cohen-Eskin and her husband brought banana bread to greet her when Farley moved next door eight years ago. &quot;I think everyone came together and said, 'How can we support them?'&quot;</p> \n<p>Now, Cohen-Eskin wakes up every morning to new pictures of beautifully painted bins from all over the world.</p> \n<p>&quot;It gave me a whole new reassurance in humanity,&quot; she said. &quot;I feel invigorated by all the love. It's exciting ... it makes you feel there's so much good out there.&quot;</p>",

The Nazi ruler, Netanyahu said, had no intention of killing the Jews, but only to expel them.</p> \n<p>In a speech before the World Zionist Congress in Jerusalem, Netanyahu described a meeting between Husseini and Hitler in November, 1941: &quot;Hitler didn't want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to expel the Jew. And Haj Amin al-Husseini went to Hitler and said, 'If you expel them, they'll all come here (to Palestine).' According to Netanyahu, Hitler then asked: &quot;What should I do with them?&quot; and the mufti replied: &quot;Burn them.&quot;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu's remarks were quick to spark a social media storm, though Netanyahu made a similar claim during a Knesset speech in 2012, where he described the Husseini as &quot;one of the leading architects&quot; of the final solution.</p> \n<p>The claim that Husseini was the one to initiate the extermination of European Jewry had been suggested by a number of historians at the fringes of Holocaust research, but was rejected by most accepted scholars.</p> \n<p>The argument concerning Husseini's role was recently mentioned in a book by Barry Rubin and Wolfgang G.

Such is the conclusion of a three-year study published this week in Tel Aviv: Journal of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University.</p> \n<p>The researchers drilled deep under the Kinneret, retrieving 18-meter strips of sediment from the bottom of the lake. From the sediment they extracted fossil pollen grains. &quot;Pollen is the most enduring organic material in nature,&quot; says palynologist Dafna Langgut, who did the sampling work.</p> \n<p>According to Langgut, &quot;Pollen was driven to the Kinneret by wind and streams, deposited in the lake and embedded in the underwater sediment. New sediment was added annually, creating anaerobic conditions that help preserve pollen particles. These particles tell us about the vegetation that grew near the lake and testify to the climatic conditions in the region.&quot;</p> \n<p>Radiocarbon dating of the pollen revealed a period of severe droughts between c. 1250 and 1100 B.C.E. A sediment strip from the Dead Sea's western shore provided similar results.</p> \n<p>Langgut published the study with Prof. Israel Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University, Prof. Thomas Litt of the University of Bonn and Prof. Mordechai Stein of Hebrew University's Earth Sciences Institute.</p> \n<p>&quot;The advantage of our study, compared to pollen investigations at other locations in the Middle East, is our unprecedented frequency of sampling - for about every 40 years,&quot; says Finkelstein.</p> \n<p>&quot;Pollen is usually sampled for every several hundreds of years; this is logical when you're interested in prehistoric matters. Since we were interested in historical periods, we had to sample the pollen more frequently; otherwise a crisis such as the one at the end of the Bronze Age would have escaped our attention.&quot; That crisis lasted 150 years.</p> \n<p>The research shows a chronological correlation between the pollen results and other records of climate crisis. At the end of the Bronze Age – c. 1250-1100 B.C.E. - many eastern Mediterranean cities were destroyed by fire. Meanwhile, ancient Near Eastern documents testify to severe droughts and famine in the same period – from the Hittite capital in Anatolia in the north to Ugarit on the Syrian coast, Afek in Israel and Egypt in the south.</p> \n<p>The scientists used a model proposed by Prof. Ronnie Ellenblum of Hebrew University, who studied documents that describe similar conditions of severe drought and famine in the 10th and 11th centuries C.E.</p> \n<p>He showed that in areas such as modern Turkey and northern Iran, a reduction in precipitation was accompanied by devastating cold spells that destroyed crops.</p> \n<p>Langgut, Finkelstein and Litt say a similar process occurred at the end of the Bronze Age; severe cold spells destroyed crops in the north of the ancient Near East and a reduction in precipitation damaged agricultural output in the eastern steppe parts of the region. This led to droughts and famine and motivated &quot;large groups of people to start moving to the south in search of food,&quot; says Egyptologist Shirly Ben-Dor Evian of Tel Aviv University.</p>",

An ambulance with escort was seen leaving the Vimercate police station, but it wasn't immediately clear if the gunman was inside.</p> \n<p> Prosecutor Edmondo Bruti Liberati said the gunman first fired on his lawyer and co-defendant, killing both and seriously injuring a second co-defendant.</p> \n<p> Afterwards, he &quot;walked through the building, going down a floor, and killed the judge,&quot; Bruti Liberati told The Associated Press.</p> \n<p> He said it wasn't clear whether there was any relationship between the gunman and the judge.</p> \n<p> He identified the slain judge as Fernando Ciampi, who worked in the civil section of bankruptcy court. The ANSA news agency identified the gunman as Claudio Giardiello.</p> \n<p> Bruti Liberati said the gunman was on trial with two others for fraudulent bankruptcy.</p> \n<p> Giardiello's former attorney, Valerio Maraniello, told RAI state TV the case concerned a failed real estate business and that Giardiello was &quot;very unusual&quot; and &quot;over the top&quot; in his legal dealings.</p> \n<p> The shooting immediately raised questions about how the man gained entrance to the Fascist-era courthouse with a weapon, given that visitors must pass through metal detectors.</p> \n<p> The courthouse has metal detectors at the four main entrances, but lawyers and courthouse employees with official IDs are regularly waved through without the additional security screen and accredited employees can drive into the internal garage.</p> \n<p> Attornies Mirko and Davide Pupo noted that the metal detector from the lawyers' entrance had been removed several months ago.</p> \n<p> Employees who emerged after the shooting suggested that the gunman could easily have gained entrance without passing through the metal detector by entering with his lawyer, though other attorneys said their clients routinely are told to go in via the public entrance.</p> \n<p> The deputy interior minister, Filippo Bubbico, said an investigation would determine who was to blame for any security lapse, given also that the gunman wasn't stopped as he moved from one floor to the next to continue the spree, and then was able to flee unimpeded.</p> \n<p> &quot;There's no doubt that this episode signals a non-functioning of the protection mechanisms, which must be employed daily and which have worked for years at the Milan tribunal,&quot; he told Sky TG24.</p> \n<p> Security concerns are particularly high in Milan given the May 1 opening of the Expo world's fair. In fact, the interior minister, Alfano, was in Milan on Thursday to preside over a public security coordination meeting for Expo when the shooting erupted.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Cue in music, something between the &quot;Jaws&quot; theme with &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot; Now jump into the water, close your eyes and pretend it's 200 million years ago and that isn't a guppy zeroing in on your feet. It's a sharp-toothed pliosaur the size of a bus and he can smell you a long way off, judging by cutting-edge scanning technology and the physiology of crocodiles.</p> \n<p>Finding fossils remains as difficult as ever, but the latest imaging technology is enabling scientists to peer into the ancient bones, which has resulted in many a surprise. One is that pliosaur snouts contain intricate nerve systems akin to that of latter-day crocs and believe you me, the crocodilian have a very keen sense of smell. They also see unnervingly well.</p> \n<p>The secrets of smell among the extinct pliosaur set were discovered by University of Bristol researcher Davide Foffa of the Earth Sciences department, who painstakingly collated 2,000 individual scans of a fossilized pliosaur skull that was &quot;exceptionally well preserved,&quot; as he wrote, that had been found some five years ago in Dorset.</p> \n<p>The pliosaur was the dominant marine reptile of the Upper Jurassic era 200 million years ago, insofar as paleontologists know to date. Meaning, one could always find some unknown beast even bigger and badder, but none have to date.</p> \n<p>Though up to 12 meters in length, pliosaurs are believed to have dined mainly on fish, rather than say each other.</p> \n<p>Little had been known of their biology or physiology until Foffa and his computer tomography machine came along.</p> \n<p>&quot;Looking at the CT scans, we found that there were some branches and unusual channels that we had never noticed before. We thought it was a good idea to follow them and trace them digitally,&quot; says Foffa. &quot;At the end we discovered this extensive neurovascular web of channels.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;The structures suggest that this could be a sensory system, perhaps similar to crocodile pressure receptors or shark electroreceptors,&quot; he wrote in his paper, &quot;Complex rostral neurovascular system in a giant pliosaur.&quot;</p> \n<p>Foffa thinks they may have supplied blood and nerve connections to skin and soft tissue in the pliosasur snout. This would have helped pliosaurs hunt prey and manipulate food in the water, like a modern-day crocodile.In the argot, the bone channels probably housed the maxillary artery and trigeminal nerve, which carried signals to and from the upper jaw and snout.&quot;We found that this kind of system we found in the snout could be linked to prey detection, in a way similar as crocodiles do. In crocodiles the trigeminal nerve goes to some receptor in the snout, which help them in detecting movement of prey,&quot; Foffa says.</p> \n<p>Palaeontologists have long suspected pliosaur skulls contained small holes called foramina that lead to internal channels, but this is the first concrete evidence of it.</p> \n<p>The particular pliosaur on which the discovery was made was around eight meters in length, with a large, elongated crocodile-like head, a rather short neck, and a plump whale-like body. Four powerful flippers helped propel the beast through water while its large jaws, containing teeth the size of cucumbers, seized and crushed prey.</p> \n<p>It's believed the larger pliosaurs could have swallowed a cow in a single bite, not that there were cows 200 million years ago.</p> \n<p>Pliosauroids survived the Cretaceous and Jurassic eras. Its name simply means &quot;more saurian,&quot; being a derivation from the Greek words for &quot;more&quot; and &quot;lizard.&quot; It's quite apt that its snout paraphernalia are reminiscent of that of crocodiles: the man who coined their name in 1841, Richard Owen, thought they were a missing link between dinosaurs and crocs. They aren't.</p> \n<p> </p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel and the United States pulled out of the UN's World Conference Against Racism yesterday, after efforts to soften the anti-Israel language of the conference's draft summary statement failed.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Durban conference is a farce,&quot; Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told reporters in Jerusalem last night, terming the conference's activities an &quot;unbelievable attempt to smear Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;We regret very much the very bizarre show in Durban. An important convention that's supposed to defend human rights became a source of hatred,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>Peres blamed the Arab League in particular, saying it had led a concerted effort to single out Israel and blame it in unacceptable terms for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Arab League, all of it, has come out against peace,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>In contrast, he lauded the U.S. &quot;I want to thank the United States of America, which took an extremely courageous position in order to make the world look more responsible, more balanced, more truthful. I think the United States has saved the honor of our world, of our time,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>He thanked U.S. President George W. Bush and U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell for their &quot;unhesitating leadership,&quot; as well as the 43 countries that also &quot;saved the world's honor&quot; by taking &quot;a clear position against this unbelievable attack to smear Israel with false colors.&quot; These nations included Russia, the European Union, most of eastern Europe, most of Latin America, India, Japan, Singapore and some African states, he said.</p> \n<p>Powell, in a statement released in Durban, also denounced the draft declaration in uncompromising terms. He assailed the attempt to single out &quot;only one country in the world, Israel, for censure and abuse,&quot; and said that conferences could not combat racism by drafting declarations with &quot;hateful language&quot; that was a throwback to the days when the United Nations equated Zionism with racism.</p> \n<p>&quot;Today I have instructed our representatives at the World Conference Against Racism to return home. I have taken this decision with regret because of the importance of the international fight against racism and the contribution that this conference could have made to it,&quot; Powell's statement said. &quot;But following discussions today by our team in Durban and others who are working for a successful conference... I am convinced that it will not be possible.&quot;</p> \n<p>The draft text termed Israel's treatment of Palestinians &quot;a new apartheid&quot; and a &quot;crime against humanity,&quot; stated that the conference &quot;recognized with deep concern the increase of racist practices of Zionism&quot; and said that Zionism is based on racial superiority. Israel was the only country mentioned specifically in the document.</p> \n<p>The Israeli-American withdrawal followed days of intensive efforts, led primarily by Norway, to convince Arab and Muslim delegates to remove the anti-Israel statements from the draft resolution and replace them with a general statement calling on all parties in the Middle East to end the violence and return to negotiations and stressing the right of all peoples in the region to self-determination. Though Israel had initially objected to any reference to its conflict with the Palestinians in the document, it had agreed to this compromise.</p> \n<p>Yesterday, however, it became clear that the Norwegian effort had no chance of being accepted by the Muslim bloc. &quot;Today we reached the conclusion that the efforts [to remove the offending articles] had been exhausted, so we decided to leave,&quot; said Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Melchior, who was in charge of Israel's preparations for the conference.</p> \n<p>&quot;From the beginning, we debated over whether to attend the conference at all,&quot; he added. &quot;Our decision to participate stemmed from intensive pressure by friendly states, who wanted to try to remove the Arab proposals during the conference itself.&quot;</p> \n<p>Foreign Ministry sources said the Muslim bloc's rejectionism was spearheaded by Arab League Secretary-General and former Egyptian foreign minister Amr Moussa and current Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher. Though the U.S. did not publicly blame anyone, off the record, American government sources also said that Amr Moussa had been the main troublemaker.</p> \n<p>Shimon Samuels, of the Weisenthal Center in Los Angeles, who has been coordinating the lobbying effort by Jewish nongovernmental organizations at the conference, said he heard similar assessments from the black American leader Jesse Jackson, who had also attempted to mediate on the issue. &quot;The Egyptians returned to ground zero regarding the equation of Zionism with racism, the Syrians denied the existence of the Holocaust, and the Iranians objected to any mention of anti-Semitism in the conference resolutions, on the grounds that the conference is dealing with the problems of the present, and anti-Semitism is not a problem nowadays,&quot; Samuels said.</p> \n<p>But Palestinian UN representative Salman Herfi said the Arab delegations had been very reasonable; it was the U.S. delegation that refused to compromise. &quot;It's sad. It's sad they didn't leave room for dialogue, they didn't leave room for flexibility,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>Though Israel has not asked any other states to join the walk-out, Melchior said that Canada, Australia and New Zealand were considering doing so, and if they did, other Western countries might follow. Foreign Ministry sources said that some eastern European countries - Hungary, Romania, Latvia and the Czech Republic - were also considering leaving.</p> \n<p>But a British Foreign Office spokesman said the European Union had no plans to withdraw. &quot;This conference is an opportunity to address racism and xenophobia in the world. The problem of the Middle East should not have been imported into the conference,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>Other than in Israel, Jerusalem's withdrawal passed largely without comment. But the American withdrawal sparked criticism from several directions. South Africa, the conference host, termed the decision &quot;unfortunate and unnecessary,&quot; and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, secretary-general of the conference, said she regretted the U.S. decision. Human rights organizations at the conference also condemned the withdrawal, as did Jesse Jackson.</p> \n<p>But Tom Lantos, a Democratic U.S. congressman who was a member of the delegation, supported the decision. &quot;A conference that should have been about horrible discrimination around the world has been hijacked by extremist elements for its own purposes,&quot; Lantos said. &quot;The conference will stand self-condemned.&quot;</p> \n<p>Within Israel, there was some disagreement over Jerusalem's decision to withdraw. Opposition leader Yossi Sarid supported the decision, saying the conference had proven to be a premeditated political lynching of Israel, Zionism and Judaism. But former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the government for &quot;abandoning the arena&quot; and urged it to at least keep a public relations team in Durban. &quot;Imagine what would have happened if then Israeli ambassador to the UN Chaim Herzog had come home instead of tearing the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism to shreds?&quot; Netanyahu said.</p>",

Our prophets had a vision of peace, we greet each other with peace, our prayers end with the word peace. This evening we are in the center named for two leaders who were groundbreakers for peace -Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat - and we share their vision.</p> \n<p>Two and a half months ago, I was sworn in at the Knesset as the Prime Minister of Israel. I promised that I would establish a unity government, and did so. I believed, and still believe, that we need unity now more than ever before.</p> \n<p>We are currently facing three tremendous challenges: The Iranian threat, the financial crisis, and the promotion of peace.</p> \n<p>The Iranian threat still is before us in full force, as it became quite clear yesterday. The greatest danger to Israel, to the Middle East, and to all of humanity, is the encounter between extremist Islam and nuclear weapons. I discussed this with President Obama on my visit to Washington, and will be discussing it next week on my visit with European leaders. I have been working tirelessly for many years to form an international front against Iran arming itself with nuclear armaments.</p> \n<p>With the world financial crisis, we acted immediately to bring about stability to the Israeli economy. We passed a two-year budget in the government and will pass it through the Knesset very soon. The second challenge, rather, the third, so very important challenge, facing us today, is promoting peace. I discussed this also with President Obama. I strongly support the idea of regional peace that he is advancing. I share the President of the U.S.A's desire to bring about a new era of reconciliation in our region.</p> \n<p>I discussed this in my meetings with President Mubarak in Egypt and with King Abdullah in Jordan to obtain the assistance of these leaders in the effort to expand the circle of peace in our region.</p> \n<p>I appeal tonight to the leaders of the Arab countries and say: Let us meet. Let us talk about peace. Let us make peace. I am willing to meet at any time, at any place, in Damascus, in Riyadh, in Beirut, and in Jerusalem as well. (Applause)</p> \n<p>I call upon the leaders of the Arab countries to join together with the Palestinians and with us to promote economic peace. Economic peace is not a substitute for peace, but it is a very important component in achieving it. Together we can advance projects that can overcome the problems facing our region. For example, water desalinization. And we can utilize the advantages of our region, such as maximizing the use of solar energy, or utilizing its geographical advantages to lay pipelines, pipelines to Africa and Europe.</p> \n<p>Together we can realize the initiatives that I see in the Persian Gulf, which amaze the entire world, and also amaze me. I call upon the talented entrepreneurs of the Arab world, to come and invest here, to assist the Palestinians and us, to give the economy a jump-start. Together we can develop industrial zones, we can create thousands of jobs, and foster tourism that will draw millions, people who want to walk in the footsteps of history, in Nazareth and Bethlehem, in the heights of Jericho and on the walls of Jerusalem, on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, and at the baptismal site of the Jordan. There is a huge potential for the development of tourism potential here. If you only agree to work together.</p> \n<p>I appeal to you, our Palestinian neighbors, and to the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. Let us begin peace negotiations immediately without prior conditions. Israel is committed to international agreements, and expects all sides to fulfill their obligations. I say to the Palestinians: We want to live with you in peace, quiet, and good neighborly relations. We want our children and your children to 'know war no more.'</p> \n<p>We do not want parents and wives, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, to know the sorrow of bereavement. We want our children to dream of a better future for humankind. We want us and our neighbors to devote our efforts to 'plowshares and pruning hooks' and not to &quot;swords and spears&quot;? I know the terror of war, I participated in battles, I lost good friends who fell [in battle], I lost a brother. I saw the pain of bereaved families from up close - very many times. I do not want war. No one in Israel wants war. (Applause)</p> \n<p>Let us join hands and work together in peace, together with our neighbors. There is no limit to the flourishing growth that we can achieve for both peoples - in the economy, in agriculture, in commerce, tourism, education - but, above all, in the ability to give our younger generation hope to live in a place that's good to live in, a life of creative work, a peaceful life with much of interest, with opportunity and hope.</p> \n<p>Friends, with the advantages of peace so clear, so obvious, we must ask ourselves why is peace still so far from us, even though our hands are extended for peace? Why has the conflict going on for over 60 years? To bring an end to it, there must be a sincere, genuine answer to the question: what is the root of the conflict? In his speech at the Zionist Congress in Basel, in speaking of his grand vision of a Jewish homeland for the Jewish People, Theodor Herzl, the visionary of the State of Israel, said: This is so big, we must talk about it only in the simplest words possible.</p> \n<p>I now am asking that when we speak of the huge challenge of peace, we must use the simplest words possible, using person to person terms. Even with our eyes on the horizon, we must have our feet on the ground, firmly rooted in truth. The simple truth is that the root of the conflict has been - and remains - the refusal to recognize the right of the Jewish People to its own state in its historical homeland.</p> \n<p>In 1947 when the United Nations proposed the Partition Plan for a Jewish state and an Arab state, the entire Arab world rejected the proposal, while the Jewish community accepted it with great rejoicing and dancing. The Arabs refused any Jewish state whatsoever, with any borders whatsoever.</p> \n<p>Whoever thinks that the continued hostility to Israel is a result of our forces in Judea, Samaria and Gaza is confusing cause and effect. The attacks on us began in the 1920s, became an overall attack in 1948 when the state was declared, continued in the 1950s with the fedaayyin attacks, and reached their climax in 1967 on the eve of the Six-Day War, with the attempt to strangle Israel. All this happened nearly 50 years before a single Israeli soldier went into Judea and Samaria.</p> \n<p>To our joy, Egypt and Jordan left this circle of hostility. They signed peace agreements with us which ended their hostility to Israel. It brought about peace.</p> \n<p>To our deep regret, this is not happening with the Palestinians. The closer we get to a peace agreement with them, the more they are distancing themselves from peace. They raise new demands. They are not showing us that they want to end the conflict.</p> \n<p>A great many people are telling us that withdrawal is the key to peace with the Palestinians. But the fact is that all our withdrawals were met by huge waves of suicide bombers.</p> \n<p>We tried withdrawal by agreement, withdrawal without an agreement, we tried partial withdrawal and full withdrawal. In 2000, and once again last year, the government of Israel, based on good will, tried a nearly complete withdrawal, in exchange for the end of the conflict, and were twice refused.</p> \n<p>We withdrew from the Gaza Strip to the last centimeter, we uprooted dozens of settlements and turned thousands of Israelis out of their homes. In exchange, what we received were missiles raining down on our cities, our towns and our children. The argument that withdrawal would bring peace closer did not stand up to the test of reality.</p> \n<p>With Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north, they keep on saying that they want to 'liberate' Ashkelon in the south and Haifa and Tiberias. Even the moderates among the Palestinians are not ready to say the most simplest things: The State of Israel is the national homeland of the Jewish People and will remain so. (Applause)</p> \n<p>Friends, in order to achieve peace, we need courage and integrity on the part of the leaders of both sides. I am speaking today with courage and honesty. We need courage and sincerity not only on the Israeli side: we need the Palestinian leadership to rise and say, simply &quot;We have had enough of this conflict. We recognize the right of the Jewish People to a state its own in this Land. We will live side by side in true peace.&quot; I am looking forward to this moment.</p> \n<p>We want them to say the simplest things, to our people and to their people. This will then open the door to solving other problems, no matter how difficult. The fundamental condition for ending the conflict is the public, binding and sincere Palestinian recognition of Israel as the national homeland of the Jewish People. (Applause)</p> \n<p>For this to have practical meaning, we need a clear agreement to solve the Palestinian refugee problem outside of the borders of the State of Israel. For it is clear to all that the demand to settle the Palestinian refugees inside of Israel, contradicts the continued existence of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish People. We must solve the problem of the Arab refugees. And I believe that it is possible to solve it. Because we have proven that we ourselves solved a similar problem. Tiny Israel took in the hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from Arab countries who were uprooted from their homes.</p> \n<p>Therefore, justice and logic dictates that the problem of the Palestinian refugees must be solved outside the borders of the State of Israel. There is broad national agreement on this. (Applause)</p> \n<p>I believe that with good will and international investment of we can solve this humanitarian problem once and for all.</p> \n<p>Friends, up to now, I have been talking about the need for the Palestinians to ecognize our rights. Now I will talk about the need for us to recognize their rights.</p> \n<p>The connection of the Jewish People to the Land has been in existence for more than 3,500 years. Judea and Samaria, the places where our forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob walked, our forefathers David, Solomon, Isaiah and Jeremiah - this is not a foreign land, this is the Land of our Forefathers. (Applause)</p> \n<p>The right of the Jewish People to a state in the Land of Israel does not arise from the series of disasters that befell the Jewish People over 2,000 years - persecutions, expulsions, pogroms, blood libels, murders, which reached its climax in the Holocaust, an unprecedented tragedy in the history of nations. There are those who say that without the Holocaust the State would not have been established, but I say that if the State of Israel had been established in time, the Holocaust would not have taken place. (Applause) The tragedies that arose from the Jewish People's helplessness show very sharply that we need a protective state. The right to establish our sovereign state here, in the Land of Israel, arises from one simple fact: Eretz Israel is the birthplace of the Jewish People. (Applause)</p> \n<p>As the first PM David Ben Gurion in the declaration of the State, the State of Israel was established here in Eretz Israel, where the People of Israel created the Book of Books, and gave it to the world.</p> \n<p>But, friends, we must state the whole truth here. The truth is that in the area of our homeland, in the heart of our Jewish Homeland, now lives a large population of Palestinians. We do not want to rule over them. We do not want to run their lives. We do not want to force our flag and our culture on them. In my vision of peace, there are two free peoples living side by side in this small land, with good neighborly relations and mutual respect, each with its flag, anthem and government, with neither one threatening its neighbor's security and existence.</p> \n<p>These two facts - our link to the Land of Israel, and the Palestinian population who live here, have created deep disagreements within Israeli society. But the truth is that we have much more unity than disagreement.</p> \n<p>I came here tonight to talk about the agreement and security that are broad consensus within Israeli society. This is what guides our policy. This policy must take into account the international situation. We have to recognize international agreements but also principles important to the State of Israel. I spoke tonight about the first principle - recognition. Palestinians must truly recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people. The second principle is demilitarization. Any area in Palestinian hands has to be demilitarization, with solid security measures. Without this condition, there is a real fear that there will be an armed Palestinian state which will become a terrorist base against Israel, as happened in Gaza. We do not want missiles on Petah Tikva, or Grads on the Ben-Gurion international airport. We want peace. (Applause) And, to ensure peace we don't want them to bring in missiles or rockets or have an army, or control of airspace, or make treaties with countries like Iran, or Hezbollah. There is broad agreement on this in Israel. We cannot be expected to agree to a Palestinian state without ensuring that it is demilitarized. This is crucial to the existence of Israel - we must provide for our security needs.</p> \n<p>This is why we are now asking our friends in the international community, headed by the USA, for what is necessary for our security, that in any peace agreement, the Palestinian area must be demilitarized. No army, no control of air space. Real effective measures to prevent arms coming in, not what's going on now in Gaza. The Palestinians cannot make military treaties.</p> \n<p>Without this, sooner or later, we will have another Hamastan. We can't agree to this. Israel must govern its own fate and security. I told President Obama in Washington, if we get a guarantee of demilitarization, and if the Palestinians recognize Israel as the Jewish state, we are ready to agree to a real peace agreement, a demilitarized Palestinian state side by side with the Jewish state. (Applause)</p> \n<p>Whenever we discuss a permanent arrangement, Israel needs defensible borders with Jerusalem remaining the united capital of Israel. (Applause)</p> \n<p>The territorial issues will be discussed in a permanent agreement. Till then we have no intention to build new settlements or set aside land for new settlements. But there is a need to have people live normal lives and let mothers and fathers raise their children like everyone in the world. The settlers are not enemies of peace. They are our brothers and sisters. (Applause)</p> \n<p>Friends, unity among us is, to my view, vital, and unity will help with reconciliation with our neighbors. Reconciliation must begin now. A strong Palestinian government will strengthen peace. If they truly want peace, and educate their children for peace and stop incitement, we for our part will make every effort, allow them freedom of movement and accessibility, making their lives easier and this will help bring peace. But above all, they must decide: the Palestinians must decide between path of peace and path of Hamas. They must overcome Hamas. Israel will not sit down at conference table with terrorist who seek to destroy it. (Applause)</p> \n<p>Hamas are not willing to even let the Red Cross visit our abducted soldier Gilad Shalit who has been in captivity three years, cut off from his family and his country. We want to bring him back whole and well. With help of the international community, there is no reason why we can't have peace. With help of USA, we can do we can do the unbelievable. In 61 years, with constant threats to our existence we have achieved so much. Our microchips power the worlds computers unbelievable, we have found cures for incurable diseases. Israeli drip irrigation waters barren lands throughout the world. Israeli researchers are making worldwide breakthroughs. If our neighbors only work for peace, we can achieve peace. (Applause)</p> \n<p>I call upon Arab leaders and Palestinian leaders: Let's go in the path of Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat, Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein. Let's go in the path of Prophet Isaiah, who spoke thousands of years ago, they shall beat their swords into plowshares and know war no more. Let us know war no more. Let us know peace.</p> \n<p>Click here for Netanyahu's speech to the UN General Assembly on September 24, 2009</p>",

        "text":["<p>Fox News Transcript:</p> \n<p>MITT ROMNEY: Well, you know, the president has a very different foreign policy than that has been followed by our country over the last 50 or 60 years. His view instead of having a strong American military that's able to keep other nations in check, that we ought to instead put in place a policy based on what he calls common humanity.</p> \n<p>Well, humanity is not common in its views. What one people called evil and other people called good. The world relies upon and America must rely upon a strong military.</p> \n<p>And, by the way, China understands the importance of a navy. Its navy will be larger than ours within seven years. That's the consequence of the president's policies.</p> \n<p>WALLACE: In that same presidential debate, Mr. Obama also made fun of your views on Russia. Let's take a look at that.</p> \n<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> \n<p>OBAMA: Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al Qaeda is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia. Not al Qaeda. You said Russia. In the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War has been over for 20 years.</p> \n<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> \n<p>WALLACE: Governor, when you look at Ukraine and the decision not to keep U.S. troops in Iraq and the decision not to arm the rebels in Syria from the start, what do you make of the choices that this president has been making particularly here in the second term?</p> \n<p>ROMNEY: Well, I think the president is really out of touch with reality when it comes to what's happening in the world. And I don't know why that is. Perhaps it's political philosophy, it's foreign policy views.</p> \n<p>But, look, he looked at Russia and thought that was a friend we should reset relations with. He looked at al Qaeda and said they're on the run. Just more recently, he looked at ISIS and said, oh, they're just the junior varsity. He looks at Iraq and says, hey, they're strong and able to care for themselves.</p> \n<p>Look, he is so out of touch with reality that he hasn't taken the action necessary to prevent very bad things from happening.</p> \n<p>A strong America that stands up for its beliefs is an America able to defend itself and to defend our principles around the world. When America is seen and the president is seen as being weak, bad people do bad things. And you're seeing that all across the Middle East. You're seeing that was well in other parts of the world, including, of course, Afghanistan, Ukraine, it's a real tragedy.</p>",

        "text":["<p> Ignore the incitement against the Tel Avivians: The vast majority of them have supported the war from the moment it started and, like everywhere else, the support will end as soon as we hear the familiar question once again on television: &quot;Our military analyst, Roni Daniel - where did we botch things up?&quot;</p> \n<p> The Tel Avivians live here because of their love for the city but also because it's the place - a mere 10 minutes from Ben-Gurion Airport - from where it's possible to emigrate. Why? For example, a chance to live a normal life. We were always taught that Israel is the only place that is safe for Jews, but if it is unbearable that Jewish children should live under the threat of missiles, why shouldn't they live in a place where Jewish children are safe? In what way is the Gaza border area better than Toronto, or Tel Aviv better than Paris? In other words, what exactly are the politicians in the south doing when they acquiesce to our rulers, translate your suffering into war mongering and are scared to demand negotiations with your neighbors, who live in hell?</p> \n<p> Let's assume that the election is not the reason for the war and that the employment of the Iron Dome defense system does not have a mega-commercial dimension, and that your distress really does matter to the government, and that the cries from some areas in this country do indeed reach the government's ears and convince them to do something - to enlarge the health basket, let's say, or to widen dangerous roads (war is much more expensive).</p> \n<p> And let's assume that Hamas really wanted a war and begged the Islamic Jihad to shoot at an Israeli military jeep, even though it knew that only Israel is allowed to do so and not the Gazans. Now, do you think it's going to be quiet, or perhaps they are preparing the herd's bellowing: &quot;They didn't let the IDF win?&quot;</p> \n<p> And let's assume that the Palestinians' pound of flesh will be acceptable to the West just as it is to U.S. President Barack Obama, and let's assume that our radio and TV channels will continue 24 hours a day, in perfect North Korean, to create a cocktail of panic and encouragement, after all the cynicism that every political reporter has shown there about the motives of the politicians in general and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak in particular, until the war started and the motives became exalted: What do we have to prove? That we can be killed a little and kill a lot because we are stronger, and therefore we can breathe freely from now on?</p> \n<p> What is the optimism of the start of a war always built on, when people talk about &quot;after the war&quot;? That the Gaza Strip should join the Labor Party and begin chanting: &quot;The nation demands social justice only for Jews&quot;? Does anyone think Gaza will melt into the sea?</p> \n<p> But, yes, they do. Don't be mistaken about the ultimate source of defilement, such as Shas leader Eli Yishai. He is merely more uncouth than Netanyahu but this is the truth about which those who dance on the blood, and build political and military careers, fantasize about, this pointless end - that Gaza should sink into the sea. That it should rot and that its lot should be more illness and hunger; and lack of electricity, sewerage and sanitation, and vaccines, and the ability to study abroad, and visits from relatives and vacations, and a health system. And that its infrastructures should continue to be destroyed, and that it should lose its social cohesion, and that its middle class should emigrate and its civilian structure be dismantled, and that it should be replaced by tribalism and ignorance that will inflame the conflict even more, with abysmal apathy also toward the situation of the residents of the south of Israel.</p> \n<p> In this way, with different dosages of destruction, the ghetto-ization of Palestine is being carried out - that of the West Bank also - under the cover of the legal alibi of &quot;temporariness&quot; and the propaganda of &quot;no partner&quot; - until they expire as a freedom-seeking nation and return to being a Zionist myth, &quot;What they were before we returned to our land - foreign nomads&quot;.</p> \n<p> The pretentious fringes of the left can indulge themselves in the debate over &quot;either one state or apartheid,&quot; but meanwhile the destruction is being done by the government and the IDF.</p> \n<p> And a word to the credit of Tel Aviv: Indeed there are several hundred people there whom wars bring out onto the streets to demonstrate. But have no fears: They too will get used to them. For decades, people who were irritated by wars passed through this left, but after two or three wars even they rejoice when they hear: &quot;Hi, this is Shelly.&quot; And even though this intonation is less nerve wracking than a siren, it is extremely annoying because the self-righteous demagoguery reminds us that Golda Meir has not died.</p>",

        "text":["<p>BRUSSELS - Let me start with two Belgian stories - unfortunately, not funny ones. </p> \n<p>The first concerns Andre Flahaut, the Socialist defense minister of this country from 1999 to 2007. This past May, the man, who is not known to be a political genius, participated in a kind of anti-Israel street theater in the city of Nivelles. The event, organized by a far-left NGO on the town's weekly outdoor market day, was a reenactment of the nakba, as the Palestinians call the renaissance of Jewish statehood in the Land of Israel. The participants, duly divided into Palestinian victims and the Israeli soldiers who brutally forced them into trucks on their way to exile, were outfitted in kaffiyehs and army uniforms, respectively, and they performed enthusiastically under the eyes of bewildered Sunday shoppers. </p> \n<p>Flahaut, who wasn't in costume, took the stage during the masquerade to deliver an emotional speech about justice and injustice, peace and war, the Socialist struggle for good against evil. In his comments, Flahaut made a direct link between Israel's occupation of the West Bank and his own ongoing fight against any form of &quot;Nazism.&quot; The umbrella body of Belgian Jewry (CCOJB) in return accused him of delegitimizing Israel and described his remarks as anti-Semitic. </p> \n<p>Flahaut took the unprecedented step of suing the CCOJB for slander (the case is still in court). And the reaction of the Belgian political class and media was unequivocal - silence, except for some criticism of the Jewish community for taking a position against free speech. The entire business had a farcical quality. </p> \n<p>The second event was less farcical, but perhaps more revealing. Last July, I interviewed Louis Michel for the Belgian Jewish monthly Contact J. Unlike Flahaut, Michel, a leader of the Liberal Party, is a highly regarded statesman, a former Belgian foreign minister and the current European commissioner for development and humanitarian aid. We talked about human rights in the Palestinian territories. Michel claimed that the Israeli government shows no understanding of the matter and tramples the basic rights of the Palestinians. After a long tirade against Israeli actions in the West Bank, he burst into a passionate plea against what he saw as an intolerable mixing up by many Jews between legitimate criticism of a government and an assault against the very existence and legitimacy of the people and state this government represents: &quot;I am a victim of this confusion, in the way I am accused of anti-Semitism each time I speak out against Israel's policies. I always was, I still am and I'll always be a genuine friend of Israel and of the Jewish community of my country, but I can no longer tolerate being insulted by members of the community.&quot; </p> \n<p>These two tales are typical of the gap of understanding that divides Belgian Jews, indeed European Jews in general, and the national communities they belong to. The Jews often feel lonely, even abandoned, when they hear Israel subjected to public criticism, and they react angrily. Most politicians and commentators in turn fail to perceive anything but paranoia in their response. Michel and Flahaut genuinely do not see themselves as anti-Semitic, and believe they are sincere friends of Israel and the Jewish people. The Jews, on the other hand, are shocked by their attitudes toward Israel, and tend to see them both as enemies, who conceal their hatred of Jews under the cloak of opposition to Israel's government. </p> \n<p>To be be clear: Whatever his intentions, Flahaut's comparison of Israel to Nazi Germany unequivocally falls under the general criteria of anti-Semitism, as defined in the working paper of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. Michel, on the other hand, is in more of a grey area, as he has never been associated with actions or comments delegitimizing Israel or the very right of the Jews to political autonomy. </p> \n<p>The Belgian political class does not understand the sensitivity of the Jewish community, which tends to see verbal attacks against &quot;their&quot; state as an avatar of the old threats, rooted in old prejudice, against their people. The Jews often do not grasp the difference between criticism of a sovereign state whose policies might be considered problematic - and sheer anti-Semitism. In this gap of perceptions lies the problem. </p> \n<p>This is not only a Belgian problem, not even a solely Jewish problem. In the whole of Europe, the strong national ethos has given way to an array of antagonistic communal feelings and demands. It feels as if the effort to create a set of values shared by all has vanished, only to be overcome by particular identities fighting each other for mutually exclusive recognition and respect. </p> \n<p>What is to be done? To be sure, putting an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be helpful. In the meantime, one should negotiate red lines compatible with a democratic way of life. </p> \n<p>We Jews need to be more prepared to accept criticism in line with what Israelis themselves direct toward their own regime. But by the same token, Europeans should be careful not to confuse Israel with the Jewish citizens of Europe. Nor should they confuse criticism with xenophobia, and must distinguish between rejection of the ephemeral policies of an elected Israeli government and an attempt to deny Jews the freedom to their own state. It is not okay to deny Jews the human rights to which every people is entitled; it is okay to debate achieving a solution that will restore and preserve the human rights of both Palestinians and Israelis. These should be the red lines of the public discourse. </p> \n<p>Claude Kandiyoti is a Brussels-based entrepreneur and the publisher of Contact J, a monthly of the Belgian Jewish community. </p>",

E-mail addresses are provided for each winery to help readers locate stores nearest them carrying these wines. </p> \n<p>After formal winemaking studies and acquiring experience in Italy, the United States, Israel and Australia, Ido Lewinsohn, along with his father Amnon, has opened his own artisanal winery. With the winery located literally in a residential garage in the Tel Aviv suburb of Hod Hasharon, Lewinsohn relies on purchased contract grapes, which at this stage include Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petite Sirah and Chardonnay from select vineyards throughout the country. First releases, from the 2007 vintage amounted to about 5,000 bottles, and from the 2008 and 2009 vintage about 7,000. Plans are to expand to about 10,000 bottles annually.

A distinct note of grapefruit on first attack, yielding to notes of lemon, melon, green apples and a tantalizing combination of chalky and flinty minerals, all with an appealing floral overlay. Full-bodied but not at all fat, with gentle notes of spicy wood; calls to mind a fine 1er cru Chablis, and like those wines will age nicely. Mouth-filling yet graceful and elegant. NIS 150.

        "text":["<p>NEW ORLEANS - A small heap of paper that survived the fiery disintegration of space shuttle Columbia, a 61-kilometer (38-mile) fall to Earth and two months of exposure to rain and sun in a Texas field has been painstakingly restored by forensic scientists, yielding the flight diary and notes of Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon. </p> \n<p>Scientists used computer image-enhancement technology and infrared light to read the charred and tattered pages and pieced some of them together like jigsaw puzzles. </p> \n<p>Not everything could be deciphered. But Sharon Brown, the Israeli police document examiner who pieced the material together, said she was amazed that the metal-ring cardboard-bound notebook had even survived. </p> \n<p>&quot;You know what a lit match could do to that pile of papers,&quot; she said this week at a convention in New Orleans of forensic scientists. </p> \n<p>She would not disclose any personal observations by the astronaut, one of the seven crewmen killed when the shuttle broke apart in February 2003. But the pages included a list of topics Ramon planned to talk about during broadcasts from space, and the carefully copied down text of the Sabbath kiddush, the blessing for wine. </p> \n<p>All together, 18 pages handwritten in Hebrew were recovered: Four sheets held Ramon's diary during the flight; six were technical classroom notes that had been made before launch; and eight were personal notes, also written before liftoff. </p> \n<p>On some pages, the writing was washed out. Some sheets were tattered and torn, pocked with tiny irregular holes as if debris had ripped through them. Pieces were twisted into tightly crumpled wads smaller than a fingernail. Some pages were stuck tightly together and had to be delicately pried apart. </p> \n<p>Brown said she had been asked if she was afraid she would destroy the shreds by opening them up. &quot;I said, 'You're right. But if I do nothing, we'll lose it all,&quot;' she recalled. </p> \n<p>Ramon was Israel?s country's first astronaut. An Indian tracker found the papers two months after the shuttle disaster. Ramon's widow, Rona, asked Israel police to find out what he had written. After 1 1/2 years, Brown still has two pages of writing she has not been able to decipher. </p> \n<p>On one section where the writing had been washed out by rain, neither infrared nor ultraviolet light was any help. Brown took the pages to a colleague who scanned them into a computer and processed them with photo-editing software, using techniques to enhance contrast and separate the writing from the background. </p> \n<p>The diary, written in black ink and pencil, covers only the first six days of the 16-day mission. &quot;We don't know whether he just stopped writing, or ran out of paper, or other pages were destroyed,&quot; Brown said. </p> \n<p>She said that because the notebook was the personal property of Ramon's widow, she tried to piece it together without actually reading it, as if it were a puzzle in a language she had never seen. </p> \n<p>&quot;But very soon, I realized that was exactly the opposite of what I had to do,&quot; Brown said. She said she could not piece it together without understanding it. </p>",

        "text":["<p> AP - The short propaganda film commissioned by Thailand's military rulers was supposed to promote the &quot;12 core values&quot; every Thai student must now learn. But there was one scene the junta has had trouble explaining: a grinning schoolboy painting an image of Adolf Hitler while his smiling classmate applauds.</p> \n<p> The video, which has been screened before movies in major theaters since Saturday, has been met with ridicule on social media and condemned by the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok.</p> \n<p> On Wednesday, a senior official in the prime minister's office, Panadda Diskul, called the uproar a &quot;misunderstanding,&quot; but said the Nazi imagery in the cartoon scene would soon be replaced.</p> \n<p> The 11-minute film tells the story of two young kids learning about life and loyalty, and Panadda told The Associated Press that the boy shown merrily painting an image of Hitler saluting beside a swastika was trying to compare his mother to a dictator, in essence a rebellious jest.</p> \n<p> In the video, however, there is no such explanation. It is part of a sequence without dialogue that depicts an otherwise normal day at school — the boys catching butterflies at a playground, doing experiments in a chemistry class and exercising on a karate mat. It lasts just a few seconds and runs with a cheery tune playing in the background.</p> \n<p> &quot;The film is good, but it has caused a slight misunderstanding in our society,&quot; Panadda said. &quot;We won't stop the project, but we will replace that problematic picture with another, more proper one.&quot;</p> \n<p> Israel's ambassador to Thailand, Simon Roded, issued a statement saying he was &quot;deeply saddened to see this trivialization and misuse of Nazi symbols in an official Thai movie.&quot;</p> \n<p> &quot;I was surprised that throughout the screening process this movie must have gone through to be approved for public broadcast, none of the smart, well educated people checking it had identified it as being problematic and offensive,&quot; Roded said. &quot;&quot;If we learn anything from this incident it is that Holocaust education, especially its global messages of tolerance, should be introduced into the Thai curriculum.&quot;</p> \n<p> The study of history in the Thai school system revolves primarily around the history of Thailand and its long line of kings. World history is glossed over, with little or no mention of the Holocaust.</p> \n<p> After overthrowing the Southeast Asian nation's elected government on May 22, coup leader-turned-Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha introduced the so-called 12 values as part of a junta campaign to return &quot;happiness&quot; to the people. The values reflect traditional concepts in Thai culture the military felt needed reinforcing; they range from upholding the monarchy to respecting parents and understanding &quot;true democratic ideals.&quot;</p> \n<p> Last year, Thailand's premier Chulalongkorn University apologized for displaying a billboard that showed Hitler alongside Superman and other superheroes, saying it was painted by ignorant students who didn't realize Hitler's image would offend anyone. The billboard was removed after two days.</p> \n<p> </p>",

        "text":["<p> Transcript from CNN:</p> \n<p> (Scroll down for the full clip from CNN)</p> \n<p> RABBI SHMULEY BOTEACH: Let's be honest. To separate the anti-Semitism growing in France and in many other European countries, because Jews don't feel comfortable in almost any place in Europe today, it cannot be separated from constant Islamic incitement. Now, I believe Islam is a great world religion. I think Rula [Jebreal] is portraying Islam the way it should be.</p> \n<p> Having said that, we're not hearing enough of the mainstream Muslims condemning the incitement against Jews. Not talking about Israel, we're not talking about political policy, foreign policy, we're talking about cartoons of Jews with giant noses in Arab-sponsored media. We're talking about Hamas with a genocidal charter -- a genocidal charter -- calling for the annihilation and the extermination of every Jew on planet Earth and people defending Hamas. And not saying that if you want to be seen with any kind of legitimacy you cannot have a charter calling for every Jew to be slaughtered.</p> \n<p> So, with all due respect, I would like to see my Muslin brothers and sisters, I want to see a million Muslim march, not just three half million French men and women marching. Muslims have to take their religion back from monsters. You can no longer say that it's a small minority inciting anti-Semitism against Jews, on the contrary, this is entering the body politic Because it's not being repudiated by the mainstream on a large scale.</p> \n<p> DON LEMON, CNN: I want to get Rula in because Fareed [Zakaria] just said the same thing, that Muslims have to take their religion back. What do you say?</p> \n<p> RULA JEBREAL: I think the religion has been hijacked by these extremists. But they are taking it back for the first time I have seen millions of people. Remember in that march in --</p> \n<p> LEMON: But what do you think about what he said? He said he wants to see millions of Muslims -- a million Muslim march.</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: I think that's a great idea. And I want to invite with that. Let's look also about the history of what's been happening. Iraq, Syria, Palestine, these were the most secular places in the Middle East. The most secular, until 2003. But then we see the rise of these extremists and they're connecting to certain policies. We need to separate extremists from regular ordinary Muslims. We can't also blame them for their own suffering, whether it's in Iraq, Syria or elsewhere because they are really on the frontline fighting this battle, whether it's in Iraq, in Syria, and in many other countries and even within Palestinian territories.</p> \n<p> &nbsp;</p> \n<p> But I want to tell the Rabbi, this is really something that we learned from Selma, as you mentioned, when you uphold the supremacy of one ethnic group, this is not a democracy anymore, this is an ethnocracy. We need to reject that whether it's in Europe, in Israel, or here in America. We can't have segregation as an answer. It's inclusion and unity.</p> \n<p> RABBI BOTEACH: With all due respect, Rula, you're excusing violence and that's very tragic. When you start bringing up that Israel's policy, it's terrible that [Palestinians] are being targeted, Israel has to stop the segregation. Let's stop the nonsense. Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. You are a Palestinian woman who has Israeli citizenship. You are allowed freedom of expression. No one tells you who to fall in love with, you don't get shot by your uncle or by your brother because you fall in love with somebody your father doesn't approve of. You live a Western life. You live with the kind of human rights that Israel protects. Israel has 1.5 million Arab citizens, there is no segregation and we all know that. So let's not excuse terrorism with some Israeli policy.</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: That's not fair, Rabbi. This is really unfair and I feel that you need to reflect on this, especially based on what I write and other stuff that I've done.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p> Transcript of Real Time with Bill Maher on HBO:</p> \n<p> BILL MAHER: Next issue, Berkeley. Normally, I would throw out an issue and let the panel then just interrupt me, which they always do before I finish the question. But all week long I've had all these request for interviews about this. Let me just get out my statement about it because people have been asking. I said I would save it for HBO because they pay me.</p> \n<p> So here's what happened. A couple of months ago I was asked to deliver a commencement speech for Berkeley's December graduation. I was like great. I love Berkeley, I'm off in December and it will be a sentimental journey. Who doesn't remember their graduation in December? But whatever, I'm happy to do it because although I never attended Berkeley, I was very aware of their place in the American debate. On the far left in a country where the Democratic party has sold out to the center and even the right, this is what is needed. This is why I wanted to accept this invitation and they invited me because it was the 50th anniversary of something that is legendary on that campus, The Berkeley Free Speech Movement. I guess they don't teach irony in college anymore.</p> \n<p> And then a few weeks ago, Ben Affleck was on our show and we had a discussion about Islam that I've had a thousand and one nights with a lot of other people, but he's an A-list movie star so our very deep media started to care about it. It's always easy to do a story about somebody being mad as somebody so when a few thousand people online who didn't have to do anything more than click a button, who didn't even go to Berkeley necessarily wanted me to be disinvited as the commencement speaker, because, you know, I'm a racist. Right, because Islam is a race.</p> \n<p> You know, this is the level of logic we are dealing with. By the way, even Reza Aslan, my most strident critics has gone to pains to say he doesn't think I'm a bigot. Here's what he said on HuffPost Live -- &quot;Bill Maher is not a bigot. I know him. We are friends. We hang out with each other backstage. He loves having me on the show despite the fact that he disagrees with me on a lot of things and that shows the kind of person that he is.&quot; If even my most respectable critic who is a Muslim says this, what leg does the &quot;protest&quot; have to stand on? He and I disagree on some stuff but he's always welcome on this show. That's how it's done, kids. Whoever told you you only had to hear what didn't upset you?</p> \n<p> So anyway, the university has come down on my side, saying what I hoped they would say all along, which is that we're liberals, we're supposed told like free speech. So I want to come. I'm planning to come. I'm planning a trip to the Redwoods the next day. My only reservation in not coming is the argument that it will be a media circus and turn which should be a day about the graduates, which it should be, you, into something else. I don't want to do that. It's the only reason I would ever pull out.</p> \n<p> But let me say this to those students worried about that: I promise this will be your day. This is a commencement speech. The issue is you. My speech was, is, I hope, going to be about you and whatever tips I thought that could actually help you in life because I already lived through it. That and my funk about how Jewish women hate to have sex. So here's my final plea to you liberal -- in the truest sense of the word -- college students. Not just as Berkeley but all over the country. Please, weigh in on this. My reputation isn't on the line. Yours is.</p> \n<p> Okay, so what do you think about this? There's my piece.</p> \n<p> RULA JEBREAL, GUEST: I don't think it's about free speech. I'm sorry to tell you this, Bill. And I'll tell you why, it's very simple. These same students who signed that petition actually invited you to a debate. And they said they are welcome so they can have a conversation, they can ask you a question. If they don't like your views on television, they can switch channels. But the commencement speech, it's a platform, actually, that doesn't give the opportunity for questions, it doesn't give an opportunity for push back, even for a debate. It's a monologue, it's not a dialogue. These same students feel offended that your views of Islam -- the generalization, and they said it clearly in their declaration, they said the generalization perpetrates bigotry. This is what they said.</p> \n<p> Look, I am all for freedom of speech. I love debates; I hate monologues. When you invite somebody to a commencement speech, you said it, it's about the students. And The New York Times, in this piece this morning said you can't counter a bad speech with a good speech except they don't have that venue. They don't have that opportunity on that day of graduation. They can't out of that.</p> \n<p> MAHER: I'm not coming to speak about that subject as I just said.</p> \n<p> SEN. ANGUS KING (I-MAINE): Does that mean we never have speeches? Every speech has to be two people?</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: But this is a commencement speech. This is a commencement address.</p> \n<p> KING: Every commencement speech has one speaker.</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: Listen, would you accept an openly anti-Semitic person to give a commencement speech to Jewish students? I actually would not accept that.</p> \n<p> MAHER: As I just said, even Reza Aslan says I'm not a bigot. So I rather resent the idea that I'm comparable to an anti-Semite. All I've ever done was basically read facts.</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: What facts did you read? I'm sorry, you are comparing jihadists, Salafists, Sunni, you don't know the difference. You are comparing all Muslims in one part --</p> \n<p> MAHER: You are Palestinian?</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: I am actually a secular Muslim. And when you talking about Islam in a certain way, I have to tell you, it's offensive sometimes.</p> \n<p> KING: But it's okay to be offensive. That's what free speech is all about. If free speech is only speech you like, it's not free speech.</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: No, but they invited him for a debate. He can go to that debate. I can accompany you on that debate if you want. I am happy to have that debate wherever you want.</p> \n<p> KING: He was invited to be a commencement speaker and then he made a statement that people didn't like.</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: I don't know what to say.</p> \n<p> MAHER: Can you be gay in Gaza?</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: Yes, you can.</p> \n<p> MAHER: Really?</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: Yes you can.</p> \n<p> MAHER: And live?</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: Absolutely, you can. You know what? It's even more offensive because you are saying --</p> \n<p> MAHER: I'm just asking because --</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: You can be gay in Gaza.</p> \n<p> MAHER: Really?</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: I've traveled the Middle East.</p> \n<p> MAHER: Is there a gay bar in Gaza?</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: This is what I do for a living. You are comparing the majority of Muslim states with Saudi Arabia or with</p> \n<p> KING: Should I call [Ben] Affleck and get him back here?</p> \n<p> JEBREAL: You know -- do you want to listen or do you want to --</p> \n<p> RET. GEN. WESLEY CLARK: I think the issue is beyond Muslims. I think it's about whether someone can be invited to give a speech and people will listen. Maybe they'll agree, maybe they won't. But we don't have a situation in Berkeley where people can't give a speech. I mean, that's the whole essence of the American system, people can give a speech, not everyone has to agree.</p> \n<p> </p>",

        "text":["<p>An ally of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and presumed right-wing candidate in Milan's mayoral elections has sparked outrage in Italy by suggesting that Arabic, Hebrew and other foreign languages should be banned from sermons in mosques, synagogues and all places of worship.</p> \n<p>Alessandro Sallusti – a popular pundit and editor in chief of the conservative daily il Giornale, which is owned by Berlusconi's family – made the suggestion on a talk show broadcast Tuesday on Italy's RAI state TV.</p> \n<p>Berlusconi, a media mogul who led four Italian governments and now heads the conservative opposition, has said he wants Sallusti to be his coalition's candidate in Milan's mayoral elections next year.</p> \n<p>Sallusti was speaking on the talk show about Islamic extremism and the need to better monitor mosques.&quot;Unfortunately Italy doesn't have a law demanding that sermons be held only in Italian. But I hope we will get one,&quot; he said. A young representative of the Muslim community in Milan, Davide Piccardo, challenged him: &quot;Would you also ban Hebrew from services in synagogues?&quot;</p> \n<p>Sallusti replied that he would support a law forbidding rabbis from preaching in Hebrew, although he said that prayers could still be uttered in their original language.</p> \n<p>&quot;With his ignorant remarks Sallusti has tried to erase millennia of integration of Jews in Italy.&quot; Emanuele Fiano, a Jewish lawmaker for the center-left Democratic Party who has also been floated as a mayoral candidate, said in a telephone interview with Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Sallusti is considered close to Berlusconi and the paper he edits supports his policies. &nbsp;Il Giornale is also well known for its pro-Israel views and regularly features articles by Fiamma Nirenstein, a Jewish Italian politician and former lawmaker in Berlusconi's coalition who moved to Israel and was named by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the next Israeli ambassador in Rome.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Union of Italian Jewish Communities did not comment officially but ridiculed Sallusti's words in its daily newsletter, calling them &quot;bizarre,&quot; especially considering that most local rabbis already preach in Italian.</p> \n<p>Gad Lerner, a liberal Jewish writer and TV host, told Haaretz that Sallusti's comments are &quot;representative of the complete ignorance of Italy's political class when it comes to minorities.&quot;&nbsp; Noting that &quot;this ignorance [about Jews] is very common in the pro-Israel right,&quot; Lerner said that he is not sure whether the gaffe will harm Sallusti's political prospects.</p> \n<p>Piccardo, the Muslim representative who debated Sallusti, told Haaretz his reaction proved a point: &quot;If you keep attacking Muslims, you can't pretend to be friends with the Jews. Whether it's protesting against the use of Arabic in mosques or halal meals in schools, anti-Muslim arguments can easily become anti-Semitic ones.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p> Everyone is up in arms. Some shout &quot;Democracy! Democracy!&quot; while others cry out &quot;Shabbes! Shabbes!&quot; But, really, why should we worry if the status of Israel's Arab citizens is lower than it already was, if the Palestinians in the territories are more afraid than ever of Israel's military power, if the Supreme Court follows the dictates of political interests, if left-wing organizations are delegitimized, and if newspapers are muzzled? Why all the fuss? Less democracy will be better for the Jews, for the army, for the settlers - for the nation as a whole. Hasn't the time come to give ourselves a more muscular regime and to admit that even if democracy suits the cozy and spoiled nations of Western Europe, it does not fit the harsh realities of the Middle East?</p> \n<p> But, seriously, we must face a simple fact: If throughout its violent history Israel has been able to muster the (sometimes uncanny ) support of the United States and Europe, it was for one main reason: It was &quot;the only democracy in the Middle East.&quot; Its democracy was Israel's shield from what could (and should ) have been a much larger, systematic and universal condemnation of its irresponsible policy in the territories.</p> \n<p> Democracy is not for softies only, after all, because it yields real power, inside and outside its own borders. But what is the nature of this power? Political scientists and sociologists summarize it in one word: &quot;legitimacy.&quot; Anyone who knows even a bit of political history and philosophy knows that legitimacy is the most coveted resource of rulership and that throughout history, democracy has been the most legitimate of all forms of government.</p> \n<p> But why is this the case, you may ask again. In his 1795 essay &quot;Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch,&quot; Immanuel Kant wrote: &quot;The problem of organizing a state, however hard it may seem, can be solved even for a race of devils, if only they are intelligent.&quot;</p> \n<p> The state Kant wanted to build would have to resolve three problems: 1 ) A nation is made up of diverse people who hold conflicting values, opinions and interests; such plurality of interests is a human condition that can never be overcome; 2 ) The people who govern can sometimes turn out to be very bad, immoral and incompetent. Thus, Kant said, we must establish institutions that will remain good even when the people governing are bad. With the right institutions, even &quot;a nation of devils&quot; would end up conforming to basic laws of ethics; 3 ) Because individuals and countries have a natural inclination to mistrust each other and to engage in wars, a good regime must somehow foster trust and social peace.</p> \n<p> After many centuries of political thought in Europe, democracy was found to be the only regime able to guarantee that different points of view be fairly represented, that good institutions would not depend on the morality or immorality of the people running them, and that the state would have relations of trust with its citizens, thereby ensuring their cooperativeness. If democracy is the political regime that has mustered the greatest level of legitimacy, it's because empirically it was found to be the only one able to generate trust and civil peace among diverse social groups. This is also the reason why secularism is always the preferred cultural option of democracies: Secularity is a neutral framework; religion, on the other hand, is thick with specific symbols and meanings. Because it is bound to a specific group, it naturally excludes other groups; secularity, on the other hand, is neutral, it lets all groups project their own identity on its empty screen.</p> \n<p> But there is more. The Yale legal scholar Amy Chua has argued that the great empires like Persia, Rome, Tang China, the Netherlands, Britain and now the United States were all able to rise to world dominance because each was, by the standards of its own time, extraordinarily pluralistic and tolerant. The condition of pluralism gives great political strength. Chua further claims that the empires that collapsed were those whose diversity ultimately triggered conflict, hatred and violence. That is, regimes whose diversity could not be organized and contained within a political framework of legitimate rule turned out to be the weakest. Democracy is the most powerful political framework because it is the only framework in which injustices, discrimination and violence are peacefully contested and negotiated through the rule of law and through the public sphere. Change that framework - as the extreme right, with the help of the right, has been doing in Israel - and it is the very basis of social peace that is undermined.</p> \n<p> But let us not be fooled: The strength of the extreme right is the strength of hormonally induced and beefed-up muscles: These muscles look scary, but they hide the weakness and hollowness of these extremists' approach to politics, and their feeble understanding of the complex art of governing. For no one can govern for very long without legitimacy.</p> \n<p> Prof. Eva Illouz holds the Rose Isaacs Chair in Sociology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and is a member of the Center for the Study of Rationality at the university.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Seventy years ago, on June 22, 1941, the German army embarked on Operation Barbarossa, the largest military operation in human history, in terms of both manpower and casualties. Germany thus opened the eastern front of World War II, to the surprise of the Soviet Union, hitherto its ally.</p> \n<p>What ensued in the following weeks was described by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Parliament, on August 24, 1941: &quot;Whole districts are being exterminated. Scores of thousands - literally scores of thousands - of executions in cold blood are being perpetrated by the German Police-troops upon the Russian patriots ... there has never been methodical, merciless butchery on such a scale, or approaching such a scale ... We are in the presence of a crime without a name.&quot;</p> \n<p>On July 3, the German army entered Novogrudok, which had been under Soviet rule since September 17, 1939. In the coming days, some 70 local Jewish intellectuals were rounded up and taken to an unknown destination, where they were murdered. Among them was most probably my grandfather, the Hebrew teacher and writer Israel Elyahu Handelzalc, who had fled to the town from Warsaw in 1939. Shortly thereafter, probably in the town of Szereszow, my aunt Tamara perished, with her husband, and their 3-year-old son, Michael. I'm named after him.</p> \n<p>In the 70 years since then, the Nazis' (and their allies' ) madness, which had a terrible method to it - and far exceeded the wildest fears or imagination - has come to be known all over the world by two names: one Hebrew, the &quot;Shoah,&quot; and the other English, the &quot;Holocaust.&quot;</p> \n<p>On April 18, 1941, Raphael Lemkin, a Polish lawyer of Jewish descent, arrived in the United States. He was carrying an extensive compilation of the Germans' legal decrees related to the treatment of the populations in territories occupied by them, specifically including minorities like the Jews. These documents were to serve as a basis for his book &quot;Axis Rule in Occupied Europe&quot; (1944 ). In the preface, Lemkin wrote: &quot;By 'genocide' we mean the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group. This new word, coined by the author to denote an old practice in its modern development, is made from the ancient Greek word genos (race, tribe ) and the Latin cide (killing ) ... a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The objectives of such a plan would be disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.&quot;</p> \n<p>Lemkin (who would have been 111 last Friday; he died, alone and forgotten, in 1959 ) had been preoccupied with devising a conceptual and legal international framework that would address the &quot;destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group&quot; since he'd heard reports of the mass murder of more than a million Armenians in 1915 by the Turks. In 1933, representing Poland, he proposed to the League of Nations in Madrid the creation of a multilateral convention that would make extermination of human groups - which he referred to as &quot;terror,&quot; &quot;acts of barbarity&quot; and &quot;acts of vandalism&quot; - an international crime. On November 23, 1947, he succeeded, single-handedly, in persuading the nascent United Nations to adopt the draft of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as UN Assembly Resolution 180, which was followed six days later by Resolution 181, concerning the partition of Palestine. Both decisions were adopted - no doubt with more than ample justification - under the influence of the still-fresh memory of the unprecedented atrocities committed by the Nazis during World War II, mainly but not exclusively against the Jews.</p> \n<p>Lemkin's unique achievement was only one of many topics discussed by participants of a symposium organized by the Open University last Monday. The event - entitled &quot;And You Must Destroy the Evil Inside of You: We Are the Human Beings Who Commit Holocaust and Genocide&quot; - marked the forthcoming publication of a book by the same name, by Prof. Israel Charny.</p> \n<p>Charny, a psychologist, and the executive director of the Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide, in Jerusalem, has been researching the subject of genocide for 50 years. Among the many publications with which he has been involved is the two-volume &quot;Encyclopedia of Genocide,&quot; which he edited. The new book, his first in Hebrew, is the 12th in the &quot;genocide&quot; series published by the Open University as part of the curriculum of its &quot;genocide studies&quot;; more than 1,000 students took these courses last year.</p> \n<p>The title of Charny's newest work and the symposium reflect the complexity of the subject, which is by nature very contentious: Are &quot;genocide&quot; and &quot;holocaust&quot; synonymous? Does one subsume the other, and if so, which is which? Are we, by virtue of being human beings, prone to perpetrating holocausts and genocide? Is evil (as is reiterated seven times in the Book of Deuteronomy ) indeed within us all? Does the fact that we are descendants of victims make us immune to becoming potential perpetrators?</p> \n<p>It is beyond my ability to address these questions here, but it's important to point out that the indirect &quot;dialogue&quot; conducted in 1941-1944 between Churchill and Lemkin about the correct name for the unnameable may help us in addressing extremely sensitive issues today.</p> \n<p>One basic, human way of coming to terms with reality is literally that: finding the terminology, the right words that describe it. Naming a phenomenon allows us to grasp it. Indeed, this is the first task that God, having just created a reality merely by uttering words, asks the first human to perform. He created animals, and &quot;brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that was to be the name thereof&quot; (Genesis 2:19 ). Similarly, by giving names to the reality around him, the human &quot;domesticates&quot; it.</p> \n<p>But we know very well that often one word is not enough to properly describe a phenomenon, especially an elusive one. For example, people have a first (sometimes also a second and third ) given name, and are often also identified by their father's (and sometime mother's ) names. In our times most also carry a family name. The given and family names together embody and manifest an individual's exclusivity and inclusivity.</p> \n<p>In a similar way - and we can thank the ingenuity of Raphael Lemkin for this - the &quot;destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group&quot; belongs to the genocide &quot;family&quot; of crimes. The genocide perpetrated by the Nazis and their ilk on the Jews during World War II goes by the first name of Holocaust, or Shoah. Unlike &quot;genocide,&quot; coined by Lemkin, both of these words, used to describe terrible occurrences, were in use before. Indeed, Churchill referred to the Armenian genocide as a &quot;holocaust&quot; (in 1929 ). Today, when people talk about a catastrophic event that befell a group of people before 1939 or after 1945, they often refer to it as a &quot;Shoah&quot; or a &quot;Holocaust&quot; - thus named &quot;after&quot; what the Nazis and their associates perpetrated on the Jews in the war.</p> \n<p>Charny proposes what he calls a &quot;multiple classification&quot; of genocide, which allows for characterization of human atrocities past and present. Such categorization does not detract in any way from the uniqueness of the calamity that befell the Jews: Precisely because of its historically unprecedented magnitude, scope and scale, the Holocaust has since 1945 constituted a measuring stick for assessing atrocities that human beings plan and sometimes perpetrate, alas, upon others. Luckily, in the interim, no other horrors have even remotely approached the enormity of &quot;the&quot; Holocaust - and it is incumbent on us to keep it that way (although we sometimes seem to forget that duty ).</p> \n<p>The odd thing about human nature, though, is that in current global political discourse, it seems to be an advantage for a nation or ethnic group to be perceived by others as having been - or as being bound to be - the victim or target of attempted genocide. We should always bear in mind that other communities may have suffered terribly, and deserve defense and appropriate redress, despite the fact that they experienced nothing like the Shoah, Holocaust or even &quot;mere&quot; genocide.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In some kosher Jerusalem restaurants, even male employees who are not observant Jews must wear a kippa. In some cases restaurant managers cite a desire to show respect for their customers, while in others the request or directive apparently comes from the on-site kashrut inspector, or mashgiah.</p> \n<p>Ran Bassa, a lawyer who works in Jerusalem's Givat Shaul industrial zone, says he noticed a few months ago that workers at the Bar Burger hamburger joint near his office were all wearing kippot. &quot;That made me suspicious, because all the kippot were identical and placed at an unnatural manner, as if temporary. I asked and the cashier admitted they all had to wear them because of kashrut,&quot; Bassa said. &quot;It's very annoying, I see it as an insult. I have no problem with the kashrut certification, but I don't understand; is the food more pure if it's prepared by someone with a kippa? The place serves the entire population, and when you force a religious facade on such a place it's infuriating,&quot; Bassa said.</p> \n<p>Burger Bar's kashrut certification, or hekhsher, is from Rabbi Avraham Rubin of Rehovot. Although this hekhsher is known to be strict and acceptable to large portions of the ultra-Orthodox community, in recent years Rubin has faced accusations of laxness from rivals, mainly from the Eda Haredit organization.</p> \n<p>Rubin's on-site kashrut inspectors tell the managers of restaurants under their supervision that only observant, kippa-wearing Jews are permitted to place food on the grill. In the case of Burger Bar, where the grill is in sight of the customers and all employees work the grill, everyone is asked to wear a kippa.</p> \n<p>According to Rabbi Yitzchak Weinberg, one of the heads of Rubin's certification agency, the agency does not get involved with employee apparel issues, which is left up to the owner &quot;who wants to respect his religious and Haredi customers.&quot; Weinberg adds, however, that anyone who places food over a flame must at least observe the Jewish Sabbath. &quot;It's not a question of clothing, it's Jewish law,&quot; Weinberg says. &quot;Not the servers, though.&quot;</p> \n<p>The on-site inspector, however, speaking to Haaretz on condition of anonymity, said that anyone working at the restaurant has to wear a kippa; &quot;it's important for the public,&quot; he said.</p>",

        "text":["<p> &quot;Go straight, then turn right at the first street after the third traffic circle,&quot; are the kind of instructions given to a visitor to Shfaram trying to get around the city center. Traffic circles are scattered throughout this city: They are not piazzas in the Italian sense nor are they the traffic circles typical of suburbs, banal alternatives to traffic lights intended to blur the urbanism and instill a tranquil, pastoral aura. No, each of the circles of Shfaram - Shefar-'Amr, in Arabic - has its unique feel. They are an urban celebration on their own, and while traveling up and down the hills on which the city is built, each encounter with them provides a different kind of surprise. </p> \n<p> At the end of that street, the first one after the third roundabout, is Shfaram's municipal Payis Center, lit up like a monument. How strange that name is in an Arab city! The very use of a the Hebrew equivalent of the letter &quot;p,&quot; a sound which does not exist in Arabic, immediately makes it clear who is in control here and who has the power to provide or not provide the local population with communal buildings - not to mention the random acronyms and uncertainty inherent in the name &quot;Payis,&quot; which means one big lottery. </p> \n<p> &quot;From birth to old age, everyone wins the lottery,&quot; is the way the national lottery presents its original worldview in ads, &quot;like a thread that runs through a citizen's life, so Mifal Hapayis accompanies Israel's citizens from their birth until they reach the golden age.&quot; </p> \n<p> So too Mifal Hapayis is also present throughout the lives of Shfaram residents, and its center is where the recently finished Ayam al-Oud (Oud Days ) Music Festival, organized and produced by the Beit Almusica municipal conservatory took place. Currently there is not a single auditorium worthy of the name in all of Israel's Arab communities, a real concert hall where a festival can be organized, and in the absence of any option, they use the alternative. </p> \n<p> The Mifal Hapayis auditorium's complete inappropriateness for hosting concerts: the haphazard positioning of the lighting and amps, the limited number of seats, which are actually school-type chairs, and the narrow stage are however forgotten given the excitement and festive atmosphere that prevailed everywhere. Extra chairs were provided for the hundreds who filled the hall, from young children - where they came from was ascertained later on - to teenagers and adults, all of whom streamed in to listen to the evening program: two Arabic music ensembles, including musicians from Shfaram, Jerusalem and the Galilee. </p> \n<p> The local performers rounded out the program, which included performances by two of the biggest names in the Arab world: the singer Aicha Redouane from Morocco and the members of the acclaimed International trio from Turkey: the innovative kanun player, Aytac Dogan; Ismail Tuncbilek, who has developed electronic folk instruments and Omar Arslan on percussion. Also performing were graduates of the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music. </p> \n<p> The festival is not an unusual event in the Israeli music scene: From the Israel Festival southward, there are dozens of festivals here each year - of contemporary music, liturgical music, jazz and baroque, Mostly Mozart and Maestro, the Music Festival and Music in the Desert, but a music festival amid a Palestinian-Arab population inside Israel? </p> \n<p> If the Jewish majority is being choked by a shortage of budgets and sighing over the shortage of public funding for music festivals, what will the Arabs, who receive crumbs of crumbs from the dietetic budget allocations, say? And still, Amer Nakhleh, Beit Almusica's director, managed to put together an international festival that was also held in the neighboring cities of Haifa and Nazareth. He himself, with tasteful remarks instilled with rare artistic and social devotion, and an oud and bouzouki performance as part of the first ensemble performing that evening, opened the concert. </p> \n<p> The educational element of the Oud Days festival became apparent in this part of the concert, whose performers were students, graduates and teachers from the conservatory. The Mifal Hapayis auditorium was filled with the sounds of classical Arab music on the oud, violin, contrabass, percussion, kanun and bouzouki: Umm Kulthum songs, wonderfully performed by Riham Hamadi, who sang in the conservatory choir and has now become a solo performer, with the young student Jerais Nazar on percussion and Tony Barhoum, a young, virtuoso kanun player who won prizes in Israel (grants from the America-Israel Cultural Foundation ) and in the Marcel Khalife Arabic music competition, and by the violinist and composer Akram Abd al-Fatah, one of whose works was also performed. </p> \n<p> &quot;The festival is a significant educational and musical statement,&quot; says Nakhleh after the concert. &quot;Firstly because of the local elements, and also the guests from the Arab world. Today, not many are willing to come here, especially not from Egypt and Turkey, for fear of a boycott. But when they come, we here feel as if we exist, that there is a channel for our culture, that there are reciprocal ties with artists from across the Middle East who are interested and come, and they in turn invite us. </p> \n<p> Welcome accomplishment </p> \n<p> &quot;This kind of festival, which has considerable support from the Shfaram municipality [Mayor Nahed Khazem opened the evening with a short, supportive speech] and this takes us to new places and new challenges, and proves to us that it is okay to dream, that developing musical culture is something that is possible, and that our culture is worthy of equal standing and more support in Israel. Musicians such as the Turks and Aicha start to realize that there is a Palestinian population here that is part of the culture. They start to notice the complex reality here, and there's a sense that the festival has a role in this process, and eventually they will see us as part of the culture. Inside Israel, the minuscule budget indicates that there is no institutional intention to develop it, that there is no news.&quot; </p> \n<p> From a handful of students around eight years ago when it opened, the first Arab conservatory has grown and now has 400 students, plus another 100 youth at risk and in dire financial straits who cannot pay for their studies and rely on grants provided by the conservatory - mostly funded by donations from individuals and funds. </p> \n<p> &quot;They are the children you saw at the concert&quot; says Nakhleh, &quot;children from Tamra and Iblin, from the surrounding communities and from Shfaram, who come to study with us - the demand is huge. This is our project, to set up a school for children in distress within the music school. Today only those with means can afford the cost of their children's music studies, and it is important to us that there is no status issue. This issue is being overseen by social workers and welfare officials who monitor the children and the impact of music studies on their lives. Who funds it? Entrepreneurs who are crazy about the idea, people who fight with all their might to realize this vision - in the end, it's just a small number of students relative to the great potential. Many of these children had never in their lives seen a concert hall before this evening.&quot; </p> \n<p> Nakhleh says that the connection with Ramallah and the Palestinians in the territories is natural: &quot;Some of our students play in the Palestinian orchestra, while at the same time perform at conferences and conservatories in the Jewish sector, and are highly praised in both places. The most important aspect: Everywhere Arab children perform professionally has an impact and that is a great and welcome accomplishment. It is image-changing, although occasionally confusing: There is still a way to go before the suspicion of both sides dissipates. The musical quality is what will enable a dialogue among equals between Jews and Arabs, not from a sense of inferiority and not under the label of 'coexistence,' but out of recognition and closer cultural ties through the music.&quot; </p> \n<p> The second part of the concert featured a young singer, Woroud Jubran, performing a series of old and new classic Arab folk songs with a Western influence - crowd pleasers from Asmahan's &quot;Toyour&quot; with vocals influenced by Mozart's &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; wonderfully performed by Jubran in way that dazzled the audience, to Abdel Halim Hafez's songs and recent songs that sent the audience out into the chilly night smiling and humming. </p>",

        "text":["<p>For most Israelis, who have had little or no interaction with Palestinians for at least the past decade, the &quot;Palestinian partner&quot; remains an abstract concept. As a result, we spend a lot of time seeking a clear definition of what that ideal partner for ending the occupation would be: Who would be acceptable? What is the ideal profile? As a civil society worker, I have a face for the Palestinian partner that I want to see, in the abstract and in flesh and blood. I have met him. But my Palestinian partner is now in jail as a &quot;security prisoner&quot; - convicted of illegal acts and facing a harsh sentence to be determined by a military judge in the coming weeks.</p> \n<p>I met Abdallah Abu Rahma in 2009 when I was handling media for Physicians for Human Rights-Israel. Among other activities, PHR provided first-aid training to Palestinian, Israeli and international activists after the death of Bassem Abu Rahma, who was killed in Bil'in that April after being shot in the chest with a tear-gas canister at one of the weekly protests that have been held in the village since February 2005. Abdallah, a 39-year-old high-school teacher and father of three, and a distant relative of Bassem's, was Bil'in's media coordinator, and thus my direct counterpart and partner in the project. We were in touch daily and met several times. Abdallah was always in his trademark suit and tie, an outfit that is a source of affectionate attention among the Israeli activist crowd.</p> \n<p>One of the first things that struck me when I attended a pre-sentencing hearing at Ofer prison for him last week was that he was no longer in his suit. A brown prison outfit and ankle chains replaced the usual tie, starched shirt and handkerchief. Abdallah, a dignified, formal man, was now being tried and sentenced by a military court system that lumps legitimate and illegitimate protest together - that is, violent and nonviolent, legal and illegal. This system does not see the partner that I worked with - it sees only a threat. Palestinian activism - violent or not - is always perceived as threatening to Israeli security.</p> \n<p>Israelis say they have been wondering for years when Palestinian leaders who preach nonviolence will emerge. But when Palestinians began a civil protest against the separation barrier that sliced through their lives, Israel resurrected Military Order 101. That deems any gathering of more than 10 people illegal unless they obtain a permit from the military commander of the West Bank. Abdallah and organizers like him - who have chosen, both in principle and through their actions, the route of nonviolence and civil disobedience - are the kind of partners we said we wanted. And now they are being arrested for doing just the thing we said we hoped they'd do.</p> \n<p>And why did Israel start using 101? &quot;Stone-throwing.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Stone-throwing&quot; is a term that categorizes all Palestinian civil disobedience as violent, makes protests impossible long before the first stone is thrown, and has given Israeli military officials carte blanche for implementing a range of policies that seem to be aimed at quashing any political organizing in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Like so many policies of the occupation - segregated roads, curfews, etc. - Israel has thus chosen a sweeping policy that limits the basic rights and liberties of all because of the perceived risk posed by a few - in this case, the stone-throwers. The sweeping nature of 101 a priori categorizes all demonstrations under the occupation as illegal. And while the military has the authority to arrest stone-throwers, it prefers to make legitimate, nonviolent protest impossible.</p> \n<p>Abdallah organized protests because the separation barrier, which is built on his village's lands, and whose route the High Court ordered to be changed in its decision of September 2007, still stands where it was originally erected. He says that his political struggle has not ended and that, as a committed activist and human rights defender, he will not be deterred by arrests and jail time from carrying out the organizing work that still needs to be done. The prosecution has said it wants to make an example of him, and wants him to be sentenced to more than the usual two years that come with these charges.</p> \n<p>I want him and other Palestinian grass-roots nonviolent organizers to be free to carry on their political struggle together with Israeli partners and supporters. For the past nine months, while he has been on trial for organizing illegal protests and incitement to violence, Abdallah Abu Rahma has been in detention, torn away from his wife, three children and the young students he could be teaching, because Israel has apparently decided that civic activism, nonviolent protest or any kind of dissidence in Palestine is illegal.</p> \n<p>On my way into the pre-sentencing hearing last week, I braced myself, expecting to see a shell of the Abdallah that was imprisoned nine months ago. But the same upright person walked in. He was greeted by a room full of Israelis, foreign diplomats and family members - and insisted on speaking at the end of the hearing. He stood and said: &quot;I was raised to believe in peace, coexistence and nonviolence. This is what I have passed on to my children and my students.&quot;</p> \n<p>This is our Palestinian partner.</p> \n<p>Libby Lenkinski Friedlander is the director of international relations for the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A public action committee is trying to convert the building that housed the studio of Avraham Soskin - one of Tel Aviv's premier photographers around the time it was established - into a photography museum that will also commemorate Soskin's work. In 1909 Soskin photographed the famous seashell lottery, in which the first building plots in Ahuzat Bayit (subsequently Tel Aviv ) were distributed. On a small dune in the barren sands north of Jaffa, representatives of the neighborhood's 66 founding families gathered and tensely waited their turn.</p> \n<p>&quot;While that was happening, Avraham Soskin stood on another hill of sand with his mysterious magical box poised on wooden legs, pressed a button and left to history the first moment of the city of Tel Aviv,&quot; stated Soskin's eulogy, published after his death in September, 1963 in the now-defunct newspaper Davar.</p> \n<p>Soskin was born in Orsha, Belorussia and immigrated to Palestine in 1905. He followed Tel Aviv in all of its most important moments. All the inhabitants of the city, the leaders of the Yishuv (pre-state Jewish community in Palestine ), Arabs from Jaffa and various visitors from abroad who wanted to immortalize their image came to his studio, which was called Fotografia, at 24 Herzl Street.</p> \n<p>Soskin also documented the first bank branch, the students and teachers at the Herzliya Gymnasium and the first street lamp.</p> \n<p>Soskin's studio was closed in 1933 and is now in private hands. Over the years the building housed a variety of businesses, among them a cafe, a hotel and a sewing shop. Accordingly, the original division of its space has changed; the original balconies were removed and the glass wall was demolished entirely.</p> \n<p>Though the building has been listed for preservation, it is not well-maintained. Currently a public action committee is trying to preserve and renovate the building, and to establish a center for historical photography there.</p> \n<p>&quot;Stills photography in the country in general and in Tel Aviv in particular doesn't have an activity center,&quot; explained photography curator and committee member Guy Raz this week. &quot;Alongside painters Nahum Gutman and Reuven Rubin and poet Chaim Nachman Bialik, Soskin was one of the most important documenters of the beginnings of culture in Tel Aviv. The other three have a house and a museum - Soskin does not.&quot;</p> \n<p>Members of the action committee include Tamar Tucler, Shula Wiedrich, Shai Farkash, Prof. Irit Amit-Cohen and the photographer's grandson Rani Soskin. It is supported by the Society for Preservation of Israel Heritage Sites and the Forum for the Preservation of Audio-Visual Memory in Israel.</p> \n<p>&quot;Anyone who wants to see how Tel Aviv looked in its earliest days looks at my grandfather's photographs,&quot; says Rani Soskin. &quot;More than 60 percent of the city's historic buildings have been eradicated and today they exist solely in the pictures.&quot;</p> \n<p>In the past 12 years there have been three exhibitions of Soskin's work: at the Artists House in Tel Aviv, at the Tel Aviv Museum and at the photography Museum in Tel Hai. Currently, the exhibition &quot;Soskin, the Camera, the City and the Home&quot; is at the Herzlilienblum Museum of Banking and Tel Aviv Nostalgia (13 Herzl Street, Tel Aviv ). It focuses on the cusp between Soskin's public and private works and includes some of the photographer's personal possessions.</p> \n<p>In Raz's opinion, the future photography center should include a reconstruction of Soskin's studio, a gallery and a research center. &quot;Many of the photographers who worked in the land of Israel have not yet been studied,&quot; he adds.</p> \n<p>At the Tel Aviv municipality they welcome the initiative. &quot;The idea is charming and the whole surrounding area is currently undergoing very interesting development,&quot; says Yermi Hoffman, the director of the landmark conservation department at the municipality. According to him, the initial phase should include talks with the current owners in parallel with the preparation of a comprehensive file on the building. He does not dismiss the possibility that, in the future, the municipality will invest money in the renovation and preservation of the building.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The wonderful program of young artists that was presented at the Batsheva Dance Company's Studio Varda on Thursday was surprising in the freshness and talent of the artists who do as they please based on solid technique and choreographic knowledge. The space is a roomy studio with no props, with uniform lighting from the side throughout all the dances. Yet the dancers are close enough to touch. What else could be needed when there are talented artists and good dancers?</p> \n<p>For this evening one could find a topical common denominator related to magic, spirits and rituals. Everything shone forth from the professionalism of the dancers, while from the actual materials the humor emerged and glittered. And that is what was so terrific.</p> \n<p>Talia Beck danced the solo work, &quot;Airplay,&quot; which can be described as expressionist; a woman who is controlled by spirits. Here movements appear to be those of someone looking for something, and suddenly they become difficult and the movement becomes choppy, controlled by an outside force. Sometimes it seems as if there is another &quot;force&quot; raging inside her body. Beck is a dancer with a strong presence, strong enough to cope with all the demons within and without. The dance ends with her standing with her palms swaying from side to side, like a storm that has subsided, but awaiting the next outburst.</p> \n<p>Gili Navot's &quot;Check-in&quot; also featured spirits. Four dancers stand on the stage, wearing black shorts, listening to a musical setting of doors shutting that can be associated with some sort of abandoned castle. And like in a seance, they hold hands, fall in, slowly rise, and move as if obeying this same outside force that controls them.</p> \n<p>Then suddenly, endearing music is heard, something like Hawaiian music, as if it is a fragment of memory, and Navot together with Avraham Yaniv dance while they appear to be controlled by the center of the body, a point in the belly, and dance with enjoyment. Navot is a dancer with an intriguing presence and outstanding technical ability who finds in Yaniv a worthy partner and the duet is both sweet and intriguing.</p> \n<p>Later on there is also a duet by two female dancers, Mami Shimazaki and Doron Raz, and it features a few segments in which both perform the same movement which only intensifies the big difference in the quality of the movements of these two fine dancers, with each one highlighting her personality.</p> \n<p>The first is strong, solid, attached to the ground and radiating outwardly, whereas the second is soft, caressing, introverted, but both conquer the stage with the same power. The structure of the dance is simple and the composition is professional. Is it possible to follow the seances and the poet's intentions? Not always, but that is not the heart of the matter.</p> \n<p>In the female duet, &quot;A Droom Come Tree&quot; by Noa Zuk, the two look like twins, dressed in shiny black leotards, their legs exposed and short socks on their feet. I did not manage to follow the subject and the dramaturgy of Ehud Fishoff, who also edited the soundtrack, but the movements are interesting in and of themselves. The dance looks like a dialogue between individual statements that are nurtured by the same movement source, but with different solutions for each of the dancers. The lexicon of movement is influenced by Ohad Naharin and it is nevertheless apparent that within this same language, Zuk is searching for her own voice.</p> \n<p>The program concluded with &quot;Battles for the 21st Century's Love&quot; by Ariel Cohen, which is manic, theatrical dance in the best possible sense of the words. The work seems to be about a television competition to direct a dance piece. And what is there? A dancer who appears to mummified in stiff, red fabric holding a knife in her hand. When she stabs the blade into the clothing, tears the cover, something emerges that is a woman with thighs flowing with a mane of light hair, like mythological horses.</p> \n<p>Another dancer, tied in plastic cuffs on her arms and legs, moves across the floor like a worm.</p> \n<p>There is a quartet of dancers whose bodies are painted with thick black stripes, like some tribe engaged in a ritual. And there is also a video photographer whose face is covered. In order to connect all this to a competition, there is also an interviewer who seems &quot;normal&quot; and is running a show wearing a tailored suit, her hair gathered on the top of her head like a lighthouse, she presents the winning team with a bouquet of flowers, then checks on her kingdom as she rides on a toy car holding a weapon.</p> \n<p>The dancers flood the stage, demonstrate their technical abilities as if they are tearing themselves apart because they are so flexible, or take part in some kind of mourning rite for the woman with the thighs made of hair who has died or fallen asleep, and when one of them lifts her, and awakens her like in the legend of Sleeping Beauty, the group goes wild like a hypnotized group of drunks and later on writhes and shouts as if on the verge of giving birth, and you wonder what will come of all this.</p> \n<p>They enjoy every moment as the bewildered audience looks on.</p> \n<p>This whole to do is supported by the clever use of the stage surface and surprising and intriguing movement that Cohen does with the outstanding, powerful, flexible and acrobatic dancers.</p> \n<p>All of this could easily have turned into a lot of kitsch, but there is not a single boring moment, and like a magician in a modern circus, every second Cohen pulls another trick out in order to win the 21st century reality competition.</p> \n<p>&quot;Airplay&quot; by Ella Rothschild.

Their downfall, one of history’s most epic tales of heavenly judgment for impenitent sin, has fundamentally shaped the way Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions view homosexuality.</p> \n<p>Yet putting aside for a moment the theological debate over the morality and indeed historicity of the Vale of Siddim’s sexual proclivities, what have archaeological excavations unveiled? Did the so-called Cities of the Plain exist, and if so, where? Were they destroyed in one cataclysmic go, a once-fertile region turned into a salty wilderness – and if so, how?</p> \n<p>Higgledy-piggledy historicity</p> \n<p>While no consensus reigns in archaeological and scientific communities as to the existence of the ‘Sin Cities’, a ‘southern theory’ – specifically a cluster of five sites in modern-day Jordan – has gained the most traction.</p> \n<p>Based on the five wadis leading into the southeastern Dead Sea, W. F. Albright, the founder of the Biblical Archeology movement, first theorized that these dry riverbeds once flowed with water, providing desirable and therefore likely places for the pentapolis in question to have established itself. Excavations at a Bronze Age site called Bab edh-Dha on the sea’s south-eastern bank, carried out in the 1960s by Paul W. Lapp, appeared to substantiate this theory.</p> \n<p>Bab edh-Dha has since been embraced by many as the remains of the condemned city, a conclusion based on the discovery of a massive cemetery, defensive walls and pottery which showed signs of being burnt, as well as telltale deposits of bitumen.</p> \n<p>Strengthening the hand of the southern theorists was the discovery of another four sites to the south of Bab edh-Dha during the 1970s. The unearthing of Numeira by Walter E. Rast and R. Thomas Schaub – excitedly labeled by some as the ruins of Gomorrah – was followed by three other ruined Bronze Age localities, Safi (Zoar?), Feifa (Admah?) and Khanazir (Zeboiim?).</p> \n<p>Aside from the magic number five, the unearthed sites exhibit similarities in both architecture and artifacts found, implying some sort of shared urban culture. However, detractors argue – among other things – that these sites are too small to match the biblical description of the Cities of the Plain, and, according to archaeological analysis, met their end hundreds of years before the Bible’s internal chronology, which pegs Sodom and Gomorrah’s downfall around the beginning of the twentieth century BCE, just before Isaac’s birth.</p> \n<p>A ‘northern theory’ has proved less popular. Ruins at Tulaylat al-Ghassul northeast of the Dead Sea, first discovered in 1929, were initially linked to the Cities of the Plain, but later excavations showed contradictory dates of destruction. Yet another option is being explored, also northeast of the sea, at Tall al-Hammam, a joint dig by the Jordanian government and Trinity Southwest College, an evangelical Christian university in New Mexico.</p> \n<p>Further north in Syria, inscriptions on some of the 20,000 cuneiform tablets found in the Ebla digs in 1975 mentions Sodom and Admah explicitly – the first such extra-biblical reference. This argues that at least some of the cities were real, though such extrapolations are contested, including by Ebla scholars themselves.</p> \n<p>Natural disaster, not hand of God?</p> \n<p>If the city-kingdoms did in fact exist, those unconvinced by a literalist reading of scripture suspect their end was brought about by an indiscriminate natural disaster, not a targeted genocide perpetrated by a puritanical being upstairs. Geologists such as Frederick G. Clapp, then Graham Harris and Anthony Beardow, posit that that the Dead Sea region, perched on top of the tectonic boundary between the Arabian and African Plates as it is, was struck by a massive earthquake that fits the relevant timeframe.</p> \n<p>Analysis of rock faces, crushed skeletal remains and scientific simulations lend credence to the possibility that a quake liquefied the ground, igniting underground methane and the region’s abundant bitumen deposits, and possibly caused a catastrophic landslide. Latter-day drilling has found oil and gas in the region's rocks, if not in commercial quantities.</p> \n<p>Harris and Beardow concluded that the most likely location of the ruins is under the shallow waters of the southern Dead Sea.</p> \n<p>Homophobic Hebrew whispers?</p> \n<p>Still other hypotheses and possible locations abound, including the presumptively named Mt. Sodom in Israel with its wondrous salt pillars. But archaeological inquiry has proven inconclusive. No singular site or finding has been roundly embraced as answering the many questions that the case of the Cities of Plains raise, perhaps in no small part to the socio-religious ramifications of any such resolution. Explaining the destruction through natural events would undermine the biblical account’s authenticity, bolstering claims that the tale of Sodom and Gomorrah is a sinister myth born out of Iron Age homophobia.</p> \n<p>As Israel Finkelstein, professor of archaeology at Tel Aviv University and co-author of the best-selling The Bible Unearthed, says: “We are probably dealing here with an etiological story, that is, a legend that developed in order to explain a landmark. In other words, people who lived in the later phase of the Iron Age, the later days of the kingdom of Judah, were familiar with the huge ruins of the Early Bronze cities and told a story of how such important places could be destroyed.”</p> \n<p>Why would they ascribe the disaster to fire rather than say, flood or plague? Finkelstein offers that the Hebrew peoples of the time “could have incorporated into the story elements that come from the natural phenomena of the region.”</p> \n<p>Smoking guns and sexual genocide</p> \n<p>True believers could retort that no, this isn’t just a case of Hebrew whispers transcribed onto cured cow skin; the Torah not a man-made redaction of dubious oral histories; it is absolute truth, dictated by God to Moses. And even if science can explain the cities’ ruination, it was Father Universe, through a servile Mother Earth, who orchestrated this most socio-religiously consequential of cataclysms.</p> \n<p>Even so, how do we prove that the slain urbanites were practitioners of ‘sodomy’ – the casus belli for their mass execution?</p> \n<p>Perhaps the only way to ever confirm their alleged homosexuality, and by extension, that God really does hate gays, is to unearth, under all those layers of rock and sand homoerotic stone inscriptions or carvings depicting man-on-man action that survived the cities’ apocalyptical end and millennia of decay.</p> \n<p>But unlike recovered artifacts affirming the proclivities of the ancient Greeks, no smoking gun has been found in the Dead Sea region – and likely not through the bible-and-spade brigade’s lack of trying.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A three-hour-plus documentary of Woody Allen's life is set to air in two parts as part of PBS’ American Masters series beginning Nov. 20.  Allen’s mystique has proven gripping for his legions of fans, who have faithfully followed his zigzagging mind through a prolific film career that has been variously comic, wacky, poignant, dark, charmingly romantic and almost ludicrously intelligent — all of which is on display in this biographical film. Nor does Allen’s neurotic self-effacement hold sway with the documentary’s producer, Robert Weide, best-known for his five-year stint as an executive producer and principal director of HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm.”  “The big thing with Woody was getting over the hump of him agreeing to do this in the first place,” Weide said during a phone interview. “That hesitation was about him feeling that he wasn’t an interesting subject — that’s how out of touch he is.”  The film frequently acknowledges, through Allen’s friends and colleagues, that he is one strange genius. Recalling Allen’s early career doing stand-up in the West Village, his manager, Charles Joffe, observes, “He could hardly talk to people, let alone perform for them. And some nights, he was godawful. But other nights, he was absolutely brilliant.”  Read more at JewishJournal.com</p>",

        "text":["<p>“At such at age, one doesn’t work as a press photographer,” they said to Yakov Agor when he immigrated to Israel from Poland in 1958, at the age of 47. Despite that greeting, Agor became one of the most important and prominent photographers in Israel, who not only went out on news assignments as a photojournalist, but for years also documented cultural and artistic life, as well as life in both town and country.</p> \n<p>Last week the Tel Aviv Museum of Art opened an exhibition of photographs by Agor (1911-1996). The volume that accompanies it, “Yakov Agor: Photographer,” marks the first time a selection of his photos has appeared in book form.</p> \n<p>In an interview with Agor in the Tel Aviv weekly Ha’ir in 1987, Esther Zandberg wrote: “When photographer Yakov Agor had been working with the Israeli theater for 25 years, friends suggested that perhaps he should publish an album, like everyone else. The Massada Press was enthusiastic and Nissim Aloni, a friend and a playwright who was a particular favorite of Agor’s, offered to write the texts. That was three years ago and to this day no album has been published.”</p> \n<p>Adam Baruch wrote in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth even earlier, in 1978: “Agor has a handwriting all his own. Someone needs to go to his house once and organize his archive properly.” That task was taken on by artist Dani Karavan, who was a close friend of Agor’s.</p> \n<p>“I’ve known Yakov since the 1950s, when he had just arrived in Israel,” he says. Beginning in 2000, when he was a member of the Payis Council for Culture and Art, Karavan set himself two main objectives or, “dreams,” as he puts it. The first was to organize a museum exhibition for a group of artists who had not been shown for years, and had largely been forgotten if not excluded from the traditional canon of Israeli art. The second was to publish a book of the work of photographer Yakov Agor.</p> \n<p>To Karavan’s delight, both dreams were fulfilled: In 2006 the exhibition “12 Artists: A Second Glance,” curated by Irith Hadar, opened at the Tel Aviv Museum, displaying the works of Yehoshua Grossbard, Avraham Naton, Yehiel Krize, Aharon Kahana and others.</p> \n<p>The second dream came to fruition this year with the publication of the catalog. Joining the editing was Prof. Shimon Sandhaus, also a member of the Mifal Hapayis national lottery committee.</p> \n<p>“I asked him to join,” says Karavan. “He’s a designer, a person who has a much better knowledge of printing houses than I do. He recommended the designer and supervised the entire printing process.”</p> \n<p>Alex Agor, the photographer’s son, who lives in the United States and is visiting Israel for the exhibition, confesses to being excited: “It’s an honor that Dani Karavan took this on himself. I don’t think there’s a curator in the world who could have done what Dani did. In terms of his thinking, he really entered father’s shoes.”</p> \n<p>The book, which includes over 100 photographs, is divided into five sections. The first presents pictures from the family album, where one can see Agor, his wife Helena and Alex. The second includes portraits of intellectuals and public figures,including Uri Avnery and Shalom Cohen, who were then editing the weekly magazine Haolam Hazeh; a young Shulamit Aloni puffing on a cigarette; David Ben-Gurion photographed from the back, sitting at a table in his home on Keren Kayemet Boulevard, in Tel Aviv; the artist couple David Hendler and Aviva Uri at the opening of an exhibition; a melancholy Nissim Aloni; as well as Uri Zvi Greenberg, S.Y. Agnon, Uri Lifshitz, Menashe Kadishman, Abba Eban, Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan and others.</p> \n<p>Other sections of the book contain photographs of theater and dance performances taken over a 20-year period; official events such as the transfer of Ze’ev Jabotinsky’s remains to burial in Israel in 1964, the Israel Defense Forces parade on Independence Day 1965, a forest-planting ceremony held to honor the memory of Israeli spy Eli Cohen, and Palestinian refugees with their personal belongings in 1967; and a chapter documenting the cultural and street life of Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Karavan and Sandhaus also curated the museum exhibition, which includes some 50 original prints prepared by Agor himself, as well as an additional selection of photographs screened sequentially on one of the walls of the display area.</p> \n<p>Agor photographed and recorded the work of many artists, including Karavan and Kadishman. “He was unusually generous,” attests Karavan. Usually he would do it without financial remuneration; perhaps the many paintings that covered the walls of his home were his reward.</p> \n<p>The exhibition is not accompanied by any text, while the book contains an article by photographer and researcher Guy Raz. In addition to Agor’s life story, Raz places his work for the first time in the context of both the local and international history of photography. His article is followed by a short piece by actor Shimon Lev-Ari, the executor of Agor’s estate; Lev-Ari’s text is almost identical to the citations from him in Raz’s article.</p> \n<p>“Agor joins a long list of photographers whose archives remained after their deaths like a negative for which no one has any use, in the silence of dark and forgotten rooms. These archives contain the history of everyday life, culture and photography on the local scene,” wrote Raz.</p> \n<p>In Agor’s case, immediately upon his death, his son donated his estate to the Israeli Documentation Center of the Performing Arts at Tel Aviv University, which until recently was run by Lev-Ari. Karavan says that Lev-Ari was also supposed to edit the book, but for health reasons was unable to do so and the task was given to photographer and artist Michal Heiman. Heiman was friendly with Agor and in 1991 curated an exhibition of his photos in the new gallery of the Camera Obscura School of Art in Tel Aviv, 32 years after his previous exhibition. For two years she worked on the book, but in the end her cooperation with Sandhaus and Karavan didn’t work out, and an article she prepared was not included.</p> \n<p>In lieu of words</p> \n<p>Like his father, Alex Agor never studied photography, but already at the age of 21, in 1969, he was sent to represent Israel at the Paris Biennale for Young Artists, along with Benni Efrat and Raffi Lavie. From there he went to London and very soon his photos were being published in The News of the World and Time Out magazine. Eventually, he settled in New York, where he began working in the fashion and advertising world. Agor once said of his son that at the age of 12, he “raced on his bicycle to photograph a lethal accident, photos of which appeared afterward in Haolam Hazeh, and at the age of 17 he had a cover and two pages in the Haaretz weekend supplement.”</p> \n<p>Alex Agor says today: “My father’s photography was something extraordinary. He never thought about himself, only about the object, the person in front of him and his character.</p> \n<p>He knew how to get at the inner self. So the photo would express, or in a way replace, the words. All his work is about people and life. That’s what I’ve tried to do too.”</p> \n<p>Did his father teach and encourage him? “At first he didn’t particularly encourage me,” replies the son. “He used to say that if I ever became a photographer, I would have to be better than he. He was a harsh critic. He would say, ‘That’s no good, go do it again.’ That helped me a great deal.”</p> \n<p>Although it is being shown at the Tel Aviv Museum, the exhibition “Yakov Agor: Photographer” is far from being of museum quality: On display are the original prints by Agor, and their quality does not flatter him. Sandhaus claims that the photos on display are of value because “Agor himself didn’t consider himself an artist, but rather a photographer.</p> \n<p>He didn’t preserve his work. Today it’s customary to make huge color prints, and here we have small black-and-white prints whose technical quality is nothing special, but with a photographic quality that is rarely seen today.”</p> \n<p>Heiman, who was familiar with Agor’s work methods, claims that the photos he printed in Poland before immigrating to Israel were far better. She gives a more complex description of the situation: “Picture a photographer who develops his films in heat and cold, rinses negatives in the same bathtub where the family bathed.” She says that this was common, but certainly was done out of constraint rather than choice.</p> \n<p>Goldfarb the poet</p> \n<p>Agor was born in 1911 in Rovno, Ukraine, with the name Yakov Goldfarb, and as a child moved to Danzig, then in Germany. When he was 12, his parents sent him to Palestine and he studied at the Reali School in Haifa and at Tel Aviv’s Gymnasia Herzliya. After three years, he returned to Danzig and finished high school, following which he went to study painting in Nuremberg, although thanks to his eldest brother, he had already discovered photography at the age of 8.</p> \n<p>During World War II he parted from his family, who had moved back to Poland, and began to wander. He arrived in Russia, worked at designing film sets in the Soviet Union and participated in the war as an officer in the Polish army. His family was killed in the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>After the war Agor found himself in Poland again. Thanks to the knowledge of cinema that he had acquired when working as a set designer, he was sent to Berlin in 1945 to purchase photographic equipment for the Polish National Film School in Lodz. Afterwards he began to work as a lab technician at a Polish photographic agency, before starting to do photography himself.</p> \n<p>He met his dancer wife, Helena, in Lodz, when she was still called Sarah Levkovich. During the war she changed her name to Helena Wolansky. In 1958, two years after Agor participated in the World Press Photo exhibition in Amsterdam, the family immigrated to Israel, straight to the Pardes Rubin transit camp. Alex, their only son, says that one of the reasons for immigrating was his mother’s fear for their lives as Jews in Poland.</p> \n<p>As a result of a meeting with a journalist at the daily Al Hamishmar, in 1959 Goldfarb-Agor had his first exhibition in Israel, at Beit Sokolov journalists’ headquarters in Tel Aviv. Uri Kesari wrote about the exhibition in Haaretz: “Mr. Goldfarb is a poet, and his camera becomes, inadvertently, a fount of inspiration and a wellspring of experiences. There is no question that he is an important artist.” He even compared him to photographer Helmar Larsky (whose work is now on display in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem).</p> \n<p>Incidentally, Goldfarb chose his Hebrew name in the wake of the currency change in Israel from the prutah to the agora. And throughout the years he worked as a photographer: From 1960 to 1962 for Haolam Hazeh and from 1963 to 1980 for Haaretz’s weekend supplement. At age 75, he retired and returned to drawing and painting.</p> \n<p>Agor was not interested in technique, he used a simple camera and refused to use a flash which lent his photos interesting plays between darkness and light and endowed them with a dramatic dimension that contributed greatly to his stage photographs. Some claimed that Paula Ben-Gurion was nice to him because she hated flashes.</p> \n<p>As a press photographer, too, he differed from his colleagues. As Esther Zandberg wrote about him: “Agor won’t catch anyone in a situation he finds uncomfortable .... Even when he worked for Haolam Hazeh, which specialized in catching people with their pants down, he had no urge to penetrate other people’s guts. For such assignments [editor] Uri Avnery sent other photographers.”</p> \n<p>A reverse photograph</p> \n<p>Although the exhibition and the book are a cause for rejoicing, they also arouse a sense of a missed opportunity. For one thing, we have to ask why there is only the article, by Guy Raz, and none by scholars of photography or other photographers who could have enriched the research about Agor, since we can reasonably assume that such an opportunity will not present itself again soon.</p> \n<p>One example of the gap between the considerations of a photographer and a photography researcher, on the one hand, and those of people like Dani Karavan and Shimon Sandhaus, both of whom knew Agor from the world of design, on the other, can be seen on the book jacket: a self-portrait of Agor that he took in a mirror, and which they decided to reverse so the cigarette would face the opening of the book.</p> \n<p>Another example appears in Heiman’s missing article. During her research in the archive she discovered new series of motifs in the photos. For example, a series of self-portraits with Agor holding the camera, sometimes with Helena and Alex; a series of war photos, including the start of Israel’s occupation of the territories, in 1967; a series with a “fish-eye” camera in which he focused on architecture and holy sites, and a series of quasi-panoramic photos. “I was very surprised to find them in the various cartons, one after another, until I understood that I had evidence of an important move here,” says Heiman.</p> \n<p>“It’s interesting to think of them in connection with the photos of Germany’s Andreas Gursky, Israel’s Barry Friedlander and others.”</p> \n<p>About a month after the death of his beloved wife, Agor “decided to shorten his life,” as Lev-Ari puts it, and left behind the following letter: “My friends! I wish you all peace and health, and am leaving because I’m unwilling to die in diapers, I love all of you, especially Alex and my close friends. Please excuse the handwriting, but I’m quite blind. I want to join Helena, and at my death I have donated my body to science. Yakov Agor 1996.”</p>",

        "text":["<p> My talk with Prof. Peter Sch&auml;fer, the new director of the Jewish Museum Berlin, goes on for more than two hours. We’re sitting in his office on the top floor of the museum, and he insists on speaking Hebrew. His language is accurate and coherent, but it’s clear he doesn’t use it often.</p> \n<p> He speaks slowly, chooses his words carefully and smiles when he can’t find the right one. But even when I suggest he switch to English for a tricky phrase, he refuses, thinks for a second and finds an alternative in Hebrew. It’s no secret he’s enjoying his chance to practice.</p> \n<p> Toward the end of our talk, Sch&auml;fer recalls with a smile how in 1964 he was a young student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p> \n<p> “I got a room in the student dorms and asked to have an Israeli roommate, a Hebrew speaker. I figured if I lived with an American student we’d speak English and I wouldn’t learn anything. But there was a problem. No Israeli students agreed to live with a German,” he says.</p> \n<p> “It was a different time. In the end, they told me: ‘We’ve found a solution. You’ll live with a Druze. His Hebrew is excellent.’ That’s how I met Rafik Halabi, who became a famous journalist and is now the head of the Daliat al-Carmel Regional Council. We’re friends, to this day.”</p> \n<p> When he sees the astonished look on my face, his smile grows especially large.</p> \n<p> During a short talk I had a few weeks later, Halabi enthusiastically confirms the story and sings endless praise for Sch&auml;fer and the years they spent together. He’s also quick to bring up memories of amusing cultural differences between him and Sch&auml;fer, who went to sleep every night in button-up pajamas, something considered odd in 1960s Israel.</p> \n<p> His appointment two months ago garnered lots of interest, both due to the institution’s status as a leading site in the German capital, and because of Sch&auml;fer’s presence itself. Throughout its 18-year history, the museum was run by its founder, Michael Blumenthal, a German-American economics professor and a U.S. secretary of the Treasury in the Carter administration.</p> \n<p> Sch&auml;fer, who isn’t Jewish and was born in 1943 in the Ruhr region, is an outstanding choice for many reasons. After completing a degree in religious studies at the University of Bonn, he spent three years studying Judaism and Semitic languages in Jerusalem. Later he earned a doctorate in philosophy and Judaism at Freiburg and Frankfurt.</p> \n<p> Until 1998 he worked as a Jewish-studies professor in Germany before taking a prestigious job at Princeton and living in the United States for 15 years. His English-language work “Judeophobia,” which has been published in Hebrew, addresses the way Jews and Judaism were seen by the Greeks and Romans. It identifies the sources of anti-Semitism in the ancient world.</p> \n<p> Later in his academic career, Sch&auml;fer became the only scholar to win both Germany’s prestigious Leibniz Prize and the Mellon Award, considered the highest honor in the United States for humanities scholars.</p> \n<p> Not a Holocaust museum</p> \n<p> Sch&auml;fer has no experience in museums or administration but says there’s a great similarity between his work as a Jewish-studies professor and directing the museum in Berlin.</p> \n<p> “My friends said I had gone crazy — what’s running a museum got to do with me? — but I think a professor who does good work passes his knowledge on to the community of students,” he says. “At the museum, we do exactly the same thing — with a much larger community. In both cases the most important thing is to fascinate the community.”</p> \n<p> Early in our talk, Sch&auml;fer explains how the museum is truly unique.</p> \n<p> It’s not a Jewish museum, but rather the national German museum for Judaism. The institution belongs to the federal government, and it’s completely independent, but its duty as a German institution is to present the history of Germany Jewry. In that regard it’s different from museums in Britain or the United States.</p> \n<p> “In the past, there was a magnificent community in Germany. There was a great deal of anti-Semitism, which launched the Holocaust. But that’s not the end of the story — it’s also important for us to present Judaism in Germany after World War II and the connection to Israel,” he says.</p> \n<p> “Our biggest department works to educate young people. A main aspect of our objective is to educate the German community and acquaint it with Judaism. That’s the only way to deal with new phenomena of anti-Semitism.”</p> \n<p> Later, Sch&auml;fer highlights his main point. “We’re not a Holocaust museum, and we don’t want to be. The Holocaust is an integral party of Jewish history in Germany, and everything we do is related to that,” he says.</p> \n<p> “As a German, I know full well that it doesn’t matter how old you are, that what happened more than 70 years ago in Germany is a part of your history, floating in the air like a cloud. It’s a shadow over Germans, and it’s important to know how to relate to it, to deal with it, because we will never get rid of it.”</p> \n<p> So what’s his explanation for the museum’s immense popularity?</p> \n<p> “The first reason is that many come to see the building itself, which is very famous. It’s magnetic. Architecture is a big thing in Berlin, and the museum building, designed by Daniel Libeskind, is an architectural fixture in the city,” he says.</p> \n<p> “The second reason is the visitors’ desire to learn about Germany’s new take on Judaism. They want to know how Germans see German Jewry’s past and future.”</p> \n<p> The museum building is a controversial subject. Sch&auml;fer recalls his first visit; he was excited and impressed by the large spaces. Then he makes a confession.</p> \n<p> “The building is very impressive but I can’t say I like it. It’s clear to me today that the building is not so suitable for our exhibitions,” he says.</p> \n<p> “This stands out especially in terms of our permanent exhibitions, where we haven’t managed, in my opinion, to fit in with the structure. It’s a huge challenge for us: adapting the contents to the architecture.”</p> \n<p> Mainz and Worms</p> \n<p> When asked about his plans for the museum, he’s full of ideas. His main objective is to renew the permanent exhibit. It’s time to make a change, he says, because it has been 14 years since the exhibit opened in 2001. (The building opened to visitors without exhibits three years earlier.)</p> \n<p> “The first thing we’ll do is shore up the exhibit on Ashkenazi Jewry in the Middle Ages. The large communities in Mainz and Worms are not sufficiently covered. During that period, the positive connection between Judaism and Christianity is evident,”&nbsp; Sch&auml;fer says.</p> \n<p> “I think it’s important to further highlight the changes caused by the Zionist movement’s rise in Germany, and to show its influence on Israel’s founding. It’s important to include more about what happened to German Jewry after the war, and to present the connection with the young Israelis who come to Berlin. Anti-Israelism often turns into anti-Semitism these days, and that’s troubling for us.”</p> \n<p> Aside from improving the permanent exhibits, Sch&auml;fer mentions his goal to include an exhibit on the Golem from Prague: “It was one of my most successful courses at Princeton, and I’m sure that there’s a basis for an exhibit — the Golem from the Bible to now, including movies, comics and countless stories. It’s fascinating.”</p> \n<p> Sch&auml;fer is definitely aware of the phenomenon of young Israelis moving to Berlin, and he provides a clear explanation.</p> \n<p> “Berlin, just like Tel Aviv, is a very young city that attracts young people. Yes, it sounds a little ironic to us, but think about it — Berliners are characterized by their chutzpah and humor; it makes them different from other Germans,” he says.</p> \n<p> “The culture, the art and the architecture attract young people from all over the world. Life here is easy and cheap, and clearly that’s part of the city’s international popularity.”</p> \n<p> Just before we part, Sch&auml;fer implores me to visit one of the museum’s temporary (until March 1) exhibits, “Snip it! Stances on Ritual Circumcision,” which focuses on circumcision as practiced by various cultures. He says the exhibit reflects the way he involves the museum in current affairs, as it has done since the debate on circumcision heated up in 2012.</p> \n<p> The exhibition presents the tradition of circumcision as practiced by Islam and other religions. The poster for the exhibit, the work of artist Harley Swedler, depicts three versions of a naked man with his genitals covered by a different flag in the shape of a map — one of Germany, one of Israel and one of Turkey.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Three years ago, Yitzhak Tshuva took to the stage at the high point of an investors’ conference organized by Phoenix insurance. The principal owner of Delek Group opened his remarks with the sheheheyanu blessing in celebration of a special occasion, telling the audience in a trembling voice: “Today is a holiday: Happy holiday to all the citizens of the State of Israel.”</p> \n<p>Noble Energy had recently released its initial estimates on the quantity of gas at the Leviathan site, the natural gas field discovered deep off the coastline of Haifa. “We can say confidently and wholeheartedly that the potential is tremendous,” said Tshuva. “Thanks to courage, sacrifice and willingness, we have attained tremendous achievements that will turn Israel into a powerful and large player in the international market. Full momentum needs to be sustained. This means geopolitical power for Israel, which needs it now more than ever.”</p> \n<p>Tshuva based these words on a report issued in mid-2010, when the partners in the gas field &shy;– Delek Group (45%), U.S.-based Noble Energy (40%) and Ratio Oil Exploration (15%) – declared that initial forecasts had proved correct and Leviathan was a commercial gas discovery on an international scale. The largest gas field discovered anywhere in the world over the past decade, Leviathan contained 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, nearly twice the quantity found in the neighboring Tamar field, plus a potential 600 million barrels of oil.</p> \n<p>Tshuva had every reason to celebrate at the time. The Tamar and Leviathan gas discoveries not only cemented his standing in the local economy, but also turned him into an energy player on a global level. They even managed to somewhat obscure the fact that, just two years before, in 2008, Tshuva began a debt-restructuring process for Delek Real Estate, another of his companies, which would result in bondholders taking a 50% haircut on their investments.</p> \n<p>The Leviathan discovery was also a momentous occasion for the Rotlevy and Landau families, the principal owners of Ratio. The two families were less known before the discovery, which thrust them onto the exclusive list of Israeli gas barons. Ratio, which until then was mostly built on pipe dreams, climbed to a company value of about 4 billion shekels ($1.14 billion).</p> \n<p>Ratio was founded in the early 1990s. In the span of 18 years, the company was a partner in 11 drillings, 10 of them coming out dry. Hundreds of millions of shekels of the public’s money went down the drain before the eagerly anticipated Leviathan discovery.</p> \n<p>“It’s a warm, wonderful feeling of satisfaction and, at the same time, a realization that it could have gone otherwise and ended up a bitter failure,” Yigal Landau, chairman of Ratio, told TheMarker shortly after the discovery.</p> \n<p>In nature, Leviathans (whales in Hebrew) take eight to 10 years to mature. As things now stand, the Leviathan belonging to Tshuva, Noble CEO Chuck Davidson, and the Landau and Rotlevy families will reach maturity at a similar age. Despite optimistic outlooks, Leviathan’s short life has so far turned out to be fraught with difficulties, and investors must be hoping it will do better in maturity than it has in its infancy.</p> \n<p>The field has spawned quite a number of controversies over the past three years, chalking up several impressive triumphs but also some bitter disappointments. Here are a few of them.</p> \n<p>Past Sheshinski, but still no plans</p> \n<p>The first challenge the Leviathan partners faced was the Sheshinski Committee, which studied the issue of taxing the output of natural gas. The discovery of gas deposits at Tamar and Leviathan apparently taught the partners that the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea contains gas reserves, and perhaps oil, on a big, global scale.</p> \n<p>This realization drove the gas companies into a stubborn and particularly intense battle over maintaining as large a share as possible of future gas revenues. The companies argued that the taxation of gas can’t be changed retroactively, and that increasing the tax rate could harm the development of gas deposits and even prevent other companies from coming to Israel.</p> \n<p>Slogging through a campaign drenched in capital, government influence and the social-justice protest, the partners navigated their way to the centers of power. They met with cabinet ministers and Knesset members, engaged lobbyists to appear at Knesset committee sessions, and made use of U.S. administration personnel.</p> \n<p>“It is legitimate for businessmen to look after their companies’ interests, but this campaign crossed red lines and, in place of freedom of expression, we had what seemed like an attempt to disrupt the capability for appropriate decision making in the State of Israel,” said then Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz, commenting on the campaign. “We are approaching the red line beyond which our ability to govern will be obstructed.”</p> \n<p>Despite the pressures applied to members of the Sheshinski Committee, parliamentarians and government ministers, the Knesset ratified an increase in royalties paid to the state in March 2011. The state’s share, it was determined, would reach 52% to 62% of revenues, similar to the situation in other countries where substantial natural resources have been discovered. The state’s share of Leviathan revenues are estimated to reach about 60%, as opposed to just 25% before the new legislation was adopted.</p> \n<p>Although over three years have elapsed since the discovery of gas at Leviathan, no organized plan has ever been completed or revealed for its development. Several open questions, such as an issue with antitrust authorities that was largely resolved last week and the volume slated for export, have prevented the partners from formulating a detailed plan encompassing a schedule, funding sources and operational decisions. The partners also never signed a contract for the sale of gas to the Israel Electric Corporation, so the completion of a development plan seems a long way off.</p> \n<p>Last June, the partnership presented the government with a preliminary plan that put the cost of developing the field for domestic purposes only at around $4.5 billion. This would cover the erecting of the drilling rig and laying down a pipeline to the shore, without taking into consideration any export capability. One of the main problems with completing the plan is choosing where to locate the gas terminal, amid protests by local groups against having it built on proposed sites within their vicinity.</p> \n<p>Noble Energy presented an updated outline for developing the field in a meeting with analysts last month, at a cost that has ballooned to $8.5 billion.</p> \n<p>This included three components: A system for transporting the gas to Israel; systems to transfer the gas to neighboring countries via underwater pipelines; and a sea-based platform for liquefying the gas and exporting it by ship.</p> \n<p>But the outline wasn’t detailed enough to include all the implications and costs of developing the field. Delek Group even issued a disclaimer afterward, noting: “A plan and budget for developing Leviathan have not yet been approved, and at this stage a projected timetable for formulating and carrying out the field’s development plan can’t be established.”</p> \n<p>Exports still a long way off</p> \n<p>Anyone who thought the Sheshinski Committee would be the last time the companies and state came to blows was mistaken. In October 2011, after it became clear that the quantity of gas off Israel’s shoreline will probably exceed the local economy’s needs for the next two generations, the question came up of whether to allow gas exports – and, if so, to what extent. Another committee, this one headed by Energy and Water Resources Ministry director-general Shaul Zemach, was set up to answer this question.</p> \n<p>In its final report, presented in August 2012, the committee recommended exporting 53% of Israel’s offshore gas. The cabinet, by a big margin, decided to accept the recommendations, but only after barring exports from the Tamar field – thereby lowering the overall percentage earmarked for export to 40%.</p> \n<p>The government’s approval set off a storm of protest. Social organizations and Knesset members went to court to revoke the decision, arguing that the government didn’t have the authority to settle such a fateful question for all of Israel’s citizens for generations to come.</p> \n<p>In October 2013, two years after the Zemach Committee was established, the court rejected the petitions, putting an end to one of the main obstacles standing in the way of developing Leviathan.</p> \n<p>But immediately afterward, it was the minority partners in the Tamar field – Isramco and Dor Alon – who petitioned the Supreme Court on the basis of wrongful discrimination against Tamar as opposed to Leviathan. The matter is still before the court.</p> \n<p>The decision on gas exports has helped the Leviathan partnership, but several key issues still remain unresolved. For example, the destination for exports still hasn’t been determined, or whether the gas will be transported overseas through pipelines or shipped in a liquefied form. Also, no agreements have yet been signed with companies or neighboring countries, except for a small contract signed several weeks ago with the Palestinian Authority.</p> \n<p>The Australian energy giant Woodside Petroleum specializes in technology for producing liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export. In December 2012, the Leviathan partnership signed an agreement in principle for Woodside to acquire 30% of the rights to Leviathan for about $1.5 billion. The plan was to build a floating facility for converting the gas into LNG, to be shipped by tanker to remote destinations throughout the world.</p> \n<p>But much has changed since that agreement was inked. The thaw in relations between Israel and Turkey, as well as a change of regime in Egypt, presented the Leviathan investors with new possibilities. The primary option now under consideration is exporting the gas through an underwater pipeline directly to Turkey. It can also be exported to Egypt, where gas is urgently needed, or piped to a facility on Cypriot soil that Delek Group and Noble Energy have a hand in building, for export to Europe.</p> \n<p>The Leviathan partners are, therefore, trying to amend their understanding with Woodside, asking for a higher price in consideration for the new alternatives that have opened up. At this point they haven’t decided which way to go and will likely choose more than one option. The bottom line is that any significant commercial agreements still seem a long way off.</p> \n<p>Escalating estimates</p> \n<p>Aside from the legal and bureaucratic hitches, Leviathan investors have also enjoyed some good news since the discovery. Last May, shortly before the government approved the Zemach Committee recommendations, the estimated quantity of gas in the field was raised from 17 trillion cubic feet to 19 TCF, with the estimated range of general reserves updated to between 15 and 24 TCF.</p> \n<p>The new figures were based on analysis of the results for the Leviathan 4 confirmation drilling that was completed two months earlier. Just the increase itself is equivalent to the Tethys Sea deposits that supplied Israel’s gas needs for a decade until 2012, and is considered worth 2 billion shekels.</p> \n<p>The estimated condensate – raw material for the production of Brent crude, which sells for around $100 per barrel – also increased from 22 million barrels to 34 million barrels. This factor contributed another potential 3.5 billion shekels boost to the value of the Leviathan field.</p> \n<p>And that’s not all. In January 2012, the partnership estimated the potential presence of 600 million barrels of oil in underlying strata at a probability of 24%. Last July, this potential quantity was updated by Noble Energy to 1.5 billion barrels, an amount that could supply Israel’s needs for 15 years.</p> \n<p>Early on, while findings from the initial drilling for gas were being analyzed, the partners also decided to check for oil by drilling 6,500 meters under the surface. Noble Energy went to work, building a rig in South Korea capable of reaching a depth of 12 kilometers. Originally planned for the end of 2013, the drilling was put off until well into 2014, after the new rig has performed a two-month test run.</p> \n<p>But that was just the first delay. Noble has now rescheduled the drilling, at an estimated cost of $200 million, for the beginning of 2015, due to the prolonged export-approval process and absence of a clear development plan. Furthermore, Woodside had committed to investing $250 million in developing the field, which was meant to go toward covering the exploratory drilling costs, but its agreement to participate in the project hasn’t yet been finalized.</p> \n<p>How much is Leviathan actually worth?</p> \n<p>Another major problem hanging over the partnership since the Leviathan gas discovery has been with the antitrust authorities. Antitrust Commissioner David Gilo declared that the partnership between Delek Group and Noble Energy constitutes a monopolistic restraint of trade in the natural gas market, due to their parallel holdings in the Tamar field as well as in the smaller Karish and Tanin offshore exploratory sites.</p> \n<p>Last Tuesday, Gilo agreed to rescind his earlier ruling on condition that the two companies divest their natural gas interests in Karish and Tanin. The compromise agreement, as well as the resolution of several more minor antitrust issues expected in the coming weeks, should pave the way for Woodside to finally come fully on board and assume its stake in Leviathan, while diluting the other partners.</p> \n<p>There is likely no clear-cut answer to the question on many investors’ minds as to how much the Leviathan field is really worth. Last month, IBI Investment House energy analyst Gil Bashan placed its current value at $6.9 billion. At the same time, Bashan put a $13.5 billion value on the neighboring Tamar field already in production. The lower valuation for Leviathan, despite being twice as large, is attributable to the risks involved along the way toward its complete development.</p> \n<p>UBS Investment Bank analyst Roni Biron put Leviathan’s value at $6.7 billion last October, explaining that the court’s rejection of petitions asking to ban the export of Israeli natural gas lowered the field’s risk profile. He also stressed that his pricing model took into consideration the risk factors surrounding the field’s development.</p> \n<p>Psagot Investment House analyst Noam Pinko provided several possibilities for valuing Leviathan based on various scenarios, rather than specifying a single figure. For example, he put the value of the field at $8 billion in the event of regional exports at $8 per unit, but only $4.5 billion if exports were to be achieved through the process of producing LNG.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In a book soon to be published in a Hebrew translation, Nassim Nicholas Taleb presents his theory of “antifragility,” which emphasizes the need for the capacity to transform crises, losses and decline into achievements and also breakthroughs.</p> \n<p>Taleb, a professor of risk engineering at NYU and a former hedge fund manager, has more than the average man's understanding of what it means to capitalize on risky business. But some of what he expounds on his book &quot;Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder,&quot; were already known in classical Chinese statecraft from the Warrior States period, approximately between 475 and 221 BCE, when the linguistic symbol for “crisis” emerged which means, according to most interpretations, both “danger” and “opportunity.” Thus, the paradox of the resurgence of Germany and Japan after their total defeat in World War II is explained as a result of an extreme crisis which destroyed the status quo and enabled radical renewal. Such a metamorphosis, the theory goes, would be impossible without a shock to the system.</p> \n<p>To make sense of this, the human mind depends on concepts and theories. Therefore the invention of the concept “antifragility” adds an important layer to our comprehension of complex situations and how people cope with them. This applies fully to critical Israeli predicaments, including political-security ones.</p> \n<p>Israel’s political-security situation includes three main dimensions, each aggravating the another: (1) Complacency by most of the public, together with skepticism on the peace process, resulting from the current &quot;good&quot; situation mixed with frustration from the results of disengagement from the Gaza Strip; (2) a political system which is “a house divided against itself,” to quote Abraham Lincoln, with many illusions and signs of fundamentalism in the “right” and “left,” which produce a vicious cycle in the peace process; (3) signs of approaching grave political-security crises, with very serious national security and socioeconomic repercussions.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Israel dithers in the face of dangerous trends across the Middle East. These include persistent hostility towards the very existence of Israel, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, tendencies towards fanaticism, the likelihood of a third Intifada, the multiplication of failed and disintegrating states, and the strengthening of terror groups. Add to this list the rejection of Israel’s policy in Western countries with the likelihood of semi-sanctions hovering on the horizon, and doubts about the future involvement of the United States on Israel's side.</p> \n<p>Let me illustrate a number of more or less predictable crises produced by a combination of these factors: growing economic and political pressure by Europe, with quiet support by the United States; increasing missile attacks on Israel; escalating cyber-warfare by unidentifiable actors; an agreement with Tehran that leaves Israel exposed to an Iranian nuclear weapon, with a stern US warning to Israel not to act against the agreement; deterioration of capacities to govern in Egypt undermining the peace agreement with and leaving Sinai to extreme Islamists; disintegration of Syria with radical actors dominating parts of it; advanced weapons transfers to Hezbollah; and additional, even worse possibilities which it would be inappropriate to specify.</p> \n<p>Israel can undoubtedly cope with these possibilities, but at a high cost. The crises currently facing Israel may undermine both of the two key dogmas: “We must keep all of the Land of Israel” and “An agreement with the Palestinians assures peace.”</p> \n<p>Antifragility teaches us that we must search for and develop options for utilizing these crises for advancing Israel’s long-term ability to survive and thrive. Antifragility thinking provides a variety of such opportunities, such as utilizing threats and aggression against Israel for counter-attacks, changing for the better Israel’s overall geo-strategic situation. We can use antifragility to help us in building relations with actors who have parallel interests with Israel, and in using Israel's crises and the ongoing upheaval across the region for a comprehensive Israeli peace initiative which will significantly improve its global standing, safeguard relations with Europe and reinforce the Israel's special relationship with the US. This will help shift the dynamics of the Arab-Israeli conflict in a better direction. A number of other factors help push things toward a solution: weariness with suffering and bloodshed, international incentives and pressure.</p> \n<p>To be added, on a higher level of antifragility, is the possibility of using political-security crises for realizing reforms in education and the economy. These have long been on Israel's priority list but seem impossible without a serious crisis to shake up the tyranny of the status quo.</p> \n<p>Our various political-security crises can also be used for realizing reforms in education and the economy, which have been necessary for years, but apparently aren't feasible without a serious crisis shaking up the tyranny of the status quo.</p> \n<p>All this does not imply that crises should be sought. But when facing prolonged decline, a controlled &quot;crisis instigation&quot; should not be rejected outright as a way to turn things around, despite the risks. The staff of various branches of the Israeli government must engage in antifragility-type preparation, studying ways to utilize crises thrown at the country. I doubt if such essential thinking has been adequately undertaken by any of the government's assessment and planning units, or by the politicians in charge of making critical choices.</p> \n<p>-- The author’s new book, &quot;Avant-Garde Politician: Leaders for Metamorphosing Humanity,&quot; will be published in April.</p>",

        "text":["<p> The Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design is tightening security following two incidents of a racist nature at the veteran Jerusalem school. The new security measures were announced in a letter sent Thursday to students by the academy's president, Prof. Eva Illouz, who also warned that disciplinary action would be taken if such incidents recurred.</p> \n<p> In the first case, the words “price tag” were written on the desk of an Arab woman student. The second case took the form of a response to the work of a third-year student in visual communication.</p> \n<p> Within the framework of a course on art and current events, the student filled a room at the academy with balloons in the colors of the Palestinian flag – green, black, red and white. In the center of the room she placed a stand with pins in blue and white, the colors of the Israeli flag, and invited the other students to burst the balloons using the blue and white pins.</p> \n<p> In reaction, the right-wing news site, 0404 News, wrote: “Do you get it? We are the bombers, we are the attackers. We are the bad ones and they are the good onesSimply disgusting.”</p> \n<p> The next day, a graduate of Bezalel who lives in a West Bank settlement spray-painted “death to Jews,” on a wall near the doorway of the room along with his phone number. Academy staff said the man wanted to define his graffiti as a “work of art.” The inscription was immediately removed and the man was summoned by the police for questioning. He was released shortly thereafter; no charges were brought.</p> \n<p> “I would like to make clear in no uncertain terms that the Bezalel administration vehemently condemns extreme expressions and rudeness toward populations that are a part of the public in Israel, calls to violence, sedition and incitement to racism against any person,” Illouz wrote in a statement aimed at calming down the atmosphere.</p> \n<p> “Any student, lecturer or employee of the academy who is found responsible for incitement, damage to property, verbal or physical threat or direct harm, will be brought up on disciplinary charges. We must all behave responsibly, show sensitivity, report any unusual incidents and not allow the extremist minority among us to drag us to violent escalation.”</p> \n<p> Bezalel student union chairman Tomer Laszlo said in response to the incidents: “The Bezalel student union views freedom of expression as very important and artistic activity in keeping with the boundaries of democracy and the standards set by the academy as a supreme value. Nevertheless, the organization condemns any attempt at incitement and provocation that are not within the framework of artistic activity.”</p> \n<p> Laszlo said there was a clear difference between the student’s work with the balloons and pins, which had a sharp political message, and the response to it. The art project was not a provocation, he said. It was created as part of an academic course.</p> \n<p> “The graffiti exceeded these boundaries because its goal is to incite and provoke, and we want to convey that there is still a sane majority in Jerusalem,” he added.</p> \n<p> Laszlo said that the day after the incident, and with the permission of the head of the visual communication department, students filled a room with blue and white balloons, which he called “an example of a response within the boundaries of the [accepted] debate.”</p> \n<p> Referring to recent violence in Jerusalem, Laszlo noted that “the atmosphere was leaking into the walls of Bezalel,” and called on students to work to “maintain the legitimate framework of discourse.”</p> \n<p> Laszlo also said that recently the feeling of personal safety in Jerusalem, particularly on Mount Scopus, where Bezalel is located, has been severely compromised, and the students have therefore asked for more security around the campus – for example, to be allowed to bring their cars into its premises in the evening.</p> \n<p> Bezalel’s spokesman’s office told Haaretz that Bezalel students “enjoyed studies in a pluralistic place that encourages freedom of expression, and welcome references to social, cultural and political issues can be seen in their work. However, in the context of recent events in Jerusalem, there have been various remarks made at Bezalel as well that are not legitimate and compromise human dignity.”</p>",

        "text":["<p> Here’s an idea for the intrepid reveler: This year, beyond celebrating one of Judaism’s happiest holidays by lighting candles, binging on sufganiyot and engaging gifts, why not head out on the road to discover the real roots of the holiday!</p> \n<p> Hanukkah marks the prevailing of the Hasmonean dynasty, originating with the High Priest Mattathias, over the Hellenists - Greek Syrians who defiled the Temple in Jerusalem and sought to stamp out Judaism in their drive to Hellenize the empire. This 2nd century BCE clash of civilizations was acted out throughout Israel, just a short chariot drive from home.</p> \n<p> Here are six ideas for Hanukkah exploration, ranging from the geohistorical to the gastronomic.</p> \n<p> 1. Matthias' home town, maybe</p> \n<p> One of Israel’s fastest growing cities is Modi’in, named for Mattathias’ home town, which was allegedly somewhere in the vicinity. But where exactly? Perhaps it was Khirbet Umm al-Umdan, discovered in a salvage dig in 2001 but only now opened to the public,in a neighborhood of modern Mod’in. The archaeologists Alexander Onn and Shlomit Wexler-Bdolah found a late 2nd century BCE village that includes residential homes and alleyways; a round building that may have been a watchtower; wine presses and water cisterns; a ritual bath; and a synagogue that is one of the oldest in the world. Make your way to Modi’in, park at the lot on Reuven Street (don’t ask me, ask Waze) and walk down the footpath.</p> \n<p> 2. Watching giant turtles and thinking of empire: Nahal Alexander</p> \n<p> You may say that watching the enormous soft-shelled turtles frolicking in the clean waters of the Alexander stream, a formerly polluted wasteland, does not seem like a quintessential Hanukkah activity. But then consider the namesake of this 32-kilometer long waterway, which wends its way from the Samarian heights near Nablus to the Mediterranean Sea at Michmoret, north of Netanya. Alexander Yannai, great-grandson of Mattathias and one of the more bloodthirsty Hasmonean kings, conquered the coastal area to the north of the stream and expanded the Jewish kingdom, not shying from massacring his fellow Jews. It is comforting to visit this now-tranquil area and to realize that the noble, primordial turtles have outlasted and outclassed the warmongering Yannai, also known as Alexander Jannaeus, about whom Chabad writes &quot;The circumstances are surely tragic when the day a Jewish king dies is declared to be a holiday.&quot;&nbsp; You can easily access Nahal Alexander via either of two exits on Route 4, at the Ruppin or HaOgen junctions.</p> \n<p> 3. Tel Maresha: Get down and dirty</p> \n<p> Archaeology is the science of revealing the material culture of past civilizations. What better way to spend a few hours of your Hanukkah vacation than to get your hands dirty finding ancient pottery, coins and everyday objects in an actual excavation that takes place in an underground manmade cavern? Somewhat ironically, the dead culture you will be digging up is that of the Hellenistic Edomites who lived at Maresha (15 minutes south of 20th century Beit Shemesh). So who won? Us or them? Archaeological Seminars, the private company that operates the dig, can be reached at office@archesem.com or +972-2-5862011. The experience lasts about three hours, and includes an unforgettable cave crawl.</p> \n<p> 4. Tel Kedesh: If you can find it</p> \n<p> When Judah Maccabee fell in battle, he was succeeded as leader of the revolt by his younger brother Jonathan, who went on to win a decisive battle against the Seleucid king Demetrius near this Roman city. Kedesh is one of the lesser-known gems in northern Israel, and to ensure that that remains the case, it is entirely devoid of tourism infrastructure – no signage, no information sheet, and no trash bins, either. It’s a mess. But that shouldn’t detract from the pleasures of discovering exquisite sarcophagi, mausoleums and one of Israel’s few Roman temples. The Roman ruins of Kedesh lie at the foot of an immense tel that begs additional excavation, though with Lebanon a couple of hundred meters away, the tel might be begging a while longer. If you go, prepare in advance for your quest: Google “Kedesh Roman city temple” and print out some informational literature. It is located along Route 899 on the road to Kibbutz Malkiya.</p> \n<p> 5. The Banias, home of dancing goats</p> \n<p> While up north, visit this beautiful bastion of Hellenism: spectacular ruins of the Greek temples tucked into the cliff face at Banias, an ancient city named for the resident demigod-of-choice, the half-man/half-goat Pan. Hellenistic paganism reached absurd heights here: See the odeon where the local faithful were entertained by – and worshiped – a troupe of dancing goats. And if you have an hour to spare, hike over to the “suspended trail” that cantilevers over Nahal Banias, the easternmost tributary of the Jordan River. This is also the place where the Syrian Greeks (the Seleucids) defeated the Egyptian Greeks (the Ptolemaids) in a decisive battle that put Antiochus and his dynasty into the driver's seat in israel, leading 30 years later to the Jewish Revolt.</p> \n<p> 6. Levinsky Market: Flavors of Hanukkah  Strangely, some readers couldn't care less about the clash of civilizations between Jews and Greeks, and are driven mainly by their salivary glands. For them, we recommend a Hanukkah-week visit to the Levinsky Market in southern Tel Aviv. It is a little known fact that in spite of their avowed abhorrence of all things Greek, Mattathias and his sons would often make furtive sorties to Pinso or Eema for their exquisite Grecian cheese bourekas.</p> \n<p> And this is a boureka.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A 2,700-year-old seal impression bearing the name of the bible-era king Hezekiah has been discovered in excavations by Temple Mount in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Other seals bearing the name of King Hezekiah (727–698 BCE) have been discovered. Not like this, though: &quot;This is the first time that a seal impression of an Israelite or Judean king has ever come to light in a scientific archaeological excavation,&quot; stated Eilat Mazar of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>The oval impression on the clay seal, which was most likely set in a ring, states in ancient Hebrew script: &quot;Belonging to Hezekiah [son of] Ahaz king of Judah.&quot; It also shows a two-winged sun, with wings turned downward, flanked by two ankh symbols symbolizing life.</p> \n<p>The symbols indicate that the seal was created late in the king's life and shows Assyrian influence, surmises Mazar.</p> \n<p>Though a Judean king, Hezekiah was a vassal of Assyria. He is however portrayed both in ancient Assyrian chronicles and in the bible (Kings II, Isaiah, and Chronicles II) as a resourceful man who maintained the independent standing of the Judean kingdom and its capital Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Late in Hezekiah's life, both the royal administrative authority and the king's personal symbols changed from the winged scarab, a symbol of power and rule throughout the ancient Near East, to that of the winged sun—a motif that proclaimed God's protection, that was employed by the Assyrian kings, including Sennacherib.</p> \n<p>The pagan royal administrative symbol imprinted on the king's jars changed to adopt the motif of a sun with wings extended to the sides. King Hezekiah's personal symbol changed to a sun with sheltering wings turned down - and a life-symbol at the end of each wing, says the archaeological team.</p> \n<p>This addition of the life symbol bolsters a theory that the king's personal seal was changed after he recovered from a life-threatening plague, shehin, described in II Kings 20:1-8, in around 704 BCE. &quot;In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live&quot; He did, though.</p> \n<p>Found in the Ophel</p> \n<p>The small inscribed clay bulla, measuring just 13 by 12 millimeters, was found during excavations of the area known as the Ophel, at the foot of the southern wall of the Temple Mount. The dig is being conducted by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem’s Institute of Archaeology, under the direction of Dr. Eilat Mazar.</p> \n<p>The bulla was discovered in a refuse dump dating to the time of King Hezekiah or shortly after, says Mazar. It would have originated in the royal building next to the dump, which apparently served to store food. The bulla was found together with 33 additional bullae imprinted from other seals, some bearing Hebrew names, their reverse showing marks of coarse fabric and thick cords that may have sealed sacks containing foods.</p> \n<p>The impression was found while wet-sifting earth from the excavation in a sifting facility directed by Dr. Gabriel Barkai and Zachi Dvira, under the auspices of the Nature and Parks Authority and the Ir David Foundation. The bulla was discovered by Efrat Greenwald, a member of the Ophel expedition, who supervised the wet-sifting of the excavation material. Reut Ben-Aryeh, who prepared the Hebrew bullae from the Ophel excavations for publication, was the first to identify it as a seal impression of King Hezekiah. Students and alumni of Herbert W. Armstrong College from Edmond, Oklahoma participated in the excavation.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s been 20 years and one month since Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination. I’m 37 years old – I was 17 and in high school in Philadelphia when he was killed.</p> \n<p>As a teenage dual citizen in the 1990s, the American side of me felt like I was born in the wrong decade. I watched footage of the anti-Vietnam War protests and the civil rights movement. I listened to the Grateful Dead and read Allen Ginsberg, but I largely missed the boat on that era in the United States. But the Israeli side of me, the side bred out of Zionist pioneers from Poland who were socialists and idealists, was living the peace movement dream: Oslo gained momentum and our leaders promised that peace was just around the corner.</p> \n<p>The ’90s were the formative years of my political identity, and the emotional content of that time was about a connection to something paradigm-shifting and positive happening on the ground in Israel – to the peace movement, to a peace that was just around the corner, and to hope for a better future.</p> \n<p>I might be the last generation to come of age politically in a time when one’s emotional relationship to Israel was defined by hope. I want to argue that this emotional backdrop is what allows me to see a new moment for Israel now, one I never would have seen if not for that emotional “muscle memory.” Today, perhaps the only authentic connection to Israel for young Diaspora Jews is to a new progressive movement for equality, an end to the occupation, and social justice.</p> \n<p>American Jews younger than 30 don’t remember the ’90s. They became politically aware after Rabin’s assassination, after Oslo crumbled, as the second intifada was getting started. We can analyze those events – project what might have been, pontificate. But I want to highlight the emotional shift that took place after 1995. The Israeli peace movement was shell-shocked. It was not a hopeful, mobilizing picture. Its emotional content was heartbroken.</p> \n<p>And things got worse. People who are now in their mid-twenties came of age politically in the early 2000s – when Israel was responding to the second intifada by placing Palestinians under curfew, administrative detention, checkpoints. The emotional content of that is about fear and guilt – people that age do not feel connected and hopeful about Israel. Nothing good is right around the corner. They feel the fear of bus bombings and feel implicated in what Israel is doing to stop them.</p> \n<p>Then comes the West Bank separation barrier, the disengagement from Gaza. Rockets and bombs.</p> \n<p>Liberal Jews who graduated from college in the last year or two have a relationship to Israel that developed during or after Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009 – where the conflict plays out on the world stage as Israel bombs the homes of civilian families and what’s being reported is 95 percent support from the Israeli public. These liberal Jewish onlookers feel ashamed and do not want to be associated with actions that seem so far away from the critical thinking and humanist values they were raised on. That is the emotional backdrop during their formative political years.</p> \n<p>From my conversations with young Jews on college campuses, I can see that these Americans are critical of many of the actions of the United States in its War on Terror, and on racism toward black people and Muslims back home. They cannot, and they will not, apply a different system of values when they discuss Israel. I am not suggesting they should; I am suggesting a different emotional backdrop might be possible.</p> \n<p>Love stronger than any romance</p> \n<p>I moved to Israel 12 years ago. Despite the fact that I felt conflicted about some of what Israel was doing, I had within me the deep-rooted hope that defined my formative years. The reality had changed, but my emotional backdrop hadn’t. And I fell in love. It was a love stronger than any romance.</p> \n<p>I met attorney Michael Sfard, who told me about his work defending Palestinians in Israeli courts as part of a group of human rights organizations that emerged after the second intifada. He convinced me to go on a tour of Hebron with former Israeli soldiers who had served in the occupied territories and tell the stories of their service publicly, breaking through long-standing myths about the Israeli military. I met Yehuda Shaul of Breaking the Silence.</p> \n<p>Right after Operation Cast Lead, I met an Israeli journalist, Noam Sheizaf, who wanted to internationalize the conversation about Israel by bringing together English-language bloggers to offer a true window into the progressive conversation on the ground – something that was so clearly missing.</p> \n<p>In 2011, I saw 500,000 Israelis demanding social justice and then I met Lia Nirgad, who used that moment of social protest to capture the energy of fellow Israelis and the appetite for engagement in the political and civic process that was ignited that summer.</p> \n<p>Again, we can analyze, we can project, we can pontificate about the merits, the missteps, the authenticity of these new leaders, these ideas and strategies. But most important to me is that we reclaim that emotional space – that story. I had it easy. On the one hand, I experienced the heartbreak of Rabin’s assassination and the aftermath. But on the other, I remember what the ’90s felt like. People younger than me don’t have that emotional muscle memory. For them, it’s all bad news.</p> \n<p>As individuals outside of Israel, if we miss out on the stories of these fierce new change-makers, we miss out on the most authentic opportunity for connection. We have been missing out on those opportunities for too long. As institutions, supporting the progressive movement in Israel is the only way we will actually engage young liberals, by shifting the emotional backdrop of their formative experiences. This means using all of the tools we have to meet and know a growing community of progressive advocates, journalists and politicians that need our help and support, and whose work and vision we need, too – for our heads and our hearts.</p> \n<p>The writer is the vice president for strategy of the New Israel Fund and cofounder of ZAZIM-Community Action.

        "text":["<p>Twelve years separate the Tel Aviv Jazz Festival debut of Duo Ras Dashen and its performance at this year’s festival. The show in 2003, which I attended with no prior knowledge of the duo, was one of the most moving jazz performances I had ever seen. It was the first time I heard the great Abate Berihun play and sing, and it was also my first exposure to the wonderful sounds of Ethiopian jazz. The combination of that sound, played amazingly by Berihun, and the touches of contemporary-classical-chamber pianist Yitzhak Yedid were hair-raising. This was musical grace, just like the debut album released by Ras Dashen shortly after that festival.</p> \n<p>After a hiatus of almost 10 years, Berihun and Yedid recently resumed their creative partnership. They recorded their second album together, which is due to drop in a few months, and this weekend performed at the festival where they began. It was clear that they had no chance of approaching that thrilling experience; some things can only happen once. Yet the hope was that their reunion would produce an excellent, exciting performance.</p> \n<p>There were pockets of beauty and moving moments, especially when Yedid elicited a cloud of delicate notes from his piano and when Berihun improvised on his saxophone or sang, but they were all too rare. In between, there was none of the beautiful blending of different worlds that is the foundation of Ras Dashen’s music. The Ethiopian and the classical-modern elements did not merge into a deep and poetic whole, Yedid’s playing was occasionally overly stiff and the title piece, “Ve’ahavta” (“you shall love”), was truly disappointing. In presenting it, Yedid joked that it resembled their “big schlager,” the lovely “Bahititu Kadus Kadus,” but in fact it was more like a superficial patchwork of gospel rhythms, Ethiopian sounds and a Bible verse sung in Amharic and English. Did my nostalgia for the unrepeatable past cause me to judge this piece too severely? Possibly. It would be interesting to hear what people hearing Ras Dashen for the first time thought.</p> \n<p>Persistence pays off</p> \n<p>After hearing the J.D. Allen Trio on Thursday, someone said, “They didn’t play free jazz.” There was a note of surprise in his voice, perhaps because the performance had been billed as a tribute to the titan of free jazz, Ornette Coleman, who died in June. The concert began with Coleman’s most famous piece, “Lonely Woman,” but overall it was far from being a salute to Coleman. There wasn’t even the slightest connection between Allen’s music and the Coleman legacy: not in sound, not in style and not in repertoire.</p> \n<p>Tenor saxophonist Allen and his partners, the bassist Greg August and the drummer Rudy Royston, indeed did not play free jazz, at least not as it’s usually understood. So what did they play? That’s a good question. It’s easier to say what else, other than free jazz, they didn’t play. Their music wasn’t typical contemporary mainstream jazz, with clear harmonies and a flexible yet defined rhythm. It didn’t fall on any clear or recognized part of the spectrum between free jazz and mainstream contemporary.</p> \n<p>More precisely, their music landed on several places along this spectrum, taking care not to get locked into any one of them and moving between styles in a frenzied manner. Heated and energetic half-free jazz, cutting to some kind of instrumental rhythm and blues, then breaking to a relaxed and elegant ballad, switching suddenly to clever and witty jazz served with iced water.</p> \n<p>Every time you thought you understood what was going on, the music shifted, drawing another question mark. It was deceptive, and for the first half hour of the performance there was an impression that despite the high quality of Allen and his companions, their constant movement among different approaches testified to a lack of commitment and maybe even to the absence of a unique sound.</p> \n<p>However, as the show went on, what at first seemed like a lack of commitment began to develop into a clear and committed artistic choice.</p> \n<p>Perhaps this is the way to play jazz in the post-genre era: constantly switching between genres, hoping that the timing of the cuts and the switches and the way in which the puzzle is arranged will yield a human sound.</p> \n<p>Allen and his partners exhibited another fundamental principle of playing contemporary jazz, an empowered performance of a trio that works on an equal footing. A jazz trio as a more or less equitable unit, as opposed to a soloist and accompanying musicians, has been a recognized format for more than 50 years. When an ensemble realizes this option in a faithful and completely organic manner (especially in the case of an ensemble with a wind instrument, in which the hierarchy between the lead player and the accompanists is often maintained), it’s a delight to listen to. Royston’s octopus-like drumming and August’s meaty bass set the agenda no less than Allen.</p> \n<p>When the festival’s artistic director Barak Weiss introduced the trio he said that he had been trying for years to bring Allen “and this ensemble” to Israel. His persistence paid off.</p>",

        "text":["<p>JTA - The so-called “Kate Middleton effect” — by which anything the Duchess of Cambridge wears becomes an instant best-seller — seems to know no bounds.</p> \n<p>She has graced the covers of countless magazines; entire blogs are devoted to what she wears. And, as it happens, the duchess is the perfect style icon for observant Jewish women.</p> \n<p>“She’s modest, demure and modern,” says Adi Heyman, founder of the fashion blog Fabologie.</p> \n<p>So it’s perhaps no surprise that one of Middleton’s signature style pieces — the fascinator — has caught on as a head covering in synagogues on this side of the pond.</p> \n<p>In case you’re wondering, fascinators are headpieces attached to the head by clip or headband. They’re often ornate and are typically smaller — or at least cover less hair — than hats. And it’s not only the Duchess of Cambridge who’s made them fashionable.</p> \n<p>Sarah Jessica Parker also helped popularize the style when she donned one that looked like a garden (with monarch butterflies, to boot) to the London premiere of the “Sex and the City” movie, Lady Gaga’s been spotted in fascinators, and the headwear selections of several guests at Middleton’s 2011 wedding to Prince William set social media abuzz. (Post-wedding, sales of fascinators reportedly climbed 300 percent — so much so that an inevitable backlash is underway.)</p> \n<p>But for observant women, fascinators offer a fashionable take on a rule in the Mishnah Berurah — a 19th-century commentary on the Shulchan Aruch, a Jewish code of law — that forbids any blessing or prayers to be said in the presence of a married woman with her hair uncovered.</p> \n<p>Today, some fashion-forward Jewish women now wear fascinators in place of a hat or lace doily during services at synagogue.</p> \n<p>“It’s always great when Jewish law and fashion can coexist,” says Allison Josephs, the Orthodox founder of the website Jew in the City. “Fashion is one of the ways observant Jewish culture can grab pieces of larger culture, and women don’t have to feel cut off.”</p> \n<p>More observant women wear fascinators atop their wigs.</p> \n<p>“Women who wear wigs aren’t going to replace one with a fascinator, but they’ll add it,” Josephs adds. “It’s a fun accessory.”</p> \n<p>Bella Basaleli, who owns Bella’s Hats and runs hat parties in the New York metropolitan area, says nearly half the headpieces she sells are fascinators.</p> \n<p>For women in the more liberal modern Orthodox synagogues, they’re a trendy alternative for those moving away from wearing the more traditional hats.</p> \n<p>“A lot of these girls wouldn’t wear anything otherwise,” Basaleli says.</p> \n<p>Most of Basaleli’s fascinators cost $40 to $120. She decided to start her business after paying “way too much” for a fascinator for her son’s bar mitzvah at a boutique on Long Island two years ago.</p> \n<p>“I wanted headwear that was different than what I would normally wear to shul,” she says. “As it was a special occasion, I decided to wear a fascinator. Fascinators were becoming very trendy at our shul, and it was the first time I had ever bought one.”</p> \n<p>Leah Zweihorn wears fascinators to her modern Orthodox synagogue in Queens with some regularity (when she first married, Zweihorn covered her hair all the time; now she only does it at synagogue). At a recent family wedding, she picked a fascinator to match her dress.</p> \n<p>“They’re just more fun than hats,” Zweihorn says. “Also, I find it harder to talk to people — especially in a crowded room — with a hat, since it blocks some of my view. But even more significantly, many of them come down over my ears and it’s harder to hear.”</p> \n<p>Zweihorn gets plenty of attention when she wears a fascinator, she says, and at shul she tends to opt for larger ones that cover more hair.</p> \n<p>“My husband feels strongly about women covering their hair in shul, so I like to wear something a little bit more substantial,” she says.</p> \n<p>Indeed, not all synagogues or rabbis agree on the legitimacy of the fascinator as a head covering. Some synagogues in England — where fascinators have enjoyed long-running popularity, even prior to the ‘Kate effect’ — explicitly state the headwear is not permitted.</p> \n<p>For example, the website at the Borehamwood and Elstree Synagogue, just outside London, states: “All Jewish married ladies must wear a hat or other head covering (not just a ‘fascinator’) while in the Synagogue.”</p> \n<p>But Rabbi Benjamin Skydell of Congregation Orach Chaim, a modern Orthodox synagogue in Manhattan, explains that a fascinator — even one on the smaller side — may be entirely kosher. The passages in the Talmud that deal with the standards of hair covering mention little about how much hair must be covered, he says. There’s even discussion as to whether wearing just a basket on one’s head is enough (remember, women way back when carried baskets).</p> \n<p>“A fascinator may very well fit the minimum requirement,” Skydell says.</p> \n<p>But the rabbi also recognizes that many women who wear fascinators to synagogue are less concerned about the Talmudic rules and see it more as a fashionable take on a long-held tradition.</p> \n<p>“For a lot of modern Orthodox women, it’s a vestige of the past,” he says of these women covering their heads in shul.</p> \n<p>For women in Conservative congregations, the emergence of fascinators is a sign of changing times. Johanna Ginsberg, who attends an egalitarian synagogue in New Jersey, says she’s seen them pop up in in recent years. She even held a hat party earlier this year where fascinators were among the pieces for sale.</p> \n<p>“Older women in the Conservative community carry more baggage when it comes to head covering,” she says. “They see hats as anti-feminist and prefer to wear kippot,” which were traditionally seen as a necessity for men only, not women.</p> \n<p>“But the younger women don’t feel the way because they haven’t had to confront this issue. Many of those women like hats and fascinators because they feel more feminine than the kippah.”</p> \n<p>One downside to the look has absolutely nothing to do with modesty.</p> \n<p>“It’s potchky,” Zweihorn admits, using the Yiddish expression to mean time-intensive.</p> \n<p>Rather than a hat, which can be plopped on your head and fix a bad hair day, a fascinator requires perfect placement.</p> \n<p>“I don’t like it to look like I’m wearing a headband, so I need to cover the band with my hair,” she explains. “It takes more time.”</p> \n<p>The end result, though, is worth the trouble.</p> \n<p>“They’re fun to wear,” Zweihorn says, “and I fully intend on expanding my collection.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Esther Werdiger, 28, from Jerusalem, flying to New York</p> \n<p>What’s that on your bag?</p> \n<p>It’s a comic strip I draw, “The League of Ordinary Ladies,” and I had it printed on the bag.</p> \n<p>Where is your accent from?</p> \n<p>I live in Israel but I’ve been offered a job in New York, which I think I’ll take, and in any event I am originally from Australia. I am making this trip for my brother’s wedding, in California.</p> \n<p>Wait, slow down a bit.</p> \n<p>First of all, my little brother is getting married in California. But I can’t go to the United States without passing through New York. I once lived there and worked as a nanny on the Upper West Side, and I am thinking about returning because I got this job offer. Anyway, I am going for a few weeks and I rented out my apartment in Nahlaot [a Jerusalem neighborhood].</p> \n<p>How long have you lived in Israel?</p> \n<p>Three and a half years. It wasn’t planned, it just happened. I came to Israel when I was 18 for a year and a half at a yeshiva. I was in a Chabad class in Kiryat Malakhi, of all places. After that I was in Safed, which is a total vacuum. There are a lot of crazies there, which freaked me out a little. Then I went back to Australia and was an architecture student, but I left and went to New York. It’s hard to get along there without a work permit, and in the end my parents came to take me back to finish my degree in Australia, and somehow I got here again.</p> \n<p>So you are religious?</p> \n<p>Orthodox “lite.” I observe Shabbat and keep kosher. My family is ultra-Orthodox; I have six brothers and sisters. My mother wears a wig [as required of married women under Jewish law], and I only started wearing jeans two years ago. Oof, I hope my father doesn’t read this and get angry.</p> \n<p>I didn’t know there is a Jewish community in Australia.</p> \n<p>Most of the Jews in Australia arrived [there] after the Holocaust. There is also a Chabad community, but Chabad is everywhere. One of my grandfathers arrived before the Holocaust and lost his whole family in Europe. My great-grandfather, who was from a Hasidic family in communist Russia, was sent to Melbourne by the Lubavitcher Rebbe.</p> \n<p>What do you do?</p> \n<p>I work free-lance in marketing, editing and managing social networks, but my work does not define me. I draw comic strips.</p> \n<p>Where can I read your comics?</p> \n<p>It’s a series that I’ve been publishing for a year on a New York site called The Hairpin, and it’s mostly about my life, sort of from a self-deprecatory angle. For example, how sad it is to date a guy who has really beautiful sisters. Or why it is that fate is cruel to you and hints that you have to go on a diet just before your brother’s wedding thanks to a juice-making machine that your roommate just bought.</p> \n<p>How did you hook up with the site?</p> \n<p>At first I sent them articles, which they didn’t really like. Then I sent comic strips and they liked that, and I also really enjoyed doing them. I’ve been drawing all my life.</p> \n<p>Would you like to publish a book?</p> \n<p>Very much. But it was explained to me that if no one knows you, you need a strong story to connect the whole book, and I am not aiming at that. There are people who know how to make money with their skills. Unfortunately, you can’t make a cent from all the things I really like to do. To my credit, it also has to be said that they don’t cost anything either: It’s just a pen, regular paper and me. I aim low. I have no expectations.</p> \n<p>Why not?</p> \n<p>Things happen to people because they are ready to work very hard. And it’s frightening to want something really badly when you are only 20-plus. Wanting something makes you so vulnerable that maybe you should just let things happen. You know, the site doesn’t pay me, but I get a lot of referrals because of it. It’s just like what happened to me now with Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>What happened?</p> \n<p>It took me a long time to get to like Jerusalem. At first, all I wanted was to be in New York. But now that I feel good here and have friends and am enjoying myself, I get this job offer in New York. That’s the way it is. It’s like when I was looking for shoes for my brother’s wedding. The minute you find great shoes you have to buy them: The opportunity to wear them will come eventually. You mustn’t be afraid.</p> \n<p>Are you afraid?</p> \n<p>It’s scary to start everything fresh. I am not married. It’s a problem for my family that I am not married at my age. I always tell my mother that statistically there is nothing to worry about. I’m not so special. If so many people got married, so will I.</p> \n<p>So even the Australian Jews are “Polish”?</p> \n<p>One time my mother got dressed beautifully to go out and put on makeup. She had also had her hair done that week, and when she put on the wig I told her, “Mom, your hair is so lovely under the wig, it’s upsetting that people don’t see it.” She turned around to me and said, “If you marry a goy, I am not coming to the wedding.”</p> \n<p>Barbara Hobi, 22; Isabelle Waldwann, 23; Larissa Bieli, 23; Vanja Gudalo, 21; Patrick M. 23; Yvonne Knoepfel, 27; and Fabienne Lang, 25 – all students, arriving from Zurich</p> \n<p>Hello, you look like a jolly group. Who are you?</p> \n<p>Lang: We are a group of Swiss students who have come to Israel on a study tour.</p> \n<p>Who organized it?</p> \n<p>I did, through an organization called Initiative for Intercultural Learning. A friend of mine, a Swiss woman who has been living in Ramle for seven months and has visited here a few times, knows that I am interested in Israel and asked me to help her organize the tour. We have a very full schedule of two weeks with 12 participants. Would you like to see the itinerary?</p> \n<p>Does the organization subsidize the trip?</p> \n<p>No. The students pay for it themselves.</p> \n<p>And they get university credit?</p> \n<p>No.</p> \n<p>So you chose to come here instead of vacationing in Costa Rica?</p> \n<p>Bieli: Costa Rica is boring.</p> \n<p>What do you expect to get out of the trip?</p> \n<p>Peter M.: Eyeglasses that will make it possible for us to get a perspective on the local culture.</p> \n<p>Waldwann: To visit a hospital in Bethlehem and see what the difference is between the situation here and in Switzerland.</p> \n<p>Knoepfel: To understand both sides and their approach to the conflict.</p> \n<p>I’m afraid there are a lot more than two approaches.</p> \n<p>Gudalo: I wanted to get to know the Israeli culture. Israel appears very often in the news in Switzerland, but I wanted to get a picture of my own.Lang: It’s something else when you meet with locals. We will meet with students from Al-Quds University, we will be hosted by families from Bethlehem, there is a lecture by an Israeli professor. The organization behind us specializes in study trips of this kind. There are also trips to Jordan and Croatia.</p> \n<p>It sounds a little like the exoticism of war and the Third World.</p> \n<p>Lang: Sorry?</p> \n<p>Usually, when people from Germany or Switzerland come here they want to learn about the conflict and not about Israel, and they mostly have worked out an orderly political doctrine even before they land. Look at your itinerary: You have a workshop only with students from Al-Quds University.</p> \n<p>Lang: That is only because no one from the Hebrew University replied when we tried to coordinate with them, and in any event that is definitely not the intention. We had a previous meeting in the Israeli Embassy in Switzerland. It’s true that we will visit Hebron and a refugee village and Bir Zeit University, and that in Ramallah we have a meeting guided by TIPH [Temporary International Presence in Hebron, a civilian observer mission] − but that is not all we will do. We will also visit Yad Vashem, Masada, the Dead Sea and Sderot, and meet representatives of the foreign workers. We also will have a lecture by [history Prof.] Moshe Zimmermann on the challenges facing Israeli society.</p> \n<p>It still sounds to me like a tour that is focused on the conflict.</p> \n<p>Lang: I admit that I am somewhat political, and there is no doubt that in Switzerland the coverage is pro-Palestinian, but I always try to see both sides.</p> \n<p>To be neutral.</p> \n<p>Bieli: It’s not simple to be neutral − it’s always simpler to look at the conflict from one side.</p> \n<p>Lang: It’s a lot easier to be militant. It is not easy to admit that you have no opinion, that you don’t know what to do and that maybe you are wrong.</p> \n<p>Gudalo: It is disrespectful to take a stand if you don’t know enough or understand enough to have one.</p> \n<p>Lang: We are also trying to talk about other central issues for Israel: the social protest movement, the problems between the Orthodox and the secular, and the economy, which actually looks quite developed.</p> \n<p>Really?</p> \n<p>Yes. Look what’s happening in other countries in the region. Not to mention the euro crisis that is now attacking Europe. It is very interesting to contemplate its implications for Israel. There might be political tension between Israel and Switzerland, but economically the relations are wonderful.</p> \n<p>You think so?</p> \n<p>I don’t know whether Israel loves Switzerland so much, even though the nice guy in passport control said to me jokingly, “Ah, chocolate, ah, Bahnhofstrasse.” And now, can I ask you something?</p> \n<p>Sure.</p> \n<p>We were told we should go for drinks this evening to the Minzar. Where is that?</p>",

        "text":["<p>A wave of soft and not so soft moans emerges from the basement of the spectacular Regency Building in San Francisco. About 1,000 people, most of whom met only a few minutes before, are arranged in pairs. The women lie on yoga mattresses as closely packed as possible, unclothed from the waist down. Men, who are dressed (and a few women) lean over them, gently stroking their genitals.</p> \n<p>It goes on for precisely 15 minutes. There is no climax. At the end of this time they thank each other and share their feelings about the activity. There may be further interaction among the couples, romantic or sexual, but at this point everyone goes their own way.</p> \n<p>This is called orgasmic meditation. The venue is the first global conference of OneTaste, a movement which aims to spread this practice and bring it into the daily life of as many people as possible around the world.</p> \n<p>The movement believes the key to a happy life is in orgasm, not only of a sexual nature, but both professional and social. Proponents believe that orgasms should be part of our daily life, and they should be treated as essential food for the body. Among the people at the Regency conference are high-tech professionals from Silicon Valley, attorneys from Europe, and even curious Australians.</p> \n<p>The ages vary, and include seniors, but the conference attendees are mainly white people in their 30s. They have each paid between $400 to $800 dollars to take part in the three-day event (journalists pay a discounted rate of $200), which includes instruction, guest lecturers and group &quot;orgasmic meditation' exercises.</p> \n<p>OneTaste was founded about 10 years ago but has only really taken off in the past year. The organization has undergone a change in recent years to become a commercial entity, which offers training for its coaches, a closed social networking platform (at a fee, of course) and, in the American spirit, a wide array of merchandise.</p> \n<p>The goddess of the organization is Nicole Daedone, 45, a star of TED lectures and author of the book “Slow Sex,” who began developing orgasmic meditation 20 years ago.</p> \n<p>Her main obstacle in spreading her doctrine was when she started out, in her hometown of San Francisco - already bursting with New Age, self-help ideas and closed communities that somehow always seem to have connotations of nudity and sex as part of their philosophy.</p> \n<p>The way she started the organization - as a home with a closed community in which 40 men and women lived and practiced the meditation daily - saw her branded her as yet another guru providing another seemingly risky illusion. It all raised suspicions of cult activity. The crowded living conditions in the house, with 12 people to a room; claims that Daedone interfered in the lives of couples who were members of the group; and nude daily yoga sessions did nothing to contribute to a positive image.</p> \n<p>But that is all ancient history now. The movement’s communal homes – there are nine worldwide – now offer private rooms and comfortable quarters.</p> \n<p>Daedone, who concedes that the practice has the potential to become a cult, decided not to live in one of the houses, after she felt that the members of the group treated her like a guru.</p> \n<p>OneTaste began focusing on orgasmic mediation only in recent years. Before, Daedone’s main work lay in training coaches and sexual therapists, and meditation was simply an aid.</p> \n<p>With tens of thousands of adherents worldwide, efficient training program and sessions, a business plan and an international vision, this is a flourishing business in every sense. Daedone, whether she wanted it or not, is still a guru, with more followers than ever.</p> \n<p>Despite her captivating lightness and her sharp sense of humor - obvious in almost everything she does - she walks around the conference with a personal bodyguard. Perhaps she has no choice.</p> \n<p>A reading exercise</p> \n<p>We enter a session. To take part in orgasmic meditation exercises, you have to undergo training. Usually it’s a half day’s work, but here they offer an abbreviated 90-minute session. Instruction is given by Master Stroker Ken Blackman, the movement’s senior instructor with 15 years’ experience. He has developed a short explanation of the essence of orgasm, explaining that men reach climax and then lose interest, whereas women have 10 or more vibrations.</p> \n<p>Before he moves on to the practical part of the class, he presents one iron-clad rule: orgasmic meditation is not sex, because you wouldn’t have sex with someone you’ve just met or are not attracted to.</p> \n<p>“Would you like OM?” is the right way to address a potential partner. There is to be no persuasion, no begging and no tempting offers. “I’d be glad to,” or “No, thank you” are the responses. “No” means no.</p> \n<p>The meditation takes a specific form that must not be changed. The woman removes her undergarments and lies on a mattress. The man (or another woman) leans over her diagonally with his or her legs stretched out. The session begins by massaging the inner legs, with the man describing out loud the woman’s genitals. Then the man puts on a glove, puts a bit of lubricant on it, and begins the actual massage.</p> \n<p>The thumb of one hand is placed on the lower part of the woman’s genitals and the forefinger touches the clitoris gently. The rhythm, extent and location of the massage are unchangeable. After precisely 15 minutes the stroking stops, the area is covered with a towel and pressure is applied with the palm of the hand for a few seconds. Feelings are shared and goodbyes are said.</p> \n<p>Daedone, who developed this doctrine from experience and exercises to which she was exposed over the years, says the most important thing is to maintain the regular framework of the meditation. She says the goal of orgasmic meditation is to connect people by the man knowing how to read the woman’s genitals.</p> \n<p>Graduates of the abbreviated course receive a bracelet, which grants them entrance to the basement where the group orgasmic mediation exercises are being held.</p> \n<p>It is announced that the next group exercise will begin in a few minutes, and this is the time to find a partner if you don’t already have one. There are 100 OneTaste followers and instructors at the conference. They provide physical, emotional and administrative support. Every one of them is greatly needed, especially when it comes to the emotional aspect. There is also a psychologist on hand if needed.</p> \n<p>At the end of another wave of moans, everyone moves into the main room, where a dance party is starting - the kind that develops where different age groups are present. Afterward, Daedone takes to the stage. Here she is treated like a true guru. Cheers go on for several minutes before she can begin talking. It seems like everyone is in ecstasy from her very presence.</p> \n<p>The high point of the event is a live demonstration of orgasmic meditation by Daedone on one of the female instructors. The sense was that a mystical ceremony was underway in the room, with Daedone herself seeming to enter an ecstatic state.</p> \n<p>The Israeli connection</p> \n<p>Daedone studied linguistics at university and was an artist. At age 27 she was shocked by her father’s death from cancer in prison, where he was serving a sentence for sexual harassment of two minor girls. Daedone tried to overcome her trauma through Buddhism, and joined a Zen community where she first learned about orgasmic meditation, which she enhanced.</p> \n<p>There’s an Israeli connection, too. Daedone says one of her sources of inspiration is the kibbutz, and she thinks the idea of everyone living together and connected to each other is very wise.</p> \n<p>She’s not Jewish, she says, but she has a rabbi, who was at the conference the previous day. She notes that there are many things about Judaism that she loves, and that many Orthodox Jews practice OM regularly. She said the movement has started in Israel and she really wants to visit.</p> \n<p>Rachel Cherwitz, 33, from New York, is the chief sales person for OneTaste and instructs the Orthodox community in Brooklyn about the movement. About 10 years ago, she lived in Israel for two years as an ultra-Orthodox Jew. She says there are dozens of Orthodox and religious people practicing OM regularly, including rabbis - the only difference being that the Orthodox practitioners are married and do it with each other.</p> \n<p>Avraham Taylor, 36, a married father of four daughters from Tekoa, is the unofficial representative of OneTaste in Israel. A psychologist by profession, he works with at-risk youth.</p> \n<p>Three years ago&nbsp;Taylor discovered the movement through Cherwitz, whom he met when she lived in Israel. He decided to take an instructor’s course, which takes a year and costs $16,000. The course is mainly online, with two group meetings in San Francisco.</p> \n<p>Taylor, who comes from a religious family but is now secular, says he always wanted to study sexuality and Daedone’s approach seemed the most suitable, because it dealt with the less discussed aspects of the matter.</p> \n<p>“I’ve had it with the fact that sexuality is always underground, especially for religious people. What broke me was the case of Rabbi Moti Elon,” he said, referring to the recent case in which Elon, a prominent figure in the Orthodox world and beyond, was convicted on two counts of indecent assault on a minor.</p> \n<p>After that case, Taylor said, he understood that the definitions of modesty in the Orthodox community were no longer suitable. Daedone, he says, “treats sex not only as a physical act, but sexuality as a gateway to all the other things in life.”</p> \n<p>Taylor is not giving instruction on a regular basis. “I’m not sure that group OM circles will be suitable here,” he says. “I want to do something that has an obligation to the culture and tradition, and Nicole and the team know this and allow me this,” he says.</p> \n<p>“Lots of people ask me why I make this complicated and don’t open a center in Tel Aviv, where lots of people would be glad to practice this method the way it is,&quot; he continues. &quot;But I don’t want to be pushed into other places because of this; I want to give this gift to as many people as possible.”</p> \n<p>When asked to explain what the gift is, Taylor says he thinks it’s “the most powerful tool to deal with loneliness of all kinds. People are suffering very much from loneliness, and it creates the ability to communicate, sexual openness and psychological tranquillity. It’s very challenging from the point of view of the couple, to look at sexuality with open eyes.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>What if Mordechai “Moti” Elon had been acquitted, rather than having been convicted of forcible sexual assault? Would he still have the privilege of being called “rabbi?” Would it still be appropriate to consider him among “the most important Zionist rabbis?” Or would he be thought of as having a serious mental disorder?</p> \n<p>But sometimes psychopathy is taken for charisma: the choked-up voice, the ingratiating mumble, the nodding, the bleary eyes – all topped off with a touching melody.</p> \n<p>Religious Zionism should have cast him out long ago. He could have been judged without a trial. But they don’t air their dirty prayer shawls in public.</p> \n<p>A few years ago Elon said: “Exposure to any sexual tendencies is the source of all impurity. Why, morally and socially speaking, is it in our power to forbid relations with animals? If he could, he would do it with his goat as well, and then he’d want [government social benefits] for young couples, and then they’d request to legally adopt a goat kid. He’d bring the goat to [school] parents’ meetings, too.”</p> \n<p>So much ignorance, prejudice, fear and above all baseless hatred. In this day and age, that is how one becomes “an important rabbi.” Didn’t this man have a reputation as a lover of humanity? At least until the pedophilic demon was exposed. Putin would be glad to appoint him chief rabbi of Moscow, which has become the new Tehran. Elon meets all the criteria – and no Turkel-shmerkel committee could stand in his way.</p> \n<p>Know this: Every time a politician, with or without a kippa, local or otherwise, goes after homosexuality (goring like a billy goat), fornicating skeletons are later found in his closet.</p> \n<p>It’s a litmus test, in which the sperm are destroyed by exposure to the acid of homophobia.</p> \n<p>And this is what happens to every society that separates schoolchildren on the basis of X or Y chromosomes. When one’s instincts are tortured and suppressed – this is how they break free. Instinct will defeat its oppressors on their home courts – their mosques, their synagogues and their churches. The merciful become horny, and they are forced to count sheep in heat, as they lay in bed at night and try to lull themselves to sleep.</p> \n<p>Goats, Israel, are the threat at the city gates – and the reason for Elon’s holy war. And one doesn’t look too closely in times of trouble: massage therapy, sexual therapy, naked rebelliousness – all methods are kosher, as long as they can be practiced discreetly, behind the curtain of the Torah ark.</p> \n<p>The one who needed therapy became the therapist – and many confused pupils became bound to their teacher by their awe, and perhaps also by tefillin straps. For too long the religious Zionist movement has stalled in its attempts to eradicate the evil from the Torah authority, and now it is ashamed and bitter. Perhaps they fear that the whole garden will be thrown out with the weeds?</p> \n<p>The Catholic example is nothing to envy. Catholicism is also dark in its ways – opposing abortions, condoms and same-sex marriage. Catholicism too, hides pedophiles in its confession booths. Regardless, they have their Pope Francis to declare “who am I to judge homosexuals” – and we have our teachers, comparing homosexual relations with bestiality. When the Pope washes the feet of the poor, no one fears that he enjoys it too much.</p> \n<p>All of religious Zionism’s eyes were on Moti; he’s not just some psychopath. Before the expose, and the trial, many looked upon him as the Messiah himself – and some still do, in spite of it all. Only the twisted and terrified imagination of the prophet can know what the Messiah does with his donkey when he sneaks off to Migdal on its back.</p>",

Yet it is a story that stresses the lengths to which Israel must go in order to confront the reality of sexual abuse.</p> \n<p>It is time for us, as a humane, empathetic society, to learn from the American Jewish community how we should expose this affront to our humanity.</p> \n<p>In 1994, a seven-year-old innocent girl named Megan Kanka was raped and murdered by a predatory neighbor in suburban New Jersey. Unbeknown to Megan’s parents, the neighbor, who had been previously convicted of sexually assaulting minors, had lured Megan into his home. After rightfully sparking national outrage, the heartbreaking case inspired Megan’s Law and subsequent U.S. legislation, which created a national sex offender registry and community notification to end these tragic crimes.</p> \n<p>We have no equivalent for Megan’s Law in Israel, though this is not because we have no Megans. Since 2009, the Israel Prison Service has reported that 1,300 individuals have been imprisoned for sexual abuse, with no information as to how many prior offenders have been released. Considering that the same report revealed that sixty percent of abusers had victimized children younger than thirteen, I most sincerely regret how irresponsible our society has been to tackle these injustices. We must first create the same kind of offenders’ registry.</p> \n<p>As a citizen of the Jewish state, I have come to realise that the Jewish community operates under the illusion that the reality of sexual violence is a uniquely foreign one. Rape, abuse, and harassment are all evils that belong solely to the outside. Thus we see the shock, the resistance and the victim-shaming within our community that manifests itself when such cruelties come to light.</p> \n<p>For a few months now, a tense security situation has threatened Israeli civilians with terror and panic. As a proud mother and Jew, it is a sad day when I must admit that, for years, we have masked another monstrous form of terror with our indifference. Regrettably, we must accept the call to battle the terror within.</p> \n<p>In light of the American Jewish community’s campaign against sexual abuse, I hope to improve the Israeli response in the public sphere and beyond. In 2014, allegations surfaced&nbsp;that the longstanding rabbi of a prominent Washington, D.C. synagogue, Barry Freundel, had exploited his position to harass women seeking conversion under his auspices. Almost immediately, his community responded by ousting Freundel&nbsp;and the Rabbinical Council of America joined&nbsp;by instituting a new internal committee to review the conversion process.</p> \n<p>More recently, I welcomed news from my dear friend Rabba Dr. Anat Sharbat that the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, a leading American &nbsp;Orthodox synagogue, had established an ethics commission to anticipate and prevent abuse in the future.</p> \n<p>With much admiration, I have begun to see the emergence of a similar model within the Israeli community. Given the complexities of living within tight-knit Israeli religious communities, it is crucial that victims have access to safe, in-house organizations that bring abusers to justice in a legal, culturally mindful fashion.</p> \n<p>In promoting this developing campaign, I applaud Takana, a forum for male and female religious leaders to mobilize the community&nbsp;to act against flagrant abuse. Several years ago, Takana surged into the national spotlight when it exposed the abusive history of an influential Jerusalem rabbi, Moti Elon. It saw through the case until Elon’s conviction on one count of sexual assault of a minor in 2013,&nbsp;Takana was appalled by the light sentence administered, one that dismissed jail time in favor of community service and a negligible fine.</p> \n<p>Along with the pain and trauma that still exist, I was horrified to learn that Israel has prolonged this disgrace on its own. Only weeks ago did I discover that Elon was featured at numerous events funded by the state. Sickened, I immediately demanded that Interior Minister Silvan Shalom divert government — public — funds from any event featuring Elon. This episode pinpoints how the Israeli response to abuse has been too little to prevent injustice in the future and too late for those irreparably harmed in the past.</p> \n<p>As both a country and a community, we, as leaders of a state founded upon Jewish and humane values, must decide to represent the victims of the most chilling side of human nature. In America, I have seen the courage to call out evil as it is, and there is no reason Israel cannot do the same.</p> \n<p>New Jersey to Jerusalem, from little Megan to Moti’s victims, I and those beside me must fight for those to be the last names we hear in this terrible tale.</p> \n<p>Aliza Lavie is a member of Knesset for Yesh Atid and a Member of the Knesset Committee on the Status of Women and Gender Equality.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Around the turn of the millennium, I received an email from a party looking to create a film script about a first century Jewish sage teaching in Aramaic. Since my PhD was in Aramaic, and Semitic languages are an area of expertise, would I be interested? It aroused my curiosity, so I wrote back with a question: Since Jewish teachers in the first century tended to use Hebrew, why would the filmmakers want an Aramaic script? I received a short response that this film script was about Jesus, as if that was enough said. I declined their offer.</p> \n<p>Last week’s news controversy over Jesus’ language, sparked by the exchange between Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu and the pope, brings to light how an Aramaic-only speaking Jesus has been enshrined within the academy and society at large. Elon Gilad’s Haaretz article “What language did Jesus speak?” is a prime example.</p> \n<p>Gilad starts his case by quoting John 20:16 where Mary Magdalene addresses Jesus as Rabbouni, “my master, my teacher.” Since the Hebrew word rabbi is widely known by specialists and the common reader alike, the assumption is made that rabbouni cannot be Hebrew and must be Aramaic. But the gospel writer called the word Hebrew, not Aramaic, and he was correct. Rabbouni is, in fact, excellent Mishnaic Hebrew. It is attested in Codex Kaufmann of Mishna Ta`anit 3.8. Mistaken conclusions like Gilad’s are perpetuated by wrong assumptions which lead to wrong expectations. A century of Israeli Mishnaic Hebrew scholarship has laid the foundation for a different perspective.</p> \n<p>Three backdrops to the language situation of Judea and the Galilee in the first century should actually reverse the expectations regarding Jesus and his languages: The colloquial nature of Mishnaic Hebrew, the anachronistic and foreign character of the Aramaic Targum translations, and the exclusivity of Hebrew in story parables.</p> \n<p>A common fallacy presents Hebrew usage in first century Judea and the Galilee as a strictly sacred, literary language, comparable to Latin in Medieval Europe. The notion that both Hebrew and Latin were monolithic is erroneous. During the Second Temple period, Hebrew had developed into two social dialects. The high register was a literary dialect used for prestigious communication, known today as “Late Biblical Hebrew,” the language of books like Ezra and Nehemia and much of the Qumran writings. The low register can be seen in works like the Copper Scroll from Qumran Cave 3, and in various papyri, graffiti, and inscriptions from the Second Temple period, as well as the tannaitic and amoraic writings of rabbinic literature. Already in 1908, M.H. Segal had pointed out to the scholarly world that Mishnaic Hebrew showed the marks of the internal development of a colloquial language - it was definitely not an artificial usage by a scholarly elite.</p> \n<p>Secondly, it is argued that first century Judean and Galilean Jews needed a translation of the Hebrew Bible, the Aramaic Targums. The argument runs that the existence of the Aramaic Targums must mean that the people did not know Hebrew. However, the Targums served an interpretive interest beyond simple translation, a commentary that elucidated and expanded the plain text. Also, although many Aramaic writings are found among the Qumran community’s scrolls, except for the foreign (imported) Job and a potential text for a pilgrimage holiday, there is no Aramaic Bible. The Targum traditions that we have stem from the 2nd and 3rd century C.E. At this point in time, a widespread, first-century Aramaic Targum practice in Israel remains speculation and the evidence available, meager though it is, actually points away from such an assumption.</p> \n<p>Parables are the third piece of the linguistic puzzle. Certain Jewish literary genres were always in Hebrew, one of which was the rabbinic story parable. In rabbinic literature, even within Aramaic contexts, the story parable was always given in Hebrew. The potential connection with Jesus is obvious, since Jesus, too, is frequently characterized as someone who taught the populace in parables. The parable genre was used for making a point that could be readily grasped by all levels of society. They were a popular literary genre, not “highbrow” or “elitist.”</p> \n<p>Archaeology has also been heralded as decisive evidence in the Aramaic-only Jesus. According to Gilad: “In the Galilee, where Jesus lived, Aramaic had taken over by the time Jesus was born. In the south, in Judea, archaeological evidence shows that some pockets of Hebrew still remained during the first century C.E.” This is ironic. The real problem is that we have virtually no archaeological evidence for first century Semitic (Aramaic or Hebrew) languages in the Galilee. We do have Galilean names found in the south, and they are Hebrew!</p> \n<p>All of the above is to point out that there are strong evidences that support the prime minister's comments on Jesus. Yes, in all probability Jesus did teach in Hebrew. Contra Gilad, Bibi's father, a historian, could be proud of his son. However, the pope countered that Jesus spoke Aramaic. He, too, is partially correct. The Gospel of Mark records at least two utterances in Aramaic, both in private healing accounts, Mark 5:41 and 7:34.</p> \n<p>The problem arises when people try to push the issue into exclusivity, either one language or the other. This reaches the most problematic point on the words of the cross: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matt 27:46, Mark 15:34). It is probable that Matthew's transliteration reflects the original form of the story, and that Mark is the one who has edited the sounds. Matthew appears to have Jesus referring to Psalm 22 either in Mishnaic Hebrew, or a mixed language, while Mark has Jesus speaking fully in Aramaic, similarly to the two healing accounts mentioned above. In any case, a few statements in Aramaic do not prove its exclusivity.</p> \n<p>It is no longer questioned nor considered a viable option that only Aramaic was a colloquial language in the land in the first century. Hebrew was also a colloquial language and a candidate for any teaching with Jewish audiences throughout the land, and may be the primary candidate for such teaching. As for a mother tongue, we simply do not know enough to speak about any particular family situation anywhere in the country.</p> \n<p>Why is there such an emphasis on an Aramaic-only Jesus? What is the sub-text that unifies many of those who suggest that Jesus taught in Aramaic? If Jewish teachers tended to use Hebrew in the first century, then a Jesus that teaches in Aramaic can be portrayed as “non-Jewish” or “less-Jewish.” Some will be comfortable with that. Historically, many Christians have wanted to emphasize a universal (and non-Jewish) orientation for the Church and an Aramaic-teaching Jesus fit that role model. Ironically, the same motive might have been comforting within a Jewish context: Jesus is not one of “our Jewish teachers” and incidentally, he did not even teach in our language. Both sides could miss the real Jesus.</p> \n<p>A Hebrew and Aramaic-speaking Jesus challenges long-held misconceptions. And even if we disagree, Netanyahu and the pope demonstrated that we can begin discussing these issues amicably.</p> \n<p>Randall Buth, PhD, is Director of the Biblical Language Center and a member of the Jerusalem School for Synoptic Research, a consortium of Christian and Jewish scholars who collaborate in studying Jesus and the Gospels.

        "text":["<p>During the last two weeks anti-Semitism in Turkey has surged. Many of its citizens blur their criticism of the Israeli attack on Gaza with outright condemnation of Jews. Even if this trend is not unique to Turkey, the level of hate speech directed at Jews has hit dangerous levels, leaving many to even question the future of the 17,000-strong local Jewish community. In fact, open threats have been made against Turkey’s Jews in some of the pro-government media, which leads to only one conclusion: The Turkish government itself is largely responsible for this bleak situation.</p> \n<p>For over a decade, I have lived on-and-off in Turkey, watching Turkish society diversify along with the new freedoms it enjoyed during the first years of Erdogan’s tenure.</p> \n<p>However, over the years, peoples’ comments and the Islamist press reminded me of the latent anti-Semitism there, though rightly brushed off as being largely marginal. However, even on the worst days, such as Israel’s raid on the Turkish-backed Gaza Flotilla, or during the Second Lebanon War, never did anti-Semitism erupt to such extremes as we have seen this week, one that was characterized by widespread praise for Hitler in the press and social media.</p> \n<p>Despite this, for many Turkish and non-Turkish Jews, life continues at a near-normal pitch, since the prejudices that have been unleashed are not generally visible in the streets or communities they live or stay in.</p> \n<p>This public display of anti-Semitism just did not suddenly reveal itself this week, Rather, it can be traced back to last year’s Gezi protest. The mass civil-society protest was brutally silenced by the Turkish government, but not before “international Jewry” was ‘identified’ as one of its main culprits by Prime Minister Erdogan, who claimed it was the work of the “interest-rate lobby,” a term regularly attributed to Jewish financiers and media moguls. According to the Turkish Prime Minister, the lobby aimed at hitting the Turkish economy and trying to bring down his government. While he was careful never to use the term ‘Jew’, it would not take long for one of his ministers to slip and actually pronounced that, indeed, international Jewry was one of the groups behind the Gezi protests.</p> \n<p>Sure enough, not even a month had passed before Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi was ousted in a coup d’etat, a major blow to Erdogan, who saw himself as a type of mentor for the Muslim Brotherhood leader. On social media, as the massacres in Egypt were taking place, I was astonished to see the number of tweets in Turkish attributing the overthrow of Morsi as a Jewish conspiracy; in fact, some even claimed that the people shooting the protesters were not even Muslims, but really Jews.</p> \n<p>It took no time at all for Erdogan to come out and accuse Israel as masterminding the coup; the problem was however he was blaming a French Jewish intellectual, Bernard-Henri L&eacute;vy, who merely participated in a 2011 conference on the Arab Spring alongside then-Knesset Member Tzipi Livni. Even if this was a strangely concocted story, Erdogan seemingly believed it, along with many of his followers.</p> \n<p>The turning point in the story of Turkish anti-Semitism was last December’s corruption scandal, which targeted high-government members and was perceived by Erdogan as an attempted judicial coup masterminded by his once staunch ally, the religious leader Fethullah Gulen, self-exiled to the United States, who has a substantial following in Turkey and other parts of the world.</p> \n<p>While most of Erdogan’s focus was purging thousands of police and judicial officials believed to be have ties with the Gulen movement, or what Erdogan coined the “parallel state,” it took no time at all for the PM and his supporters to remember that Gulen had been critical of the Turkish government’s role in the Gaza Flotilla – thus, of course, he too must have been under the wing of Israel.</p> \n<p>Throughout all of this, Erdogan has had to work to retain a wide front of support, incorporating and rewarding numerous groups, including the once-marginal anti-Semitic newspapers, which are now much closer to the ruling circles of power. All of these changes also led to a transformation in Turkey’s political culture, which has become extremely polarized. Over the last year, Erdogan has regularly lashed out against his opponents in crude and offensive language.</p> \n<p>There is no doubt that through these polarizing politics he has been able to consolidate his already strong conservative base – but at the cost of alienating many other sectors of Turkish society.</p> \n<p>It would be erroneous to think that ‘world Jewry’ was the only target of his attacks. During the Gezi campaigns, protesters were falsely accused of attacking a religious woman and desecrating a mosque, allegations that despite being disproven were reproduced in all the major pro-government papers and repeated numerous times by Erdogan. Following the break with the Gulen movement, Erdogan’s language hit new levels when he declared a witch hunt against them, stating that “in order to sterilize this dirty water that contaminated the milk, we will either boil or vaporize it.”</p> \n<p>When a group representing Alevis, Turkey’s largest religious minority, voiced opposition to Erdogan, he offensively questioned their religious beliefs as Muslims. Erdogan then caused anger among Turkey’s very small Shiite community when he explained that the Gulenists were even worse than Shiites in sedition and malice. In fact, in a similar way, MP Zafer Caglayan, in reference to the Gulen movement, said that he would have understood their (treacherous) actions had they been Jews, Zoroastrians, or Atheists; this lead to a harsh state of condemnation by Turkey’s Chief Rabbinate.</p> \n<p>If things were not polarized enough, Turkey for the first time will go to the polls in August to vote in a president, with Erdogan as one of the main candidates, providing fertile ground for this latest wave of anti-Semitism. However, it seems that rather dictating a moderating path, Erdogan took the cues of radical voices, leading to him making even harsher statements than in the past. Further, we must remember that anti-Semitism and praise for Hitler - and protests against Israel – have provided a sense of unity and joint purpose among some divided parts of Turkish society.</p> \n<p>During the last two weeks, Turkish Jews have been subjected to the ugliest of campaigns, with blatant threats lodged against the community, and even against foreign Jewish tourists. One author demanded that the Jews publicly condemn Israel, or else they could be subjected to pogroms such as that faced by Turkey’s Greek community in 1955. In the same newspaper, Yeni Akit, there was a cross-word-type game with Hitler’s portrait adorning the central panel with the slogan: “We are longing for you.” Many Turks reacted with shock, but this was by no means an isolated incident. One pro-government news source tweeted the dangerously inciteful words of IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation, Bulent Yildirim, who declared: “If the Turkish Jewish community does not put an end to Israel’s actions, very bad things will happen.” He explained in a succeeding tweet that it was getting hard to constrain ‘our youth’,&nbsp; in effect suggesting that violence against Turkish Jews was imminent.</p> \n<p>If such statements by the pro-government press were not enough, a ruling party AKP MP, Samil Tayyar, tweeted a message to Jews: Let your race be finished off, and may Hitler never be too far away. Further, Erdogan loyalist and mayor of Ankara, Melih Gokcek, came out in support of singer Yildiz Tilbe who praised Hitler on Twitter.</p> \n<p>It was following these expressions of hate towards Jews that Erdogan, in an election campaign speech, positioned Israeli barbarism as even worse than Hitler’s, a claim would clearly cause grave offense to any Jew regardless of their affiliation with Israel. He followed this up by hedging his position, stating: “I don't approve of any (bad) attitude towards our Jewish citizens in Turkey, despite all this. Why? They are the citizens of this country.” These words, at least nominally upholding the right to safety of the Jewish citizens of Turkey, seem far too little and also too late. He has still made no public condemnation of his own party members’ praise of Hitler and their anti-Semitic statements, nor has he condemned the threats made against members of the Turkey’s Jewish community in the pro-government press.</p> \n<p>On the bright side of this darkening picture, if social media in Turkey has provided a breeding-ground for anti-Semitic statements, it also has brought to light the condemnation of anti-Semitism by numerous Turkish columnists and appalled individuals, with voices even emerging in the more moderate pro-government press. However, it seems safe to say that in the wake of the current atmosphere of blatant anti-Semitism, more Jewish families will be convinced that the time has come to leave, a decision already made by many of the Jewish members over the last decade. If they stay, they are choosing to survive within their own psychological and physical bubble, or to carry on by ignoring the fact that many of their compatriots see them as the enemy.</p> \n<p>Louis Fishman is an assistant professor at Brooklyn College, City University of New York and writes on Turkish, and Israeli/Palestinian affairs.

        "text":["<p>From an ethical perspective, there is good reason to criticize the UN Human Rights Council’s appointment of a committee to investigate possible war crimes in Gaza. But in deciding whether to cooperate with Prof. William Schabas' panel, Israel must make a cold cost-benefit calculation, and I think the obvious conclusion is that Israel should cooperate.</p> \n<p>This conclusion stems from the lesson of the Goldstone mission after Operation Cast Lead in 2009, when Israel’s refusal to cooperate caused damage that could have been prevented, as least in part.</p> \n<p>Cooperating with the Schabas committee would let Israel justify its actions in the war in front of the whole world, while making Hamas responsible for the harm to civilians. Israel would also be able to express regret.</p> \n<p>There is also room to admit mistakes, such as the use of Israel’s Hannibal Directive — including a massive bombardment to prevent the capture of a soldier — in a densely populated area. Israel would be able to explain the reasons for its mistakes and show the measures being taken to prevent them in the future.</p> \n<p>There is also room for innovative revisions of the rules of war, when one side is a fanatical group using terrorist methods; a group that hides behind civilians and buildings serving a humanitarian purpose. Of course, one can rely, as necessary, on the legal principle of dire necessity, which some countries invoke when extraordinary circumstances force them to deviate from legal norms.</p> \n<p>We may assume that the committee chairman will be cautious in showing a clear anti-Israel stance. If he is not, he may be credibly condemned thanks to Israel’s cooperation.</p> \n<p>Also, Israel should coordinate its decision with the United States and the European countries. This would do much to improve relations and pave the way for efforts to prevent the committee from reaching false, one-sided conclusions. If such conclusions are reached, a joint condemnation could be crafted.</p> \n<p>I think the idea of establishing an Israeli investigative committee as a preventive measure is useless. Even if such a committee contained renowned experts and operated in the best possible way, it would be seen as an Israeli trick.</p> \n<p>The necessary conclusion, then, is to grit our teeth and cooperate with the UN investigative committee. Israel should state that it is doing so “out of respect for the United Nations despite the disgraceful makeup of the Human Rights Council.” And it should meticulously prepare before it makes claims and shows evidence in the best possible way.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When Emad Obaid, 32, heard about the 12-hour cease-fire in the Gaza Strip a few days ago, he felt he must run to check on his house in the eastern neighborhood of Shujaiyeh, six days after fleeing it. Obaid expected the house to be damaged, but was shocked to see that it had been totally reduced to rubble.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Standing over the rubble, Obaid started to search for any usable things he could take with him to his wife and five children back in one of the local UNRWA schools; with difficulty he pulled out clothes and blankets.&nbsp;He had to go back and forth a couple of times between the school and the ruins to bring the items to his wife.</p> \n<p>“When I told my wife that we no longer have a house and that we are homeless from now on, she started weeping and hitting her cheeks. It was a huge shock,” Obaid said.</p> \n<p>Thousands of residents of the eastern part of the Gaza Strip, near the front lines of the fighting during Israel’s Operation Protective Edge last week, sought refuge in UNRWA schools after Israel Defense Forces tanks invaded and heavily shelled the area last week, causing devastating damage to hundreds of houses and killing scores of people.</p> \n<p>A couple of meters away from Obaid, Ahmed Jundia was also scratching around in the rubble of his house. Jundia’s mother had been killed in an air strike while walking in the street, after she had fled from her home to an Orthodox church in the old part of Gaza City.</p> \n<p>“I thought we survived the genocide here, and we escaped thanks to a miracle, yet my mother insisted she would go out to visit her relatives. She was killed on the way,” Jundia said.</p> \n<p>He added that he had returned to the ruins of his home to look for photos of her so he can talk to them: “I’m not looking for my money here, I only want the memories, but even the memories were burned.”</p> \n<p>Jundia, an only son, said that when he saw people in the area fleeing their houses, he was able to imagine how it was for Arabs who fled in 1948 during Israel’s War of Independence.</p> \n<p>“I used to hear these stories, but now I ‘lived’ one of them. I bet it’s the exact same scene. I think that now I will build a tent over the rubble of my house,” he added, picking up part of an explosive device that fell near his house.</p> \n<p>A couple of kilometers&nbsp;away was the church Jundia had been talking about. Dozens of families had gathered in the yard, taking shelter from the nonstop violence in the area. Rami Ayyad, who is in charge of services at the church, said that since the first day of the ground invasion, his administration decided to cancel the prayers, and to open the church’s doors to the displaced citizens.</p> \n<p>Asked if such a step has helped relations between Muslims and Christians in Gaza, Ayyad said he thought a gap had never really existed between people of different religions.</p> \n<p>“We are glad we are able to help, all of us are Palestinians under the same attack – an attack that doesn’t differentiate between man and women, Christian or Muslim,” Ayyad noted.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in the old quarter of Gaza City,&nbsp;people rushed to the main market during a brief lull in fighting, after a long period of being stuck indoors. They were buying essential goods only, and not things needed for the Id al-Fitr feast being observed this week.</p> \n<p>Majed Helo, 51, who owns a candy shop, said this is the worst period he has ever experienced in the many years he has been working. He estimated that one percent of his customers were buying chocolate in advance of the three-day holiday marking the end of the month of Ramadan, compared to previous years.</p> \n<p>“I can understand this. It’s a war, people neither have money nor can they celebrate Id amid this mass destruction and killing,” Helo added.</p> \n<p>At this writing, since Israel’s Operation Protective Edge began three weeks ago in the Gaza Strip, some 1,100 Palestinians have been killed. The United Nations estimates that more than 70 percent are civilians. Israel has lost 53 soldiers during the conflict and three civilians have been killed by Hamas.</p>",

In a phone conversation with U.S. Secreatry of State, Netanyahu said his Turkish counterpart’s comments, accusing Israel of massacring Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and carrying out war crimes worse than those if Hitler and the Nazis, were anti-Semitic and desecrated the memory of the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>The crisis in relations between Israel and Turkey began during the operation Cast Lead in Gaza in December 2008. They deteriorated sharply after Israeli naval commandos killed nine Turkish activists during a raid on a flotilla of ships trying to breach the blockade on the Gaza Strip in May, 2010.</p> \n<p>The two countries came close to signing a reconciliation agreement this year, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ultimately refused to endorse the accord.</p>",

        "text":["<p>MILAN, Italy – A Muslim cleric is set to be deported from Italy because of alleged hate speech against Jews, the Italian authorities said this week.</p> \n<p>Abd Al-Barr Al-Rawdhi, an immigrant from Morocco, works as a preacher in San Don&agrave; di Piave, a small town about 30 kilometers north of Venice.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, the Middle East Media Research Institute, a watchdog against hate speech in the Arabic- and Farsi-language media, uploaded a video in which Rawdhi appears to be praising the killing of Jews, even though the word “Jew” is never mentioned, the authorities say.</p> \n<p>“What can we possibly expect from people who lost all respect for Allah, saying to Moses: 'Show us Allah outright?'” the preacher said, referring to a passage in the Koran in which the Jews challenge Moses. “What can we possibly expect from people who said 'the hand of Allah is shackled?' May their own hands be shackled, and may they be cursed for what they said.”</p> \n<p>The translation by the institute, also known as Memri, has been confirmed by Haaretz. According to Memri’s website, the video was taken from another site, though Memri does not say which one. Haaretz was not able to trace its original source.</p> \n<p>The Italian right-wing newspaper Libero reported on the issue Monday, quoting from Memri’s translation. The following, day Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, a hardliner on immigration policies, announced that Rawdhi would be deported.</p> \n<p>“We cannot accept that people deliver such obviously anti-Semitic speeches that incite to violence and religious hatred,” Alfano told La Stampa, a mainstream newspaper. Rawdhi’s expulsion should “serve as a warning for all those who think they can spread hatred in Italy,” he added.</p> \n<p>Rawdhi is currently being held by the military police, so he is unavailable for comment.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Anti-Semitism has been a concern for the authorities in recent weeks as anti-Semitic graffiti has proliferated in Rome and other cities.</p> \n<p>The planned deportation has received mixed reactions in Italy’s 1.5-million-strong Muslim community. “Those who preach hatred should be expelled from [Italy’s] mosques,” Bouchaib Tanji, president of the Islamic federation of the Venice area, told La Stampa, praising Alfano’s decision.</p> \n<p>Others claimed that Rawdhi should have been granted the right to a trial. Mohammed Guerfi, the imam of Verona, described the decision to deport Rawdhi without trial as &quot;shameful&quot; and a sign of &quot;disrespect to the Italian constitution.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to Guerfi, Rawdhi's comments were directed at Israel, not the Jews. &quot;What do the authorities expect from us – to keep quiet about the war in Gaza?&quot; Guerfi said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Others had similar views. “Any form of anti-Semitism and hate speech should be condemned; moreover, it goes against Italian law,” Davide Piccardo, the leader of one of the largest Muslim organizations in northern Italy, told Haaretz. “What I don’t get, however, is why Rawdhi was expelled, and so quickly, instead of being put on trial. I mean, don’t people get to defend themselves when they’re accused of something?”</p> \n<p>Such cases might be used to spread distrust of Italy’s Muslim community, Piccardo added.</p> \n<p>More than 60 percent of Italians have a negative view of Muslims, a record for Western Europe, according to a recent Pew survey.</p> \n<p>Piccardo also expressed concerns that the Italian authorities might have based their decision on a video translated by Memri that “appears to be edited and cut.” But Alfano has told reporters that the decision to deport Rawdhi was made after a “thorough investigation” by the anti-terror police.</p> \n<p>The mosque in San Don&agrave; di Piave has had problems with the law before. A preacher from that mosque, Ahmad Chaddad, was arrested on terror and illegal-immigration charges in 2012. A native of Syria, Chaddad was accused of aiding illegal immigrants and recruiting volunteers for the fighting in Syria.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Tisha B’Av is a Jewish day of mourning. However, what exactly we are mourning for, and why we're doing so on this date, the ninth day of the Jewish month of Av, is somewhat mysterious.</p> \n<p>The general consensus these days is that we're mourning for the destruction of both the first and second Temples, as well as a host of other travails that befell the Jewish people over the ages. But how that came to focus on this day is unknown.</p> \n<p>What's sure is that sometime in the summer of 587 BCE, Babylonian forces besieged Jerusalem. They eventually breached the great stone walls protecting the city, plundered the First Temple, and set it ablaze. The Jews were taken into captivity in Babylon where famously “we wept, when we remembered Zion” (Psalm 137:1).</p> \n<p>During the 50 years the Jews stayed before being allowed to return to Jerusalem by King Cyrus of Persia in 538 BCE, four fast days were established in memory of the First Temple’s destruction. One was in the month of Av. Which day in Av, we don't know.</p> \n<p>It seems that unusually, these fast days were established from the “bottom up&quot; – meaning, they began among the people, instead of being handed down from on high by religious authorities. Support for that thesis appears in the Book of Esther. When talking about the grassroots origin of Purim, the author says exactly that about the fast days: “…as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry” (Esther 9:31).</p> \n<p>Perhaps that non-centralization of the fasts is why, after the Jews returned to Jerusalem and rebuilt the Temple, they were at odds as to whether or not to continue mourning rites, with their independence regained and the Temple rebuilt.</p> \n<p>Should I weep or be gladdened?</p> \n<p>The earliest reference to these four days of fasting is found in the Book of Zechariah, written during these first years of return to Israel. Chapters 7 and 8 are essentially the prophet's answer to the Jew’s question: “Should I weep in the fifth month [Av]?” (Zechariah 7:3)</p> \n<p>The closest thing Zechariah gives to an answer – apparently, &quot;No, we should celebrate&quot; – is this: “The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts” (Zechariah 8:19).</p> \n<p>At this point, it bears mention that the fast day in Av may not have been the 9th. The above quote is the only one we have on the subject and Zechariah only gives the month, not the date.</p> \n<p>How people marked the destruction of the First Temple (or its rebuilding) in Av during the time of the Second Temple is not clear. Some evidence indicates they fasted; other evidence indicates precisely the opposite – that they celebrated its rebuilding.</p> \n<p>Evidence for mourning appears in Mishnah Rosh HaShanah 1:3, which tells that at the start of the month of Av, messengers would be dispatched from the Temple to inform the Jewish communities when the mourning should commence.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, another account (Mishnah Ta’anit 4:5) that during the Second Temple period, the 9th of Av marked a sort of ancient Arbor Day, an agricultural holiday celebrating trees.</p> \n<p>The bottom line is that we don't know if the Second Temple Jews celebrated a feast on the 9th of Av and fasted on a completely different day in Av. Possibly Zechariah was bemoaning the insistence on mourning a temple that had already been rebuilt, and wanted Jews to stop doing that right away.</p> \n<p>In any case, observant Jews today think Zechariah was referring to the End of Days, which is when the fast days should turn into festive days.</p> \n<p>When the Temple was destroyed </p> \n<p>As we said, another issue shrouded in mystery is when exactly these four fast days marking the destruction of the First Temple took place.</p> \n<p>Today we mark the fast day on the 9th of Av, but that may be because we don't know on what date the Temple of Jerusalem was destroyed. Biblical accounts of the destruction contradict one another. The Book of Kings says it happened on the “seventh day of the month” (2 Kings 25:8), while the Book of Jeremiah has it “in the tenth day of the month” (Jeremiah 52:12).</p> \n<p>The earliest accounts dating the day of mourning for the First Temple to the ninth of Av are after the destruction of the Second Temple. We could surmise that the ninth was chosen because that was the date that the Second Temple was destroyed by Titus in 70 CE. But it seems, that was not so. The only contemporaneous account dating the destruction of the Second Temple is that of the Jewish historian Josephus, who says in “The Wars of the Jews&quot; that it happened on the 10th of Av.</p> \n<p>This dating problem did not elude the rabbis of the Mishnah: &quot;The law would have it that we would mourn on the 10th, the day the house of our god was burned, but why on the ninth?&quot; They then answer their own question: “On the seventh they entered it, on the eighth they circled it, on the ninth they lit the light and on the tenth it burned.&quot;</p> \n<p>Rabbi Jochanan remained unconvinced. &quot;Had I lived in that generation [which decided on the date] I wouldn't have set it to the tenth.&quot; (Ta'anit 4:9)</p> \n<p>False messiah fans the fire</p> \n<p>Several generations later, during the period of the Babylonian Talmud, the date of Tisha B'Av was imbued with more disasters, to give it even more gravity. This was apparently due to some laxity in execution during later generations, as attested by an account that Yehuda HaNasi sought to abolishing the fast (Megillah 5b): &quot;On the ninth of Av our ancestors were sentenced to not enter the land [punishment for the doubt of the 12 Spies], and the temple was destroyed for the first and second time, and Beitar was captured [thus ending the Bar Kokhba Revolt in 135 CE] and the city [of Jerusalem] was destroyed.&quot;</p> \n<p>It is in the Talmud that many of the traditions associated with Tisha B’Av to this day were set. Reading the Book of Lamentations, sprinkling ashes on the food you eat before the fast begins, sitting on low stools, eschewing leather shoes, and so on. During post-Talmudic times these mourning rites became more and more vigorously observed and new traditions were added, including draping the Torah scroll in black and lighting the synagogue dimly on that day, as well as the chastisement of the congregation by an elder.</p> \n<p>Come the 17th century, the kabbalist Sabbatai Zevi announced that he was the Messiah and gained a huge following by Jews around the world. Among other things, he announced that Tisha B’Av would become a day of celebration as foreseen by Zechariah. When Jews became disillusioned with Sabbatai Zevi after his forced conversion to Islam in 1666, Tisha B’Av was taken up anew with new vigor, with extreme public mourning rites being viewed as a badge of orthodox piety.</p> \n<p>During the reform movement in the 19th century, some groups (mostly in Germany) favored reinterpreting Tisha B’Av as a day of celebration - as it was the Temple's destruction that turned the Jews into a people of priests destined to minister to the people of the world. Over time, this set of traditions was abandoned.</p> \n<p>The State of Israel marks Tisha B’Av eve by closing businesses. Programming on television and radio turns somber. But in contrast to Yom Kippur, most Israeli Jews do not observe the fast.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>History doesn’t record when the first Christmas was celebrated, but it was probably sometime in the fourth century CE, in the Roman Empire. What's sure is that the first historic record of the holiday is a calendar dating from 354 CE, belonging to a rich Roman Christian named Philocalus.</p> \n<p>That calendar tells us that on the same date - December 25 - another holiday was celebrated, marking the birth of Sol Invictus, “the Unconquered Sun.” That was a new pagan cult, worshiping a new sun deity.</p> \n<p>Both these holidays coincided with the Roman festival of Saturnalia, which had been celebrated from December 17 to December 24th. That was a festival celebrating the god Saturn, which – as we will see - contributed heavily to latter-day Christmas traditions.</p> \n<p>Why December 25?</p> \n<p>Scholars differ on why December 25, was chosen as the birthday of Jesus, since it apparently wasn't.</p> \n<p>Hippolytus, in the second century, was probably the first to propose this date. The New Testament doesn’t tell us when the birth took place: and the only clue the text gives us - &quot;some shepherds staying out in the fields keeping watch over their flock by night&quot; (Luke 2:8) actually implies that the birth took place in the spring or summer, as sheep would have been kept indoors during the cold winter nights.</p> \n<p>Most probably that date was based on the birth-date of Sol Invictus, which is marked on the Winter Solstice - when the sun overcomes darkness and the days begin to get longer.</p> \n<p>The sun is born</p> \n<p>Early Christian symbolism would often liken Jesus with the sun.</p> \n<p>As Christianity developed, becoming the official religion of the Roman Empire, many pagan traditions were assumed . This is blatantly clear in the case of Christmas, which took on many of the traditions of Saturnalia, most notably the traditions of gift-giving and merrymaking.</p> \n<p>When the Germanic tribes adopted Christianity and with it the holiday of Christmas, they too contributed to the traditions of the holiday by incorporating aspects of the pagan winter festival Yule into the Christian holiday. Most notable of these are the veneration of evergreens, which would with time morph into the Christmas tree; the traditions of holly and mistletoe decoration; and a wild hunt of flying creatures led by the long-bearded god Odin, who is believed to have been the prototype of Santa Claus.</p> \n<p>A Greek bishop merges with Odin</p> \n<p>Another aspect that Christmas adopted from the Germanic Yule is heavy drinking.</p> \n<p>Though this is not associated with Christmas anymore, during the Middle Ages drinking was a major part of the holiday. In general Christmas during the Middle Ages would have been very foreign to a modern-day observer - it was mostly a festival of drinking and revelry, much closer to Saturnalia than our modern Christmas.</p> \n<p>It was during the Middle Ages when the veneration of Saint Nicolas, a third to fourth-century Greek bishop living in what is today Turkey, developed into the holiday figure of Sinterklaas in the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>St. Nicolas was said to have given gifts to children and thus was considered the patron saint of schoolchildren. According to tradition, Sinterklaas would come from Spain on a steamboat accompanied by a mischievous Moorish helper called Zwarte Piet. This helper would kidnap bad children and report to Sinterklaas on good children, who would then receive gifts on Dece,ber 6th, which was Sinterklaas' feast day.</p> \n<p>Later, during the Reformation, many Netherlanders stopped celebrating the saints’ feast days, and the gift-giving associated with Sinterklaas migrated from December 6 to Christmas.</p> \n<p>Christmas is banned, the people are unimpressed</p> \n<p>In the English-speaking world, the Protestant Reformation was even more radical, abolishing not only saint feasts but going as far as banning Christmas itself.</p> \n<p>In the wake of the English Civil War, Christmas was abolished in 1647, though many outright acts of protest followed, with people defying the Puritans and continuing to celebrate the holiday, albeit in a less public manner.</p> \n<p>Even after the restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, celebration of Christmas wasn’t completely restored to its former glory.</p> \n<p>At roughly the same time, the tradition of setting up a tree in one’s home and lighting candles began to spread in Germany. The concept spread among European nobility during the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching the lower classes only in the late 19th century.</p> \n<p>The huge success of Charles Dickens’ &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; in 1843 greatly contributed to popularizing Christmas, and gave it much of the qualities we associate with it today: a holiday centered around the family, as opposed as a community holiday celebrated in church.</p> \n<p>The book also contributed to the popularity of the phrase “Merry Christmas,” which appears many times throughout it. That very same year the first commercially printed Christmas cards were printed and sold, bearing that wish - &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile in 1823, &quot;A Visit From St. Nicholas&quot; (that’s the poem starting with “'Twas the Night Before Christmas”) by Clement Clarke Moore was published in the United States. This contributed to the spread of Santa Claus, at this point merging the serious Dutch Sinterklaas with the jolly English personification of Christmas known as Father Christmas, and gift-giving in the English-speaking world.</p> \n<p>Come the Chinese restaurant</p> \n<p>This emphasis on gifts led merchants and manufactures to decorate their stores and ads with Christmas themes, hoping it would be their products that would be bought and gifted. By the mid-19th century people began to complain that the holiday was losing its “true meaning” in face of commercialization.</p> \n<p>In 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant signed a law that officially made Christmas a secular federal holiday.</p> \n<p>This coincided with a mass influx of Eastern European Jewish immigrants into America. Finding shops closed on this day and not celebrating Christmas themselves, they found themselves going to Chinese restaurants that stayed open because their owners didn’t celebrate Christmas either. Moreover, the Chinese restaurants were located nearby, as Jewish, Chinese and other poor immigrants tended to live in the same slums.</p> \n<p>This is the origin of the Jewish-American tradition of eating at Chinese restaurants on Christmas.</p> \n<p>Many of the most popular Christmas carols were written and composed in the 19th Century: “Silent Night,” originally in German in 1818, “O Holy Night,” originally in French in 1847, “Joy to the World,” originally in English in 1839, “Jingle Bells,” also originally in English, in 1857, and “Deck the Halls,” originally in Welsh in 1877, to name a few.</p> \n<p>These began to be superseded after the advent of the radio and the phonograph by popular Christmas songs especially during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Many if these were written by Jews, among them: “Sleigh Ride,” written by Mitchell Parish, originally Michael Hyman Pashelinsky, in 1948, Let It Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!&quot; was written and composed by Sammy Cahn (b. Samuel Cohen) and Jule Styne (b. Julius Kerwin Stein) in 1945. Irving Berlin (b. Israel Isidore Beilin) wrote “White Christmas”, and Johnny Marks wrote both “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” and &quot;Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.&quot;</p> \n<p>Christmas broadcasts began in earnest during the second half of the 20th century, most notably Frank Capra’s “It's a Wonderful Life” from 1946 and “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” which first aired in 1965.</p> \n<p>In recent years Christmas has become a battleground for the opponents of the separation of church and state, who oppose the public endorsement of the Christian holiday by government and public companies and conservative Christians, who believe a “War on Christmas” is being waged. The liberals claiming the worship of Jesus shouldn’t be forced on them and the conservatives claiming that their right to worship freely is being infringed upon. But if the Protestant Reformation with all its power couldn't manage to stamp out the holiday spirit, grousing in the op-eds section of the press isn't likely to either.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Nazareth not only has history, impressive churches and charm, it tells a fascinating culinary story. In a small area you can find a bustling selection of stores, restaurants, bakeries, coffee-roasting houses and pastry shops. And now Nazareth restaurants boast a new generation of chefs who have plied their trade in top-notch restaurants around Israel and the world.Halvah and tahini at Nazareth HalvaNazareth Halva is run by the fourth generation of the Ali Nasser family, which produces halvah and tahini from natural ingredients using traditional methods. The sesame comes from Africa and goes through a long process to become perfect halvah; this includes the roasting and grinding.</p> \n<p>Nazareth Halva produces three types of tahini – from white sesame, whole sesame and ground black cumin, recommended for diabetics and considered the healthiest tahini. There are also more than 20 types of halvah, including vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, cashew, almond, cinnamon, ginger and carob.</p> \n<p>For the more advanced it’s worth lingering over the rahat lokum, aka Turkish delight, or indulge in dragee candies and sugar-coated hummus. Prices for half a kilogram of tahini and halvah range from 10 to 15 shekels ($3-$4). Want to know the origin of halvah? A tour of the factory and tastings – free of charge but by appointment only – are available at Nazareth Halva, 4000 Street, Building 21, on the way down from the courthouse in Upper Nazareth.Home-made pastries at SambusakIf you’ve visited Nazareth Halva, take a peek into the shop next door, Sambusak. In 2006 Aouni and Jada opened Sambusak, a tiny place where Jada makes small baked goods based on secret family recipes. Eat the goodies on the spot or take them to go; either way, the prices are very low. The piece de resistance are the fingers of dough stuffed with za’atar (hyssop) leaves, sesame and cheese, which Jada can be seen preparing almost every day with inspiring precision. Prices are about 65 shekels ($20) per kilo.</p> \n<p>Ground coffee and spices at FahoumIn 1950 it was rare to find places in Israel that ground coffee, certainly not from imported fine coffee beans. The first roasting house opened that year in Nazareth and became a trailblazer in Israel, before roasted coffee became so common. Today four places in Nazareth sell and roast coffee from countries like Costa Rica, Colombia, Kenya and Ethiopia.</p> \n<p>Fahoum also offers unique blends. Of the four places where it sells the stuff, our favorite was the one hidden on 6 Paulus Street. Here you’ll find coffee, spices, candy, dried fruit, pine nuts and a huge roasting machine. The device is one of the best in the world, specially ordered from Germany. A kilo of ground coffee ranges from 40 to 50 shekels ($10-$15).Spices and more at the Galilee Mill (El Babour)El Babour means “the mill” in Arabic, and sure enough, the place is teeming with spices. The building once housed the flour mill of a German Templer family and was transferred to a Nazareth family in 1904. Today the place boasts more than 1,500 types of spices and products, including candy, chocolate, nuts, seeds and traditional cups of tea and coffee. Don’t forget the spices that you won’t find anywhere else. Just head for Habankim Street.TishreenTishreen is the pioneer of the new wave of restaurateurs and chefs in Nazareth. The restaurant, housed in a building put up in 1868, serves both classic Arab cuisine such as muhmar and European dishes such as pasta, carpaccio and cordon bleu. And don’t overlook the dishes that emerge from the wood-burning stove: roasted baladi eggplant, lamb ribs and siniyeh. The restaurant is on Hama’ayan Square.Olga’sA building once used as the Nazareth elementary school is the home of Olga’s. The school theme is evident in the restaurant’s design, and even the menu looks like a notebook. As befits a family of butchers, chef Samer Milad focuses on meat. Don’t miss the transparent bar on the second floor, which overlooks the Old City. It’s the most romantic secret you’ll discover on your trip here. The restaurant is in the Elrom neighborhood.MejanaSeven years ago chef Souhel Farran opened Mejana with his wife, and two years ago he moved it to Hama’ayan Square. In addition to its meat dishes, Mejana excels in traditional fare as shish barak – meat-filled dough cooked in yogurt with garlic and spearmint. Mejana offers one of the best deals in Nazareth: 70 shekels ($20) for a raft of first courses and a main course.SudfehSudfeh on Hama’ayan Square is the most beautiful restaurant in Nazareth. It’s also one of the only places in the city headed by a woman, Mary Abu Jaber. In the kitchen you’ll find chef Nizar Jaraisy, who returned to Nazareth after 12 years in Tel Aviv, where he worked in placed such as Messa, Espresso Bar, Goocha and Shalvata. Coming in a group? Ask for the lovely private room that overlooks the restaurant.DanteIf you’re looking for another restaurant with a promising chef, consider Dante and young Elias Mattar who heads it. Mattar’s menu boasts mushrooms stuffed with cheese, and seafood bought every day at the market in Haifa. All this comes with the impressive building that overlooks the city. The restaurant is on 48 Al-Bishara St.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Furious that convicted sex offender Rabbi Moti Elon will continue to teach at Bnei Akiva Yeshiva Or Etzion, concerned Israeli parents are turning to the American Friends of Yeshiva Bnei Akiva to protest his continued employment. They are also asking for support in pressuring Or Etzion head Rabbi Haim Druckman to reverse the decision to retain him.</p> \n<p>Keeping Elon as a lecturer despite his conviction on two counts of forcible sexual assault and sentencing of community service&nbsp;was a decision made by Druckman, a prominent figure in the national religious world who, along with heading Or Etzion, serves as chairman of the Bnei Akiva schools network, a fact which particularly disturbs many parents with children in the Bnei Akiva educational system.</p> \n<p>Beit Shemesh resident Miriam Zussman has distributed a letter to Bnei Akiva supporters abroad, asking them to alert members. of the board of American Friends of Yeshiva Bnei Akiva to the issue. In the letter, she describes Elon as a&nbsp;“dangerous, habitual sexual predator.”</p> \n<p>The decision to continue to allow him to teach, she wrote, “reflects very badly on Rabbi Druckman's judgment and calls into question whether he should be entrusted with the welfare of the 24,000 students in the school network…. If you agree and are a donor to YBA or know any of the&nbsp;North American leaders ...I would appreciate if you could contact them and explain how dangerous the support of Moti Elon is, and how flawed Rabbi Druckman's judgment has become.”</p> \n<p>Activist Israeli opponents of Druckman’s decision created a popular Facebook page called “Supporters of the Victims of Rabbi Elon”whose slogan is “those who deny sexual violence, permit sexual violence.”</p> \n<p>Among those spearheading the effort to pressure Druckman to remove Elon from the yeshiva is Daniel Goldman, co-chairman of the World Bnei Akiva organization. “As head of the network, Rav Druckman has a much greater responsibility than someone who runs his own institution. The fact that he is ignoring and denying the outcome of the appointed court of law on this matter, makes a bad statement and sends a bad message with respect to what we say about what goes on within our schools and what should be the level of tolerance of people who have been convicted of sexual offenses - there should be zero tolerance. Whatever personal feelings Rabbi Druckman might have shouldn’t matter,” Goldman told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Goldman said the decision to turn to the American organization was made “since Rabbi Druckman seems to be immune to criticism in Israel, I wouldn’t do it under other circumstances - but I think people feel strongly.”</p> \n<p>Goldman noted that, to put it mildly, Druckman is “not somebody who responds well to criticism” and because of his age and position ‘it is quite difficult to apply any sort of sanction” against him within his organization. The irony, Goldman noted, is the fact that Bnei Akiva is a member of the Takana, the forum of religious leaders which first revealed the allegations against Elon and brought it to the attention of authorities after conducting its own investigation, and recommended distancing him from young people even before his conviction.</p> \n<p>Druckman, however, a respected rabbi in the national religious community and an Israel Prize laureate and a longtime supporter and defender of Elon has stood fast. In a radio interview on Sunday, Druckman saidthere was “no reason” to prevent Elon from teaching, and cast doubt on the court’s ruling against him.</p> \n<p>“At the end of the day, we’re talking about an incident in which two people were in the room, Rabbi Elon and the complainant. There was no one in the room apart from them,” he said. “This person claims one thing, which the other denies. There’s no other testimony [on this incident]. Who says the claim is true? No one knows what happened in the room and no one can know. This is why I saw the ruling as a mistake,” Druckman told Arutz Sheva.</p> \n<p>The religious website kipa.co.il surveyed Orthodox Knesset members on the issue. Only Habayit Hayehudi MK Uri Orbach took a stand, saying that although he personally respects Rabbi Druckman, he believes that convicted sex offenders “must not be permitted to teach young people” and that “first and foremost, we have to stand behind the victims.”</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, Economics Minister Naftali Bennett was asked about the matter on Israel Radio and said, &quot;I think a man convicted of this should not be teaching. Certainly, not for a period of time. That is my position.&quot;</p> \n<p>The other Knesset members polled, including Education Minister Shai Piron, declined to comment on the matter. It’s unclear whether their silence means that they are reluctant to speak out against Druckman - or whether, perhaps, given the fact that Elon received a relatively light sentence of community service and probation, quietly endorse the decision to allow him to stay in the classroom. Elon, who before the scandal was a highly respected yeshiva head himself, admitted in court that he had kissed and hugged two underage students - but denied that the contact was sexual.</p> \n<p>One parent of three children in the Bnei Akiva school network, Miriam Haber, complained on Education Minister Piron’s Facebook page on his unwillingness to condemn Druckman’s decision. Normally, she said, she “feels proud” to have kids studying in Bnei Akiva but “not this week.”</p> \n<p>“As Education Minister, do you think it’s right that an organization that manages 60 schools across the country under ministry auspices should welcome someone convicted of sexual impropriety with a minor? I don’t. The double message sent to the 22,000 students in the network are A) that it is acceptable to question the decision of the courts and B) that the network they study in doesn’t take the crime of sexual impropriety with a minor seriously. I would presume that these messages are not acceptable to you as someone who is responsible for the education of my children, and I would appreciate hearing your opinion on the matter.”</p>",

        "text":["<p> When worshippers arrive for Friday-night services at Israel’s newest Reform congregation, they don’t greet one another in Hebrew. Not in English either, as they would in some of the more established Reform congregations founded by Anglophone immigrants around the country.</p> \n<p> At this brand-new congregation in Tel Aviv suburb Ramat Gan, Russian rules. Not only is it the mother tongue of every single worshipper showing up for services, it’s&nbsp; the language in which many of the prayers are recited and the rabbi’s sermon is delivered.</p> \n<p> Set up specifically to serve Russian speakers, the congregation doesn’t yet have a name, but it already has a core of 35 members who attend the traditional Kabbalat Shabbat prayer service every other Friday night.</p> \n<p> And it’s not the first to target this particular audience. Four years ago, Shirat Hayam-Carmel in Haifa paved the way, and plans are on tap to set up similar congregations in two other cities with large Russian-speaking enclaves: Be’er Sheva and Ashdod.</p> \n<p> “Reaching out to this community is a key strategy for us in the coming years,” says Rabbi Gilad Kariv, executive director of the Reform movement in Israel.</p> \n<p> To be sure, it’s not a mass movement. Gregory Kotler, the rabbi of both congregations, estimates that several hundred members of this community “at some level or another” have been brought into the fold in recent years. But like Kariv, he believes the potential goes way beyond that.</p> \n<p> To outsiders, it would appear to be an anomaly. After all, how does a Jewish religious movement that made its way to Israel via America end up appealing to immigrants with roots in the atheistic Soviet Union?</p> \n<p> But followers of this budding love affair argue that the Reform movement and Russian Jewry are a natural fit, and that the timing couldn’t be more perfect. As Reform Judaism in Israel is broadening its outreach efforts and seeking to tap into new segments of society, these Russian immigrants, whose religious credentials are often called into question by the Orthodox establishment, have been on the lookout for an alternative and welcoming Jewish home.</p> \n<p> “When the immigrants from the former Soviet Union first began arriving in Israel in the 1990s, we thought that because of their secular background we would be the ones they came to. And we did try hard to reach out, but quickly a few things became clear,” Kariv recalls.</p> \n<p> “First of all, like immigrants anywhere, they were very preoccupied in their first years in the country with their basic needs, like employment and housing, and they had no energy for things like Jewish identity. By now, we have a generation that’s been born here or been here since a very young age. They’ve integrated into Israeli society, and now they’re suddenly showing a lot of interest in their Jewish roots.”</p> \n<p> All the way from Leningrad</p> \n<p> A case in point is Marina Polinovsky, who immigrated to Israel in 1990 at age 9 from St. Petersburg — when it was still called Leningrad. An attorney completing her doctorate in law, she serves on the board of the Reform movement in Israel and was a founding member of Shirat Hayam-Carmel, which has about 50 full-time members.</p> \n<p> Polinovsky traces her early interest in progressive Judaism to the years she spent studying at the Leo Baeck Education Center in Haifa, which is affiliated with the Reform movement. “It was the principles of pluralism and equality that attracted me,” she says. Not surprisingly, the president of the congregation, Limor Apt, is also a graduate of Leo Baeck.</p> \n<p> Why not just join existing congregations rather than set up their own? Justifiably or not, Polinovsky explains, many Russia-speakers feel they are being judged by their Israeli-born counterparts, so they’re more comfortable in synagogue among their own.</p> \n<p> “Many of us started out with no knowledge whatsoever of Judaism, so it’s easier for us to be with others from the same background,” she says. “We don’t want to have to worry then if we’re not bowing in the right place during the prayer service.”</p> \n<p> Another factor behind the growing popularity of Reform Judaism for Russian-speakers in Israel is the spread of the movement in the former Soviet Union – particularly its youth movement, Netzer. According to Kariv, the Reform movement is second only to Chabad in terms of its reach in the old country.</p> \n<p> Kotler, who serves as director of the Israeli Reform movement’s outreach activities with the Russian-speaking community, was the first full-time Reform rabbi stationed in Moscow. Six Reform rabbis are currently active in the former Soviet Union — two in Moscow, one in St. Petersburg, one in Kiev, one in Odessa and one in Minsk.</p> \n<p> “In recent years, we’ve seen many alumni of Netzer in the former Soviet Union moving to Israel, and they naturally want to join our congregations,” he notes. “These immigrants have grown up in a completely different reality than those who came 25 years ago and had no religious background whatsoever.”</p> \n<p> More than a million immigrants from the former Soviet Union have come to Israel since the early 1990s, among them anywhere from 250,000 to 350,000 who are not defined as Jewish according to Jewish law because they don’t have a Jewish mother. They were able to immigrate under the Law of Return either because they had at least one Jewish grandparent or a Jewish spouse. For them in particular, the Reform movement, which doesn’t ask too many questions, seems a perfect fit.</p> \n<p> The conversion issue</p> \n<p> Many in this group have opted out of an Orthodox conversion because it would require them to adopt a religious lifestyle. Immigrants who undergo a Reform conversion in Israel are recognized as Jewish in the Population Registry but cannot marry in the country since the Orthodox establishment controls marriage law and does not recognize them as Jews.</p> \n<p> Still, the Reform movement converts about 200 people a year in Israel, about 70 percent of them immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Along with the second-generation immigrants and the Netzer alumni, they account for the core of Israel’s new Russian-speaking Reform community.</p> \n<p> A prime example is 33-year-old Svetlana (who requested that her last name not be used), a single mother of two who completed her conversion a little more than a year ago and is today the driving force behind the new Ramat Gan congregation. Born non-Jewish, she married an Israeli she had met in Russia and moved with him to Israel 14 years ago before getting divorced. At the time, Svetlana, who is training as an interior designer, had begun studying for an Orthodox conversion but gave up.</p> \n<p> “By chance, I heard that it was a possible to have a Reform conversion in Israel, so I signed up,” she recounts. “It was like a ray of light for me because finally someone was willing to accept me.”</p> \n<p> Katya, a woman she befriended at the Reform conversion classes, is also a regular at the new congregation.</p> \n<p> Unlike Svetlana, Katya is a newcomer to Israel, having immigrated with her Russian-Jewish husband just over a year ago. She decided on a Reform, rather than Orthodox, conversion for two reasons.</p> \n<p> “For an Orthodox conversion, my husband would have had to take all the classes with me, and he travels a lot on business, so that wasn’t possible,” she says. “Besides that, he’s not circumcised, and he would have had to get circumcised if I’d gone through an Orthodox conversion, and he refused to do that.”</p> \n<p> Like Svetlana, she attends not only the weekly Shabbat services at the new synagogue but also takes part in other congregational events, classes and celebrations. “I may not have been born Jewish, but I’m certainly more Jewish than my husband today,” she says.</p>",

        "text":["<p> American kitsch was at its very best in Cleveland these past few days, peaking just before the Cavaliers’ first NBA game of the season Thursday night. The ceremony introducing the home players looked and sounded like an urban orgasm. The video presentation of the players included a clip of LeBron James saying, “There’s no place like home!” When his turn came to go up, the Cavaliers’ fans made it clear that they had missed him just a little. It’s doubtful whether coach David Blatt’s introduction right afterward was even audible.</p> \n<p> After the return of his pregame ritual of tossing talcum powder into the air and a heartfelt hug with friend Carmelo Anthony, James focused on the professional side of his comeback game – and that’s where the magic faded. Cleveland opened decently against the New York Knicks – mainly Kevin Love, who demonstrated his full repertoire (post-ups, triple threats and “quarterback” passes all over the court) – but the man for whom everyone had assembled seemed affected. During the first quarter, LeBron suffered four turnovers and managed only one basket from his first nine shots.</p> \n<p> The Knicks used the butterflies in his stomach to their advantage. Anthony’s strong play (a game-high 25 points, on 9-for-17 shooting and six assists) and the well-timed baskets of Iman Shumpert and J.R. Smith left them enjoying an advantage for most of the second half. The Cavaliers’ great trio closed a nine-point gap three minutes from the end to three with 44 seconds to spare, but in the next offensive Anthony stretched it to five points with a tough basket. For Cleveland and Blatt, there was no going back: 95-90 to the Knicks.</p> \n<p> Blatt was criticized by commentator Charles Barkley for not taking a time-out during the Knicks’ 10-to-1 run in the last quarter. But the thing that will be most remembered and discussed is LeBron’s weak showing. His 43 minutes’ on court saw him finish with 17 points on 5-for-15 shooting, four assists, plus a game-high eight turnovers.</p> \n<p> Love’s debut appearance was better (19 points, 14 rebounds, four assists), while Kyrie Irving added 22 points and seven assists. But the team’s defense was fairly weak (the Knicks shot 54 percent on the night), its offense scattered (19 turnovers, leading to 26 points for the Knicks) and its bench outscored 41-12 by one of the weakest benches in the league. It seems that everybody has more to work on.</p> \n<p> “It was a special night,” LeBron said afterward. “I’m glad it was great, but I’m also glad it’s over. I didn’t press; I didn’t do much. I was throwing passes where I thought some of my teammates were. Those things will come. It was one game, and we’ve got to learn from it.”</p> \n<p> “I thought we came out with energy and we started well,” former Maccabi Tel Aviv coach Blatt said. “The crowd was fabulous ... and then we got away from playing the way that we’ve played.” Referring to the second half, he said, “We got static. We’re good when we move the ball.”</p> \n<p> About LeBron’s playing, he said, “First of all, that was an emotional night for him, and he wanted badly to win the game and help the team play well. His effort was there. His efficiency was not what it normally is. We’ve got to do a better job of getting him things in motion, not asking him to play from static positions, and help him out when he needs it. And some nights you need it – even a guy like him.”</p>",

        "text":["<p> Israel has invested heavily in the successful absorption of new immigrants, but new numbers of those leaving cast a pall on the success of this endeavor. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, half of the Israelis who left the country in 2012 for more than a year were immigrants who were not born here. A quarter of those leaving were designated as “others,” a term reserved for immigrants deemed Jewish for obtaining citizenship but not according to Jewish law (halakha).</p> \n<p> Yogev Karasenty, an adviser at the Jewish Agency, presented these figures recently at the Knesset against the backdrop of debate on the conversion reform. He believes that the numbers indicate a problem in the process of absorbing these people. “The number of immigrants who came and left is uncomfortably high,” he says. “We’d like to see a much better blending of these immigrants into Israeli society, and we’re convinced that more accessible conversion will change things around.” That’s the new buzz word: “accessible conversion.”</p> \n<p> “Conversion is a process of acceptance into Israeli society,” says Karasenty. “It’s tantamount to serving in the army, and the two have been linked together not coincidentally. These two frameworks give an imprimatur of ‘Israeliness,’ without which a person’s sense of belonging is affected.”</p> \n<p> In response to the claim that the numbers don’t indicate that conversion problems are at fault, Karasenty says anyone thinking otherwise should offer an alternative explanation for the daunting numbers. “Conversion is part of the story, not all of it, but it’s prominent. When you convert, you become part of the larger group and acquire a sense of belonging. When you’re an outsider it’s easier to leave. The fact that even the CBS labels them as ‘others’ highlights their marginalization.”</p> \n<p> Seeking to hear some stories behind the statistics, Haaretz talked to immigrants from the former Soviet Union who have decided to leave Israel, including some of those defined as “others.” Some faced difficulties upon arrival while others felt at home immediately. They all see themselves as Israelis and regard Israel as their home. Those who were considered not Jewish according to halakha said that this was a major component in their sense of not belonging.</p> \n<p> “I came here at the age of nine from Moscow, but I’m defined as ‘other,’ like a pig,” says 34-year-old Neta Kunin bitterly. A year ago she followed her partner to Barcelona. “It’s true that non-Jewish Russians leave because they are treated like second-class citizens. You don’t feel it on a daily basis but when you need to be married or buried you can’t do a thing. I didn’t join the army for that reason – why should I serve and then if anything happens you’ll bury me outside the cemetery?”</p> \n<p> Kunin says the Jewish issue comes up before marriage does. She told men whom she met that she wasn’t Jewish according to Jewish law. “You meet the most secular man, and as he bites into his lobster he declares that his children have to be Jewish,” she relates cynically. She’s had partners who didn’t tell their parents that she wasn’t Jewish. Her parents and grandparents are pressuring her to convert, but she’s had a traumatic experience with the ordeal. She’s tried three times already. “The first time was with a female rabbinic instructor who tortured us any way she could.“ Kunin says the process involves learning how to tell a kosher egg from a non-kosher one, how to be a woman, to cook, to make dishes kosher, with a little bit of Judaism thrown in.</p> \n<p> “I tried again two or three years ago, since I heard a reform had made things easier. It was easier, with men and women together in class, but the lecturer sounded dismissive of our way of life.” What bothered her was that native Israelis don’t have to go through all that to be considered Jewish. “Why should I go through hell, and lie, only to be equal to them? In all these cases women lie to the rabbinical courts. Nobody I know keeps the rules afterwards. The process only produces liars who mock the whole procedure.” She held out longer on her third attempt, but gave up again.</p> \n<p> “I believe that someone who’s lived here for 20 years, speaking Hebrew and working for a living, should be able to take a short test in Jewish history and become Jewish – why all this torture and lying?”</p> \n<p> After a year in Barcelona, no one asks her if she eats kosher or is Christian. She has no intention of returning. “In Israel there is a daily struggle for survival of people who fight each other, looking for ways to vent their frustration.”</p> \n<p> Rabbi Shaul Farber from the Itim NGO, which accompanies immigrants during their conversion process, knows a couple who left after going through it. After a lengthy process they refused to marry when getting their conversion papers, so their conversion fell through. “I don’t think everyone leaves for these reasons, but it is a factor,” he says.</p> \n<p> “The problem is not in halakha, but in the people who are running things. One has to find solutions for people who see themselves as Jewish, as belonging to Jewish communities. Some would say, Let them leave, but I want to tell them that Israel belongs to them too.”</p> \n<p> Kunin believes it’s easier for immigrants to leave since they’ve immigrated once already, unlike Israelis who are rooted here. “I was born in a country that no longer exists, so my home is Israel.”</p> \n<p> Immigrants twice-over</p> \n<p> Lena Dagtiar, also 34, who came to Israel at age 12, agrees. “It was easier for me to leave since I wasn’t born there. Like Kunin, she is not considered Jewish by the Rabbinate. She studied biology in Israel and jumped at an offer from Berlin. The Jewish question is part of the public discourse in Israel, which made her feel she didn’t belong. “They constantly discuss it, making you feel not a part of things.”</p> \n<p> “I told people I wasn’t Jewish, to put things out in the open, and I even considered converting, but then decided that it wasn’t important.” She was mostly angry that her sister couldn’t get married in Israel. “When I came to Berlin I thought I’d return, but that won’t happen soon. What clinched it was the mentality in Israel – everyone is into your personal affairs with an opinion about your lifestyle. In Berlin you get the feeling that you can be whatever you want to and it’s okay. That’s very special.” The economic situation also played a role, since in Berlin she can make ends meet, unlike in Israel. Nevertheless, she still maintains she feels most at home in Israel.</p> \n<p> A., who is Jewish, nevertheless felt like an outsider, like a stigmatized “Russian.” “My children were called names and didn’t want to speak Russian, which annoyed me since we were previously subjected to anti-Semitism in Russia. Here they feel proud of their origins.”</p> \n<p> Others interviewed said they left for better business opportunities, noting that they felt at home in Israel and still do. Only in their new countries did they understand what many immigrants in Israel felt, as outsiders.</p>",

The Subbotniks are a Christian group that embraced Judaism several hundred years ago.</p> \n<p>“We already have third generation Subbotniks living in Israel, some of them even in the Haredi community, and now they’re being told that their grandparents weren’t Jewish,” Sharansky said.</p> \n<p>The definition of a Jew under Israeli law assumes even greater relevancy today, Sharansky said, following recent signs of increased interest in aliyah among descendants of Jews forced to convert to Christianity hundreds of years ago.</p> \n<p>“There are hundreds of thousands of them who want to return to Judaism, and among them, tens of thousands of them who would consider moving to Israel,” he said. “We have to decide now how wide we want to open the gates of the State of Israel and how much effort we want to invest in the continued in-gathering of the exiles.”</p> \n<p>He said the rabbinical conversion courts in Israel also had to decide whether to take a more open-minded “Hillel and Rambam” approach to conversion and welcome all those belonging to the “seed of Israel” - the common term for individuals with Jewish ancestry - or alternatively, to turn them away and say “we’re not interested in you.”</p> \n<p>On another subject, the Jewish Agency chairman said the best way to encourage greater immigration to Israel was to expand programs that bring young Jews from around the world on trips to the country.</p> \n<p>“Programs like Masa, which bring young adults here for 12 months to a year, have proven to be a major success,” he said. “We have 12,000 participants every year in this programs, and among those participants from France and the former Soviet Union, 70 percent end up moving to Israel within a year.”</p>",

        "text":["<p> As we approach the end of this year, we must take stock of two significant developments in Israeli politics in 2011: the protests that enthralled us and our media for many weeks; and the fact that the extreme right, with the support of the conventional right, has launched a frontal, militant attack on left-wing organizations, democracy and the rule of law, both inside and outside the corridors of power. Contrary to appearances, these phenomena are connected.</p> \n<p> As someone who was raised in Europe, the protests were surprising to me in more than one way: the first surprise was their cozily consensual character. The protests reawakened the feeling of national solidarity that had long disappeared from Israeli society. While European protests had previously often ended up in harsh confrontations with the police, the local ones assumed the benign form of a festive and colorful national fair, complete with tents. Cooperation with the government and police was optimal, and a feeling of national solidarity between groups normally separated by class and religious belief quickly developed. The second surprise had to do with the protests’ peacefulness.</p> \n<p> For a society that is often condemned by outsiders and insiders for its violence, this peacefulness over the course of many months was indeed remarkable. Israeli protesters insisted on a pacifist approach, for example, by not attacking political leaders who, in the first few weeks, contemptuously called them “sushi-eaters,” and by not disrupting traffic; indeed, the demonstrators did not use the tactics seen in most other countries. The third surprise was the refusal by protesters to cite specifically the screaming injustice plaguing Israeli society: between the privileges accorded to settlements and to the ultra-Orthodox on the one hand, and those enjoyed by the productive classes inside the Green Line.</p> \n<p> While intellectuals and artists called on the protesters to define their political agenda explicitly, the latter refused to “be political,” and opted instead for a highly pragmatic style of building consensus in a highly polarized society. In a country so intensely divided by political issues, the protesters’ demands took the form of an economic-social revolt (for affordable housing, a lower cost of living, and improved education and health care).</p> \n<p> The final and perhaps most profound surprise was the fact that the protests did not occur much earlier. All the characteristics of the protests and their consensual, peaceful and nonpolitical nature are connected to the activism of the extreme right in both official and illicit ways. Israeli society embodies characteristics from three different types of political regimes. The first is that of a classical social democracy, in which the welfare state and the citizen are bound by a contract: The citizen pays taxes in exchange for the state guaranteeing legal and social rights, free or subsidized education, medical care, employment and security, etc. Most social democracies provide a “neutral” framework whereby productive citizens of diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds can pursue what they define as “the good life,” and are guaranteed both civil rights and a minimal standard of living. In that sense, regardless of their differences, such persons are bound to each other by the connective tissue of citizenship, which provides a common framework that organizes social life. In Israel, such concepts are anchored in the Declaration of Independence.</p> \n<p> Secondly, Israel can be described as a premodern regime, in three respects. The first has to do with the control of land, most of which is not for sale and is not privately owned per se. In the Middle Ages, control of land depended on religious affiliation (for example, a Jew could not own any). Similarly, a substantial amount of land in Israel today is controlled by the Israel Lands Administration because ownership of land is rooted in ethnic and religious categories (in contrast to being simply a commodity, in purely social democracies).</p> \n<p> The second aspect of a premodern regime that is evident in Israel concerns society’s division into “orders” with significant qualitative differences. For example, feudal Europe was divided into three orders: those who pray, those who fight and those who work, each with reciprocal obligations vis-a-vis the other. Israel also has three orders, which, as in the feudal era, do not interact with each other, and have different rights and status: the non-Jews (the majority of them Arabs); Jews who pray and do not fight (Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox who study in yeshivas and are not productive in economic terms), and Jews who both work and fight (by the way, the Orthodox nationalists who both work and fight share far more in common with the class that prays than with the productive class).</p> \n<p> The third characteristic of a premodern regime is that there is a system of privileges whereby one class provides subsistence to the priestly class, because the entire society is oriented toward maintaining religious beliefs and/or sustaining the religious stratum. For example, historically, in Christian Europe the Third Estate worked to provide for the needs of the clergy. In Israel, those who pray, like the Christian clergy in Europe, receive allowances and privileges on the basis of their religious beliefs and practices.</p> \n<p> Finally, the third political regime around which Israeli society is structured is military. Children are raised to become soldiers, and the army plays a particularly large part in the lives of men, instilling in them the virtues of courage, fraternal bonds and self-sacrifice. Indeed, clearly the Israel Defense Forces plays a very prominent role in the country’s economy, culture and political system.</p> \n<p> Dr. Eyal Chowers, a professor of political philosophy at Tel Aviv University, puts it well: He argues that in the territories, the army has played all the roles normally attributed to different branches of government executive, judiciary and legislative. Inside Israel proper, it tends to conflate the various branches of government. The military also shapes people’s attitudes by encouraging nationalism and the view that state security is the supreme concern. Indeed, many political problems, says Chowers, are routinely dismissed because they are trumped by “national threats” or because they are framed as “security” issues, thus further augmenting the military influence over the political and social spheres.</p> \n<p> Defined by Jewishness</p> \n<p> These three political regimes are embodied by a very specific form of citizenship that is unique to Israel, which is at once social-democratic, premodern and military. In comparison with their European counterparts, Israeli citizens are uncannily devoted and compliant to their state: they pay one of the highest rates of taxes in the world; sacrifice their comfort and sometimes even their lives in the army; and, as in the Third Estate, even help subsidize the clergy.</p> \n<p> What has held these three regimes together has been the fact that the welfare state and the military have been defined by the Jewishness of the country. Because Israel was conceived as a Jewish state, the Israeli citizen has been exceptionally compliant to the demands of groups claiming to champion the continuity of that people, precisely because Jewishness has always been the trump card in the political arena. Even security demands are ultimately predicated on the necessity to preserve Jewishness as a common ground uniting the people. Jewishness in turn has been contained in and managed by the welfare state and a social democratic system.</p> \n<p> People who go out to demonstrate often do so in response to forces they do not fully grasp. The protests this summer were a reaction to the fact that the three political regimes are increasingly breaking away from the single framework that held them together, each becoming powerful in distinct arenas, and clashing more and more.</p> \n<p> The protesters were self-consciously apolitical and did not demand an overhaul of the country’s entire social structure per se rather, they sought better conditions of living. But theirs was a political protest, not in the benign sense of a protest organized by a political party, but in a more profound sense: It was sparked by increasing dysfunction in the political system. They protested, at times without knowing it, the fact that something in that system, which once enabled the three regimes to coexist, is becoming untenable.</p> \n<p> Specifically, the premodern and military aspects are increasingly incompatible with those of the welfare state and social democracy, because, first, all over the world today, the legitimacy of a welfare state derives from its capacity to provide high or adequate standards of living; and second, because both market economies and social democracies are ethnically and religiously inclusive instead of being geared toward maintaining ethnic, racial and religious distinctions. This is the main reason why these markets and social democracies are such powerful tools in engineering social peace. In Israel, however, they are severely restricted by the premodern-religious political regime.</p> \n<p> When the Likud came to power some 30 years ago, it started dismantling the socialized economy and the welfare state. This project, one must note, was not met with significant opposition from other sectors of society. In fact, most Israeli middle and working classes were eager to join the global economy, increase competition, attract foreign investors, and move to a full-fledged consumer market. The dismantling of the welfare state resulted in the erosion of public services (the deterioration of the school system and medical care), growing economic concentration and inequality. This was also accompanied by a new conception of social bonds between people, one that is prevalent in most market economies. It is based on self-interest, individualism, a global lifestyle and inclusiveness of any group (such as foreign workers) willing to join the system of production.</p> \n<p> Meanwhile in Israel, however, two other institutions were promoting a contrasting ethos: the clergy and the military. Both demand self-sacrifice and a commitment to the collective, spiritual and territorial defense of the Jewish people. Thus Israeli citizenship has come to be characterized by an odd combination of an intense market-oriented ideology that stresses individualism and competition; economic concentration; strong state control of land; and dismantling of the welfare state and ideologically motivated devotion to the nation as a military and religious collective entity.</p> \n<p> This combination has no parallel in the world. To put it differently: With the exception of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s cut in allowances to the Haredim, the transfer of funding to religious people and other sectors that ostensibly defend the Jewishness of the country (yeshiva students, settlers, etc.) has steadily increased over the last three decades.</p> \n<p> No secular framework</p> \n<p> It can thus be said that the erosion of the welfare state in Israel has been precipitated by three factors, not one, as in other countries. These are: neoliberalism, economic concentration and the increase in the portion of the economic pie allotted to the religious sector. This means simply that secular working people are left without a framework within which to organize their collective identity. Increasingly, Jewish identity or nationalism, or both, are the only remaining ideologies upon which to base a collective existence here.</p> \n<p> The state represents the interests of investors and tycoons, of those who defend Jewish identity and Jewish territory, and to a much lesser extent, the interests of the many others who carry the state on their backs. Thus the protests have been a reaction to the fact that it is becoming increasingly difficult for working and nonreligious citizens to feel represented by the state. The banners that read “An entire generation wants a future” really meant: “An entire generation wants to understand who represents its interests.”</p> \n<p> The rather odd hunger for solidarity and consensus during the protests was due to the fact that in this neoliberal state, so little is left for the hard-working Third Estate to use to organize a common identity.</p> \n<p> Enter the extreme right. Its aggressiveness is an expression of the same processes: that is, it has objectively gained the political and ideological power that came with the dismantling of the welfare state, thanks to the demographic increase in religious populations of all stripes. Where previous secular frameworks of a state of social democracy were able to cope with the diversity of the collective body, now the premodern, religious-oriented regime has gained autonomy and increased power.</p> \n<p> The fact that almost half of all children in elementary schools today are religiously observant is a clear indication that the balance of power has shifted. Instead of the welfare state being the powerful agent managing, regulating, reconciling between the three different regimes, the state itself is being challenged by the representatives of the premodern regime, and on several fronts through violent confrontations with the army and attempts to change the democratic character of Israel’s law and media and muzzle the universities.</p> \n<p> Although different factions within the religious public are attacking democracy in different ways, they have a common interest: namely, the defense of a premodern regime based on religious and ethnic exclusivity. It emerges, however, that the army is stuck in an ambiguous position because it has conflicting interests: It needs the budget provided by a flourishing economy and cannot easily accommodate certain religious restrictions, and yet, increasingly, it is being won over by religious factions that provide it with a new reservoir of messianic ideas about its historical mission of preserving and expanding Jewish territory.</p> \n<p> Because the management of the conflict with our neighbors has become routine, the military needs a new source of rationales and justification for its existence, happily provided by the religious worldview.</p> \n<p> The social protests, in addition to moves by the extreme right, are the tectonic plates beneath Israeli soil, and these plates are now shifting, creating seismic tremors in the social body. For its part, right-wing activism represents the religious, nationalist and military forces that aim to defend the Jewish identity of the country. And that activism, along with the protests, are clear expressions of profound contradictory forces, and of the powerlessness of the welfare state and of social democracy to contain the contradictory regimes of Israeli society.</p> \n<p> Prof. Eva Illouz is a member of the Center for the Study of Rationality and holds the Rose Isaacs Chair in Sociology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A knock on the roof. It almost sounds like a courtesy, a warning at take-off: In the event we decide to reduce the building in which you reside to rubble, you will hear a knock on the roof advising you to move to your nearest exit.</p> \n<p>The Israel Defense Forces, Israeli politicians and others who engage full time in “hasbara,” that problematic art of explaining Israel’s point of view, argue that the IDF is the most moral army in the world, and that it goes above and beyond other militaries at war to avoid civilian casualties. One proof of this is the “roof-knock” procedure, in which a building is subject to a minor missile strike, followed by a truly destructive one a few minutes later.</p> \n<p>The problem is, if you were a Gazan and the IDF gave your building a little rap on the head, would you necessarily know that this was your personal warning to get out? Or would think that you’re already done for? Would you perhaps crouch in the bathroom with your family hoping that if you stay away from the windows, you’d be safe? Would you worry that if you were seen fleeing in panic, you’d be treated as fair game – as anyone moving in the middle of the fighting often is, according to anonymous soldiers’ reports published by Breaking the Silence? And if you understood that this was the knock you’d heard about and you had minutes to get out of the building, would you be able to pull everyone together in time? Would you know which direction to run in? Would you even be sure whether your building was actually hit, as opposed to your neighbor’s?</p> \n<p>I ask this honestly, as a reporter who was once working in Gaza during a round of tension. My colleagues and I were sure the tall building we were in was hit because it shook so violently. It was just an IAF plane breaking the sound barrier, it turned out, as it struck a target elsewhere. And I write this after speaking to colleagues in Gaza, who say average people were often confused and couldn’t tell the difference between a knock and an attack already underway.</p> \n<p>According to the commission of inquiry formed by the UN Human Rights Council, which on Monday released its report into the last conflict in Gaza, known in Israel as Operation Protective Edge, many Palestinians did not understand the “knock” when it came, nor did they know which direction to run in. How many? It’s difficult to know, because the people who didn’t comprehend the arrival of the knock or who otherwise failed to act in time are no longer with us.</p> \n<p>The compilers of the report note that this knock on the roof “may have been effective” in minimizing civilian casualties. But in many cases, it was meaningless as a tool for getting people to flee.</p> \n<p>“In a number of incidents examined, the concerned persons either did not understand that their house had been the subject of a 'roof-knock', or the time given for evacuation between the warning and the actual strike was insufficient,” the report summary states. “In one case examined by the commission, a 22-member family, including nine children, were given just a few minutes to evacuate their home after a 'roof-knock' in the early hours of the morning, while they were asleep; 19 of the 22 people present in the house died. The commission concluded that 'roof-knocks' cannot be considered an effective warning given the confusion they often cause to building residents and the short time allowed to evacuate before the actual strike.”</p> \n<p>(The report did not mention the family name, location or date of this case; a Palestinian journalist in Gaza says it is a reference to the Abu Jamaa family in &nbsp;Khan Younis.)</p> \n<p>The commission says that Israel should have noticed early in the war that its roof-knock warnings were not nearly effective enough.</p> \n<p>“The limited effectiveness of the above-mentioned precautionary measures must have become abundantly clear in the early days of the operation, given that many buildings were destroyed, together with their inhabitants. The apparent lack of steps to re-examine these measures in the light of the mounting civilian toll suggests that Israel did not comply with its obligation to take all feasible precautions before the attacks,” the report said.</p> \n<p>The authors of the report then go on to indicate that Israel’s failure to adjust its approach could point to a broader war-time strategy for which political officials at the highest levels could be held responsible – in other words, right up to the prime minister’s office.</p> \n<p>“The fact that Israel did not revise its practice of air-strikes, even after their dire effects on civilians became apparent, raises the question of whether this was part of a broader policy which was at least tacitly approved at the highest level of government,” the report summary states.</p> \n<p>Of course, much of what we’ll see in the next few days will be a depressing d&eacute;j&agrave; vu of the aftermath of Operation Cast Lead in 2009 and the Goldstone Report. The Palestinian side will say the evidence points to war crimes, and will continue to pursue trying Israel in the International Criminal Court, of which it is now a member. In fact, the summary ends with an exhortation to “cooperate fully with the preliminary examination of the International Criminal Court and with any subsequent investigation that may be opened.” But Hamas, far more so than in 2009, is also taken to task in many places throughout the report &nbsp;- as it should be - for deliberately targeting Israeli civilians, discouraging Palestinians to flee from areas the IDF advised people evacuate from, and sometimes killing its own people when rockets fell short and landed on Palestinians. What changed was the scale: Hamas had longer-range rockets and an extensive system of tunnels into Israel. What’s also new and untested is the role of the ICC, which could be a forum to try not just Israel but the Palestinian Authority and Hamas as well.</p> \n<p>The report is not gospel – it is one attempt at creating a comprehensive report of the war. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in its response Monday that “the entire process that led to the production of this report was politically motivated and morally flawed from the outset.” But Israel could have enabled the accuracy of the fact-finding mission by allowing the commission of inquiry access to Israel and to Gaza, which it did not. Even the Egyptian government collaborated in keeping the gates to Gaza closed as part of this inquiry by refused to facilitate entry to the Strip through the Rafah crossing. The report’s note: “The commission wishes to thank the Government of Jordan for facilitating its two visits to Amman.” In short, this is a commission of inquiry that was as thorough as it could manage to be, given that it was operating from the Jordanian capital.</p> \n<p>Israel has a mess to contend with in the wake of the report into the war that didn’t really end last summer. There are questions that it will likely have to address in legal, diplomatic and political forums. Perhaps one of the questions it must address for its own sake is whether it is possible to go on explaining that the roof-knock and other methods of urging people to flee really minimize the deaths of innocent men, women and children.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>A few years ago I got to know a “mixed” couple (he is Israeli, she’s American). Everybody, including myself, liked the man, who seemed to be a highly moral human being. Around dinner tables, he used to speak frequently about moral problems, just and unjust wars, politicians with and without integrity, redistributive justice for the poor. He had studied courses at university on “moral philosophy,” “justice” and “fairness,” and seemed to spend, in general, a great deal of his thinking on questions of equality and patriotic duty. He not only liked discussing moral topics, he also avoided all gossip, thus projecting a rare aura of trustworthiness. He was a moral man.</p> \n<p>Yet, while I respected the husband, it was his wife who became my friend. She had a sarcastic sense of self-irony and displayed, beyond her assertiveness, a likable vulnerability. With time and the bond of our friendship growing, I became aware she was unhappy: Her husband, she said, spent very little time with her and the children; he resented trips to the grocery store, never cleaned, folded laundry, changed a light bulb or cooked. He was always busy at work, where he stayed long after everyone else had gone to their homes and children, frequently spending Fridays and holidays in an empty building, in his office.</p> \n<p>His wife had other reasons to feel unhappy. Her husband, she confided, rarely gave her marks of love and affection, neither in words nor deeds. Conversations with him quickly turned into a set of moral commands – what she should or should not do. At this point, you will think what I thought to myself for many years but did not dare tell her: “Get a divorce!” But the tragedy of my friend was that she was very confused. Like everyone else, she viewed her husband as deeply moral and loved him for it.</p> \n<p>But unlike everyone else, she felt an immense solitude in his presence. Her husband’s morality made her confused, unable to interpret adequately his absence and neglect. Was she to blame? What responsibility did she bear? She could not tell, precisely because her husband was morally impeccable. Our conversations made her more depressed, as she was struggling to make sense of her situation: the man she loved for his moral identity avoided gestures of love and care, presence and support. We increasingly avoided the topic of her marriage altogether, both knowing our conversations did very little to help her find a solution to her predicament. One day, however, her state of confusion morphed into a new and unknown anxiety: her husband – the moral man – announced he was leaving her for another woman. He had been quietly and carefully planning his exit for many months, and after 14 years of marriage left his wife and children in a few short days. When I asked my friend what he said before leaving, she said she could not remember, but was sure he never offered apologies or regret. He was practical about it, she said, and had “reassured” everybody, including their two young daughters, that they would all get over it soon.</p> \n<p>This story is not interesting because it is about betrayal (a boring topic for stories). Nor because it is about a bad marriage (for which two people always bear responsibility). Rather, the story is interesting because of the role of morality here: the man’s emotional neglect coexisted with his wife’s and his own belief in his morality, a belief that was never altered by his actions. In fact, after he left his home – and after he witnessed the disorientation and general collapse of his family – he became more, not less, convinced of his own moral path. As he told common friends, he had sacrificed his own comfort for the sake of the truth his wife had not dared act upon. “Courage” was the word he used to characterize his behavior. He further convinced himself of his own morality by using a familiar technique: accusing the other side. It was she who was causing him pain and agony by not letting him have all the access he needed to his children. Whatever he had done, he remained the moral man because he remained oblivious to the path he had himself drawn.</p> \n<p>In telling this story, I do not want to point to the discrepancy between the man’s actions and his self-image. Nor do I want to lament – one more time – the role of words in creating a false sense of morality. Instead, I want to point to the role this man’s morality – true or false – played in obscuring the self-awareness of all the protagonists of the story – mostly his wife, who, throughout the years, became paralyzed, confused and depressed because she was unable to align his “morality” with the emotional neglect she experienced. Despite what I assume to have been his many good intentions, the man was oblivious to his own absence and neglect because of, not in spite of, his morality. This man’s morality then obfuscated to him and to his wife the truth of their experience. This story has become my private paradigm to understand the relationship of Israel to peace.</p> \n<p>Israel’s self-image</p> \n<p>People, like nations, devote a great deal of energy to hold high and lofty images of themselves. Peace, for Israel, has been a crucial aspect of its self-image, to itself and to the world. The longing for peace is one of the most powerful sources of moral identity. At the end of the prayer Jews make a collective wish “that God brings peace to Israel.” Diaspora Jews rarely bore arms as Jews and viewed themselves as victims of others’ violence, not as perpetrators of violence. Historically, peace has been the default option of Jews. Zionism itself, while having colonial aspects, also aimed at peace with the bellicose neighbors. For Jews around the world, Zionism was not only a nationalist project, but a moral one as well.</p> \n<p>In fact, Zionism has felt the need to provide endless more proofs of its morality than many nationalist movements: Israel accepted partition, which Arabs had refused; Israel has a democracy; Israel had the only democracy in the Middle East; Israel extended equal rights to its Arab minorities; Israel treated prisoners in a humane way; it made flowers bloom in the desert; it created great socialist utopias; Israel had a moral army. Like my friend’s ex-husband, Israel, in short, has been highly preoccupied with its own morality and has known to give many proofs of it.</p> \n<p>Soon after the Six-Day War, Israel became even more like my friend’s ex-husband: the territories became a source of endless moral reflection and discussions. The territories were the moral stain on Israel; getting rid of them became the moral mission of many. More than that: with the difficulty to accomplish what should have been, after all, fairly trivial (giving back or getting rid of the territories), peace became a verbal industry with its own workers on the payroll: peace declarations, peace treaties, peace agendas, peace politics, peace movements, peace organizations, peace international conferences, secret meetings, semi-secret meetings, NGOs devoting training workshops to youths for the sake of peace, high school students meetings, demonstrations in the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Peace became a busy and buzzing beehive, preoccupied with discussions about the morality or immorality of the country.</p> \n<p>Throughout the years, outstanding moral figures were the moral display-window of peace: Shlomo Ben-Ami, Sami Michael, Uri Avnery, Yael Dayan, Yossi Beilin, Shlomo Ben-Ami, Yossi Sarid, Amoz Oz, Shulamit Aloni, Zahava Gal-On, Gilead Sher – these are only a few names who showed the beautiful and moral conscience of Israel.</p> \n<p>The Right wanted a part in this morality and aligned itself with peace: Menachem Begin became the moral compass of Likud because of his commitment to peace. Peace was, thus, not only a foreign policy program, but, more deeply, a moral identity that Israel could proudly display to itself and to the world.</p> \n<p>Yet, on the ground, while so many different political groups were busy reaffirming the country’s moral identity, Israel actually engaged in policies of neglect, obliviousness and harsh domination. Israel built settlements; used the Israel Defense Forces to defend settlers against victimized Palestinians; rarely enforced law in the territories; engaged in illegal practices with administrative arrests; seized land; strangulated commerce and economic development; decreed embargoes; created roadblocks breaking apart families and geographical movement; destroyed houses; hurt Palestinian children, women and the elderly; incarcerated a huge number of Palestinian men, let trigger-happy soldiers off the hook; retaliated on Palestinians for wanting to be accepted by the UN or for forming a unity government.</p> \n<p>Legitimizing brutality</p> \n<p>As with my friend’s ex-husband who could maintain a sense of moral self-righteousness, all the while trampling on almost every standard of moral behavior, Israel has destroyed the lives of Palestinians without doubting fundamentally its own morality. In fact, the more Israel destroyed the fabric of Palestinians’ lives, the more it explained and legitimized its own brutality with lines such as “There is no partner on the other side;” “There is no one to talk to;” “We made unprecedented offers;” “The Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity”; “The Arabs want to destroy us”; “The Arabs are undemocratic”; “Ask any Israeli Arab if they want to go and live in the New Palestine.”</p> \n<p>I never talked to my friend’s husband after he left their home, but I am sure he could easily have told me: “I made an unprecedented offer” and “there was no one on the other side.” Moral self-righteousness is crucial to accomplish harsh deeds and to remain blind to their meaning and consequences.</p> \n<p>Like my friend’s former husband, Israeli leaders never doubted the legitimacy and necessity of Israel’s actions, since Israel was the naturally born peace lover. Ironically, the moral hyperactivity of the Left helped Israeli leaders maintain a positive image of Israel to the world. A country – like a neglectful husband – can contribute to the collapse of another people and ultimately of its own society, and yet keep its sense of morality intact, because morality can easily become a feeling sustained by discourses, words, university courses, dinner-table discussions, readings and circle of smartly chosen friends whose function is to support one’s choices and actions.</p> \n<p>Peace, of course, is a necessary ideal. I am not suggesting we should get rid of it. Of course Israel is more beautiful with rather than without peace movements. I am simply observing that the moral hyperactivity of Israelis has also obfuscated and mitigated the consciousness of the meaning of Israeli domination over an entire people. It has created the same kind of confusion that paralyzed my friend for such a long time. It creates apathy because, after all, “things are not that bad”; after all, “there are worse regimes” and “we are the more moral ones.” Ironically, moral hyperactivity simply makes it more difficult to recognize callousness and harshness for what they are.</p> \n<p>And thus Israelis and Jews around the world who support Israel are confused because they cannot align their belief in Israel’s morality with an interpretation of the actual political experience created and denied by Israel. The peace industry has, ironically, kept the belief in Israel’s morality strong, further confusing many outside and inside Israel. Israel has drifted far from the initial vocation of Zionism and has become a moral bully, entrenching itself deeper in the conviction of its own morality, forever transferring the moral responsibility of its actions onto others. Israel’s violence cannot be justified any longer by a logic of war or self-defense. Maybe the time has come to put the moral mask down, and abandon the comfort zones afforded by morality as the mirror in which we can avoid looking at the ugliness of Israeli occupation.</p> \n<p>Click here to see the conference program.</p> \n<p>The articles that appear in this section have also been published in Hebrew and Arabic.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>According to the simplistic postmodern discourse theory, there are countless ways, some of them contradictory, to interpret and understand the same text. But even people who subscribe to this theory must assume that there are texts that are exceptions to this rule, whose meaning is unequivocal.</p> \n<p>Sayed Kashua’s most recent column (Haaretz, June 20) was one of those unambiguous texts. Addressing Israeli Jews, Kashua writes that they don’t understand how Arabs feel when they see images of [Arab] children who were killed. He implicitly asks a rhetorical question, the answer to which leaves no room for interpretation: Arabs who see images of Arab children who were killed are likely to feel, according to Kashua, intense hatred toward Jews and to demand vengeance.</p> \n<p>In the next paragraph, Kashua says he wonders how it would be were the Palestinians capable of invading homes in Israel and wresting from their beds, before their families, army commanders, politicians and soldiers who had shot Palestinians. This too is a rhetorical question, the answer to which that Kashua seeks as plain as the sun in the Middle East: that the vengeful Arabs would carry out terrible war crimes against their victims.</p> \n<p>Kashua writes all this for a single purpose: in order to agree, with subdued pain, to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s assertion that the kidnappers of the three Jewish teens are capable of brutal acts, while denouncing the abduction and expressing his disgust at the action. He has only one reservation, which was not sufficient to cancel out the denunciation or the disgust. You, Israeli Jewish occupiers, don’t think you’re any better than we are.</p> \n<p>The reactions to his column from Israeli Jews showed that many of them insist on an interpretation that is the polar opposite of its clear and explicit meaning.</p> \n<p>Alexander Yakobson, in a response, went so far as to accuse Kashua of lacking courage and honesty when it comes to his people (Haaretz, June 23). He wrote this even though his shame over the abduction and the empathy toward the kidnapped children, as Kashua calls them, thinking with dread of his own children, are obvious.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to believe that Yakobson, an expert in ancient Roman history who is familiar with deciphering complex texts, failed to understand the text. The explanation for his reversed interpretation of the column, which is reflected in many Jewish Israeli responses, should apparently be sought elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Consider, for example, Netanyahu’s response to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ remarks on the abduction. In Arabic, in words that cannot be misunderstood, Abbas denounced the abduction. This infuriated his opponents, first and foremost in Hamas, whose rage was demonstrated among other things by distributing cartoons of Abbas wearing an Israeli army uniform. As for Netanyahu, first he cynically dismissed Abbas’ sincere, courageous words out of hand, while nearly depicting him as a partner to the abductors.</p> \n<p>Presumably, if Kashua’s column were translated into Arabic and published on Hamas-associated websites, the next day a caricature of him dressed in IDF uniform, by Haaretz cartoonist Amos Biderman, would be posted on Islamist networks next to the “Zionist” Abbas.</p> \n<p>But this doesn’t confuse Netanyahu, Yakobson and all the other Jewish responders, who are determined to see “the Arabs,” without exception, as bloodthirsty creatures devoid of any humanity at worst or cowardly and self-righteous at best. According to their view, Arabs never really intend to denounce Arab violence – even if they do repeatedly, in a voice that is loud and clear.</p> \n<p>It appears, therefore, that for many Israeli Jews it is easy to perpetuate the sweeping demonization of the Palestinian Arab public and difficult to recognize that among “the Arabs” there are also people who condemn, harshly and sincerely, the violent resistance to the occupation.</p> \n<p>It’s clear why the continued demonization of the Palestinians and the obtuse deafness to the moderate Palestinian voices that don’t shrink from self-criticism are good for Netanyahu. It’s easier to continue to perpetuate the occupation when the occupied side is described as lacking humanity or at best dishonest.</p> \n<p>It’s not clear why the collective degradation of “the Arabs” is so popular with more than a few Israeli “centrists,” who day and night swear their allegiance to the two-state solution and the “end of the occupation.”</p> \n<p>Is it possible that some of them lack the courage and honesty to admit they’re not really prepared for a just division of sovereignty between the two nations of this land?</p>",

However, its fate was sealed just seconds into the launch when a lump of foam came loose during takeoff and punctured the leading edge of one of Columbia's wings.</p> \n<p>David Baker, who worked on the shuttle program, told the BBC that during research for an upcoming lecture at the British Interplanetary Society, &quot;he studied plans that suggest that a dramatic and audacious orbital rescue mission could have been launched – if only Mission Control had known about the danger in time.&quot;</p> \n<p>According to Baker, the Atlantis space shuttle was close to being ready for a March 1 launch when Columbia lifted off on January 16. Columbia only had enough supplies to keep the astronauts alive for 30 days, so a rescue mission would have required recognizing the problem by Day 2 and speeding up the preparation schedule for Atlantis from six weeks to four weeks.</p> \n<p>If that could have been accomplished, then Atlantis could have been sent into an orbit bringing it within six degrees to Columbia at a 90 degree angle – requiring skilled piloting to prevent the tails from colliding. With a reduced crew of four astronauts, while two of them would pilot the Atlantis, the other two would begin the rescue, first bringing over lithium hydroxide canisters to reduce life-threatening carbon dioxide levels on the Columbia. Then the Atlantis astronauts would position an extendable pole between the two shuttles to guide the crew of the Columbia to safety.</p> \n<p>Two by two, the Columbia crew would spacewalk to the Atlantis, in a process that would take at least 48 hours because of the time it takes to don a space suit and avoid a fateful mistake when moving from airlock to airlock, explained Baker.</p> \n<p>So why did NASA never attempt such a rescue mission?</p> \n<p>“The big mistake was not having a sufficiently detailed and intensive analysis soon enough,” Baker told the BBC. “It just didn’t appear the damage was going to be that bad until, as evidence built day by day, it became very clear.”Another issue was that NASA did not display the &quot;failure is not an option&quot; attitude that saved the lives of the Apollo 13 astronauts when their spacecraft was damaged on the way to the moon in 1970, added Baker.</p> \n<p>“It would have been possible but frankly the mindset at NASA was so rigid compared to the lightening decisions and quick responses we had during Apollo,” he said.</p>",

People rushed into the main streets in Gaza, either checking the damage left by the 30-day Operation Protective Edge or getting the basic necessities they had been deprived of while stuck indoors.</p> \n<p>At the fancy toy store, Jihan Qannu’,25, was choosing new toys for her two daughters, who seemed delighted to be walking in the street again. Qannu’ said she wanted to take the children to an entertainment zone, but none of them were open.

Everyone was saying, “thank God you are still fine,” whether you know them or not.</p> \n<p>Abu Ali, 45, was walking with his children near a huge&nbsp;government compound that had been reduced to rubble. He and his children gazed at the building for a while; they seemed choked with emotion.</p> \n<p>“I went out into the street because I’m missing it and I’m missing the air, but Gaza is no longer the way it was; it’s totally devastated,” he said, displaying the mixed emotions of happiness at being alive, along with his children, and sadness for the hundreds killed and injured.</p> \n<p>The number of people at one of the UNRWA schools, where thousands of residents from Al-Shejaiya and the northern neighborhoods have been sheltering, was lower than than it had been in recent weeks. People had gone to check up on their houses.

        "text":["<p>Hanukkah is the holiday probably best known in the English-speaking world as the hard-to-pronounce, impossible-to-spell Jewish alternative to a certain winter festival that involves a fat bearded man, the Middle Eastern birth of a deity and, sometimes, snow.</p> \n<p>Sure, the English spelling differs from greeting card to greeting card. But that’s just because Chanukah/Channuka/Hanukkah is a transliteration of the Hebrew, and the world hasn’t quite reached unanimous agreement on how or when to add an “h” at the end of a Hebrew word, double up on certain consonants or, most importantly, express the guttural “kh” sound often described as the kind you might make if you had a fish bone stuck in the back of your throat.</p> \n<p>Here’s Hanukkah’s dirty little secret: As long as everyone knows what you’re talking about, it doesn’t actually matter how you spell the name of the Festival of Lights in English (though many publications, including this one, go with the Associated Press spelling for consistency’s sake). So let’s set aside the English spelling conundrum and take a look at the Hebrew word.</p> \n<p>Desecration of the temple</p> \n<p>Americans can take comfort in the fact that they're not the only ones who have trouble pronouncing the name of this holiday. Israelis get it wrong too, typically pronouncing it KHA-noo-ka, though the formal (albeit widely ignored) pronunciation is supposed to be kha-noo-KA. Either way, that fish-bone sound at the beginning is all-important, followed by a “noo” that rhymes with “moo” (rather than one that, as in the common Anglicized pronunciation, resembles the vowel sound in “nook” or “book”).</p> \n<p>The name of the holiday, Hanukkah, comes from the Hebrew word for “dedication,” “consecration” or “inauguration.” It refers to the Jews’ rededication of the Second Temple in the second century B.C.E., after the Hellenistic Greeks of Syria had desecrated it by using it for the worship of Greek gods and the sacrifice of (famously non-kosher) pigs.</p> \n<p>A popular children’s song for the holiday begins with the words: “The days of Hanukkah, hanukkat mikdasheinu [the dedication of our Temple], fill our hearts with joy and gladness.”</p> \n<p>Some sources are specific when describing what exactly was rededicated. The non-canonized book I Maccabees, which tells the story of Hanukkah, relates: “And they celebrated hanukkat hamizbe’ah [the dedication of the altar] for eight days, and they brought sacrifices with joy in their hearts.”</p> \n<p>The term hanukkat hamizbe’ach is also used in the Bible, to refer to King Solomon’s dedication of the First Temple (2 Chronicles 7:9) and in the traditional Hebrew song “Maoz Tzur,” often sung right after lighting Hanukkah candles.</p> \n<p>A spiritual victory</p> \n<p>The story of Hanukkah is one of a Maccabean military victory and - at least as significantly - a spiritual victory over Hellenistic attempts to prohibit Jewish practices.</p> \n<p>This spiritual victory is symbolized by the Jews’ discovery of a single sealed, pure vial of olive oil to light the seven-branched menorah (pronounced in Hebrew as me-no-RA), one of the primary ritual objects in the Temple. According to the Hanukkah story, though the oil was enough for just one day, it miraculously lasted for eight, and we commemorate this by lighting Hanukkah candles or oil lamps for (as Adam Sandler would have it) eight crazy nights.</p> \n<p>The Hebrew spelling of Hanukkah also serves as a mnemonic device, reminding us that the date of the holiday is the 25th of the Hebrew month of Kislev, as represented by the last two Hebrew letters of the holiday, which are equivalent to 25 in the Hebrew alphanumeric system.</p> \n<p>A rabbinical dispute</p> \n<p>If the Hebrew word is broken down a different way, it can remind us of one of the key religious rulings regarding the method of candle lighting – and an argument between two schools of rabbinical thought about the order in which the candles should be lit.</p> \n<p>In this breakdown, the first two letters stand for “eight candles,” since het is eight in the alphanumeric system and nun is the first letter of nerot, the Hebrew for “candles.” The rest of the word (the letters vav, kaf, heh) is an acronym for vehalakha k’veit Hillel, “and the religious ruling follows Beit Hillel.”</p> \n<p>This refers to a dispute between two groups of scholars over whether one should light eight candles on the first night and dwindle down to one or, as members of Hillel’s school of thought argued, light one candle first and an additional one every night of the holiday, since we should strive to increase sanctity rather than diminish it. The Hillel school won out</p> \n<p>As for what exactly to call the eight-branched Hanukkah candelabra (plus a separate branch for the extra shamash candle): it is popularly known by many English speakers as a menorah, and before the revivification of the Hebrew language it was known as a Hanukkah menorah in Hebrew as well. But in modern-day Israel, if you’re looking for the holiday candelabra, you should call it a hanukkiah (derived, naturally, from the name of the festival).</p> \n<p>The State of Israel may have chosen the menorah of Temple times to represent the country on the state emblem, but ask an Israeli shopkeeper for one and you may find yourself wondering why he's offering you a night light (menorat layla), a desk lamp (menorat shulhan) or perhaps a wall fixture (menorat kir). Hanukkah may last only eight days, but get thee to a light fixtures store like a house on fire, and you’ll find that in Israel we use menorahs all year long.</p> \n<p>This article was originally published in December 2014</p>",

For the first minute and 33 seconds of the video clip, Cohen is shown without any other police officers around while he curses, head butts and hits Shweiki and others who tried to help him.</p> \n<p>For ordinary citizens, this is a rare opportunity to view police violence in its worst and crudest way. The violence, as seen in the film, was so outrageous that everyone rushed to condemn the acts and Cohen immediately: Alsheich, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, Knesset members Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi) and Ahmad Tibi (Joint List). No one remained unmoved.</p> \n<p>They all called to bring the police officer to justice and Alsheich immediately summoned him for a hearing, after which Cohen was suspended. Alsheich sent out a message on the matter to the entire police force in which he wrote: &quot;This is an exceptional incident that has no place in the Israel Police.&quot;</p> \n<p>But one minute and 33 seconds after the video begins, something happens that shows that as opposed to what the police claim, Cohen works in an organization where violence against civilians has become routine, acceptable. In those last 16 seconds a few of his colleagues from the unit enter the picture and see him acting violently, kicking Shweiki in the back and knocking him to the ground, bleeding from his head.</p> \n<p>And what do those policemen do? They stand there and prevent the others from interfering. It may be only a few seconds, but in those seconds not a single police officer can be seen trying to stop their colleague from going crazy, or helping Shweiki, who is lying on the road.</p> \n<p>The police spokesperson's office said the officer was suspended immediately when the video was received. &quot;He will be summoned for a hearing to consider the continuation of his service in the police.&quot;</p> \n<p>The police's announcement confirms that Cohen's colleagues were obligated to this conspiracy of silence, and not to the public. None of those present during the attack filled out a report in which they noted that Shweiki was harshly beaten, or called their commanders and informed them of the incident. They stood there and prevented the people in the vicinity from interfering with Cohen and preventing him from continuing his attack.</p> \n<p>This conspiracy of silence remains strong, certainly at a time when Alsheich allows himself to take the stage in front of his police force and says he does not have &quot;peace of mind&quot; about anonymous complaints against them. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>If the Justice Ministry's department for investigating police officers wants to deal with the problem, they must show a bit more responsibility than what Erdan, Smotrich, Alsheich and the others showed, and not just make do with an investigation against Cohen only. The Justice Ministry investigators must also summon Cohen's colleagues who were present and did not report on the incident.</p> \n<p>The last 16 seconds of the video show that violence is still deeply rooted within the police, and the only thing that can save us from this violence and false arrests for attacking police officers is if someone in the vicinity has enough courage to film what is going on.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Being friendly and considerate to locals when traveling is always good advice, but the Russian Foreign Ministry seems to think much more specific instructions are needed for its citizens traveling the globe to &quot;avoid undesirable incidents.&quot;</p> \n<p>Advice such as not to overindulge on alcohol is one thing, but the ministry's consular department felt it necessary to issue a document telling Russians not to compare Kenyans to monkeys, not to use offensive language or expressions (such as extending your middle finger to people) found in Hollywood movies, act overly familiarly with strange women and not to call Israelis &quot;zhids.&quot;</p> \n<p>The advice, provided by the ministry as a public service before the summer vacation season, also includes such good advice as when in countries with a sizable black population avoid using the &quot;N-word&quot; and its derivatives. &nbsp;But the advice (in the original Russian) often seems to say more about what the Russian Foreign Ministry thinks about its own citizens than the countries they visit.</p> \n<p>Alongside such advice as do not touch or stroke the head of a Thai or use the two-fingered &quot;V&quot; sign in Turkey (where it does not mean victory but is a sign of support for Kurdish independence), ordering meals in French without knowing the language and correct pronunciation can lead to &quot;conflicts.&quot; Instead ask for a menu in Russian or English. It is also advisable in France &quot;not to respond to members of the LGBT community and not to insult them&quot; with words or gestures.</p> \n<p>The ministry gives specific advice for Russian visitors to over 25 countries, including Israel, though for some reason, the ministry does not have specific advice for visiting the United States.</p> \n<p>The level of linguistic tolerance in Israel is relatively low and visitors can often hear Russian curse words &quot;brought by Jewish immigrants to Palestine in the early Twentieth Century.&quot; But tourists are still advised not to use Yiddish and Arabic swear words, including &quot;schmuck&quot; and putz,&quot; along with Arabic obscenities such as &quot;sharmuta.&quot;</p> \n<p>Using the word &quot;zhid&quot; in Israel, which in Russia is considered to be derogatory though not in other languages such as Polish or Czech, is &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; in Israel for any Jew, &quot;even if they do not understand Russian.&quot;</p> \n<p>In an attempt to explain the differences between Russian and Western customs and values, Russian tourists in Denmark are encouraged to keep their distance and avoid questions of a personal nature such as about income, employment and religion. &nbsp;&quot;Also, do not touch on the topics of racial and ethnic origin and sexual orientation.&quot;</p> \n<p>As for Canada, the authors of the document were even more direct: Canadians have a &quot;serious obsession&quot; with gender equality, so avoid telling sexist jokes or making fun of those with &quot;nontraditional&quot; sexual orientation.</p> \n<p>In Finland, Russians should avoid swearing because many Finns know the vocabulary, and try to remain calm when hearing common Finnish names that sound like filthy Russian expressions.</p> \n<p>A final recommendation for visitors to Israel is to &quot;take into account the heightened sensitivity of the Israelis to almost all kinds of criticism of both the State of Israel and any aspects of the life there.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Ever since Ariel Sharon sank into a coma eight years ago, many have wondered whether he would have taken the peace process with the Palestinians any further after the 2005 withdrawal from Gaza.</p> \n<p>A series of cables from the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to the State Department that were leaked to WikiLeaks show that in fact, even before the Gaza withdrawal, Sharon was planning his next big diplomatic move. Moreover, leaked Palestinian documents show that after Yasser Arafat’s death in November 2004, and even more so once Mahmoud Abbas was elected Palestinian president the following January, Sharon made efforts to coordinate the Gaza withdrawal with the Palestinian Authority.</p> \n<p>The disengagement plan was approved by the Knesset on October 26, 2004, after a stormy debate.&nbsp;Only a month later, on November 30, 2004, Sharon hosted two U.S. senators in his office – Chuck Hagel, who is now defense secretary, and Joe Biden, now vice president.&nbsp;According to an American cable, Sharon stressed to Biden and Hagel that he was committed to making peace with the Palestinians despite the major domestic struggles he would face “from a left that has no power, and a right which was totally opposed to his initiative.”&nbsp;Sharon told them that the post-Arafat era had presented &quot;a new opportunity&quot; to coordinate the Gaza withdrawal with the Palestinians.&nbsp;The report added that Sharon assured them that if disengagement went off successfully, the Road Map could then be implemented in stages, as had been envisioned by then-U.S. President George W. Bush.</p> \n<p>On December 27, 2004, Sharon met with Sen. Joseph Lieberman and told him that after disengagement, he wanted to return to implementing the Road Map, on condition that the Palestinians fight terror. “Israel does not expect Abu Mazen [Abbas] to be a Zionist, but steps need to be taken against terrorism,” he said.</p> \n<p>In his summary of that meeting, then-U.S. Ambassador Dan Kurtzer makes it clear that Sharon had no intention of stopping with the Gaza withdrawal, but planned to take far-reaching steps in the West Bank and Jerusalem. Kurtzer noted that Sharon put emphasis on annexing the major settlement blocs, implying he would concede other parts of the West Bank, and that while he would not even discuss dividing Jerusalem, he would consider handing over some Arab neighborhoods, “but not the Temple Mount, Mount of Olives or the City of David.”</p> \n<p>Two weeks later, on January 10, 2005, Sharon again met with U.S. senators, including Biden. According to Kurtzer’s summary, Sharon said, “If Palestinians do their part on security, Israel and the Palestinians can return to the Road Map. A final settlement might take a few years, but it can be achieved.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, documents from the Palestine Liberation Organization negotiations department, which were leaked in January 2011 to Al-Jazeera, reveal that after Abbas was elected Palestinian president in 2005, Sharon attempted to coordinate the Gaza pullout with the PA. On February 8, 2005, Sharon and Abbas held a summit at Sharm al-Sheikh that was meant to mark the end of the second intifada and a new start between Israelis and Palestinians. The six-page Arabic protocol of the meeting shows that the encounter was positive and the atmosphere almost playful at times.</p> \n<p>Abbas told Sharon that he was determined to assert control over the security situation, battle the smuggling through Gaza tunnels, and stop incitement against Israel in the Palestinian media. He also asked Sharon to release the pre-Oslo security prisoners, the same prisoners whom Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would finally release over eight years later. Abbas also suggested setting up a covert channel for holding talks on a permanent arrangement.</p> \n<p>Sharon, in turn, offered to withdraw the Israeli army from several Palestinian cities and take down roadblocks. He did not agree to release the prisoners Abbas wanted, but agreed to free 900 others. He also made it clear that unless the Palestinians cracked down on terror, there could be no diplomatic progress. “I’m determined to carry out the disengagement and I want it to be coordinated with you, particularly with regard to security and property,” Sharon said. “We must tighten our security cooperation. I want to do big things but I cannot accept terror.”</p> \n<p>Three months later, Sharon began losing his patience. On May 30, 2005, he met with several members of Congress, telling them that the previous night a rocket fired from Gaza had landed near the entrance to a packing house on his ranch. According to Kurtzer’s report, Sharon stressed that the Gaza rockets were causing the Israeli public to lose faith in him, and that “his internal situation is exacerbated by every act of terror.”</p> \n<p>Three weeks later, on June 22, 2005, only two months before disengagement, Sharon, Abbas and their advisers met again, this time at the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem. It was a far less pleasant meeting than the one three months before. A summary document written by the PLO negotiations department states that Abbas and his advisers left the meeting frustrated, calling the meeting a&nbsp;recycling of the Sharm al-Sheikh arrangements.</p> \n<p>According to the document, Sharon spent the first 15 minutes of the meeting complaining about the Palestinians' lack of willingness to fight terror, saying that Abbas &quot;failed to live up to his promise.&quot; In attempt to thwart these accusations, Abbas said that violence is not a Palestinian interest and that &quot;every bullet that is aimed in the direction of Israel is a bullet aimed at the Palestinians as well.&quot;</p> \n<p>“In the end, the only deliverable Abu Mazen could report was an agreement to issue more [work] permits,” the Palestinian summary states. “There was no agreement on prisoners, no progress on the airport, nothing on easing movement in the West Bank, and nothing on the internal closures.”</p> \n<p>Still, the document notes, Sharon hinted that if there was calm during the disengagement operation, “Israel will be able to take further steps in the future. If there are terror attacks, however, the disengagement will be put on hold.”</p> \n<p>Half a year after that meeting with Abbas, Sharon suffered a minor stroke, and three weeks later a major cerebral hemorrhage from which he never recovered. It’s hard to know whether and how he would have implemented the plans he had sketched out to the Americans and the Palestinians. The documents show that Sharon became increasingly skeptical about the Palestinians as disengagement got closer. Nevertheless, he did not at the time correctly assess what would happen only two years later, after his debilitation.</p> \n<p>In a meeting on March 14 with U.S. Senator Carl Levin, Sharon said he did not expect Hamas to take over Gaza after Israel withdrew. He asserted that Hamas was worried that Israel would hit it harder after withdrawing because the Israeli government would no longer have to take the safety of the Gaza settlers into account.</p>",

        "text":["<p>One of my father’s most distinct memories as a Jewish child in Germany at the start of the Nazi regime was a frightening visit to the family home by his uncle Walter one evening in 1933. Pale as a ghost and dripping with sweat, Uncle Walter walked into my father’s house. He could barely stand on his feet. But after they helped him sit down and he had taken a sip from the glass of wine set down before him, the look of terror on his face turned into a look of shame.</p> \n<p>“I was cast under a spell,” he murmured, breaking down in tears before his shocked hosts. Once he had calmed down a bit, he told them what had happened. On his way from the railway station to his sister’s home, Walter happened to pass by a mass gathering of the Nazi Party. At first he was seized by fear, imagining what the inflamed mob might do to him, but once he understood that his Aryan looks disguised his Jewish origins, he was swept into an odd sensation of inquisitiveness and attraction.</p> \n<p>When the huge crowd began to sing the party anthem, he tentatively joined in quietly, but gradually raised his voice. After that, Walter found himself drawn with an uncontrollable fervor into the cheering of the masses. When Adolf Hitler rose to the stage, Walter stood at attention, raised his right hand stiffly, and shouted as loud as he could, “Sieg Heil!”</p> \n<p>Walter’s emotional pull to the fervent fascist “togetherness” ritual clouded over the fact that the Nazi ideology that so greatly attracted him at that moment saw him, a Jew, as its primary enemy.</p> \n<p>In recent years, an increasing amount of evidence has been produced that suggests that our political behavior is governed mainly by emotion, with fairly little of it governed by rationality. This evidence contradicts the way many of us think about political processes and elections. The “rational choice” school of thought in political science, which has been influenced by such philosophers as Kant and Hobbes, has been the dominant school of thought in political science theory since the mid-20th century.</p> \n<p>Outside the academic world, political campaign managers and media people employ logical arguments, on the assumption that the public is earnestly weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each candidate and analyzing the implications of each proposed policy. We voters also use rational arguments to explain our choices and to persuade others to vote in a certain manner, despite the fact that these arguments may hold little sway over our final decisions.</p> \n<p>The now-iconic slogan coined by James Carville during Bill Clinton’s 1992 election campaign, “[It’s] the economy, stupid,” reflects the public’s common wisdom in both the United States and Israel: that economic considerations have a major influence on voters’ decisions. But this is wrong as far as Israel is concerned.</p> \n<p>The two most recent election campaigns in Israel, which were waged in the context of a broad-based economic protest, show just how wrong this supposition is. Economic or other interests have very little effect on our decisions as voters, which is pretty sad, since this means that we are sacrificing our interests on the altar of our psychological intelligence.</p> \n<p>The new findings regarding the effect our emotions exert on our decisions as voters are related to other revelations that are even more surprising. A large share of our political orientation is not determined during the days and years following birth, but about nine months prior to it.</p> \n<p>American political scientists Peter Hatemi and Rose McDermott edited an anthology of articles in 2011 that reviewed numerous research studies conducted during the previous decade on the connection between genetics and political orientation. Although no one among us is a Likudnik or a leftist from birth, certain combinations of gene types can trigger behavioral tendencies, which in combination with social factors can help predict an individual’s political orientation.</p> \n<p>Personality structure</p> \n<p>These and other findings explain why rationality plays a secondary role in the determination of our political behavior. Rationality and logic are universal. Everyone uses the same logic (although some people use it more than others), but morality and feelings are unique and personal. They stem from our personality structure, and it is they that make each one of us different from everyone else.</p> \n<p>People whose personality structure tends toward compliance and fear of change may be expected to display a partiality for a right-wing or conservative party more frequently than others. Those who are more influenced by feelings of solidarity and empathy will, likewise, according to the above-mentioned anthology, vote for a leftist party with a social platform. And anyone whose personality emphasizes liberty and revulsion for authority will vote for a liberal party. Supporters of the right who demand that their party adopt a policy of compassion in the economic realm represent another combination of personality traits.</p> \n<p>There is no such thing as unequivocal identification with any one political orientation; it is merely a statistical proclivity. However, in the same way that our personality affects our style of dress, the design of our apartment or the way we spend our leisure time – it also influences our political choices.</p> \n<p>All of the behaviors I have enumerated above, and many others, affect the nature of how we communicate with our social surroundings. They indicate to others who we are and with whom we may prefer to become friendly.</p> \n<p>The very decision to head to the ballot box and take part in an election is mainly an emotional decision. Political scientists term this the “voting paradox.” Going to the polling station to influence the outcome of an election can’t be considered a rational decision, as it involves substantial effort; for an action to be considered rational, it must generate a certain benefit that could be measured by a cost-effectiveness calculation.</p> \n<p>Practically speaking, each one of us on his own has very little chance of changing the result of the election by his vote. Throughout the history of democracy, there has not even a single case, anywhere in the world, of a national election being decided by a single vote. Nevertheless, most of us go to vote on Election Day, and it is a good thing we do.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Why? Because the benefit that accompanies the vote is emotional, not practical. Were our considerations merely practical, many of us would simply call a friend or acquaintance who supports the rival party, reach a gentleman’s agreement with him about having our votes cancel each other out – and stay home. But that isn’t how we behave. We want to be there at the polling station and put the slip in the ballot box ourselves. No one can take our place in this action, because voting is primarily a matter of expression, and less a matter of outcome.</p> \n<p>In a study published several years ago by Esteban Klor, who teaches economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and myself, we analyzed data on the habits of voter participation in the gubernatorial races in several American states. We found that the habits associated with going to vote are very similar to those involving going to a stadium for a football game. The chance that you, as a fan, will go the trouble of buying a ticket and heading to a game will increase when the teams are more closely matched, and when the team that you root for has a slightly better chance of winning. After all, we enjoy the game more when our team wins than when it loses.</p> \n<p>So too, ideology, as opposed to what most of us may think, is mainly rooted in emotions and less in rationality. Imagine a world in which ideology is derived from pure rationality, without any emotional deviation. In a world like that, there would be no need for political arguments between intelligent people. If all of us are exposed to the same facts and employ the same system of logic – it is incumbent upon us to reach the same conclusions. We will still wish to wield political power, because we have different interests (one profits from high taxes, the other from low taxes), but we will never disagree on subjects such as which economic policy will benefit the majority of the country’s citizens, or what is the proper policy to reduce terror.</p> \n<p>The fact that we continue to argue about these subjects without end, without the debate ever being decided, is evidence that there is something else beside rationality to our ideological orientations. That other thing is our personal and subjective taste. But in matters of taste, there can be no disputes, and so arguments almost never help to bridge ideological differences. Almost always, they end where they began.</p> \n<p>The following are two among many studies that offer evidence on the emotional factor in ideology that we espouse in our moral orientation.</p> \n<p>1. Pazit Ben-Nun Bloom, of the Hebrew University, examined the political-moral position of subjects as it related to adoption by homosexual couples. Some of the subjects were “primed” by means of viewing pictures of disgusting food. Ben-Nun Bloom found that those exposed to the pictures displayed a more stridently negative stand on the adoption issue, even when they were asked to express their opinions on the topic in a rational manner, without emotional involvement.</p> \n<p>2. Ran Hassin, also of Hebrew University, demonstrated that subliminal priming can affect political orientation. Israeli subjects who were asked to answer political questions by computer were exposed to an image of the Israeli flag for a split second. Although they could not consciously identify it in that amount of time, the stimulus did affect their political orientation.</p> \n<p>The political orientation of the subjects who were exposed to the flag tended on average toward the center, whereas those who were not exposed to the stimulus showed more extreme orientation (to both the left and the right). Similar outcomes were received in a parallel experiment conducted in the United States. Hassin, who conducted his experiments a few weeks before the elections in Israel, claims that some of the priming’s effect persisted until Election Day and influenced subjects’ actual voting.</p> \n<p>In cases in which the dry facts contradict our subjective bias, it will be this bias that dictates our political behavior. We will grant greater attention to facts that substantiate our political views, and we will screen out the facts that show our position to be wrong, all the while fooling ourselves into believing that our political tastes are backed by pure logic.</p> \n<p>In order to prove this phenomenon, it is sufficient to note how supporters of both the left and the right in Israel back up their political views on the issue of our relationship with the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>This issue contains one element that is purely moral/emotional. Many members of the right, and especially the Orthodox Jews among them, would claim that relinquishing parts of the Land of Israel is unacceptable, by virtue of our moral obligation as Jews, even if occupation of the territories does nothing to contribute toward our security, and even if it leads to a perpetual state of war. On the other hand, many leftists would claim that domination over another people is morally unacceptable, and that it should be brought to an end even at the cost of the personal security of citizens of Israel.</p> \n<p>If we were capable of distinguishing between the emotional/moral sources of our political views, on the one hand, and their rational underpinnings, on the other, we would see a lot of members of the right claiming as follows: Without a doubt, domination of the Palestinians is harmful to the security and economy of the State of Israel. But we are nonetheless forbidden from ceding even an inch of land to the Palestinians because it is morally unacceptable.</p> \n<p>We would also find a lot of members of the left who would claim something like this: Without a doubt, if we did not control the Palestinians, we would be living a much more difficult and dangerous life here, but nevertheless our control of the Palestinians should be brought to an end due to its inherent moral unacceptability.</p> \n<p>Ask yourselves how many people on the left or on the right maintain these views and explain their positions based on these arguments.</p> \n<p>Gun control</p> \n<p>Charles S. Taber and Milton Lodge, of Stony Brook University, have demonstrated how we are biased in our reasoning when it comes to political questions. Subjects in the laboratory were asked to express their opinion on issues related to gun control in the United States. Afterward, they were presented with a list of claims that have been used by lobbyists working for organizations that seek to influence legislation in Congress on the subject. This list included both claims for and against gun control.</p> \n<p>The subjects were asked to rank the strength of the different arguments, and were told that their ranking should relate solely to the rationality of the argument and have nothing to do with moral sentiments. As expected, the rankings of those who sided with stricter gun control were very different from those who were opposed to it. Each respondent awarded higher rankings to those arguments that supported his own initial position.</p> \n<p>Similar results were obtained when the issue was affirmative action. In both instances, the subjects’ subjective ideological views eclipsed their ability to weigh rational arguments in objective fashion.</p> \n<p>In order to understand how greatly our common sense can be compromised, such that we become captive to an ideological stand, it is worth recalling Trofim&nbsp;Lysenko, Stalin’s eminent agronomist, who studied way to increase Soviet wheat yields in the 1930s and ‘40s.</p> \n<p>Lysenko was so thoroughly in love with socialist ideology that he managed to convince himself, as well as the entire Soviet Union, that wheat could be “educated” to produce higher yields by means of a mechanism that would force it to become accustomed to harsh environmental conditions of temperature and humidity. He had his “wheat gulag” kernels saturated with water and planted deep in the snows of the Siberian plains, fully expecting a yield three times the usual crop. It never came to pass.</p> \n<p>Our craving for ideology means that we are partial to ideological leaders. Researcher Gian Vittorio Caprara and his associates at the Sapienza University of Rome demonstrated that voters usually seek to support a leader who is similar to them in terms of personality structure. Ideology helps us identify emotionally with leaders. Leaders who avoid emphasizing their ideological stances are conceived by the electorate, perhaps erroneously, as opportunists who entered politics for their own benefit, rather than for the good of the public. This also happens when a leader espouses a rightist policy on one issue and a leftist policy on another.</p> \n<p>In addition to the position assumed by personality in determining our ideology and our political orientation, group identity is an important factor influencing our Election Day choices. Political orientations are frequently handed down from generation to generation, or from friend to friend, via education and socialization. Voters considering diverging from the traditional choice of their family members, friends or ethnic group may even feel that they are betraying their group. Here, as well, the solution often lies in downplaying the importance of facts and complying with the herd diktat.</p> \n<p>However, our craving for ideology (which as we know today is primarily driven by emotions) exacts a heavy cost from us as a society, as it creates terrible incentives for the decision makers we appoint. Politicians are a great deal more rational than we the voters are. First and foremost, they are guided by instincts of political survival. Our need for ideology compels them to embrace one or another in order to satisfy us. Politicians will even convince themselves of this ideology in order to appease us, persuading us of their sincerity.</p> \n<p>Yet this situation goes against our interests as a public. There is no one ideology that is better than the others when it comes to the subjects about which we have to decide, except for the ideology that opts for choosing the best policy on each different subject, in a manner that is not dependent on political orientation.</p> \n<p>We need leaders who will make smart decisions that are aligned with the public interest. At times this kind of decision may be leftist in orientation, at times it may be rightist. We should not force our leaders to adopt an ideological line that will compel them to reach erroneous decisions out of a desire to comply with said ideology.</p> \n<p>Ideology, which was conceived in the late 19th century amid big promises of a better society, found itself one century later with very few successes and with hundreds of millions of victims, murdered by the greatest ideologues of all times: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. If we can understand our craving for it and the manner in which it distorts our judgment, there is a chance that we will one day learn how to dispense with it. When that happens, all of us will live a better life.</p> \n<p>Eyal Winter formerly headed the Center for the Study of Rationality at Hebrew University, and is author of “Feeling Smart: Why Our Emotions Are More Rational Than We Think” (PublicAffairs, 2014).

        "text":["<p>The District Court in Nazareth on Wednesday sentenced Yaakov Deutsch, the prominent former rabbi of a large community in Afula, to nine years in prison plus two suspended years, for sex offenses he committed against minors between 2008 and 2010. Deutsch will also have to compensate his four victims with payments of 150,000 shekels ($40,000), 20,000, 40,000 and 80,000 shekels, respectively.</p> \n<p>In the first charge sheet, Deutsch was convicted in two cases on multiple counts of forbidden consensual sex, sodomy and unlawful touching of a female minor, when she was 15 to 17 years old. In the second case he was convicted of unlawful touching congruent with an act of rape, committed on a 13-year-old female minor. The third case involved a similar charge against a 13-year-old male, and the fourth indictment involved a 14-year-old male.</p> \n<p>In issuing the sentence, the Court’s Deputy President Tawfic Kteily said that the accused’s deeds had “seriously and permanently damaged the victims’ dignity, liberty and body, as well as their mental wellbeing.” He added that “the accused found these victims to be easy prey. They saw him as an influential figure, one who was a spiritual authority and a guide, whose word was their guiding light.”</p> \n<p>The judge also noted that the victims’ parents “looked up to the accused as a dignified and respected rabbi, giving him their complete trust, without even imagining that their children would be exploited and abused by him. He therefore breached the parents’ trust as well.”</p> \n<p>The judge added that “the harsh effects of his deeds on their mental wellbeing, their development and functioning were detailed in the reports relating to the victims, which show that the damage inflicted on them is widespread, affecting all aspects of life, and may last for an extensive part of their lives, particularly if they do not receive appropriate treatment. This damage should be taken into account when considering the suitable penalty.”</p> \n<p>Deutsch’s lawyer attorney Elad Rath told Haaretz that “it’s no secret that the rabbi has consistently denied all the charges attributed to him. We greatly respect the court but believe that it erred both in its verdict and in the severe punishment it imposed on him, a penalty that ignores a long list of personal circumstances as well as his lengthy contribution to society.”</p> \n<p>Rath said that he would appeal the sentence and “wait patiently for the Supreme Court’s decision.”</p> \n<p>Attorney Or Lerner, from the Northern District State Prosecution office, stated that “anyone who exploits his lofty public status, particularly within his own community, in order to commit such contemptible crimes which so severely damaged the souls of these minor plaintiffs and their families deserves to receive such a harsh sentence, which expresses society’s revulsion.”</p> \n<p>Lerner added that he is “full of respect for the plaintiffs who, despite the inherent difficulty in coming forth, lodging a complaint and disclosing the acts done to them, in light of the harsh consequences facing them after taking such a step, took the courageous step, filed a complaint and bravely stood on the witness stand.”</p> \n<p>He expressed the hope that the sentence handed down would send a deterrent message to potential culprits as well as encourage anyone considering lodging a complaint about similar offenses.</p> \n<p>The investigation into Deutsch’s case started in 2010. He was arrested by the investigative unit of the Afula police while trying to leave Israel to, in his words, attend festivities in Turkey. The suspicion was that he was planning to continue from there to the United State. Deutsch came to Israel more than 40 years ago, acquiring his status over the years while establishing educational institutions and a not-for-profit charity group. He became a kabbalist rabbi, supposedly possessing mystical properties. He gathered a large community of believers around him who saw him as an authority on questions of religious law.</p> \n<p>In December 2013, a sentence of six months of community service was handed to another rabbi, Moti Elon, who was convicted of forceful unlawful touching, committed while he was the head of a yeshiva. He was given a 15 months’ suspended sentence and a fine of 10,000 shekels ($2,500).</p> \n<p>Another rabbi, Eliezer Berland, who headed the Breslau community of “Shuvu Banim”, was suspected of sexual offenses against women in his community. He fled Israel in April 2013 and was arrested in Holland in September 2014. In February a court in Holland ruled that he was extraditable to Israel.</p> \n<p>The head of the “Orot Ha’ari” Yeshiva in Safed, Ezra Schoenberg, is currently under arrest after 13 complaints were filed against him by different women. He is suspected of rape under fraudulent circumstances, unlawful touching and issuing threats. He was arrested over two weeks ago and his remand was extended until Friday. Schoenberg was also arrested at the airport. His lawyer claimed after the arrest that Schoenberg was en route to a vacation after undergoing cardiac catheterization.</p>",

        "text":["<p> The Education Ministry is working hard to augment children’s Jewish identity even as the Religious Services Ministry is&nbsp;doing the same. A new project, to be carried out over the current school year in 300 primary schools, will focus on the “Jewish people’s national asset — Shabbat,” according to a document obtained by Haaretz.</p> \n<p> Mibereshit, a Jewish educational organization, has won the tender to run the project. Mibereshit has also been running the Masa Israel program for 11th-graders, in partnership with the Education Ministry, at a cost of tens of millions of shekels — on top of the hundreds of thousands of shekels it receives from the ministry each year.</p> \n<p> Late last year the Education Ministry joined up with the World Zionist Organization to carry out the Israeli Shabbat project (different from the project of the same name led by the Beit Hillel organization that brings religious and secular people together). The ministry said the WZO had been chosen because of its great experience in the field.</p> \n<p> But the WZO is not running the project directly — Mibereshit is; the tender it won closed after just three weeks. Mibereshit officials had no comment for this article.</p> \n<p> According to an official at a Jewish organization that stresses pluralism, when he asked about the program and the tender’s conditions, “people hinted that it wasn’t a good idea to submit a bid.” WZO officials did not say whether other groups had submitted bids.</p> \n<p> Education Ministry officials gave no specifics about the Israeli Shabbat program. “The program’s content is in development,” one said, adding that the project was largely a “one-time activity for parents and children in public schools about values, family and Shabbat.”</p> \n<p> According to the tender, the program aims to “strengthen the family connection” by “encouraging the study and experience of the traditional Shabbat meal, its customs and values.”</p> \n<p> It says that because of technological developments, “direct communication is disappearing” — communication that “creates memories for generations of family togetherness, of embracing and closeness. Shabbat is quality time that belongs to us all, a time for gathering, talking, being together as a family — a time for love. The Israeli Shabbat project seeks to create such times around significant and high-quality content, and around the national asset of the Jewish people — Shabbat.”</p> \n<p> Bashing secular people's Shabbat</p> \n<p> According to an official at a Jewish organization, there are two problems with the program.</p> \n<p> “The first is the paternalistic view reflected in the tender: Secular people’s Shabbat contains no closeness or love, which can be found only in the traditional model. That contrast was never accurate, but to speak that way in 2014 is ridiculous,” the official said.</p> \n<p> “The second problem is that the project was given to Mibereshit, which couldn’t act in a pluralistic way if it wanted to. The kids in the public-school system come from a variety of backgrounds. There’s no good reason an Orthodox organization should teach them about Shabbat.”</p> \n<p> Mibereshit was established in 2002 by Rabbi Moti Elon, who was convicted in 2013 on two counts of indecent acts by force against one of his students.</p> \n<p> The organization’s goal, as it reported to the Registrar of Charities, is “to impart basic values of Jewish tradition to children and teenagers.” It says this includes “the deepening of children’s knowledge and the emotional development of identity with the people, the land and the heritage of the Jewish people.”</p> \n<p> The organization’s executive director between 2002 and 2008 was Avi Wortzman, now the deputy education minister and a member of the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi party.</p> \n<p> According to a WZO official, “The program’s content was determined by the Education Ministry’s primary education section,” though Mibereshit officials say their organization is responsible for it.</p> \n<p> The budget for the Israeli Shabbat project is about 4 million shekels ($1.1 million). The program, geared for children in the third to sixth grades, contains two parts: an event conducted by a teacher, based on a kit distributed by Mibereshit, and an event that parents take part in, conducted by an instructor from Mibereshit.</p> \n<p> The tender states that the cost of each activity is 3,450 shekels, with 600 activities costing roughly 2 million shekels. According to the WZO, the rest is to be used for “acquiring activity materials in the schools for the pupils and their parents and the ongoing running of the program, based on the Education Ministry’s instructions.”</p> \n<p> Meanwhile, the Education Ministry has resumed work — amounting to 4.5 million shekels — with the nonprofit organization Orot, which gives classes on Jewish topics in public schools. The privatization of values education, which the Education Ministry has been promoting for years, is particularly prominent when it comes to Jewish studies. Among the many groups that benefit from this process is Mibereshit.</p> \n<p> In 2009, then-Education Minister Gideon Sa’ar doubled his ministry’s funding of the Masa Israel program to 10 million shekels. According to the Finance Ministry, the organization has received about 30 million shekels since then, including contributions it has received for Masa.</p> \n<p> Mibereshit officials take pride in the fact that more than 100,000 students have taken part in the program, which is billed as “a formative and unforgettable experience that strengthens the feeling of belonging and commitment to the nation, the land and the State of Israel.”</p> \n<p> Students and teachers have told Haaretz that Judaism is often stressed at the expense of democracy, and that discussions on Zionism often reflect right-wing views.</p> \n<p> Either way, about a year ago, Education Ministry officials expanded the Masa Israel program even further. In addition to its cooperation in the Masa Israel program, Mibereshit also receives funds from the Education Ministry for projects on Jewish culture and education.</p> \n<p> Based on Education Ministry figures and numbers reported by Mibereshit to the Registrar of Charities, this funding ranged from 200,000 shekels to 300,000 shekels annually between 2010 and 2013. The amounts from previous years were even higher.</p> \n<p> These Jewish culture and education projects are part of a broad system that includes academies for the study of Judaism and the Land of Israel, and classes on religious topics. The Education Ministry’s religious culture department is responsible for distributing the funds. The total amount in this area in the 2013 budget was 29.1 million shekels.</p> \n<p> But over the year that sum grew to 97.6 million shekels. Similarly, for 2014 the budget was 37.6 million shekels, but the Knesset Finance Committee has approved an extra 51.8 million shekels at the request of the education and finance ministries.</p>",

        "text":["<p>On January 3, 1919, Chaim Weizmann, head of the British Zionist Federation, and the Emir Faisal ibn Hussein, head of the Arab delegation to the Versailles peace conference, signed an agreement of cooperation between their two peoples. In it, Faisal, representing the Arab nation as a whole, accepted the terms of the 1917 Balfour Declaration, in which the British government committed itself to “establishment in Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish people.” Weizmann, on behalf of the Zionist movement, expressed its support of an independent “Arab state,” and the two agreed that both entities would work peacefully toward realization of their respective aspirations and mutual cooperation.</p> \n<p>The meetings that led up to the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement came in the context of the end of World War I, the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, and the convening of the Versailles conference to decide the future of the lands over which the war had been fought. Weizmann (1874-1952), the Russian-born chemist who had been living in the United Kingdom since 1904 and was a key member of the political Zionist movement from its beginnings, had been essential in eliciting the Balfour Declaration (named for the British foreign secretary, Arthur James Balfour, who signed it) from the British government in November 1917.</p> \n<p>Faisal ibn Hussein ibn Ali al-Hashimi (1885-1933) was an Arabian-born descendant of the Prophet, a member of the Hashemite family, which oversaw the Muslim shrines of Mecca. After meeting British intelligence officer T.E. Lawrence (“of Arabia”), in 1916, and with his assistance, Faisal organized the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman sultan, which helped Allied forces to conquer the Arabian Peninsula and Greater Syria. His goal was a single, independent, pan-Arab monarchy, and like Weizmann, he believed the British could help him achieve it.</p> \n<p>Faisal and Weizmann first met in June 1918, five months before the armistice, and they began discussing cooperation. Whereas Weizmann had the standing to speak in the name of the Zionist movement, Faisal was the self-appointed representative of a people that were only beginning to think of themselves in national terms. And though he expressed his approval of the Zionist aspirations for a home – the Zionists were careful not to speak about a state at that stage – he did not necessarily have the authority to speak on behalf of the Arab residents of Palestine. In fact, after their first meeting Weizmann recorded in his diary that Faisal was “contemptuous of the Palestinian Arabs whom he doesn’t even regard as Arabs.”</p> \n<p>The two men met again later in 1918, and then on January 3, 1919, in Aqaba, to sign their memorandum. In it, they agreed to work together with “the most cordial goodwill” to effect Jewish immigration to Palestine and to protect the religious and property rights of Palestine’s Muslims, as well as control over the Holy Places. They subjected their peoples to the terms of the Balfour Declaration and agreed that the peace conference would determine the precise boundaries of their respective territories, with disputes to be resolved by the British government.</p> \n<p>Both men went to lengths, in the agreement and in other statements, to express their mutual goodwill, and to make it clear that they agreed that the Jewish immigrants to Palestine would assist the Arabs “in forwarding their economic development.” They also defined, in other correspondence, the boundaries of Palestine, which are similar to what we think of as the Greater Land of Israel, including most of the Golan, but extending on the north and on the east into what are today Lebanon and Jordan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Faisal also appended a crucial reservation to the agreement, which declared that the entire plan was contingent on the Arabs receiving independence, in accordance with a plan outlined elsewhere by the emir. He stipulated that if that plan were to be altered with the “slightest modification or departure,” he would not be bound “by a single word of the present Agreement.”</p> \n<p>The peace conference, however, did not grant the Arabs their state, and Faisal ended up becoming the monarch of Iraq alone. Weizmann remained convinced that their agreement was valid, but neither Faisal nor the Arab world in general saw things that way.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Twitter: @davidbeegreen&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>The uprooting of the Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip was scheduled to begin on August 14, 2005, but someone hadn’t bothered to take a closer look at the calendar. Of course, destroying Jewish homes on Tisha B’Av, the anniversary of the Jerusalem Temple’s destruction, was out of the question and Operation Yad L’Achim (“a hand to brothers”) began at midnight, a few hours after the day of mourning ended with nightfall. On the morning of August 15, the army began handing out eviction notices.</p> \n<p>Two days later the forced evacuation began and in retrospect, the most astonishing thing about it is that the whole process, including a break for Shabbat and the evacuation of four settlements in northern Samaria, took only seven short days. From early Wednesday morning, when lines of Air Force officers began advancing on the southernmost agricultural settlement of Morag – its families, struggling with their emotions, sitting down with their children for breakfast so that when the soldiers knocked on their doors, the scene of domesticity they were about to desecrate would be seared in their memory.</p> \n<p>To the last stand in Homesh on Tuesday afternoon, where all the residents had already left and riot-police dragged out the last teenage protestors who had barricaded themselves in a bomb shelter. In one week, 25 communities had ceased to exist.</p> \n<p>But 10 days earlier, as the secretary of Netzarim, Eliahu Ouzan, summoned over 100 youngsters who had smuggled themselves in despite the police roadblocks to the synagogue of the most isolated of Gaza’s settlements, no-one believed it would soon be over. Ouzan, who ran Netzarim’s vegetable-growing and packaging business and had worked to keep the community together throughout years of virtual siege during the second intifada, admonished the hotheaded teenagers to “keep calm and respect the spirit of Netzarim,” and not to use any form of physical or verbal violence against the security forces.</p> \n<p>At that point I wasn’t sure how much of his stern speech registered. As we emerged from the air-conditioned synagogue to the intense heat outside, light-headed from the Tisha B’Av fast around me, the adolescents in their orange T-shirts and first beards of manhood were discussing how the progress of redemption was irreversible. Who was a mere mortal such as Ariel Sharon to stand in its way?</p> \n<p>In the shimmering haze of Netzarim, as work continued in the hothouses and on construction of a new home opposite the synagogue, it was hard to argue with their unbending faith. Jewish destiny had only one way forward.</p> \n<p>Losing historical agency</p> \n<p>Tisha B’Av is one of those few anniversaries on the Jewish calendar where tradition and history largely corroborate each other. Whether your view of the past is formed by strict adherence to biblical scriptures, the midrash and Talmud, or you prefer academic research, it is the point where mythology and fact collided as the Roman Empire crushed the Great Revolt of Judea and destroyed the ancient Temple, rebuilt and renovated less than a century earlier by King Herod.</p> \n<p>It’s also one of those dates which are easy to remember and by using the Gregorian calendar, calculate how many years have passed since 70 C.E., 1945 years ago this weekend.</p> \n<p>1945 years ago the Jews lost their own historical agency – two more revolts were to take place against the Romans, but they were doomed from the start.</p> \n<p>1945 was also the nadir of Jewish destiny, the last year of the Holocaust and destruction of a third of the Jewish people in the heart of European culture, shattering the illusion that had grown over 100 years or so of emancipation that enlightened Jews could live as secure equals alongside their fellow citizens. 1945 marked the end of the period where Jews were only victims of history.</p> \n<p>It would formally end on November 30, 1947, when the Jews of Rome gathered at the Arch of Titus. Four years earlier they had huddled in hiding as German troops raided the homes of the Rome Ghetto, while nearby in the Vatican, Pope Pius XII, the final remaining symbol of the Roman Empire, remained silent. Free again, they celebrated the previous day’s United Nations resolution to establish a Jewish state and an Arab state in partitioned Mandatory Palestine under the arch erected to immortalize the Imperator of Jerusalem, with its depiction of Jewish prisoners in chains and the vessels of the Temple borne to Rome in triumph.</p> \n<p>Roman Jews, members of the most ancient of the Diaspora’s communities – so old that they can’t be classified as Ashkenazim or Mizrahim – have a historical instinct like no other group. They understood that after two millenia of living as subjects at the whim of emperors, popes and Il Duce, something fundamental had changed. Jews were about to wrest their destiny from history. The temple’s menorah carved in deep relief on the south panel of Titus’ arch would soon become in Jerusalem the official symbol of a sovereign state of Jews. This week, as Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi spoke in a special Knesset plenum, beneath him on the podium was the menorah.</p> \n<p>Dignified evacuation</p> \n<p>Netzarim was the last of the Gaza settlements to be evacuated on August 22. The builders were mixing cement for the half-built home until everyone there gathered outside the synagogue and the menorah was dismantled from its roof and carried at the head of a silent, dignified procession to the buses waiting at the gates.</p> \n<p>A nimble graphic artist placed a photograph of the Netzarim menorah on the shoulders of the departing settlers next to the Temple menorah on the Arch of Titus. But while the visual similarity is arresting, the historical comparison is erroneous. The people of Netzarim were not going into exile and their menorah wasn’t about to disappear without trace in the vaults of Rome (popular myth maintains it is under the pope’s palace to this day). The destruction of Netzarim was an assertion of Israeli sovereignty and Jewish destiny.</p> \n<p>Ariel Sharon’s corruption and cruelty were of near-Herodian proportions, but he was also a Jewish leader who didn’t wait around for history. His decision to remove the settlements from Gaza and northern Samaria may have been influenced by his fear of police investigations and diplomatic pressure, but it was also a recognition of the fundamental fact that an Israel which seeks to evolve into a healthier state cannot afford the occupation of another nation and to maintain the settlements.</p> \n<p>His successor, Benjamin Netanyahu. is a far more sophisticated student of history, but he has used the second-longest term in office of an Israeli prime minister to grumble about how others make mistakes of epic historical magnitude, rather than making his own history.</p> \n<p>Sharon forced Netanyahu to vote in favor of the disengagement, and then he resigned on the eve of the evacuation. Netanyahu’s erstwhile challenger Isaac Herzog, who this week said that the disengagement was “a mistake from a security perspective” and that he doesn’t know how he would have voted if he had known all that would happen over the last 10 years, is another keen student of history who will probably never make history himself. Historical anniversaries are artificial dates much beloved by journalists in search of sexy subjects on days of lean news. More than anything though, they serve to show us how little things change.</p> \n<p>Today is 10 years to the start of Sharon’s disengagement. We had last month the first anniversary of the last Gaza war, in two years we will have the 50th anniversary of the Six-Day War and the ensuing occupation. A year later it will be 70 years since David Ben-Gurion defied diplomatic pressure and a dire war situation to declare independence.</p> \n<p>Our history is defined by flawed leaders like Ben-Gurion and Sharon, who didn’t wait around for anniversaries but took command of Jewish destiny.</p>",

        "text":["<p>And then the pig appeared. Vast, fleshy red and fat – a helium balloon, a zeppelin in the desert skies. Gliding above the tens of thousands of astonished spectators, it lurched from side to side like a drug-induced hallucination. A swinging swine in the sky. All eyes were glued to the apparition, as breathtaking as it was unexpected. The applause erupted spontaneously. Sean Penn, who was sitting next to me, literally jumped with joy. The pig was Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>The pig has been moving from one country to another with its creator for a few years, its character and political message changing in each venue. A week before, it had cruised the skies above Mexico City, where 400,000 people viewed it during three shows. Its message there was aimed against the president of Mexico and the kidnapping of 43 students in 2014 whose fate remains unknown.</p> \n<p>Some years back, there was a huge rumpus when a Star of David was drawn on the pig.</p> \n<p>But here in the United States, with the presidential election looming, an inscription on the inflatable creature read, “Ignorant, lying, racist, sexist.” Words were not being minced: “Together we stand. Divided we fall”; “Fuck Trump and his Wall.” And, on a giant screen, in case anyone didn’t get the message, “Trump is a pig.” Actually, I spotted one man wearing a pro-Trump baseball cap in the huge crowd, and maybe there were a few others.</p> \n<p>Welcome to the Desert Trip festival in southern California, which I attended during the first of its two weekends, on October 7-9. The event, which took place at the Empire Polo Club in Coachella Valley near Palm Springs, was probably the last opportunity to see the giants of rock all together. A visit to “the dinosaur park,” as that dinosaur Mick Jagger put it. Three evenings, two full concerts each evening. The first 75,000 tickets sold out in two hours, so a second weekend was scheduled, during which the same thing happened. Tickets for the best places went for $200,000 on the black market.</p> \n<p>But here’s what you got: Bob Dylan followed by the Rolling Stones on the first evening; Neil Young and then Paul McCartney the next evening; and, on the final evening the Who – and, last but not least, Roger Waters. The pig showed up during Waters’ performance, of course. And appearing on the stage with him was Capt. Greg Galeazzi, who lost both legs in Afghanistan, his right arm shattered, half a human being sitting in a wheelchair and playing a dazzling guitar solo on “Shine on You Crazy Diamond.” Originally written in 1975 as a tribute to former Pink Floyd member Syd Barrett, it was now being played by a disabled veteran who wants to go to med school.</p> \n<p>Galeazzi, 31, climbed onto the band’s bus – which took us to the festival venue every afternoon – on his own, by crawling on the floor. His message, from the first minutes after he was wounded, he said, is that he bears no hatred toward those who did this to him.</p> \n<p>In recent years, Waters – whose father and grandfather were both killed in wars – has been working on a project to rehabilitate disabled U.S. war veterans through music. The Jewish donors to the project pulled out, apparently because of Waters’ opposition to the Israeli occupation. Nothing makes him angrier. Nor will he pass up the opportunity here, before an audience of 75,000, to say something about the occupation. But more of that later. First, the music.</p> \n<p>Once a year, on yellowing lawns amid date groves, this polo club turns into an immense concert site. But there has never been anything like Desert Trip. All the greats – the fact that there are only men did strike a discordant note – in one festival. Woodstock it wasn’t, nor did it purport to be. However, the Who and Neil Young also performed at Woodstock, and quite a few of the old-timers appearing at this festival were also there, and had apparently come to recreate Woodstock with the wife, the grandchildren and the hearing aid. Everyone has aged in the meantime: both those on the stage (less so) and those watching from below (more so). Yes, there was a camping site where some of the audience spent the night, but the spirit of Woodstock seemed to be irrecoverably and irrevocably gone.</p> \n<p>The aging giants had come to make a bundle and remind people about the existence of the legend. Their fans, who have meanwhile become no less bourgeois, wanted to reprise the good ‘ole days. That didn’t happen; there was no way it could. Desert Trip was perhaps akin to a hall of fame commemorative event for the rock giants, but the spirit was largely lacking. Still, it was a unique experience.</p> \n<p>Absolute separation</p> \n<p>Gordon, the tattooed rocker who picked us up at Palm Springs International Airport, asked us which classics we thought would remain for our children and their generation – since classics like the ones from our time are no longer being created. His question was left hanging in the space of the black Cadillac jeep. Gordon was chauffeur for the Rolling Stones’ Ronnie Wood during the festival and had been asked to pick us up – Catrin, my partner, and me – at the terminal.</p> \n<p>Those who’d hoped, as I did, that behind the scenes the stars would fall into each other’s arms – McCartney with Jagger, Dylan with Waters, Young with Pete Townshend – were soon disabused of their hopes. Each artist had a separate area, separate trailer and separate tent for receiving guests. Security was tight. An image of a horse marked the Stones’ compound; an elephant, that of Waters’. The separation was absolute. Nor did they attend one another’s performances; Waters went only to Young’s gig, while McCartney invited Young onstage to do a few songs. The legends didn’t mingle. Living legends they certainly are, but friends they are not. They also stayed in different hotels or holiday resorts in Palm Springs; the Stones rented a separate house – and, of course, no one knew where Dylan was.</p> \n<p>They’re all in terrific physical shape, at least onstage, and their voices have cracked only a little during all these years of rock ’n roll. To listen to an old recording of Neil Young’s marvelous 1992 song “Harvest Moon” on YouTube (over 10 million hits) and then hear him sing it at Desert Trip was enough to give you the shivers. The voice may have hardly changed but the giveaway was the way he looked: the long, sleek hair and innocent gaze of the past vs. the long, thin hair and somewhat bitter gaze on this particular evening. To see Jagger gyrate, Young poeticize, the Who shake Coachella Valley and Waters leave everyone stunned – and to think that many of their generation live in protected housing and have 24-hour caregivers!</p> \n<p>They’re thin as reeds, floating like butterflies, prancing like grasshoppers. It’s simply unbelievable after all the drink and drugs, all of them in the eighth decade of their life. Some are gone, dead and buried, but those who’ve survived are in tremendous shape, or appear to be. Forget dieting and sports, a healthy lifestyle and doctors – long live rock!</p> \n<p>They are the soundtrack of our youth; it’s a clich&eacute;, but still true. Nostalgia worked overtime on this desert journey, everyone with his own memories of the music. Still, something had obviously died: This was no more than a momentary resuscitation in the intensive care unit. The audience was middle-of-the-road and middle-of-life America, as far as one can generalize about 75,000 people. The British Telegraph reported that the average age was 51. These people were attending a requiem for icons unmatched in subsequent generations, though the reports of their death were premature. Bye-bye, American pie. But Don McLean’s message that the music had died was also premature: It’s alive and kicking. At least it was on these amazing evenings.</p> \n<p>We sat in a suite, a small VIP section with hostesses, alcohol and unlimited refreshments, accessed by an elevator and overlooking the arena; Sean Penn and I and Penn’s new girlfriend, Leila George, a 24-year-old Australian whose parents are actors Vincent D’Onofrio and Greta Scacchi. Their love story had erupted in the tabloids just a few days earlier with paparazzi shots of a passionate kiss. Penn’s son, Hopper, who’s about the age of his father’s girlfriend, was also there; he wore the same baseball cap as his dad and had the same mannerisms. The older Penn amused himself by putting his cap on his girlfriend’s head, and she promptly put it back on his. He said he’s working on a film about Syria and had visited the country last May.</p> \n<p>This suite is for the few guests of Roger Waters. Full disclosure: I was his guest. Even fuller disclosure: I’ve loved Waters with all my heart, especially since we met last year for an interview at his home in the Hamptons.</p> \n<p>I heard the first part of Bob Dylan’s performance from afar, from Waters’ personal trailer, where one is welcomed by a sign saying “Roger” and two hefty guards. Who could have known that a few days later Dylan would be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature?</p> \n<p>Dylan was, of course, the briefest and most alienated of the artists. Instead of projections of his image, the huge screens showed abstract visuals to accompany the songs he performed, most of which were unfamiliar to the audience. In other words, not many people managed to actually see Dylan in Desert Trip; and possibly even fewer were moved by his gig.</p> \n<p>Two hours later came “Ladies and gentlemen, the Rolling Stones!” – and the place shook. The observation that “age has lost its meaning” must have been inspired by the Stones. “Tonight we’re not going to do any age jokes,” Jagger quipped. Their rendition of the Beatles’ “Come Together” threw the audience into an ecstasy of unity. Jagger, in red and blue, a narcissist who changes clothes during his shows, face furrowed, body youthfully lithe. A cloud of marijuana hung in the air, over tens of thousands of (former) users and their successors, and the aroma wafted far. Neil Young asked if anyone in the audience was doing a barbecue. Some of the old-timers drank Budweiser during the intermission. Fireworks in the skies of Palm Springs, and in the skies of our life, signaled the end of the Stones’ gig. See you tomorrow, with Neil Young and Paul McCartney.</p> \n<p>Wrists were adorned with numerous bracelets, necks buckled under a panoply of colorful tags. Here, prestige was measured by bracelets: Tell me what your bracelets are, and I’ll tell you who you are. Each bracelet and tag allowed entry to a different venue, and guards were everywhere.</p> \n<p>Backstage was more like a factory than a rock festival, with heavy trucks and dozens of laborers working behind the vast stage. The fleet of glossy black limos of the stars and their entourages reflected the big money here.</p> \n<p>‘And I’m getting old’</p> \n<p>Neil Young was terrific. “I’m searching for a heart of gold. And I’m getting old,” he sang. Felt hat, faded T-shirt inscribed “Water is life” hanging on his big torso, playing guitar and harmonica. His face was weary, his voice wonderful, his songs beautiful. Who could ask for more? Tents and Native American sculptures adorned the stage. Young is now a social and environmental activist. Next week he will do a charity event in San Francisco to raise funds for a California school for children with special needs, including cerebral palsy victims. His son, Zeke, has the condition. A number of famous artists, including Waters, will perform there for free.</p> \n<p>Young’s organ-playing generated a church-like atmosphere. An image of hooded workers in white suits spraying the stage with chemicals betokened the dangers of a toxic world. He sang a song to Mother Earth. And also “Down by the River.&quot; And then, “Because I’m still in love with you / I wanna see you dance again ... On this harvest moon.” Somehow, the song sounded a lot sadder here than it did when it was first released nearly 25 years ago. The members of Young’s current band were toddlers then; some are even young enough to be his children. “Keep on rockin’ in the free world,” he sang.</p> \n<p>Cell phones flashed, a drone camera hovered in the skies as night descended. Paul McCartney, who followed Young, said, “We know what songs you like hearing. It lights up with your phones like a galaxy of stars When we play one you don’t know, it’s like a black hole. So here’s another black hole.” He then proceeded to introduce an unfamiliar song – and blackness indeed ruled. The audience wanted Beatles songs, and McCartney obliged. But he was the disappointment of the festival. He sang 38 songs, promising a “Liverpool-style” party, but blandness reigned.</p> \n<p>The stories McCartney told between numbers only made things worse. He’s one of the elders of the tribe, and the wealthiest. He dedicated one song to Nancy, his current wife (who was in the audience), and another to the late Linda McCartney; a third, written after John Lennon’s murder, was about the phone call to him that never happened. “I love you,” he sang to his dead songwriting partner, but even that somehow was unmoving.</p> \n<p>In fact, nothing was truly moving about McCartney, other than the knowledge that he is McCartney – Sir Paul to you. About 45 years ago, a friend of mine from the world of prog rock tried to convince me that Paul was dead. We played a vinyl record backward any number of times, in order to hear the humming refrain “Paul is dead.” We felt we’d hit on something mysterious and secret. Now he’s here, Sir Paul. “We can work it out” – but something wasn’t working.</p> \n<p>The atmosphere of indifference did not persist, however, when Neil Young returned to the stage to duet on “A Day in the Life,” “Give Peace a Chance” and “Why Don’t We Do It in the Road?” Once again the cell phones lit up “like a galaxy of stars,” possibly accompanied by a few tears for what had been and was gone, never to return. The tops of the illuminated palm trees swayed in the autumn wind. There was a sense of history: McCartney and Young onstage.</p> \n<p>As the skies reddened and dimmed on the third evening, the Who came onstage. The bad boys of rock looked like retired accountants. The two original members who are still alive, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey, came on in open shirts, revealing smooth, muscular chests, wearing sunglasses and exuding potent energy. They’ve been singing together for more than 50 years, since growing up together in a working-class suburb of London. As they took the stage, the second Clinton-Trump debate got underway. But the real fireworks were here: The Who performed a great set.</p> \n<p>And then it was his turn. I’m biased, of course, but there was sweeping agreement: At this festival there was Roger Waters – and there were all the rest. Nothing else matched the meticulous quality of his performance; there was nothing as stunning, nothing so fraught with fierce, courageous messages that electrified the audience. Having invested in the visual as much as the musical, far more than all the other artists, Waters shone like a diamond in the rough.</p> \n<p>In one of the show’s highlights, a full-size Battersea Power Station loomed onstage, from which immense smokestacks sprang, white smoke curling out of them for the rest of the evening. All this conjured up the cover of Pink Floyd’s “Animals” album, resurrected by Waters especially for the festival. He sang the best of Pink Floyd, recharging all the songs with powerful messages and images.</p> \n<p>The atmosphere was electric from the first moment, from the first notes of hits from “Dark Side of the Moon” that threatened to blow up the polo grounds. Ever since my adolescence I’ve always thought Pink Floyd was the greatest band of all time. But the show at Desert Trip wasn’t a memorial gathering or nostalgia trip. In contrast to the other artists, who reprised earlier successes, Waters doesn’t stand still and doesn’t look back.</p> \n<p>Here’s what The Desert Sun newspaper (part of the USA Today network) wrote the next day: “At 72 [actually 73] ... Waters is emerging as an artist at the peak of his powers. He’s now getting credit as the creative force of Pink Floyd, following the departure of original leader Syd Barrett in 1968, but he’s gone beyond what Pink Floyd did Waters took Pink Floyd&nbsp;material about Barrett’s mental breakdown (‘Dark Side of the Moon’), the corporatization of the band and Barrett’s absence (‘Wish You Were Here’) and growing up without a father killed in World War II (‘The Wall’) and gave them a whole new meaning in which the&nbsp;sum was not only different, but greater than their parts.” And the Los Angeles Times: “Now Waters uses the grand stage afforded him to create a sense of shock and awe for concert audiences, a reminder that the experience of live music can provide more than flashy costumes changes, hyperkinetic choreography and blinding pyrotechnics.”</p> \n<p>And so it was. And for those who were at Waters’ June 2006 concert in the fields of Neve Shalom in Israel, there was a surprise waiting: He can be even greater than he was then. And he was great then.</p> \n<p>On the morning of his first Desert Trip performance, Waters was still considering what to say about the Israeli occupation. He had absolutely no doubt that he mustn’t miss this opportunity, even at the cost of angering part of the audience. Some tried to tone him down, but he was determined. This is an urgent issue for him. He cannot be silent, even when all the other artists are silent, even if he knows he is paying a price. After a few songs, he took a piece of paper out of his pocket, saying, “Fuck, I’ll speak.” And speak he did, briefly and cogently.</p> \n<p>“I’m going to send out all of my most heartfelt love and support to all those young people on the campuses of the universities of California who are standing up for their brothers and sisters in Palestine and supporting the BDS movement,” he said, “in the hope that we may encourage the government of Israel to end the occupation.” Palestinian flags projected on screens in the background. Before that, he echoed the cries of support for Palestine by the fans of Scottish soccer team Celtic, who covered their stadium with Palestinian flags during the match against Hapoel Be’er Sheva in August.</p> \n<p>Waters is not anti-Semitic and he does not hate Israel. He does care to the depths of his soul about the wretched fate of the Palestinian people. One can only respect him for this. He’s paying a steep personal price for it, but is not deterred.</p> \n<p>Later during an after-party, Waters emerged to greet the revellers. Sean Penn and war veteran Galeazzi were deep in conversation. Waters talked about his next project. He’s a sensitive and genuine human being, convinced he can change the world. He’ll be launching a world tour next May. It doesn’t include Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Japan will wake up Monday morning with almost the exact same government, but a radically changed national mindset as the country further embraces a form of nationalism not seen there in over 70 years.</p> \n<p>Despite his unpopularity, Shinzo Abe, the hawkish prime minister, strolled to victory&nbsp;on Sunday&nbsp;in the snap election he called in late September. Abe's victory will increase his two-thirds governing &quot;super majority,&quot; having capitalized on mounting concerns in the country, chiefly over North Korea’s provocative missile tests and U.S. President Donald Trump’s ability to contain the rogue regime's nuclear program – coupled with his “America first” agenda, which has repeatedly singled out Tokyo, insisting that it pay more for its own defense.</p> \n<p>The campaign focused almost entirely on defense, stability and Article 9 of Japan’s post-World War II constitution, which bans the country from using force to settle international disputes and which Abe has long vowed to amend.</p> \n<p>Argument over Article 9, a pacifist provision enacted in the aftermath of World War II, has raged in Japan ever since. But the new level of threat posed by North Korea and concerns about Trump rallied voters around Abe and his conservative Liberal Democratic Party, despite Abe's lack popularity.</p> \n<p>Only on Thursday a poll published in the daily paper Asahi gave Abe, whom many Japanese seem to feel is an arrogant elitist, an approval rating of just 38 percent. Now he will remain premier until 2021, barring another snap election, of course.</p> \n<p>The anti-terror bill</p> \n<p>The outcome of the election also effectively rubber-stamps the controversial anti-terror bill that Abe’s government rammed through the National Diet in June, bypassing the upper house of the parliament. Now the bill's opposition has very little hope of repealing it.</p> \n<p>Abe positioned the anti-terror law as a critical overhaul of counter-terrorism policy ahead of the summer Olympic games Tokyo is to host in 2020. The law criminalizes hundreds of actions, such as plotting and conspiracy - but critics fret that erodes civil liberties and may be used to gag journalists and crush grassroots political movements.</p> \n<p>International observers were quick to condemn the law. The Japanese government had used the “psychology of fear” to push through “defective legislation,” claimed Joseph Cannataci, the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to privacy, after the bill passed in June.</p> \n<p>Long-held distaste</p> \n<p>During his presidential campaign, throughout 2016, Trump repeatedly criticized Japan for not pulling its own weight on defense. In August, while campaigning in Des Moines, Iowa, he said, “You know we have a treaty with Japan where if Japan is attacked, we have to use the full force and might of the United States. If we’re attacked, Japan doesn’t have to do anything. They can sit home and watch Sony television, OK?”</p> \n<p>NATO as well as countries such as Egypt and South Korea that rely on American defense or the U.S. nuclear umbrella were unsettled by Trump’s repeated attacks on their defense spending and the perceived isolationist tendencies outlined in his “America first” policy.</p> \n<p>Even before entering the political arena, Trump had been a critic of Japan. During the 1980s and '90s, as Japanese businesses bought up assets in the U.S., Japan was a regular target of the right and critics of globalization. Trump even went so far as to take out a full-page ad in the New York Times in 1987 to criticize Japan for “taking advantage of the U.S.,” a fact Japan's ruling class in Japan is well aware of.</p> \n<p>Demographic destiny</p> \n<p>Abe sees two main crises in Japan today: the North Korea threat and the aging population. The Japanese people for their part are concerned about economic stagnation and fears of demographic decline.</p> \n<p>His answer to these concerns has been to a hawkish foreign policy, “Abenomics” (aggressive stimulus and monetary easing) while courting the international community and restoring local pride through hosting the Olympics (in 2020) and other international events. For all Abe’s unpopularity, the upshot is that now the Japanese are turning outward for the first time in over 70 years.</p> \n<p>Thanks to the growing threat from North Korea and Trump’s isolationism, which helped bolster his governing coalition, Abe can finally fulfill his long-term dream of amending Article 9 and legitimizing the military. With Japan joining the tide of nationalism rising &nbsp;around the globe, from Catalonia to the rise Germany’s far-right to the Kurds and Brexit, the post-World War II era based on U.S. leadership and global order has never seemed so threatened.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Jews, Christians and Muslims all believe in a single, omnipotent deity that created the heavens and earth. But if he was and is the only god, why would God need a name?</p> \n<p>The Bible explicitly tells us that God has one, which indicates he had to be distinguished from other celestial beings, just like humans use names to identify different people.</p> \n<p>What that name might be is another matter. The Jewish prohibition on speaking God’s name means that its correct pronunciation has been lost. All we know is that the Hebrew Bible spells it out as four consonants known as the Tetragrammaton – from the Greek for “four letters,” which are transliterated as Y-H-W-H.</p> \n<p>The existence of a proper name for God is the first indication that the history of Yhwh and his worship by the Jews is a lot more complicated than many realize.</p> \n<p>In gods we trusted</p> \n<p>Modern biblical scholarship and archaeological discoveries in and around Israel show that the ancient Israelites did not always believe in a single, universal god. In fact, monotheism is a relatively recent concept, even amongst the People of the Book.</p> \n<p>Decades of research into the birth and evolution of the Yhwh cult are summarized in “The Invention of God,” a recent book by Thomas R&ouml;mer, a world-renowned expert in the Hebrew Bible and professor at the College de France and the University of Lausanne. R&ouml;mer, who held a series of conferences at Tel Aviv University last month, spoke to Haaretz about the subject.</p> \n<p>The main source for investigating the history of God is, of course, the Bible itself.</p> \n<p>When exactly the Jewish holy text reached its final form is unknown. Many scholars believe this happened sometime between the Babylonian exile, which began after the fall of Jerusalem in 587 BCE (some 2600 years ago), and the subsequent periods of Persian and Hellenistic rule.</p> \n<p>However, the redactors of the Bible were evidently working off older traditions, R&ouml;mer says.</p> \n<p>“Biblical texts are not direct historical sources. They reflect the ideas, the ideologies of their authors and of course of the historical context in which they were written,” R&ouml;mer explains.</p> \n<p>Still, he notes, “you can have memories of a distant past, sometimes in a very confusing way or in a very oriented way. But I think we can, and we must, use the biblical text not just as fictional texts but as texts that can tell us stories about the origins.”</p> \n<p>What's in God's name</p> \n<p>The first clue that the ancient Israelites worshipped gods other than the deity known as Yhwh lies in their very name. “Israel” is a theophoric name going back at least 3200 years, which includes and invokes the name of a protective deity.</p> \n<p>Going by the name, the main god of the ancient Israelites was not Yhwh, but El, the chief deity in the Canaanite pantheon, who was worshipped throughout the Levant.</p> \n<p>In other words, the name &quot;Israel&quot; is probably older than the veneration of Yhwh by this group called Israel,&nbsp;R&ouml;mer says. “The first tutelary deity they were worshipping was El, otherwise their name would have been Israyahu.”</p> \n<p>The Bible appears to address this early worship of El in Exodus 6:3, when God tells Moses that he “appeared to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as El Shaddai (today translated as &quot;God Almighty&quot;) but was not known to them by my name Yhwh.”</p> \n<p>In fact, it seems that the ancient Israelites weren't even the first to worship Yhwh – they seem to have adopted Him from a mysterious, unknown tribe that lived somewhere in the deserts of the southern Levant and Arabia.</p> \n<p>The god of the southern deserts</p> \n<p>The first mention of the Israelite tribe itself is a victory stele erected around 1210 BCE by the pharaoh Mernetpah (sometimes called &quot;the Israel stele&quot;). These Israelites are described as a people inhabiting Canaan.</p> \n<p>So how did this group of Canaanite El-worshippers come in contact with the cult of Yhwh?</p> \n<p>The Bible is quite explicit about the geographical roots of the Yhwh deity, repeatedly linking his presence to the mountainous wilderness and the deserts of the southern Levant. Judges 5:4 says that Yhwh “went forth from Seir” and “marched out of the field of Edom.” Habbakuk 3:3 tells us that “God came from Teman,” specifically from Mount Paran.</p> \n<p>All these regions and locations can be identified with the territory that ranges from the Sinai and Negev to northern Arabia.</p> \n<p>Yhwh’s penchant for appearing in the biblical narrative on top of mountains and accompanied by dark clouds and thunder, are also typical attributes of a deity originating in the wilderness, possibly a god of storms and fertility.</p> \n<p>Support for the theory that Yhwh originated in the deserts of Israel and Arabia can be found in Egyptian texts from the late second millennium, which list different tribes of nomads collectively called &quot;Shasu&quot; that populated this vast desert region.</p> \n<p>One of these groups, which inhabits the Negev, is identified as the “Shasu Yhw(h).” This suggests that this group of nomads may have been the first to have the god of the Jews as its tutelary deity.</p> \n<p>“It is profoundly difficult to sort through the haze of later layers in the Bible, but insofar as we can, this remains the most plausible hypothesis for the encounter of Israelites with the Yhwh cult,” says David Carr, professor of Old Testament at Union Theological Seminary in New York City.</p> \n<p>The many faces of god</p> \n<p>How exactly the Shasu merged with the Israelites or introduced them to the cult of Yhwh is not known, but by the early centuries of the first millennium, he was clearly being worshipped in both the northern kingdom of Israel and its smaller, southern neighbor, the kingdom of Judah.</p> \n<p>His name appears for the first time outside the Bible nearly 400 years after Merneptah, in the 9th-century BCE stele of Mesha, a Moabite king who boasts of defeating the king of Israel and “taking the vessels of Yhwh.”</p> \n<p>While Yhwh’s cult was certainly important in the early First Temple period, it was not exclusive.</p> \n<p>“Jeremiah speaks about the many gods of Judah, which are as numerous as the streets of a town. There was certainly worship a female deity, Asherah, or the Queen of Heaven,” R&ouml;mer told Haaretz. “There was certainly also the worship of the northern storm god Hadad (Baal).”</p> \n<p>The plurality of deities was such that in an inscription by Sargon II, who completed the conquest of the kingdom of Israel in the late 8th century BCE, the Assyrian king mentioned that after capturing the capital Samaria, his troops brought back “the (statues of) gods in which (the Israelites) had put their trust.”</p> \n<p>As the Yhwh cult evolved and spread, he was worshipped in temples across the land. Early 8th-century inscriptions found at Kuntillet Ajrud probably refer to different gods and cultic centers by invoking “Yhwh of Samaria and his Asherah” and “Yhwh of Teman and his Asherah.” Only later, under the reign of King Josiah at the end of the 7th century BCE, would the Yhwh cult centralize worship at the Temple in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Nor, in ancient Israel, was Yhwh the invisible deity that Jews have refrained from depicting for the last two millennia or so.</p> \n<p>In the kingdom of Israel, as Hosea 8 and 1 Kings 12:26-29 relate, he was often worshipped in the form of a calf, as the god Baal was. (1 Kings 12:26-29 explains that Jeroboam made two calves, for the sanctuaries at Bethel and Dan, so the people could worship Yhwh there and wouldn’t have to go all the way to Jerusalem. Ergo, in northern Israel at least, the calves were meant to represent Yhwh.)</p> \n<p>In Jerusalem and Judah, R&ouml;mer says, Yhwh more frequently took the form of a sun god or a seated deity. Such depictions may have even continued after the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian Exile: a coin minted in Jerusalem during the Persian period shows a deity sitting on a wheeled throne and has been interpreted by some as a late anthropomorphic representation of Yhwh.</p> \n<p>R&ouml;mer even suspects that the Holy of Holies in the First Temple of Jerusalem, and other Judahite sanctuaries, hosted a statue of the god, based on Psalms and prophetic texts in the Bible that speak of being admitted in the presence of “the face of Yhwh.”</p> \n<p>Not all scholars agree that the iconography of Yhwh was so pronounced in Judah. The evidence for anthropomorphic depiction “is not strong,” says Saul Olyan, professor of Judaic studies and religious studies at Brown University. “It may be that anthropomorphic images of Yhwh were avoided early on.”</p> \n<p>The God of the Jews</p> \n<p>In any case, many scholars agree that Yhwh became the main god of the Jews only after the destruction of the kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians, around 720 BCE.</p> \n<p>How or why the Jews came to exalt Yhwh and reject the pagan gods they also adored is unclear.</p> \n<p>We do know that after the fall of Samaria, the population of Jerusalem increased as much as fifteenfold, likely due to the influx of refugees from the north. That made it necessary for the kings of Judah to push a program that would unify the two populations and create a common narrative. And that in turn may be why the biblical writers frequently stigmatize the pagan cultic practices of the north, and stress that Jerusalem alone had withstood the Assyrian onslaught – thereby explaining Israel's embarrassing fall to Assyria, while distinguishing the prominence and purity of Judahite religion.</p> \n<p>Religious reforms by Judahite kings, mainly Hezekiah and Josiah, included abolishing random temple worship of Yhwh and centralizing his adoration at the Temple in Jerusalem, as well as banning the worship of Asherah, Yhwh’s female companion, and other pagan cults in the Temple and around the capital.</p> \n<p>The Israelites don't keep the faith</p> \n<p>This transformation from polytheism to worshipping a single god was carved in stone, literally. For example, an inscription in a tomb in Khirbet Beit Lei, near the Judahite stronghold of Lachish, states that “Yhwh is the god of the whole country; the mountains of Judah belong to the god of Jerusalem.”</p> \n<p>Josiah’s reforms were also enshrined in the book of Deuteronomy – whose original version is thought to have been compiled around this time – and especially in the words of Deut. 6, which would later form the Sh’ma Yisrael, one of the central prayers of Judaism: “Hear, O Israel, Yhwh is&nbsp;our God, Yhwh is one.”</p> \n<p>But while Yhwh had, by the dawn of the 6th century BCE, become “our” national god, he was still believed to be just one of many celestial beings, each protecting his own people and territory.</p> \n<p>This is reflected in the many biblical texts exhorting the Israelites not to follow other gods, a tacit acknowledgement of the existence of those deities, Romer explains.</p> \n<p>For example, in Judges 11:24, Jephtah tries to resolve a territorial dispute by telling the Ammonites that the land of Israel had been given to the Israelites by Yhwh, while their lands had been given to them by their god Chemosh (&quot;Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever Yhwh our god has given us, we will possess.&quot;)</p> \n<p>Snatching God from the jaws of defeat</p> \n<p>The real conceptual revolution probably only occurred after the Babylonians' conquest of Judah and arson of the First Temple in 587 B.C.E. The destruction and the subsequent exile to Babylon of the Judahite elites inevitably cast doubts on the faith they had put in Yhwh.</p> \n<p>“The question was: how can we explain what happened?” R&ouml;mer says. If the defeated Israelites had simply accepted that the Babylonian gods had proven they were stronger than the god of the Jews, history would have been very different.</p> \n<p>But somehow, someone came up with a different, unprecedented explanation. “The idea was that the destruction happened because the kings did not obey the law of god,” R&ouml;mer says. “It’s a paradoxical reading of the story: the vanquished in a way is saying that his god is the vanquisher. It’s quite a clever idea.</p> \n<p>“The Israelites/Judahites took over the classical idea of the divine wrath that can provoke a national disaster but they combined it with the idea that Yhwh in his wrath&nbsp;made the Babylonians destroy Judah and Jerusalem,” he said.</p> \n<p>The concept that Yhwh had pulled the Babylonians' strings, causing them to punish the Israelites inevitably led to the belief that he was not just the god of one people, but a universal deity who exercises power over all of creation.</p> \n<p>This idea is already present in the book of Isaiah, thought to be one of the earliest biblical texts, composed during or immediately after the Exile. This is also how the Jews became the “chosen people” – because the Biblical editors had to explain why Israel had a privileged relationship with Yhwh even though he was no longer a national deity, but the one true God.</p> \n<p>Over the centuries, as the Bible was redacted, this narrative was refined and strengthened, creating the basis for a universal religion – &nbsp;one that could continue to exist even without being tied to a specific territory or temple. And thus Judaism as we know it was established, and, ultimately, all other major monotheistic religions were as well.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the summer of 1947, when the British turned away the SS Exodus from the shores of Palestine, the world was watching.</p> \n<p>Before the eyes of the international media, British troops violently forced the ship's passengers — most of them Holocaust survivors — onto ships back to Europe. The resulting reports helped turn public opinion in favor of the Zionist movement and against the pro-Arab British policy of limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine.</p> \n<p>But much else was happening in the aftermath of World War II, and attention soon shifted elsewhere. One of the few journalists to stick with the story was Jewish Telegraphic Agency correspondent Robert Gary, who filed a series of reports from displaced persons camps in Germany.</p> \n<p>Seventy years later and decades after his death, Gary is again drawing attention to the &quot;Exodus Jews,&quot; albeit mostly in Israel.</p> \n<p>An album of 230 of his photos will be sold at the Kedem Auction House in Jerusalem on October 31, and a number of the images reveal the reality inside the camps, where the Jews continued to prepare for life in Palestine under trying conditions.</p> \n<p>Some of the photos, which have little to no captioning, capture the haunting similarities of the DP camps to those in which the Nazis interned and killed millions of Jews during the Holocaust, including images of Exodus Jews repairing barbed-wire fences under the watch of guards.</p> \n<p>But others show the Jews participating in communal activities and preparing for their hoped-for future in Palestine. In one photo, Zionist emissaries from the territory — young women dressed in white T-shirts and shorts — appear to lead the Exodus Jews in a circular folk dance.</p> \n<p>Shay Mendelovich, a researcher at Kedem, said he expects there to be a lot of interest in the album, which is being sold by an anonymous collector who bought it from the Gary family. Mendelovich predicted it could be sold for as much as $10,000.</p> \n<p>&quot;There were other people in these camps.&quot; he said. &quot;But Robert Gary was one of the few who had a camera and knew how to take pictures.&quot;</p> \n<p>Between 1945 and 1952, more than 250,000 Jews lived in displaced persons camps and urban centers in Germany, Austria and Italy that were overseen by Allied authorities and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Despite having been liberated from the Nazi camps, they continued to languish in Europe under guard and behind barbed wire.</p> \n<p>Gary was an American Jewish reporter who JTA sent to Europe to cover the aftermath of World War II. He detailed the living conditions in the camps more than a year before the Exodus journey: inadequate food; cold, crowded rooms; violence by guards and mind-numbing boredom. But he reported in September 1946 that the greatest concern among Jews was escaping Europe, preferably for Palestine.</p> \n<p>&quot;Certainly the DPs are sensitive to the material things and sound off when things go bad (which is as it should be), but above all this is their natural desire to start a new life elsewhere for the bulk in Palestine, for others, in the U.S. and other lands,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Get any group of DPs together, and they'll keep you busy with the number one question: When are we leaving?&quot;</p> \n<p>In July 1947, more than 4,500 Jews from the camps boarded the Exodus in France and set sail for Palestine without legal immigration certificates. They hoped to join the hundreds of thousands of Jews building a pro-Jewish state.</p> \n<p>Organized by the Haganah, a Zionist paramilitary force in Palestine, the mission was the largest of dozens of mostly failed attempts at illegal Jewish immigration during the decades of British administration of the territory following World War I. The British largely sought to limit the arrival of Jews to Palestine out of deference to the often violent opposition of its Arab majority.</p> \n<p>The Haganah had outfitted and manned the Exodus in hopes of outmaneuvering the British Navy and unloading the passengers on the beach. But near the end of its weeklong voyage, the British intercepted the ship off the shore of Palestine and brought it into the Haifa port. Troops removed resisting passengers there, injuring dozens and killing three, and loaded them on three ships back to Europe.</p> \n<p>Even after two months on the Exodus, the passengers resisted setting foot back on the continent. When the British finally forced them ashore in September 1947 and into two displaced persons camps in occupied northern Germany — Poppendorf and Am Stau — many sang the Zionist anthem &quot;Hatikvah&quot; in protest. An unexploded time bomb, apparently designed to go off after the passengers were ashore, was later found on one of the ships.</p> \n<p>The widely reported events won worldwide sympathy for European Jews and their national aspirations. An American newspaper headlined a story about the Exodus &quot;Back to the Reich.&quot; The Yugoslav delegate from from the United Nations Special Commission on Palestine called the affair &quot;the best possible evidence we have for allowing Jews into Palestine.&quot;</p> \n<p>Later, the Exodus achieved legendary status, most famously as the inspiration and namesake of the 1958 best-seller by Leon Uris and the 1960 film starring Paul Newman. Some, including former Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban, credited the Exodus with a major role in the foundation of the State of Israel in May 1948.</p> \n<p>Gary, who was stationed in Munich, had close ties to Zionist activists; he reported early and often on the continuing plight of the Exodus Jews in the camps. His dispatches highlighted their continued challenges, including malnutrition, and unabated longing to immigrate to Palestine.</p> \n<p>In a report from Poppendorf days after the Exodus Jews arrived, Gary said the dark running joke in the camp was that the alternative to Palestine was simple: &quot;Everyone would choose a tree from which to hang himself.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;The Jews of Germany demand and expect a chance to start life anew under reasonably secure circumstances,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They feel these places exist mainly in Palestine and the U.S. And they are determined to get there, either by legal or illegal means, or just by plain old-fashioned patience.&quot;</p> \n<p>Pnina Dromi, who later became Gary's wife, was among the emissaries that the Jewish Agency for Israel sent to the camps from Palestine to prepare the Jews for aliyah. As a kindergarten teacher, she taught the children Hebrew and Zionist songs. Other emissaries, she said, offered military training in preparation for the escalating battles with the Arab majority in Palestine.</p> \n<p>&quot;In the photos, you see a lot of young people in shorts and kind of Israeli clothes,&quot; she said. &quot;We were getting them ready for Israeli life, both good and bad. You have to remember Israel was at war at the time.&quot;</p> \n<p>Gary was one of the few journalists who continued visiting the DP camps in the weeks after the Exodus Jews returned to Europe. Somehow he even obtained a fake certificate identifying him as one of the former passengers of the ship. But by late September 1947, JTA reported that British authorities had tired of Gary's critical coverage and barred him from entry.</p> \n<p>&quot;The fact that Gary and [New York newspaper PM reporter Maurice] Pearlman were the only correspondents still assigned to the story, and had remained at the camps, aroused the authorities, who charged that they 'were snooping about too much,'&quot; according to the report.</p> \n<p>Israel declared independence in May 1948, and after Great Britain recognized the Jewish state in January 1949, it finally sent most of the remaining Exodus passengers to the new Jewish state. Nearly all the DP camps in Europe were closed by 1952 and the Jews dispersed around the world, most to Israel and the United States.</p> \n<p>Gary soon immigrated to Israel, too. He married Dromi in 1949, months after meeting her at a Hanukkah party at the Jewish Agency's headquarters in Munich, and the couple moved to Jerusalem, where they had two daughters. Robert Gary took at job at The Jerusalem Post and later worked for the British news agency Reuters. Pnina Gary, 90, continued her acting career.</p> \n<p>She said her husband always carried a camera with him when he was reporting, and their home was filled with photo albums.</p> \n<p>Decades after Robert Gary died in Tel Aviv in 1987, at the age of 67, Pnina Gary wrote and starred in a hit play, &quot;An Israeli Love Story.&quot; It is based on her real-life romance with the first man she was supposed to marry, who was killed by local Arabs in an ambush on their kibbutz.</p> \n<p>&quot;We knew life wouldn't be easy in Israel,&quot; she said. &quot;That's not why anyone comes here.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON - The Anti-Defamation League expressed its support on Tuesday for the &quot;Israel Anti-Boycott Act,&quot; a piece of legislation that is supposed to combat the boycott, divestment and sanction movement, but has come under criticism from civil rights group that warn it could endanger free speech in the United States. The veteran Jewish organization said it supports the legislation and has called on members of Congress to do the same.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The ADL explained in a statement that the legislation &quot;is not intended to limit the First Amendment rights of U.S. individuals and companies who want to criticize Israel or penalize those who want to refuse to do business with Israel based on their own personal convictions.&quot;</p> \n<p>The statement is a direct response to the main line of criticism being voiced against the legislation by the American Civil Liberties Union, which has warned that the legislation's current language could impose sever penalties on U.S. citizens for supporting boycotts of Israel and the settlements.</p> \n<p>According to the ADL, &quot;this narrowly-tailored legislation is designed simply to prevent boycott actions from being taken against Israel in compliance with major international bodies such as the United Nations and the European Union.&quot;</p> \n<p>This explanation is similar to one that appeared last month in a letter published by the bill's cosponsors, Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, and Rob Portman, in reply to the ACLU.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One of the main reasons the ACLU has come out strongly against the bill is that violating it could lead to a minimum civil penalty of $250,000 and a maximum one of $1 million, or a lengthy period in jail. The ACLU pointed to First Amendment protections in their criticism, noting that the bill &quot;cannot be fairly characterized as an anti-discrimination bill.&quot;</p> \n<p>One senator – Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand of New York - withdrew her cosponsorship&nbsp;earlier this week, stating that she supports the bill's main objective of fighting BDS but would only support the bill if its language was changed to avoid legal ambiguity. Gillibrand's move made her the most senior Democratic politician to demand the AIPAC supported bill be changed.</p>",

He never published a picture in which his subject didnt look good. While others didnt even consider the possibility that their subject could be hurt – Rubinger made sure the people appearing in his photos looked respectable. More than once he subdued his photographers ego and chose the less impressive photo. Every photographer knows how much ego has to be suppressed to do that.</p> \n<p>My whole life Ive tried not to take paparazzi photos, he said in an interview to Maariv in 2008. They shoot moments in peoples lives that the public shouldnt see.</p> \n<p>Rubingers respect for his subjects opened doors to him that were closed to other photographers. The most remarkable example of this is his famous photo of Menachem Begin putting a shoe on his wife Alizas foot, on a plane.</p> \n<p>Rubinger was highly respected and appreciated, thanks to his discretion and gentlemanly behavior. If Im not mistaken, he is the only photographer Golda Meir allowed to photograph her in her kitchen, wearing a dressing gown and washing dishes.</p> \n<p>Rubinger treated each photograph as though it were historically significant. Even the most negligible photo could be important in a historical perspective, he used to say. Every photo was important evidence in his eyes.</p> \n<p>He was completely taken up by his work. Because of his talent, diligence and excellence and because he lived and worked in Israels defining years, he became the nations photographer. Because of Rubinger, press photographers in Israel were treated with respect they did not enjoy before Rubinger came along.</p> \n<p>He may be remembered mainly for his famous pictures, but like every devoted, obsessive photographer (I cant remember him ever being without a camera) he took pictures everywhere, all the time. A photograph he took in 1956 is one of my favorites. It shows a bearded new immigrant walking on a gravel road, with a sack of potatoes on his shoulder and a few live chickens hanging down from his hand. The picture tells the story of a period, not merely of a certain person. The too-short long trousers, the oversized military boots, the shabby coat and above all the smiling face, depict a different era, different hopes, the kind that remain only in the picture.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday I visited David. I wanted to say goodbye. I dont know if he heard me. I held his hand and thanked him for the many years in which he supported and encouraged me. When I was just starting out as a press photographer, I told David I had butterflies in my stomach before every assignment. He smiled and said: Do me a favor — when you dont feel the butterflies anymore, put the camera down.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Bon Appetit magazine declared last month that babka is the new bagel, meaning it is finely making its way to the masses. We can only rejoice, and maybe thank Uri Scheft of Breads bakery in New York, for making this beloved cake even better, and therefore more popular.</p> \n<p>Jewish-American babka has Polish roots - babka meaning small grandmother - although the non-Jewish babka is a simple, tall yeast cake that’s baked in a kugelhopf pan without any filling. The Jewish babka is a twisted filled yeast dough made with a simple, relatively lean dough.</p> \n<p>In Israel, yeast strudels became popular thanks to Hungarian bakeries and cafes, which offered traditional versions of poppyseed or cinnamon and raisins filled rolls. Those cakes, which have their roots in Austro-Hungarian tradition, as well as Russian, Polish and other Eastern European countries, became so popular that you can still find them in every supermarket, as well as in coffee shops and bakeries all over the country.</p> \n<p>But this delectable yeast pastry’s appeal did not stop there. In recent years, a version of the German hefekranz, a braided cake baked in a round shape (kranz means a wreath), or simply kranz, made its way to the shelves of Israeli bakeries. In the Israeli version, the only thing left from the original German braided cake is the braiding. But the term “kranz” became synonymous with a braided cake of laminated yeast dough, filled with a variety of fillings.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Laminated dough is a very rich yeast dough that basically combines the techniques of yeast dough and puff pastry. It is very time consuming since beyond making the yeast dough, you need to add a few steps of folding the dough with cold butter. These days, any braided yeast cake in Israel claims the name kranz, but the real ones are undeniably rich, very tasty and stay fresh for longer thanks to all that butter. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>To make things simpler for the home baker, chefs came up with recipes for butter-rich yeast dough that does not require all the folding. It is not as flaky and light as the original laminated dough, but it is still very rich and in that sense very different from the American babka. (And, some would argue, superior.)&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A few rules before you start: Make the effort and buy SAF instant yeast online; it’s more reliable than the store-bought active dry yeast. However, if you can’t, use about 30% more active dry yeast in the recipe (quantities in the recipe below).</p> \n<p>This babka recipe is very rich, meaning it contains more butter than the average babka recipe. This makes it much tastier but it is also harder for the yeast to rise properly. Add butter last to the dough, as instructed below, and you’ll be fine.</p> \n<p>The best way for yeast dough to develop its flavor is by letting it rise overnight in the fridge. If you’re in a hurry, just let it rise at room temperature for a couple of hours; it’s still going to be fine.</p> \n<p>Do not over bake the babka. To get a moist babka, it needs to be baked just until almost firm, but when the center still feels a little too runny. It will stabilize a bit more outside the oven.</p> \n<p>Chocolate and halva babka</p> \n<p>Halva is available at some chain supermarkets (usually in the Jewish section), Middle Eastern stores and kosher markets.</p> \n<p>Yields two 9”x5” babkas or one round 9” babka</p> \n<p>Ingredients:</p> \n<p>For the dough: 1 lb. (440 grams) all purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough 1 tablespoons instant yeast (or 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon active dry yeast) 1/2 cup sugar plus more for the pan 2 large eggs at room temperature, lightly beaten 2/3 cups warm milk 12 tablespoons soft butter plus more for greasing&nbsp; Grated zest of one lemon 1 teaspoon kosher salt</p> \n<p>For chocolate-halva filling: 16 tablespoons soft butter 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup cocoa powder Pinch salt 6 oz. (170 grams) halva, crumbled 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chips</p> \n<p>For brushing: 1 egg, beaten</p> \n<p>Directions:</p> \n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To make the dough, use a stand mixer with the dough hook. Put flour and yeast in the mixer’s bowl and mix with a fork. Add sugar, then turn mixer on medium-low speed and mix for a minute. Add eggs and milk and continue to mix for about 2 minutes, until well incorporated. Stop the mixer as needed to scrape the flour from the sides using a spatula, and continue to mix. Add butter, a tablespoon at a time, then add lemon zest and salt. Turn speed to medium and mix for 8 minutes. Stop the mixer to scrape the sides as needed. The dough will be very soft, but don’t be tempted to add more flour.</p> \n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remove bowl from stand mixer. Using a spatula, transfer dough into a lightly floured large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature, preferably in a warm space (near the oven, for example) until dough is almost double in volume, about 2 hours.</p> \n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Check the dough: On a hot day it may be too soft at this point, and therefore hard to work with. Put it in the fridge for 30 minutes before rolling. 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the meantime, make the filling. In a large bowl, mix butter, sugar, cocoa powder and salt. Set aside.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Butter two 9” x 5” loaf pans or one 9” cake pan and sprinkle sugar at the bottom.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lightly flour a work surface and a rolling pin.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you’re making two loaf-size babkas, divide dough into 2 (the dough weighs about 2 pounds, so divide it into two 1-pound portions). Sprinkle dough with a little flour and roll into an approximately 10-inch by 15-inch rectangle. Spread half the cocoa filling all over using an icing spatula, then sprinkle with half the halva and half the chocolate chips. Roll up dough jelly-roll style, starting with the short side. Gently cut the log in half lengthwise, leaving the top connected. Twist both sides over each other, making sure the cut side is on top and carefully transfer into the loaf pan. Repeat with the rest of the dough. (See photos.)</p> \n<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you’re making one round babka, roll the dough in one piece into a 20” x 15” rectangle. Spread the cocoa filling, sprinkle with halva and chocolate chips and roll up into a long log, starting from the long side. Gently cut log into 7 short logs (about 3 inches each) and transfer them, cut side up, into a 9” round spring form. (See photos.)</p> \n<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cover with towel and leave to rise in a warm place in your kitchen for about 1 hour.</p> \n<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Heat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius). Brush babkas with beaten egg. Bake babka loafs for 45-50 minutes, and round babka cake for 50-60 minutes, until golden brown on top. It’s important not to overbake the babkas, as they will dry on the inside. Touch the surface in the center of the babka to make sure it’s almost stable, but not completely firm. Remove to a cooling rack and let cool for 30 minutes (if you can) before serving.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Alternative babka fillings for the dough recipe above:</p> \n<p>Chocolate filling: Melt 8 tablespoons (4 oz.) butter and 8 oz. bittersweet chocolate with a pinch of salt. Spread over dough. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup chocolate chips.</p> \n<p>Cinnamon and hazelnuts: Mix 14 tablespoons butter with 4 tablespoons cinnamon and 1 cup sugar. Spread over dough. sprinkle with 1/2 cup golden raisins and 1/2 cup chopped roasted hazelnuts.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Come New Year’s eve, what do you wish for? A year as sweet as apples in honey is one typical answer. But Jewish tradition offers many other symbolic options. Talmudic era scholars came up with a list of very specific requests to make from God, laying the groundwork for the Rosh Hashanah seder, which Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews have been conducting for hundreds of years.</p> \n<p>The roots of the Rosh Hashanah seder can be found in the Babylonian Talmud circa 300 CE. It was built around symbolic foods chosen for their Aramaic names, which are word plays on the accompanying blessings. The five foods included squash, black eyed pea, leek, Swiss chard and dates.</p> \n<p>The Aramaic word for squash, karaa, uses the same sounds as the Hebrew verbs “rip apart” and “read.” The accompanying blessing is double, that the evil of our verdicts be ripped, and our merits be read before God. As with the other foods, the exact meaning of “karaa” is unclear, and different Jewish communities gave the Aramaic word different interpretations, as pumpkin or squash.</p> \n<p>Sephardi families serve sweet roasted pumpkin burikitas (small pastries) or fried pumpkin sprinkled with sugar. In some communities, families would prepare a sweet pumpkin jam, while others in the levant would serve the light skinned, Middle Eastern zucchini.</p> \n<p>Black-eyed pea or haricots verts are called rubia or lubia in Aramiac. These words contain the same sounds, respectively, as “many” and “heart” in Hebrew. The accommodating blessing asks that our merits become many and that God hearten us.</p> \n<p>Haricot verts can be served simply roasted, or cooked in tomatoes. In Egypt, the word rubia was used for fava bean, but since fresh fava beans were not in season during Rosh Hashanah, Egyptian Jews cooked dried beans. Yemenite Jews used fenugreek for this blessing.</p> \n<p>Leek, karti in Aramaic, relates to the verb “cut” in Hebrew. The blessing asks that our enemies, haters, and those who wish evil upon us be cut down.</p> \n<p>Swiss chard, silk in Aramaic, relates to the Hebrew verb “depart,” and is used to invoke the blessing that our enemies, haters and those who wish evil upon us shall depart. In some communities, beets (selek) are used instead.</p> \n<p>And the date, tamar, shares sounds with the verb “finish” (tam) in Hebrew and comes with the wish that there come an end to our enemies, haters and those who wish evil upon us. (Garlic, thum in Arabic, is used in some communities for the same blessing).</p> \n<p>Feel a little uncomfortable with an evening based on wishing evil upon your enemies? So did Rabbi Menachem Hameiri, who lived in Provence in Medieval times. He claimed the meaning of the last three blessings was fighting our own prejudice and bad intentions, not our actual enemies.</p> \n<p>The dishes prepared to accompany these blessings were Sephardi leek latkes (recipe below), made with or without ground beef and served with lemon wedges; and Swiss chard latkes.&nbsp;In some houses, both leeks and chard would simply be fried or saut&eacute;ed.</p> \n<p>Dates would be served plain. In the Levant, Jews used the yellow, fresh dates that are the sweetest dates available once ripe, and are right in season for the High Holidays.</p> \n<p>Jewish scholars were not always happy about seeing signs in foods, which which they believed was sorcery, but they concluded that these signs encouraged people to pray. So let’s continue.</p> \n<p>Throughout the centuries, the idea of the Rosh Hashanah seder gained momentum, and more symbolic foods and traditions were added.</p> \n<p>The book of Nehemiah recounts that after building the second temple, Nehemiah and Ezra read the Torah to the sons of Israel and when noticing the people were weeping, they urged them to &quot;go eat fat foods and drink sweet drinks,” an order that never had to be repeated again. And so they did.</p> \n<p>Jews in Babylon used to cook fat meat and cook sweet sauces for Rosh Hashanah, to make sure the coming year would be sweet.</p> \n<p>In Medieval France, Jews had red apples for the holiday, and in Provence, they served white grapes. They cooked ram head and lungs, to be set “at the head, and not at the tail” (Deuteronomy, 28:13) and to have a light year. Over the years, ram head turned into fish head, and eventually simply any fish dish.</p> \n<p>The Ashkenazi custom of dipping apples in honey is mentioned in the texts of Rabbi Jacob Ben Asher from the 1300s. The blessing accompanying the dish asked God to renew a year good and sweet like honey.</p> \n<p>Then came the tradition of eating a first-of-the-season fruit, which broadened the holiday table to include etrog and quince.</p> \n<p>Pomegranate was added in the Middle Ages as well, to symbolize the blessing of being filled with mitzvot like a pomegranate is filled with seeds.</p> \n<p>Ashkenazi Jews added carrots, “ma’rin” in Yiddish, which can also mean increase, in order to ask that merits be increased. Some say the sliced carrots in a dish like tsimmes look like gold coins, making this a way of asking for wealth. Other symbols of wealth, of fruitfulness and of multiplying in number include cooked beans in Ashkenazi tradition and sesame seeds for Yemenite Jews.</p> \n<p>The Rosh Hashanah seder has gained popularity with Israelis in recent years among Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Mizrahi alike (not to mention mixed families like mine). Newspapers print the blessings before the holiday and a special Rosh Hashanah seder plate, similar to the Passover seder plate, is now available at gift stores.</p> \n<p>Does this give you enough to work with when planning your Rosh Hashanah dinner? Between the leeks, Swiss chard, pomegranate, carrots, sesame, fish and ram’s head, a truly meaningful and delicious menu can emerge.</p> \n<p>See the full list of prayers here, and print them for each of your guests.</p> \n<p>How to put together your Rosh Hashanah seder:</p> \n<p>Swiss chard latkes – Get the recipe here.</p> \n<p>Dates - Simply serve plain dates, or if you can get fresh yellow dates (available in September at many Middle Eastern stores) you can chop them into green salads.</p> \n<p>Haricots verts - Mix with a little olive oil, sprinkle with salt and roast in the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes or until tender.</p> \n<p>Squash - The traditional Mizrahi and Sephardi way is to fry chunks of pumpkin or squash and serve it dipped in sugar. You could also mix butternut squash chunks with honey, olive oil and kosher salt and roast in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about an hour, or until tender.</p> \n<p>Pomegranate - You can either serve the seeds plain or try this recipe for pomegranate and roasted beet salad (two blessings in one dish) or this recipe for tilapia and pomegranate ceviche&nbsp;(again, two blessings in one, the fish and pomegranate).</p> \n<p>Apple Jam - An Iraqi tradition. In a large bowl, mix 2 pounds of red apples with 1 pound sugar and 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom. Cover and let sit overnight. The next day, transfer to a pot, bring to boil, remove foam, and cook on low heat until very tender. Add juice of one lemon at the end. Keep in the fridge.</p> \n<p>Leek latkes - Excellent with or without meat. Those are hard to resist, especially hot straight out of the pan, so hide them well until dinner.</p> \n<p>Yields about 18.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>INGREDIENTS:</p> \n<p>6 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, chopped</p> \n<p>1 1/2 medium potatoes (about 9 ounces together), peeled and diced into 2-inch cubes</p> \n<p>Leaves from 4 stems flat-leaf parsley</p> \n<p>2 large eggs</p> \n<p>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs or matzo meal</p> \n<p>1/2 lb. ground beef</p> \n<p>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</p> \n<p>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p> \n<p>Vegetable oil for frying</p> \n<p>Lemon wedges to serve</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>DIRECTIONS</p> \n<p>1. Bring salted water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat.</p> \n<p>2. Add the leek and potato pieces to the saucepan. After the water returns to a boil, cover the saucepan and cook the vegetables for 10 minutes, until just tender.</p> \n<p>3. Drain the vegetables in a colander, then run cool tap water on them so they can cool down enough for you to squeeze out as much water as possible from the leeks.</p> \n<p>4. Working in 2 batches, transfer the vegetables to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.</p> \n<p>5. Finely chop the parsley and add to the bowl, along with the eggs, beef (if using), bread crumbs, sea salt and black pepper; mix well.</p> \n<p>6. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat 2 large skillets over medium-high heat. Add just enough oil to coat the bottom of each skillet.</p> \n<p>7. When the oil is quite hot, drop about five large spoonfuls into each of the skillets, using the back of the spoon or a spatula to flatten them slightly. Cook for a few minutes, until browned on the edges, then turn over and cook for a few minutes, watching them closely, just until they are cooked through. Transfer carefully to the lined baking sheet to drain slightly. Repeat to use up all of the leek mixture, adding oil to the skillets as needed.</p> \n<p>8. Cut the reserved lemon half into wedges. Serve the latkes warm or at room temperature with lemon wedges on the side.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Rugelach, a much-loved Jewish pastry, is ubiquitous in Israel nowadays, where varieties range&nbsp;from merely-average cookies sold at neighborhood grocery chains to gourmet delicacies at the country’s best bakeries.</p> \n<p>This lightly yeasted pastry has its roots in the Ashkenazi communities of Eastern Europe, where it was made with traditional fillings such as fruit jams, poppy seed or nuts. From there, it followed Hungarian and Polish Jewish immigrants to Israel and the United States.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But the versions prepared in each country diverged. American bakers, in the name of convenience, substituted a sour-cream or cream-cheese dough in place of the yeast dough.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Professional Israeli bakers, on the other hand, took the pastry up a notch – making an all-out laminated yeast dough just like that used for croissants, with many thin layers of butter.</p> \n<p>While rugelach is popular year-round, it's also traditional to eat it over Hanukkah, along with the fried foods eaten for the holiday.</p> \n<p>The secret to bakery-quality rugelach is just a little advance planning. Leave yourself extra time, in order to make the dough a day in advance, and let the dough rest as needed between steps. This makes the dough more manageable and pliable, which is necessary when you’re rolling it out into the fine, butter-filled layers&nbsp;that give these pastries their lovely texture.</p> \n<p>Makes 20-24 rugelach pastries.</p> \n<p>Ingredients</p> \n<p>For the rugelach dough: 2 cups flour 2 tbsp sugar 1/4 teaspoon yeast 1 large egg at room temperature 1/4 cup softened butter (50 grams( 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 1/3 cup milk</p> \n<p>For folding the dough: 100 grams softened butter (1/2 cup)</p> \n<p>For the rugelach filling: 1/4 cup chocolate 1/4 cup softened butter (50 grams) 1/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons cocoa powder</p> \n<p>For the glaze: 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons water</p> \n<p>Directions</p> \n<p>Ideally, start&nbsp;a day before you plan to make the rugelach. Put flour in a bowl. Add yeast, sugar, softened butter, egg and milk. Mix to form a dough. Add a bit more flour or milk if needed, a teaspoon at a time, until the dough comes together as a soft, but not sticky, ball. Knead for a few minutes, and then set aside. Wrap in plastic.</p> \n<p>Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for a minimum of one hour, but ideally overnight.</p> \n<p>On the day you want to make the rugelach, preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit).</p> \n<p>Take out the dough, and let the butter soften until room temperature. Lightly flour a large work surface. Roll out the dough into a large rectangle. Spread evenly with the butter, leaving the edges clean. Fold into thirds (left and right), and then fold into thirds again (top and bottom). Re-wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p> \n<p>In the meanwhile, make the filling: Put the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave for 30 seconds, until it starts to melt. Mix in the sugar and cocoa until smooth.</p> \n<p>Take the dough out of the fridge, and roll it out into a long rectangle about 30 centimeters (12 inches) deep and 3 millimeters (1/8 inch) thick. Spread with the filling, leaving the edges clean. Fold in half lengthwise, so that the rectangle becomes a long strip about 15 centimeters (6 inches) deep. Roll out lengthwise a bit more, until the dough is close to 3 millimeters (1/8 inch) thick again.</p> \n<p>Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into elongated, 15-centimeter (6-inch) long triangles with bases of 6-7 centimeters (2 inches). Starting at the base of each triangle, roll into a croissant shape. Arrange finished rugelach on a baking sheet covered with baking paper.</p> \n<p>Place the rugelach in the oven, and bake until lightly golden, 20-25 minutes.</p> \n<p>While the rugelach are baking, prepare the syrup: Bring sugar and water to a boil in a small saucepan.</p> \n<p>When rugelach are golden, remove from the oven and brush with syrup.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“If you don’t have any fish, don’t talk to me,” Yehi Zino says good-naturedly on the phone. Zino, chef and co-owner of the Pescado fish restaurant in Ashdod, has a gentle way of talking that exudes a Zen-like calm. But when the subject is the daily catch, it’s a serious business.</p> \n<p>Even a chef whose partners are some of the biggest fish merchants in all Israel — the Zion brothers — has to go out every morning to “hunt” for the best local fish. For someone who’s made his reputation with a fish restaurant that’s become known as a place where both imported and locally caught fish can be enjoyed, he has had to get up early and nurture an extensive network of ties with local fishermen and traders at the daily fish auction. “He’s the first to choose, but he has competition,” laughs his partner, Eran Zano.</p> \n<p>The two men opened their kosher Ashdod restaurant in 2009 (“Everyone thinks we’re brothers, but we’re not related,” says Yehi. “We were good friends when we were kids, then we went our separate ways in school. But then we connected again on a trip to South America”).</p> \n<p>Yehi Zino is an unassuming fellow, with none of the pomposity so often associated with chefs. And his easygoing nature carries over to the kitchen staff and into the restaurant itself.</p> \n<p>He was born in Ashdod in 1982. “The appreciation for good taste is something I got from home,” he says, when asked what led him to kitchen work, “though I never dreamed of becoming a chef.” What was supposed to be a temporary shift at Caf&eacute; Puzzle, a local beach restaurant, led to a six-year stint in the restaurant’s kitchen (“And on Wednesdays, my only day off, I would go to work with Yossi Suissa, who had the Terrine restaurant in Yavneh, and he started to teach me about fish and seafood”).</p> \n<p>He then catered for private events, learned how to prepare sushi and worked for six months at the Zepra restaurant in Tel Aviv. Then, just after he’d sent a letter applying for a job at the famed Arzak Restaurant in San Sebastian, Spain, he received a phone call asking if he was interested in taking over Pescado, a local fish restaurant and bar where he’d also previously worked for a few months.</p> \n<p>Eran Zano “also got the same phone call,” Yehi relates. “We met at the beach the next day, and the day after that we bought the restaurant. I didn’t know what I was getting into. In retrospect, I can’t believe I did it — opening a restaurant with just the knowledge I had then. The food I served seven and a half years ago is nothing like the food I serve today.”</p> \n<p>Minimalist delights</p> \n<p>Good fish restaurants rise and fall on the quality of their ingredients. In 2009, it was still possible to eat well at Pescado, but it’s hard to compare the meals back then to what this young and talented chef serves up today.</p> \n<p>In addition to his great talent, Zino also possesses boundless curiosity about flavors and ingredients, and a keen thirst for knowledge. The basic menu, like the design of the restaurant, is minimalist: white ikra, spicy tomato salad, several Asian-inspired raw fish dishes, and four or five fish dishes based primarily on the selection available from imports and fish farms (sea bream, sea bass, salmon and meagre).</p> \n<p>Then there’s the daily selection of locally caught fish, depending on what the sea and local fishermen can provide (even Zino, one of the few chefs who keeps a careful daily record of the fish being brought to the market, admits that in the modern age and with the current fishing situation, it’s hard to define any clear seasonality).</p> \n<p>The dishes on the menu, either Asian- or Mediterranean-inspired, appear simple, with the flavor of the main ingredient front and center, and the type of fish dictating the cooking method. But they are also very elegant dishes and their originality shines through.</p> \n<p>After years of study (and trial and error), Zino is one of the few people who has mastered the secrets of the Mediterranean. Word of this excellent fish restaurant located on the Ashdod shore — and unfortunately, even in a country that sits along the Mediterranean coast, there are not many of this caliber — has spread and the place is almost always packed. Even on a Sunday afternoon, a time when most Israeli restaurants are at best half-full, Pescado is bustling. Besides the many locals who have made this pleasant, southern Israeli restaurant their second home, lots of people (including us) travel from further afield just to eat Zino’s fish.</p> \n<p>Zino’s fish recipes</p> \n<p>Spiced Moroccan oil:</p> \n<p>Ingredients:</p> \n<p>2 liters (8.5 cups) canola oil</p> \n<p>1 cinnamon stick</p> \n<p>2 tbsp. grated shata pepper</p> \n<p>2 tbsp. sweet Moroccan paprika</p> \n<p>5 sweet peppers</p> \n<p>Place all the ingredients in a pot and simmer over the lowest flame for 40 minutes. Make sure the oil doesn’t start to bubble, since the paprika burns easily.</p> \n<p>Remove from the fire and let cool. Blend the contents of the pot using an immersion blender or food processor and then filter through a piece of cheesecloth. The seasoned oil keeps well and becomes even tastier after a few days.</p> \n<p>Moroccan fish</p> \n<p>This traditional dish, a skillet filled with fish in a hot tomato and pepper sauce in which to dip thick slices of bread, does not appear on the restaurant’s menu. But Zino sometimes makes it for groups of regular customers who come and sit in the restaurant every day, and it is simply superb. The degree of spiciness can be adjusted as desired.</p> \n<p>Ingredients (for 6 servings):</p> \n<p>1 kg. sea bass, sliced; or 6</p> \n<p>grouper fillets, 150-170 gm.</p> \n<p>each, sliced with the bone; or</p> \n<p>one grouper head taken from</p> \n<p>a fish weighing 6-8 kg.</p> \n<p>Separated and peeled cloves</p> \n<p>from 1 head of garlic</p> \n<p>6 fresh whole red chili peppers</p> \n<p>2 sweet red (gamba) peppers,</p> \n<p>sliced in wide strips</p> \n<p>300 gm. whole cherry</p> \n<p>tomatoes</p> \n<p>Separated leaves from one bunch of cilantro</p> \n<p>250 ml. spiced Moroccan oil (see recipe)</p> \n<p>200 ml. water</p> \n<p>Preparation:</p> \n<p>Salt the fish well on both sides with fine salt. Heat a little of the oil in a wide pot and fry the garlic until golden. Add the peppers and tomatoes and fry for 4-5 minutes.</p> \n<p>Add the water and the fish slices and bring to a boil. Add the rest of the oil, cover the pot, lower the flame and simmer over a low fire for about 15 minutes, until all the fish is cooked.</p> \n<p>Remove from the fire and sprinkle cilantro leaves on top.</p> \n<p>Baked fish with white wine and tomatoes</p> \n<p>Can be made with sea bream, meagre, red snapper or mullet.</p> \n<p>Ingredients:</p> \n<p>1 sea bream, weighing 1 kg.</p> \n<p>3 shallots, peeled</p> \n<p>5 scallions</p> \n<p>150 ml. white wine</p> \n<p>2 ripe tomatoes</p> \n<p>10 whole cherry tomatoes</p> \n<p>2 fresh whole red chili peppers</p> \n<p>1 small spring of tarragon (or 1 star anise)</p> \n<p>Coarse and fine salt</p> \n<p>Ground dried chili</p> \n<p>Ground black pepper</p> \n<p>0.5 cup water</p> \n<p>Leaves from 1 bunch basil</p> \n<p>Olive oil</p> \n<p>Preparation:</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees Celsius (482 degrees Fahrenheit).</p> \n<p>Heat a cast-iron skillet, slice the shallots width-wise, sear them in the skillet and then set them aside.</p> \n<p>Place the scallions and white wine in an ovenproof pan and cook over a direct flame.</p> \n<p>Cut a cross-hatching pattern in the thick parts of the fish, and salt the fish well with fine salt.</p> \n<p>Place the fish in the pan and arrange the shallots, cherry tomatoes, peppers and tarragon on top. Season with coarse salt, dried chili and black pepper. Cut the tomatoes in half, squeeze them over the fish and vegetables, and then add to the pan.</p> \n<p>Put the pan on the stove and bring to a boil until the alcohol evaporates. Add the water and pour on a generous amount of olive oil.</p> \n<p>Place the pan in the oven and roast for 10 minutes, until the fish is cooked. Remove from the oven, sprinkle basil leaves on top and serve immediately.</p> \n<p>Stuffed cigars with fish ‘wings’</p> \n<p>“Wings,” in the parlance of cooks and fishermen, are the front fins on either side of a fish’s head. The flesh of the fish is more fatty in this area, so it has less tendency to dry out in cooking and is easier to remove from the bone (the bones here are mostly bigger). In terms of taste, we’re talking heaven. Last month, some wonderful local fish was available in the markets and restaurants, and some restaurants put “fried wings” on the menu. Preparing these stuffed cigars takes a little work, but the delicious warm cigars are totally addictive.</p> \n<p>Ingredients:</p> \n<p>2 kg. “wings” of large sea fish</p> \n<p>(grouper, amberjack, meagre)</p> \n<p>2 bunches scallions</p> \n<p>4 large white onions, peeled and</p> \n<p>finely chopped</p> \n<p>2 tsp. cumin</p> \n<p>Cigar leaves</p> \n<p>Fine salt</p> \n<p>Coarsely ground black pepper</p> \n<p>Olive oil</p> \n<p>Vegetable oil for deep frying</p> \n<p>For the paste:</p> \n<p>0.5 cup flour</p> \n<p>1 cup water</p> \n<p>For the dip:</p> \n<p>3 tomatoes</p> \n<p>Olive oil</p> \n<p>Salt</p> \n<p>Coarsely ground black pepper</p> \n<p>Heat the oil in a pan for deep frying and fry the wings until brown. Remove the wings from the pot and place in a strainer until they cool a bit. Putting on rubber gloves, gently separate the flesh of the fish from the bones and skin, and place in a mixing bowl.</p> \n<p>Cut the scallions into 4-centimeter (1.5 inch) segments. Heat a skillet, pour in a little olive oil and sear the scallions for about 2 minutes, until soft. Remove from the skillet and add to the bowl with the fish.</p> \n<p>Heat a little olive oil in a skillet and fry the chopped onion until brown and caramelized, remove from the skillet and add to the bowl.</p> \n<p>Mix the contents of the bowl well, add the cumin, salt, pepper and olive oil and refrigerate.</p> \n<p>Prepare paste by mixing the flour and water.</p> \n<p>Fill the cigar leaves: Spread a cigar leaf on the work surface. Place a little bit of filling near the end closest to you and roll it up as you would when making stuffed grape leaves. Fold the edges of the leaf on the right and left over the mixture and start to roll from the bottom until you obtain a small, well-closed package with no holes. Spread some of the paste over the edges of the leaf to seal.</p> \n<p>The dip: Grate the tomatoes, transfer to a bowl, season with olive oil, salt and coarsely ground black pepper.</p> \n<p>Heat oil in a pan for deep frying, fry the cigars until golden brown and transfer to a platter lined with paper towels.</p> \n<p>Serve warm, with the tomato dip on the side.</p> \n<p>Fish soup</p> \n<p>A marvelous thick soup that just calls out for great crusty bread to go with it.</p> \n<p>Ingredients (for 6 servings):</p> \n<p>For the stock:</p> \n<p>0.5 kg. cleaned red mullet</p> \n<p>1 carrot</p> \n<p>1 onion</p> \n<p>1 leek</p> \n<p>2 tomatoes</p> \n<p>1 sprig tarragon</p> \n<p>200 ml. white wine</p> \n<p>1 liter water</p> \n<p>Olive oil</p> \n<p>For the soup:</p> \n<p>5 carrots</p> \n<p>2 onions</p> \n<p>1 bunch celery stalks, without</p> \n<p>the leaves</p> \n<p>2 medium-size leeks</p> \n<p>0.5 liter grated tomatoes</p> \n<p>Olive oil</p> \n<p>To make the stock:</p> \n<p>Soak the red mullet in ice water for 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Coarsely chop 1 carrot, 1 onion, 1 leek and the 2 tomatoes.</p> \n<p>Drain the fish and cut into big pieces. Heat a little olive oil in a large pot and add the fish. Then add the chopped vegetables and tarragon, and fry together until the vegetables are seared.</p> \n<p>Add the white wine, let the alcohol evaporate and then add 1 liter water. Bring to a boil, lower the flame and cook at a gentle boil for 45 minutes.</p> \n<p>Use an immersion blender or food processor to crush the contents of the pot, then put through a fine sieve. Mash again and put through a fine sieve.</p> \n<p>For the soup:</p> \n<p>Dice the onion, celery, leek and carrot into pieces of approximately equal size. Heat a little olive oil in a pot and fry the diced vegetables until golden.</p> \n<p>Add the strained fish stock to the pot, bring to a boil and then lower the flame. Simmer for 20 minutes over a very low flame. Add the grated tomatoes and simmer for 20 more minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Rosh Hashanah is almost here and, even with the fusion in contemporary Israeli food, the holiday season is the time we return to traditional ethnic dishes. Each family has its own tradition; each ethnic group has its special dishes that have been around for generations. In honor of the holiday, we brought together four home cooks – specializing in Hungarian, Syrian-Lebanese, French and Moroccan cuisine – from the Yummi website, to prepare their traditional holiday dishes and share their home-made recipes and tips on how to survive the holiday cooking marathons.A taste of heaven / Getting to know Esther Doron, who cooks in the Hungarian style&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“I’ve been cooking for 45 years, ever since I got married. My five grandchildren are always saying, ‘Nana, what did you cook for me?’ When I got married I didn’t know much about cooking, but I was jealous when my husband boasted about his mother’s cooking, so I started cooking too – so that one day my husband and children would boast of my special dishes. As soon as I began cooking, all these childhood memories from my grandmother’s kitchen in Hungary came back to me, and I remembered how I would sit next to her and gaze in awe at her agile hands as they chopped and kneaded and rolled. I remember the slices of bread she would dip for me in the rich red sauce simmering on the fire; it tasted like heaven. Hungarian cooking still comes to me naturally. It’s in my DNA.“At our holiday table we’ll have the extended family – my daughters with their husbands and children, my sons with their girlfriends and the family of one of them – 20 people altogether. How do I survive all the preparations and cooking for so many? Very simple. I parcel the work out into a number of days so I won’t end up collapsing when the holiday eve finally arrives. I prepare whatever I can beforehand and freeze it, for as long as a week, and that includes the kreplach, which take a lot of work and are very time-consuming. I make the salads the night before, and then they can wait in the fridge – I pour on the dressing at the last moment. The meat and soup can also stay in the fridge for a couple of days.“The dish eaten only on Rosh Hashanah is the soup with kreplach. The family won’t eat it at any other time, so as not to ruin the uniqueness of the holiday eve. My son, for example, eats six or seven kreplach in his soup, then keeps his soup bowl near and goes fishing for any kreplach left in the soup pot. We have to have kreplach throughout the holiday.”Kreplach recipe</p> \n<p>Photo by Yishai Doron</p> \n<p>This recipe makes approximately 16 kreplach. I always triple it so there will be enough to get through the whole holiday. Plan for two or three kreplach, depending on the size, per serving.For the dough:</p> \n<p>2 cups flour2 egg yolks&frac12; cup cold watersaltFor the filling:250 gr ground beef1 large onion1 egg2 tbsp breadcrumbsSalt and black pepper3 tbsp oilThe dough: </p> \n<p>Beat the eggs with the water and knead together with the flour and salt. The dough will be stiff at first but then it becomes more pliable. Cover and let rest for half an hour to an hour.</p> \n<p>The filling: Place the meat in a skillet with oil and fry until browned. Finely chop the onion and add it to the meat and continue frying until the onion is translucent. Season to taste and then chill. Add the egg and breacrumbs and mix well.Assembling the kreplach:</p> \n<p>Roll out the dough into a thin sheet – the thinner the better (a pasta machine may be used).Cut into 5x7 cm squares and place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the center of each square. Lightly moisten the edges of the squares and fold into triangles. Pinch the edges together well to keep the filling inside. Press the two tips of the triangle together so they stick (the shape will be similar to tortellini).</p> \n<p>Bring a pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook the kreplach in the salted water for 10-15 minutes, until they float to the surface. Drain well and store in the refrigerator. Heat them in the soup before serving.Syrian-Lebanese-Israeli / A peek into the kitchen of Nissim Hilu, who specializes in Syrian-Lebanese home cooking</p> \n<p>Photo by Hadas Peretz</p> \n<p>&quot;The first time I remember cooking was when I was six years old. My older brother and I asked my mother to make majadara for us, and even though she promised to make it the next day, we decided to make it ourselves right then and there. At some point my mother took over and finished the work we started. Eventually, my love for cooking led me to study cooking professionally – at age 55, once a week for 10 months, at the end of the workday. My cooking style has always been homestyle Oriental, with a focus on Syrian-Lebanese cuisine. It’s the type of cooking I absorbed from my mother and later from my mother-in-law.“The preparations for the holiday meals in my childhood revolved around the things used in the blessings of the Kiddush – lubia (black-eyed-peas), karat (leek), mangold (chard) leaves stuffed with rice and meat, and kar’a (gourd). All cooked in the Syrian style. The greatest was when the whole big family would get together in my mother’s small house, and despite the shortage of space, no one ever felt crowded, and no one ever left hungry, and there was always a feeling that there was plenty to go around.“For the upcoming holiday, I’ll be hosting something like 20 or 25 people, and I’ll cook the main food and the food for the blessings, and as always, whatever is left over the guests will take home with them, so that the next day we’ll have nothing left from the holiday eve meal.“I start making preparations for the holiday cooking a few days in advance. Slicing, chopping, getting things ready, so that when the day for cooking comes, I’m more than 50 percent ready and all that’s left is to put the pots on the stove and finish the job. I get the pots going early in the morning because all the flavor comes from slow cooking over a low flame for many hours.“My favorite dish is what we make for the blessing over the leek, which we call karat.”Stuffed karat (Serves 6, with 6 units per person):</p> \n<p>1 very thick leek, the white part cut in 8-cm-long slices and then cut lengthwise, but just up to the middle2 cups round rice, rinsed and drained400 gr fresh ground beef&frac12; cup sweet-sour pomegranate concentrate (a thick concentrate for the sauce and 2 more tablespoons for the filling)&frac12; cup lemon juice2 cups watersalt and black pepper1 &frac12; tsp baharat2 tsp sugar5 tbsp canola oilBlanch the leek until the leaves separate (the aim is just to soften the leek, not cook it). Bring a pot of water to a boil and add a teaspoon of salt. Add the leak to the boiling water and remove it when the water returns to a boil. Transfer to cold water.The sauce:In a small pot, place 1/2 cup of pomegranate concentrate, the lemon juice, water, 1 tsp salt and pepper, &frac12; tsp of baharat and 1 tsp of sugar. Bring to a boil, adjust the seasonings to taste. Set aside to cool.The filling:Mix the rice with the meat, salt, pepper, baharat, 2 tbsp pomegranate concentrate and a little oil, until well combined. Taste and adjust seasonings.Place a leaf of the leek on a flat dish and top it with filling so you are able to roll the leaf one and a half-times around the meat, then pinch the edges closed.Spread the oil in a 24-cm pot. Place in it all the leaves that were not suitable for filling, and then put all the stuffed leaves on top. They should be close together, but not stuck together, seam side down.</p> \n<p>Fill the pot with 2-3 layers of stuffed leeks and pour on the sauce to cover. Place a dish over the leaves. Bring the pot to a boil, then lower the heat to a minimum and let simmer for two hours. Or transfer to a preheated 125 degree Celsius oven and let cook for five hours.Remove from the heat and let cool for half an hour before serving.A way with beef / In the kitchen with Liora Bresniac, who specializes in French cuisine</p> \n<p>Photo by Hadas Peretz</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;My father, who was a butcher and the son of a butcher, and had a butcher shop in the Mahaneh Yehuda market in Jerusalem, taught me the joy of food and how to specialize in meat. I’m a graduate of the Seligsberg Culinary School, where I specialized in French cooking. For the last two years, I’ve been cooking for a living, and it’s still my great love.“Our holiday meal is usually based on the foods we always ate growing up. We try to preserve the tradition we were raised on, with the traditional foods, although my sister and I have both gone in different directions. For us, preserving the traditional foods is what gives the holiday a special atmosphere.“This year I’m hosting my close family – my sons and their wives and children, and there’s no greater happiness than that, but in order to survive all the cooking, I have to work with orderly lists, for shopping and for the menu. I must have a clear schedule worked out, otherwise I’ll just get lost and end up exhausted by the time the holiday comes.“The food that everyone in the family absolutely must have for Rosh Hashanah is chicken soup with cooked marrow and lots of vegetables, including root vegetables, and kreplach. Besides that, there’s also my beef dish, which I’ve upgraded a little from my mother’s version from my childhood, and this is the one I’ve chosen to present here.”</p> \n<p>Beef with wine, mushrooms and chestnuts (serves 4)</p> \n<p>Photo by Meshek8</p> \n<p>1 kilo fresh beef fillet or entrecote1 package chestnuts1 package champignon mushrooms1 onionolive oilwhole-grain mustardcoarsely ground black pepper2 cups good red wine2 tbsp pomegranate concentrate2 tbsp prune jamWaterImportant: Cook the piece of meat whole; it will be sliced after cooking.Brush the meat with olive oil and mustard andsprinkle with coarsely ground black pepper.Slice the onion and fry in a large saucepan with a little oil over high heat. When the onion is golden, add the meat to the pot and fry for a few minutes on each side.</p> \n<p>Add the wine, pomegranate concentrate, jam and a &frac12; cup of water. Cook for half an hour and then taste. Remember: The gravy should be slightly sweet, so you can carefully add more of the ingredients if desired.Now simmer over medium heat for at least two and a half hours. When the meat is tender, add the chestnuts and sliced mushrooms for brief cooking.</p> \n<p>Turn off the heat and allow the meat to cool. When it is cold, cut into thin slices.Can’t do without fish / What’s cooking in Limor Bar’s Moroccan kitchen?</p> \n<p>“I’ve been cooking for years,” says Bar. “When I was a kid I would always help my mother with the cooking for Shabbat. I like to cook almost anything. I like to try new recipes and if they’re successful I keep them in a special file. If it doesn’t work, the recipe goes in the trash.“Usually every year I host the whole family, but this year we’re going to be deviating from our usual custom. After the tough period of the war and being shut in the house, we decided this year to take it easy on the holiday, so instead of hosting everyone we’re going to be vacationing in Eilat. Usually, my survival strategy for coping with all the holiday cooking is very simple – keeping things neat and organized in the kitchen. It may sound obvious, but it’s an important tip not just for the holiday but for cooking in general. To prepare as many things as possible ahead of time so you can enjoy the cooking without a lot of pressure.“Our traditional Rosh Hashanah food is ‘tanziya’ – a dish made with dried fruit, cooked with a lot of onion and lamb. It has just the right amount of sweetness and is so delicious. And you can’t do without fish, of course. So the recipe I’ve chosen is for festive Moroccan fish, ‘so we should be like the head and not the tail.’”Moroccan fish</p> \n<p>1.5 kilos tuna (6-7 pieces)peeled cloves from 1 head garlicHot red pepper – depending how hot you want it, use 1-2 peppers for a little spice, 4-5 peppers for a very spicy dish3 potatoes, cut into thick rounds&frac12; cup chickpeas that have been soakedovernight (optional)1 bunch cilantro, finely chopped1 scant tbsp hot paprika5 scant tbsp sweet paprika2 scant tbsp turmericfish seasoningsalt1 small cup of canola oil2 cups waterIn a wide, shallow saucepan, scatter the garlic cloves along with the peppers, potatoes and chickpeas.</p> \n<p>Arrange the fish on top and sprinkle each piece with salt and half a teaspoon of chopped cilantro.</p> \n<p>In a small bowl (the size of a cereal bowl), place the seasonings one atop the other: the two kinds of paprika, the turmeric, fish seasoning and a little salt. Add the oil and mix until you have a marinade. Pour this over the fish.Fill the same bowl with water and pour that over the fish as well. To avoid breaking the fish slices, gently move the pan from side to side until the liquids are well blended.You can leave the pot in the refrigerator overnight and cook it the next day. This way the fish will absorb all the flavors.Cook over high heat for 10 minutes, until the liquids come to a boil; then lower heat and simmer for about an hour.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Forget rogue waves, hostile rams or hidden reefs. The real terror of the ancient shipwrights was the teredon worm.</p> \n<p>Infestations of this remorseless mollusk could be kept at bay only by vigilant maintenance, including drying out&nbsp;the hull on shore and constant applications of pitch. The Greek poet Homer's poetical reference in &quot;The Iliad&quot; to “black ships” referred exactly to that.</p> \n<p>This week a new species of shipworm was discovered alive for the first time. The giant jet-black creature had been known for centuries but remained unfound and despite being several feet in length, intriguingly, does not eat and has no digestive system. The more conventional shipworms had very healthy appetites.</p> \n<p>In summer, the Mediterranean and temperate seas the world wide seethe with the spawn of the teredo, actually a sort of extreme clam.&nbsp;Each teredo tiny larva swims about desperately evading predators and seeking timber: driftwood, dock pilings, or the hull of a passing ship. Fastening to the wooden surface, the larva bores a hole, rapping at it with the razorlike edge of its vestigial shell.</p> \n<p>Once ensconced in its hiding place, the teredo never emerges. It keeps its mouth fixed to the opening of its hole, sucking in life-giving seawater. Meanwhile, it grows and as it does, the sharp shell at the other end of its body burrows ever deeper.</p> \n<p>As the burrow extends into the timber, the animal grows to fill its ever-lengthening home. Within a month, the sluglike teredo can reach 30 centimeters and is now ready to eject swarms of larvae of its own into the sea, starting a new cycle.</p> \n<p>Their wood planking and ribs riddled with their holes, ancient ships would suddenly break up and sink mid-voyage.</p> \n<p>Only conscientious maintenance – new applications of pitch, drying out and inspecting of hulls, and prompt replacement of unsound planks – could keep the wooden ships seaworthy, for up to about 25 years.</p> \n<p>Not Man's best friend</p> \n<p>Thus the worst enemy of wooden-hulled navies in the Mediterranean waters was less the neighbors than the misnamed worm. The maiden trires in Aristophanes resigned herself to a worm-eaten old age:</p> \n<p>“Soon shall age these timbers eat, and give the worms a lasting treat” – Aristophanes, &quot;The Knights&quot;</p> \n<p>The earliest written allusions to protection against shipworm is in Homer, whose most common epithet for ships after “swift” is “black” or “dark”, a reference to the coating of pitch that made the ancients ships seaworthy and protected against the dread clam.</p> \n<p>Herodotus (6.119) informs that the Phoenicians, from the 5th century B.C.E., seemed to have plated their ship with bronze or bitumen to waterproof their vessels and deter the teredo.</p> \n<p>Some ancient merchant ships solved the problem by being lead-sheathed, but the weight of lead made it unsuitable for oared warships, which needed to be lightweight and swift in the sea. The Greeks would haul their warships into huge shipsheds, where harbor workers would inspect the keel, replace infested planks and apply fresh pitch. Inventories of ships at the time frequently labeled wooden gear “worm eaten”.</p> \n<p>The pitch was made out of resin and lime, tar and Sulphur, mixed with oil.&nbsp; In later times, the keels were also waxed. The Romans used the same methods to protect their ships.</p> \n<p>The Vikings, however, seemed to have put more effort into beautifying their long-ships with ornaments only above the water-line (although there is a description of a smaller boat that was coated with tar).</p> \n<p>The technology did not improve much over the millennia. The great seafarers Francis Drake (1540-1596), Christopher Columbus (1451-1506), and James Cook (1728 -1779) suffered badly from infested keels during their exploration voyages. Their main method of protecting the ships seemed to have been&nbsp; to coat the keels every month with a layer of beck, oil and tar. Yet on Columbus' fourth voyage, they survived storms, hurricanes, coral reefs and diseases but had to abandon the ships due to the shipworms.</p> \n<p>During the 16th and 17th centuries, a technique developed involving anhydration of the wood exterior&nbsp;using animal hair and tar. The ships of the East India Company were built in this manner, then coated with a bottom paint made out of arsenic, broken glass, ceruse and tallow.</p> \n<p>After thousands of years, the industrial revolution brought back a forgotten solution: From the mid-18th century, ships were plated with metal, in this case copper, which prevented the larva from latching on to infest the keels.</p> \n<p>The collapse of the San Francisco bay piers due to shipworm in 1914 led to the development of new prevention methods, to hinder the immense damage caused by the mussel.</p> \n<p>So humans don't appreciate its charms and the monster shipworm species newly discovered burrowing into swamp mud in the Philippines is unlovely. But as much of nuisance the shipworm may be, it plays a crucial ecological function by breaking down and replacing organic material in nature. The shipworm has existed for over 60 million years, and is also happily eaten by peoples around the globe, including the Amazonas and the Philippines.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The High Court of Justice summarily rejected a petition by Temple Mount activists on Sunday demanding that the police allow them to stage their annual reenactment of the Paschal sacrifice in an archaeological park near the Temple Mount.</p> \n<p>Though the reenactment is held every year, it has never been held in close proximity to the Mount.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Jerusalem police chief Yoram Halevy announced that he would not permit the reenactment to be held near the Jerusalem Archaeological Park’s Davidson Center. On Sunday, the activists behind the reenactment responded by filing a petition in the court against this decision.</p> \n<p>Police legal adviser Michael Frankenburg then informed their attorney, Aviad Visoly, that Halevy had conducted a situation assessment about the issue, and on the basis of that assessment, he decided not to permit the event to take place at the Davidson Center, even if various restrictions were imposed.</p> \n<p>The activists claim that during their discussions with police officers last week, police had actually seemed willing to permit the reenactment to be held at the park under certain conditions. According to sources involved in the talks, the conditions were that the sacrificial lamb couldn’t actually be slaughtered at the site, nor could it be burned on the altar there, but other parts of the ceremony could take place.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, on Thursday, Halevy decided to ban the event completely.</p> \n<p>In their ruling, Justices Salim Joubran, Yoram Danziger and Uri Shoham stressed that this decision lies within the hard core of the police’s authority and competence. But beyond that, they added, “it seems this is the correct decision, about which one could say that it is appropriate and even mandatory.”</p> \n<p>The ceremony has been conducted annually for the past 15 years. It began as a semi-underground event in which an animal was sacrificed a few days before the Passover Seder. In recent years, the reenactment has become an institution and has become the most important event of the year for Temple Mount activists.</p> \n<p>Last year, the reenactment was held in the Bet Orot neighborhood on the Mount of Olives, with a view of the Temple Mount. This year, organizers decided to hold the ceremony as close to the Temple Mount as possible, just south of the Western Wall Plaza.</p> \n<p>The Jerusalem municipality has supported the event in recent years, and an inspector from the Veterinary Service has been on hand to supervise the slaughter of the sacrificial animal. Hundreds of people, including Knesset members, rabbis and other public figures have attended the ceremony in recent years.</p> \n<p>The archaeological park is run by the Company for the Reconstruction and Development of the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem, a government-owned corporation under the Construction and Housing Ministry. The company approved the request to hold the ceremony in the park, but required organizers to also receive permission from the police.</p> \n<p>Holding the reenactment is expected to draw a furious response from Islamic groups, who say it is a provocation; the Islamic Waqf views the entire area as part of the Temple Mount. In addition, for years some archaeologists have been complaining about holding events in the archaeological park, which they say violates the character of the site.</p>",

        "text":["<p>With his impassioned defense of the embattled President Donald Trump, amid the constant drip of new revelations regarding his campaign’s relationship with Russia, Jay Sekulow, Trump’s personal attorney, has quickly become a familiar face to viewers of the Sunday morning news shows in the United States.</p> \n<p>Tanned, bespectacled and nattily dressed with a red tie and a uniquely folded pocket square, Sekulow, 61, came out swinging this past Sunday, on four major news shows. He asserted firmly on all of them that Trump was not aware until “very recently” of the now-infamous June 2016 meeting between his son, son-in-law and campaign manager, and a Russian government lawyer promising to deliver dirt on Hillary Clinton. Sekulow insisted that the president knows of “no other meetings” with the Russians.</p> \n<p>But years before he was all over television screens doing battle with network hosts, Sekulow, was a celebrity legal warrior for conservative Christian causes. A Messianic Jew who affiliates with Jews for Jesus and has served on its national board and as its general counsel, he argued a landmark case on behalf of the group before the Supreme Court.</p> \n<p>Sekulow went on to become chief counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice, founded by televangelist Pat Robertson. The lawyer’s comfort during his recent pro-Trump media appearances reflects the fact that he has hosted a radio show called “Jay Sekulow Live!” and is a frequent commentator on law and civil liberties.</p> \n<p>In addition to cases involving freedom of religious expression, he also is involved in a case in which he is defending a host of right-wing pro-Israel groups. He is representing the Gush Etzion Foundation, one of over a dozen defendants, in al-Tamimi vs. Adelson – a 2016 lawsuit brought by Palestinian activist Bassem al-Tamimi and others. The latter contend that the defendants, a group of U.S. nonprofits, philanthropists and corporations led by American casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson, are guilty of war crimes against Palestinians, among other accusations.</p> \n<p>Sekulow’s co-counsel in the case is Marc Zell, co-chair of Republicans Abroad Israel, who lives in the West Bank settlement of Tekoa.</p> \n<p>Sekulow discussed the case at the Ambassadors Against BDS International Summit in March at United Nations headquarters, where he introduced himself as “the grandson of a fruit peddler from Brooklyn, New York, who came to the United States from Russia.”</p> \n<p>He said he had been brought into the Tamimi case by Israel’s UN Ambassador Danny Danon because “the folks in Gush Etzion” (a cluster of settlements located in the Judean Hills, south of Jerusalem) needed a “tough” lawyer. “I like being a tough lawyer,” he declared. “And when you know the story of Gush Etzion, it brings out the toughest part of who you are.”</p> \n<p>Spiritual path</p> \n<p>Sekulow penned a personal account of his spiritual path on the Jews for Jesus website in 2005, titled “How a Jewish Lawyer From Brooklyn Came to Believe in Jesus.”</p> \n<p>He wrote there that he was raised as a Reform Jew on Long Island and later moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he had his bar mitzvah. As an undergraduate at Atlanta Baptist College, he said he had been determined in a mandatory Bible class to “outsmart” the Christians and prove Jesus wasn’t the Messiah, but soon developed “genuine curiosity” and made an “intellectual” decision that this was the proper interpretation of the Bible.</p> \n<p>“I’d always thought my cultural Judaism was sufficient, but in the course of studying about the Messiah who would die as a sin bearer, I realized that I needed a messiah to do that for me. When I concluded that Jesus was that Messiah, I was grateful,” he wrote on the website.</p> \n<p>Later, he found fellow travellers in the Jews for Jesus organization.</p> \n<p>Early in his legal career Sekulow joined the group’s board of directors, and then, he noted, “I thought more and more about using my legal skills to serve God. In 1986 I became the Jews for Jesus general legal counsel.&quot;</p> \n<p>It was in that capacity that he successfully argued his first Supreme Court case in 1987, contending that a Los Angeles International Airport ban on the group handing out pamphlets constituted a ban on &quot;First Amendment activities,&quot; and violated the organization’s right to free speech.</p> \n<p>In 1992, Sekulow moved to Robertson’s ACLJ, an organization that takes on cases involving evangelical and Christian rights. It also spearheaded the legal effort to stop the building of a mosque at Ground Zero in New York City.</p> \n<p>'Obnoxiously rich'</p> \n<p>However, Sekulow’s financial success while working for nonprofits that back his numerous high-profile legal activities have raised eyebrows. When Donald Trump hired him as his personal attorney, the liberal blog Think Progress described the lawyer as “fantastically, opulently, obnoxiously rich. And, much like his most famous client, Sekulow got that way through an elaborate web of business ventures, family-led operations, and media savvy.”</p> \n<p>An extensive 2005 investigation in Legal Times detailed how Sekulow, thanks to “a string of interconnected nonprofit and for-profit entities, has built a financial empire that generates millions of dollars a year and supports a lavish lifestyle – complete with multiple homes, chauffeur-driven cars, and a private jet.”</p> \n<p>A 2011 article in USA Today reported that Sekulow served as the principal officer of both the ACLJ and another group he founded called Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism, whose structure has been criticized by charity watchdog organizations that point the finger at practices that seem to be disproportionately bankrolling his family.</p> \n<p>According to the article: “Since 1998, the two charities have paid out more than $33 million to members of Sekulow’s family and businesses they own or co-own, according to the charities’ federal tax returns. One of the charities is controlled by the Sekulow family — tax documents show that all four of CASE’s board members are Sekulows and another is an officer.”</p> \n<p>The same story quoted numerous Sekulow friends and supporters defending him, saying he was “a humble man dedicated to the Christian cause.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Dozens of protesters gathered in front of the Neve Shalom synagogue in Istanbul on Thursday night to rally against Israel’s decision to install metal detectors at the entries to Jerusalem’s Temple Mount. The protesters, who were seen kicking the synagogue’s gates and throwing stones, chanted, “if you don’t let us into our places of worship, we won’t let you into yours.”</p> \n<p>The protest was organised by Alperen Ocaklari, a far-right nationalist and Islamist movement linked to the Great Unity Party, an extremist offshoot of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), which has supported Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in his successful bid to turn the country into a presidential democracy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Speaking in front of the synagogue, the local president of Alperen Ocaklari, K&uuml;rşat Mican, accused Israel of “harassing our Palestinian brothers and hindering their freedom of worship” with the placement of metal detectors at the Temple Mount. Before putting an end to the protest, Mican asserted that “either the Zionists pull themselves together, or we will come again.”</p> \n<p>Israel installed the metal detectors at the compound last Sunday after assailants opened fire there, killing two Israeli police officers. The Waqf – the Muslim religious body that has authority over the site – announced that the metal detectors are an attempt to change the status quo and called on worshipers not to enter the site. Over the past week, violent clashes have erupted at the compound.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Members of the Jewish community of Istanbul told Haaretz that the protests in front of Neve Shalom synagogue are reminiscent of demonstrations that took place during the Gaza operation in 2014. “It was a massive shock for us because it was the first time that synagogues were deliberately targeted to protest Israeli policies,” a young community member said, referring to the 2014 protests.</p> \n<p>While only small numbers of Turkish Jews have immigrated to Israel in the past few years, some members of the community fear that greater tensions between the two countries could induce more departures. “After the Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH) organised the Mavi Marmara operation in 2010, which aimed to try break the embargo of Gaza, we all felt less safe,” a member of the community said, recalling the episode which led to a decade-long freeze in Israeli-Turkish relations.</p> \n<p>“Members of the NGO invented that the Israeli soldiers who fought and killed some of the activists were Turkish Jews who had recently emigrated to Israel, only to stir up domestic anti-Semitism. We fear that if the Temple Mount crisis slips out of hand, protests here could increase, and maybe even lead to more departures.”</p> \n<p>Almost all Turkish Jews, a community of about 18.000, live in Istanbul. Many members of the community left Turkey after the imposition of the Varlk Vergisi in 1942, a so-called tax on wealth, which was deliberately tailored to target and impoverish minorities. Many others left following the 1955 Istanbul pogroms, which started with the spreading of rumors that Greeks had put a bomb at the birthplace of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in Thessaloniki. Although street violence mainly targeted Greek and Armenian Christians, many Jews took it as a warning sign for all minorities and decided to leave the country.</p>",

        "text":["<p>On the rare occasions I have the opportunity to meet and talk with them, I can’t shake the feeling that they're better dressed than I am, more educated than I am and have more natural manners than I do. I am referring to the people of “Putin's aliyah” – a phrase that took root in Israel a while ago and refers to members of the middle class who left Russia in recent years because of the tightening of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s belt around their necks.</p> \n<p>For many of them – Jewish, or people of Jewish ancestry – Israel was the default destination for many reasons, in large part because of the automatic citizenship. This was also the case for us – people from the large wave of immigrants who came from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s – but with one significant difference: Whether due to the inevitability of circumstances or a spirit forged in the era of the Cold War and Iron Curtain, emigration for us was a decision from which there was no turning back.</p> \n<p>But the post-2000 immigrants, especially those who arrived following the failed protest that erupted after the parliamentary elections in 2011 and 2012 – and even more so after the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war in Eastern Ukraine – saw themselves differently from the outset. Those who could afford it did not give up jobs and businesses that could be performed remotely, and in effect they never defined themselves as Israelis forever, at any price.</p> \n<p>Now that this mini-wave of immigrants has been given a name, and some of its representatives doused with a cold shower by its more veteran compatriots (social media has become the main arena for this clash), many have become an integral part of the Russian-Israeli landscape. However, others have taken advantage of the broad opportunities presented to them and have left. Some returned to Russia; others moved on to countries other than Russia.</p> \n<p>I interviewed five of them, in an attempt to understand what led them to immigrate to Israel and what led them to leave it. I also tried to figure out why these questions bother me and others who immigrated to Israel in the ’90s.</p> \n<p>“As a Jew who grew up in Russia, I am accustomed to feeling like a foreigner. In Israel, this rather clear identity began to split. I felt ‘more European,’” says Boris, 48, a composer who immigrated to Israel from Saint Petersburg with his wife and three children in 2012 – and who has been living in Berlin since 2013.</p> \n<p>“I am at home here, but I will never be a local here in the social, ethnic, psychological and also cultural sense. And this is perfectly fine as far as I am concerned,&quot; he says from Berlin.</p> \n<p>&quot;Israel demands some kind of cultural union. You are a Jew, you speak Hebrew – so here is Israel and its culture. Paradoxically, it was in Israel I became an atheist once and for all.”</p> \n<p>Beyond the religious pressure he felt in Israel and his dislike for ritual and the holy days, Boris says he also felt a lack of privacy in Israel. The hot climate, the cockroaches and the difficulty in getting from place to place using public transportation didn't increase his enthusiasm for the state. When he received a scholarship in Berlin, these problems and the difficulties of earning a living as a composer who is not prepared to compromise on his career were resolved.</p> \n<p>From frying pan to fire</p> \n<p>Unlike the others I interviewed – who loved Israel but didn't feel they could live there – Anton (not his real name), 39, says he is disgusted with Israel from an ideological perspective. A former journalist who now works in public relations, he came to Israel in 2015 with his wife and four children, and left about a year later.</p> \n<p>“I came to the conclusion that Israel is a fascist state,” he says. “I don’t want to live in a country like that. I realized that nothing was going to change for the better here. An important factor in my decision to leave Russia was the desire to go with my children to a free country. And no, Israel is not a free country. I do not want to participate in what is happening here and have to take the moral responsibility for it. I am absolutely not interested in moving from the frying pan into the fire. Without doubt Russia is an authoritarian country, but it is not a fascistic country. In Russia, it doesn’t matter what your surname is, what the shape of your nose is and what your name is, as long as you speak Russian reasonably well. In the middle class circles I travel in, people don’t care about this. It doesn’t matter whether I am Jewish, Tatar, Kalmyk, Dagestani or Arab. In Israel, it does matter.”</p> \n<p>Alongside the ideological reasons, Anton also lists more practical reasons for leaving Israel: His family ended up in the West Bank settlement of Ariel and his attempts to find work there in his profession – PR and writing copy – were not successful. He worked at a factory and other blue-collar jobs, his wife didn't work and they lived in semi-austerity. In contrast, there were many potential jobs awaiting Anton back in Russia, offering good salaries. Indeed, he started working at one of those jobs about a month after his return to Russia.</p> \n<p>He doesn't conceal his bitterness toward the attitude he encountered from veteran members of the Russian-speaking community in Israel. “In the Russian army, if it turns out you are a Muscovite they immediately punch you in the face,&quot; he says. &quot;In Israel, the attitude is similar. If people discover you are a Muscovite, they treat you with a certain coldness. In principle, they can also punch you – it’s no problem for them. For some reason, they think we are a kind of privileged class of superior beings who, now we are in Israel, have to eat a bit of shit together with them. And they won't hesitate to shove a plate of it under your nose.”</p> \n<p>Anton’s statement is one of many manifestations of the bad blood that exists between prominent representatives of the Putin aliyah and some of the “old” Russian intelligentsia that has been in Israel for two decades or more.</p> \n<p>The bitter feuds operate on a right-left axis. The old guard represents a conservative-patriotic front, while those who fled Putin are the skeptical-liberal alternative. The ideological conflict is also present in personal issues: The &quot;non-immigrant&quot; stance of the Putin generation, its status in Russia and requirements with respect to the standard of living in the new country – all this came down like a one-ton hammer on the image of the world to which we had accustomed ourselves in our decades here, which included the need to bow heads, kvetch and work hard.</p> \n<p>Exhausting bureaucratic struggle</p> \n<p>Alexander Gavrilov, a literary critic and producer of literary events, immigrated to Israel at the end of 2014. But he had to move back to Moscow two years later after proving unable to transfer his “center of life” here, as the Interior Ministry requires passport applicants to do. “I think – and maybe I’m mistaken – that in the meantime, the political pressure in Russia has decreased a bit,” he says. “From a feeling of revulsion and disgust every single day, I’ve advanced to a feeling of revulsion and disgust once a week. That’s what made it possible for me to consider the option of returning.”</p> \n<p>Looking back, it seems Gavrilov’s departure was inevitable. What can an entrepreneur working in the literary world with creative people hope to find far from the center of intellectual life conducted in Russian? He says that in order to survive in Israel financially, he had to dumb down in terms of the type of artists and writers he represented, in response to the demands of a larger segment of the Russian-speaking community – and he wasn't prepared to do that.</p> \n<p>Gavrilov, who declares his love for Tel Aviv in general and southern Jaffa in particular, never left his businesses in Russia or relinquished his Moscow office. He says the frequent trips between Israel, where his father lives, and Russia exhausted him and, ultimately, he and his wife, a Belarusian, decided to make Moscow their primary place of residence.</p> \n<p>A considerable part of Gavrilov’s stay in Israel was accompanied by an exhausting bureaucratic struggle. The Population, Immigration and Border Authority denied his wife an entry permit and blocked the possibility of the couple meeting in Israel. The problem was only resolved when the visa requirements between Belarus and Israel were canceled.</p> \n<p>Gavrilov noticeably refrains from openly criticizing Israel. However, toward the end of our conversation, when asked whether his departure and that of others indicate something has been out of kilter in relations between Israel and the new wave of immigrants, he replies, “I am sure that a certain opportunity was missed. More or less at the moment when David Ben-Gurion’s way overcame Chaim Weizmann's way, or when Albert Einstein refused the presidency. From that moment, this opportunity was missed in a systematic way. There's no doubt that if Israel had acted differently, it could have become the Jewish intellectual elite of the whole world and would have gained many benefits from that. This complex process would require, for example, political unity that is almost impossible to imagine.”</p> \n<p>Summing up, Gavrilov says: “Israel today is not a country of fighters, kolkhozniks [farmers] and mathematicians, but rather a country of fighters and kolkhozniks. The mathematicians are still living in Brooklyn and are still wearing their checked shirts.&quot;</p> \n<p>Like an Italian town, almost</p> \n<p>The quality of life and cost of living in Israel come up in nearly every conversation with those who left. One of the biggest differences between the FSU immigrants and the Putin aliyah is that the latter had already tasted the good life. In fact, they spent a large part of their adult lives enjoying greater prosperity and economic freedom than those in the Israeli middle class.</p> \n<p>Architect Katya Preobrazhensky, 31, arrived in Israel at the end of 2015 with her husband. She is now about to depart for Thailand, to study at the Cordon Bleu cooking school and is hoping to continue on to London from there.</p> \n<p>“When we moved here, it was the first time we’d ever seen Israel,&quot; she relates. &quot;We hadn’t visited here before then. I had different expectations with respect to the aesthetics of the place. The way we are living – with a sea view and old Jaffa – I thought this was how more or less everyone in Tel Aviv lives. In reality, everyone lives in standard, boring, three-story buildings with small windows and they are lucky if the view isn’t some garbage dump. And they pay a lot of money for that. This, of course, depressed me a bit,” she admits.</p> \n<p>However, she says the Israeli public, which is not accustomed to good service or to inexpensive, high quality products, has proved very open to what she had to offer – which increases the chances that she will return here one day, she adds.</p> \n<p>'We didn’t flee Aleppo'</p> \n<p>Journalist and playwright Mikhail Kaluzhsky, 49, moved to Israel with his wife in September 2014, but they moved to Berlin just over a year later. His wife, a cultural researcher by profession, was offered a position at the Free University in Berlin and the family seized the opportunity for a quick departure.</p> \n<p>“The Israeli absorption system, as it was constructed after the Declaration of Independence and the way it exists to this day, assumes that upon arriving in Israel, you reset your past – linguistic, professional and social – leaving only your private life,” says Kaluzhsky. “After that, you go to the ulpan [language school] for half a year to learn Hebrew, you embark on your new life and you start all over again. That is what happened to my mother, who arrived in 1991, and to many others. With us it is different. We can travel to Israel, Germany or anywhere else, and our professional life doesn’t start all over again. It is always with us.”</p> \n<p>Could it be said this is immigration with privileges?</p> \n<p>“I don’t like this leftist discourse about privileges,&quot; replies Kaluzhsky. “True, we didn’t flee from the bombardments in Aleppo. We are privileged, of course, in the sense that we have bought an apartment in Germany and are paying taxes, even though we can’t vote here. Though you are in the middle of the social scale, apart from work and a life, you don’t receive anything. At least that is how it is in Germany.”</p> \n<p>Could it be that what bothers me in encountering people from the Putin aliyah is actually plain unadulterated envy? Beyond their relatively high socioeconomic status, beyond their education and the sudden desire I have to leap to the defense of all the things I myself got sick of in Israel (The cost of living? The whining of spoiled brats! The occupation? Putin’s dictatorship is worse! Too narrow a culture? Learn Hebrew!) – beyond all that, there is another element that has to do with a possibility I hadn’t known was open to me. For even if my freedom of choice is an illusion, in contrast to people of the Putin aliyah, this illusion was taken away from me when I was brought to Israel at age 10. The way the new immigrants skip so easily between countries and continents, and their unwillingness to commit themselves – all this is tantamount to a challenge I may some day accept.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel’s record numbers of foreign tourists this year have led El Al Airlines to press into service flight attendants who had been laid off as well as aircrew members who are still in training, during the Passover peak travel season.</p> \n<p>The Central Bureau of Statistics reported on Sunday a 24% rise in tourist arrivals in the first quarter, to 739,000, from the first three months of 2016. In March alone the rise was 22%, to 293,000.</p> \n<p>The figure represents a new record since the 50-day war Israel fought with Hamas in the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2014. Operation Protective Edge caused airlines to suspend flights briefly and tourists to cancel reservations. Israel’s tourism industry has struggled to recover, but the numbers for the first quarter of 2017 exceeded those of the same period in 2014, before the war, when 705,000 tourists arrived in Israel.</p> \n<p>The Tourism Ministry said spending by tourists at hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops amounted to 4 billion shekels ($1.1 billion) in the three months, up 730 million shekels from the same time in 2016.</p> \n<p>But the crunch of foreign tourists flying into Israel and Israelis flying abroad for vacation caught El Al, Israel’s flagship carrier, short-staffed.</p> \n<p>The number of Israelis going abroad (see story on this page) climbed 12.5% to 1.22 million in the first quarter from the same time a year earlier — and that’s before the big vacation periods of Passover, the summer and the fall High Holy Days. Last year, the number of Israeli departures reached 6.8 million, up from 4.8 million three years before.</p> \n<p>The heavy traffic has pushed El Al to the limit. With an estimated 1.6 million people passing through Ben-Gurion International Airport this month, the carrier will have to fly 530,000 of them to retain its market shares of just under 35%. That meant scheduling six to seven more daily flights than it did the same time in 2016.</p> \n<p>To do that, El Al has been calling back flight attendants they fired after working for the airline for five years, rather than give them tenure in their jobs.</p> \n<p>They have also given cabin assignments to flight attendants who have completed most of their training but, for example, may not have completed the course on night flights.</p> \n<p>El Al is also quietly leasing jets to make up for the shortfall at its Sun d’Or from companies like SmartLynx.</p> \n<p>El Al said safety and service were not being hurt by the moves. “All the crews working on flights are ready and trained for their jobs as required by the rules and requirements,” a spokesman said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The love affairs on Eyal Golan’s new album, “Lo Pashut Lihiyot Pashut” (Simple Ain’t Easy), tend to end after two years. It’s a clear pattern, and when listening to the album one can’t help wondering what it means. The song “Mami” begins with the words: “Two years have passed, it seems like a thousand, we had better times.” The song “Games of Honor” begins as follows: “You took a suitcase, it’s quiet for now, you packed a beautiful two-year love.” And in the song “Goda Boba,” which concludes the album, Golan sings: “For two years I gave my heart and soul, we were even talking about a wedding, now I’m out of the picture frame and he has taken my place.”</p> \n<p>To remind us, for the thousandth time, that in Mizrahi pop songs in general, and in those of Eyal Golan in particular, the love affair almost always ends when the woman goes from the arms of one man to the arms of another, without a cooling-off period.</p> \n<p>But what’s all this about two years? Once or twice, okay, but by the third time it becomes a kind of motif and one wonders whether the entire album actually describes one real or imagined relationship that ended after 700 days or nights, more or less. After listening repeatedly to the new album, I have no clear answer to that question.</p> \n<p>My two best guesses are as follows: First, if there’s anyone who has developed a slight romantic obsession with the words “two years” it’s Offir Cohen, who wrote two of the three songs in which those words play a leading role. Second, perhaps Golan’s new album centers around the words “two years” for the simple reason that it lasts for two years. In other words, almost 80 minutes, which is about two years in terms of a pop album – although in recent weeks it seems that half the Israeli pop albums are spread over this unreasonable period of time. This is a kind of “pile it on, pile it on, pile it on,” as Golan sings in one of his new songs (the preceding line is “to pamper, to pamper, to pamper”) – art imitating advertising.</p> \n<p>Shallow female images</p> \n<p>Two years or not, the basic situation of the new album is as follows: She left, disappeared, apparently she’s already in someone else’s arms, and he remains alone, sad and thoughtful. The truth? You can understand her, and you don’t feel much like identifying with him, for two main reasons. One, which is quite evident in the first half of the album, is the tiring combination of self-righteousness and self-pity that typifies the guy Golan is personifying.</p> \n<p>He’s alone in the room, or opposite the sea, swimming in thoughts, not sleeping at night, occasionally shedding a tear. But is he doing any genuine soul-searching at the same time? Not really.</p> \n<p>“If I hurt you, little girl, if I hurt you I’m sorry (“Disappearing Moon”), “Maybe I was mistaken when I told you to go” (“Going Back in Time”), “To forgive and to give in to you even when I’m right” (“Flowers in the Desert”), “From every corner they say you’re right, what good is it to be right if I’m in an empty house” (“Goda Boba”). The possibility that he’s the source of the problem is usually hedged by “if” or “maybe.”</p> \n<p>In general, as becomes even more clear in the second half of the album, his thoughts about women often arouse unease. I’m not talking about Eyal Golan himself, but about the man whose consciousness is reflected in the songs, written by a number of lyricists but supposed to represent Golan’s soul, even if he didn’t write a single word on the album.</p> \n<p>The second reason is that quite a number of shallow and even absurd female images are portrayed in the new album. The girl whose entire essence is shopping (“Clothes and Gifts”), the unfaithful woman (“Goda Boba”), the cynical flirt (“Mazal”), the obsessive woman who calls 30 times an hour (“Suffocating from Love”). Sometimes it’s not exactly the woman herself but her girlfriends, who lie to her and cause conflicts between her and the guy (“Games of Honor”). And sometimes, quite frequently, the entire essence of the woman is that she’s simply beautiful and that all the men look at her and envy her partner. But she should know her place and not exaggerate by flaunting her beauty (“And you don’t stop, you wanted a party, you got the best there is maybe you’ll lower the flame,” from “I Have Only You”).</p> \n<p>Golan’s serious fans won’t let reservations like these prevent them from enjoying the new album, of course. On the other hand, there are more moderate and selective fans, those who (like me) are attracted mainly by Golan’s wonderful voice. They will manage to suspend their textual reservations (or at least most of them) only in songs that, with a decent melodic content, combined with the voice and the singing, create the beloved musical material called “a beautiful song by Eyal Golan.”</p> \n<p>An example? “It’s Dangerous,” the second song on the new album. It’s not as beautiful as Golan’s classics, but pay attention to the double takeoff maneuver! A double takeoff is when Golan’s voice soars for the first time at the start of the chorus and then soars once again in the middle. I’m a sucker for that maneuver.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, there are no other double takeoffs on the new album. There are of course single takeoffs, always at the beginning of the chorus. Few of them take place in songs with a pleasant melody (“Disappearing Moon,” for example, which along with “It’s Dangerous” creates the most beautiful sequence on the album), but most of them are wasted on a mediocre or clich&eacute;d melody. You have to make an effort to like those songs, and you’re better off focusing your attention on the meaty arrangements by Yaakov Lamai, which are like miniature symphonies of synthesizers in a Turkish atmosphere. The quiet songs, which are clearly not Mizrahi, those that try to be a kind of “Shlomo Artzi meets Coldplay in a honey factory,” are impossible to like, no matter how hard you try.</p> \n<p>And the same is true of most of the rhythmic songs. For reasons known only to him and his strategic advisers, Golan decided to divide the new album into two sections, which are presented one after the other: The ballad section contains the first 10 songs and the playing field (also “expansion”) section includes all the next 10 (except for the title song). Because in the rhythmic part there’s a song called “Singing and Soccer,” we’ll go with the soccer metaphor. The rhythmic songs, which are disappointing for the most part, don’t arouse associations of a forward who continually fails to score, but of a forward who scores continuously opposite an empty goalpost, without a goalie and without defensive players.</p> \n<p>The target is captured. The net is torn by the force of the kick. So what? There are no smart plays, no interesting tricks, no tension and release. As in the ballad section, on the rhythmic playing field there are positive flickerings here and there (for example “Don’t Say No to Me”), but a good song only here and there on such a long album doesn’t make a game plan.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“Our priority is no longer to sit there and focus on getting [Syrian President Bashar] Assad out,” Nikki Haley, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said last Thursday – and with that put the final kibosh on Barack Obama’s policy for Syria.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump is now aligning himself with Russia, Iran and Syria, in dictating a policy that will have implications for Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf nations that still are trying to topple the regime in Damascus.</p> \n<p>With every passing day, support of Assad’s regime seems to be increasingly popular among countries that want to see Syria remain orphaned and crumbling, as commentator Eyad Abu Shakra wrote on March 24 in an op-ed for the English site of the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya newspaper. Another commentator tweeted that the United States is behaving as though ISIS is its enemy, but to his own people, Assad is the enemy. Indeed, the slaughter of over 400,000 people is a tragedy. But what does that matter to the U.S.?</p> \n<p>The American position is likely to have grave implications for the rebel militias in the war-torn country, but could also influence diplomatic moves. Obama’s rather muddy policy – which boiled down mainly to declarations about the need to topple Assad and the right of the rebels to fight for a democratic Syria – gave one the feeling that the U.S. is not indifferent to the human suffering in that country and would be willing to help the rebels in their resistance. But&nbsp;Trump, on the other hand, is spelling out to those forces now that the only war he’s prepared to participate in, is the war against ISIS.</p> \n<p>Washington isn’t alone in essentially shelving the issue of Syria. France, which had led the opposition to Assad in Syria, declared its agreement with the American position last week, when its foreign minister explained that the reality that has developed on the ground there has to be acknowledged. Of course, that reality was not the result of some spontaneous development: The positions espoused by Europe and the U.S., in addition to the policies of Russia and Iran, contributed their parts.</p> \n<p>From now on, the responsibility for Syria’s “reality” will fall on the shoulders of Russia, which apparently doesn’t get queasy every time masses of civilians get killed in the civil war there.</p> \n<p>The American and French position is the outcome of the rebels’ crushing defeat in Aleppo by Syrian forces backed by Russian jet fighters. The aftermath of that battle is now evident on two fronts.</p> \n<p>On the international diplomatic front, there is no force left standing that can challenge the Russian strategy, use the rebels to achieve any influence in post-war Syria, or build coalitions to curb either Moscow or Tehran. In addition, the Arab League is not making its support for a diplomatic solution in Syria conditional on first ousting Assad.</p> \n<p>On the domestic front, a demographic pathology is forming, designed to isolate and eradicate the country's various ethnic rebel concentrations, and to strengthen supporters of the Syrian regime. The latest example of this is the truce signed between Iran and the Tahrir al-Sham liberation organization, which is affiliated with Al-Qaida. The agreement was signed in Doha, under the sponsorship of the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Al-Thani.</p> \n<p>According to the pact, the rebel forces – most of whom are radical Islamists – will leave the locales of Zabadani and Madaya west of Damascus, near the Lebanese border, in exchange for lifting the approximately year-long siege Islamic militias have imposed on the towns of Foua and Kefraya, in Idlib, in northwestern Syria. Also, about 8,000 civilians, mostly Sunni residents of Zabadani and Madaya, will be permitted to move north, while a similar number of civilians, mostly Shi'ites, will move out of Foua and Kefraya to two locales west of Damascus. Also, Al-Qaida fighters will leave the Palestinian refugee camp of Al-Yarmouk in southern Damascus.</p> \n<p>The truce is supposed to come into force on Tuesday, and to last nine months. Its geographical and demographical aspects are of particular interest.</p> \n<p>What will result from the accord is essentially a population exchange that will beef up the Shi'ite presence along the border between Syria and Lebanon, giving Hezbollah and Iran territorial contiguity between Syria and Lebanon.</p> \n<p>This isn’t the only cease-fire signed in the last two years but it is the most significant, demographically speaking. It shows how Iran is envisioning its areas of influence in Syria after the war.</p> \n<p>As far as the people affected by the new agreement are concerned – on the one hand, they will have greater freedom of movement, access to food and medication, which have all but run out; moreover, and mainly, the deadly bombings will stop, if indeed the various parties comply with the truce. On the other hand, these citizens will become refugees, cut off from their ethnic and religious base, living among an unwelcoming population, and dreaming of going home.</p> \n<p>Last week Wahid Abd Al-Majid, a deputy director of the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Egypt, compared these demographic changes to the expulsion of the Palestinians from pre-state Israel by its nascent army in 1948.</p> \n<p>Writing in the Arabic newspaper Al-Hayat, Al-Majid bitterly criticized Arab intellectuals and leaders for failing to react to the demographic tragedy unfolding in Syria. The expulsion of the Palestinians, wrote Majid, was actually a modest incident compared with the demographic disaster Syria is undergoing at present. He added that while in Israel, there are researchers and intellectuals who have beat their breasts and revealed the real history of the events surrounding the creation of the Jewish state – nobody in the Arab nations is so much as talking about the surgical demographic operation Syria is experiencing. As Trump says, it’s Syria’s problem.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Beit Hankin Museum in Kfar Yehoshua in the Jezreel Valley, shut down and abandoned for 20 years, has now reopened. It is set to feature exhibitions of contemporary art that relate to the collections preserved in the museum. The first such exhibition is “Ministry of Information,” created by Tomer Sapir.</p> \n<p>The small museum (which essentially consists of a single room) is located in the school building at Kfar Yehoshua, in keeping with the last will and testament of Yehoshua Hankin. An early 20th century Zionist, Hankin was responsible for purchasing lands on behalf of the Zionist movement. The museum was established in the late 1940s at the initiative of nature enthusiast and teacher Menahem Zaharoni as an institution for visual learning in the field of Land of Israel studies.</p> \n<p>It was an extraordinary educational center, with marvelous wooden display cases containing stuffed birds and mammals and dozens of drawers crammed with findings and artifacts Zaharoni had collected from around the Jezreel Valley. An alcove housed Hankin’s office desk, complete with a variety of personal effects. Above this space was an upper gallery overlooking it all.</p> \n<p>The museum was a dynamic, vibrant educational site that linked geography and folklore, a dash of archaeology and geology, dried flowers and a lot of zoology (through the wonders of taxidermy), and visual lessons on butterflies and pest control. It was called the Regional Institute for Nature and Homeland Studies.</p> \n<p>Over the years, the mission of the site changed. Chemistry, physics and biology labs were established, as were a library and a small astronomical observatory. At some point, a botanical garden and a petting zoo were added, and courses and pedagogical in-service training days were offered. In 1953, a larger exhibition space, Yad Michael, was built alongside the original museum. It provided a hall for lectures as well. It is this space that has now been converted into a gallery for contemporary art.</p> \n<p>Like Beit Shturman on Kibbutz Ein Harod, which was filled with stuffed specimens of local fauna, over the years Beit Hankin turned into an out-of-the-way museum known to a select few who were cognizant of its Zionist past as embodied in the displays and presentations, which bore a somewhat kinky character. Compared to Beit Shturman, the maintenance of Beit Hankin’s displays is inferior. Most of them are falling apart, broken, yellowed and covered in dust. Following Zaharoni’s tenure, a few other dedicated souls came and went. One placed an emphasis on agriculture, another on ecology. They channeled the work of the museum as they saw fit, but in the absence of a sufficient budget (and visitors), the place eventually closed down. Now there is an attempt to revive it and adapt it to the spirit of the times. Says curator Neta Haber, “It is a time capsule of sorts from 65 years ago, which has now been reopened.”</p> \n<p>Tomer Sapir rummaged through the collection and extracted a number of diverse objects, their strangeness both obvious and not. Sapir offers a mishmash take on the various levels of display: the object itself; the photo/sketch/documentation of it; the catalog or lexicon explanation of it; and its method of didactic illustration.</p> \n<p>Reorganized chaos</p> \n<p>The artistic process executed by Sapir, who repositions the nature collections to mount a reworked exhibition, unravels the logic of the archive. He unties the narrative and sprinkles it in several directions at once, by means of simultaneous displaying of objects of various types, doctrines and methods. Sapir makes near-exclusive use of the objects he found on site, and has installed and displayed them on tables, in cabinets, display cases and shelves belonging to the museum, creating and arranging names. He rebuilds them as aesthetic elements that possess the poeticism of a private world. He presents them as is, without mediation, manipulation, conversion of material or form – only rearranging them, crowding them together or spreading them apart.</p> \n<p>Sapir placed display cases crowded with items in his space. They are seemingly haphazardly arranged, on the basis of a formal or aesthetic logic that is related to art, but not necessarily to the scientific discipline to which they belong. Thus, a barrel containing a plethora of native brambles stands alongside a collage of maps, and a very old photograph titled “Fossilized trunk of palm” is displayed next to rodent skeletons and stuffed birds. We find information and instructional sheets placed next to milk crates and seashells, schoolroom desks, a collection of Maariv newspaper cartoons from the mid-‘90s that were for some reason clipped and preserved, animal skulls, horns and snakeskin, a single page from a pamphlet entitled “Anti-Semitism is on the rise,” fossils lying near animal skins, metal and stone vessels alongside a pail containing glass test tubes, the head of a stuffed turtle alongside some IDF magazines about regions of Israel, precious and semi-precious stones and “Articles about the Bedouins.” What was already busy in the original arrangement has been transformed into utter chaos.</p> \n<p>Added to all this are visual results of activities that Sapir put on for local children over the course of the year he spent working in the space. They were asked to collect items from their home environments. These items were photographed like archaeological findings, even though most of them were dry leaves, construction debris and trash. In the middle of this reorganized chaos, Sapir also fashioned a sort of mausoleum for himself. It is an installation built as a burial plot, an earthen mound and a life mask his own children made out of plaster placed on his face (screened off the side is a video clip that reveals the process), crowded under the table are dry branches, seemingly in preparation for placement on a bonfire. It is very much the transition from the “state generation” to the “me generation,” complete with post-archival rhetoric. Sapir was captivated by the displays, swept up into their living-dead charm, and played with them like a boy choreographing live-action experiences while using inanimate plastic figurines. He sifted through the objects, gazed at them for hours, listened to seashells and then soared through his imagination with the winged animals, grew closer and then farther away, and eventually installed them as they were, only a little different, without spaces between the profusion of items and without any public declaration that he had significantly veered from the doctrine.</p> \n<p>In essence, he added a thin veil of sentimentality. It is as if he has been swept up by the charm of the contents. There is no sharp-edged dimension to his rearrangement. Thus, we receive a sort of sentiment-laced list of songs whose stanzas and melodies are mixed up with one another, but there is no doubt – it is the same playlist of sentimental favorite songs on which we were raised.</p> \n<p>If the exhibition bears any dimension of criticism of museums and how they mount exhibitions, and perhaps a criticism of native-land studies, then these are concealed by the way Sapir seems openly to enjoy himself with them.</p> \n<p>This is an outstanding opening exhibition for Beit Hankin, in the sense that it offers an introduction to the institution, complete with its inexhaustible cornucopia of offerings. Hopefully, upcoming exhibitions will succeed in capturing sub-themes and delving into them in a far-reaching manner that sparks the imagination.</p> \n<p>Tomer Sapir – “Ministry of Information.” Curator: Neta Haber.

        "text":["<p>The large-scale exhibition of the New Barbizon group at the Mishkan Museum of Art at Kibbutz Ein Harod, in the Jezreel Valley, is like an idol in the temple. The elegant museum, established in 1948 and extended several times afterward, was designed by the architect Shmuel Bickels (1909-1975) so that the entire structure is bathed in natural light that enters the halls from unseen upper windows. Just a few months ago, when its spaces were filled with an exhibition of works by the artists of the 1950s New Horizons group and their possible successors in contemporary Israeli art, it seemed as though the museum had been created especially for lyrical abstraction.</p> \n<p>Yet now we find the complete opposite: figurative paintings in gleaming primary colors, many of them rife with social content, the works of five female artists from the former Soviet Union who have immigrated to Israel. The modernist venue has yielded to a festival of pagan representations.</p> \n<p>The New Barbizon group was established about six years ago (by Zoya Cherkassy-Nnadi, Natalia Zourabova, Asya Lukin, Olga Kundina and Anna Lukashevsky, all in their forties except for Kundina, who is 10 years older), and has been gathering momentum ever since. By now it has consolidated itself as the sitra ahra, ascribed in Jewish mysticism to the devil – the “other side” of Israeli art. Despite this, the group is not spurned by local art spaces. On the contrary, its works are exhibited at every opportunity, both at popular venues (the “Fresh Paint” fairs) and serious, dignified ones (such as in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art’s current “Regarding Africa” exhibition). The group posits an artistic, political and sociological challenge – in the style of painting and the form of socialization, in the artistic language and in the language of talking about art. At times it shows constraint, on occasion it fails, but it’s always acute and generates debate and interest.</p> \n<p>The group’s collective gathering is the hub of the show. The dozens of paintings – oil on canvas, felt pen on canvas, large or small format, series and standalone works – are divided not according to the artist in each case but thematically, generally by the places depicted (the Bedouin market in Be’er Sheva, the Central Bus Station in Tel Aviv, cities, kibbutzim); or by subject (women, migrants). This division underscores both the similar style of the artists and their joint activity of going out into the field together and painting side by side – often identical scenes.</p> \n<p>The exhibition’s best moments lie in its juxtaposition of these scenes, resulting in a reverse series, in which the subject is one and the painters many. Observing the series offers a lesson in stylistic differentiation. What at first seems to be a collection of more of the same later begins to individualize. Thus the paintings of Asya Lukin stand out for their somber colors, thick brush and formalism that is not only referential. They exist on the stylistic boundary of the group, whose declared unity actually disintegrates when the works are shown together.</p> \n<p>Contrariwise, the exhibition’s worst moments reside in the quasi-touristic panorama it summons up, like scenic postcards from a tour of the country – in city and village, in ethnicity and gender. These are well-known, well-worn places that allow for quick recognition and brow-wrinkling pondering of the “Israeli condition.”</p> \n<p>What’s intriguing is the artists’ gaze at the place they live in. Seemingly they are engaged in open-air work – “observational painting,” as the curator, Yaniv Shapira, emphasizes – as they revivify the spirit of the original mid-19th century Barbizon School. That group consisted of French painters who left the city for the countryside, abandoned the studio and went into the expanses of nature to paint segments of life and contours of landscapes. That was a prelude to realistic painting that seeks unmediated proximity to the reality that will be transposed to the canvas.</p> \n<p>A distant gaze</p> \n<p>However, the New Barbizon group makes no effort to produce realism that is faithful to reality. On the contrary: These artists process the revealed world in a heightened manner. Their brash colors evoke pop art, the lines and shapes are crude and caricature-like, the figures seem to be copied from sketches. The artists pay explicit homage to various artistic traditions – Fauvism, Henri Matisse, even the Russian painter Kasimir Malevich – in the sense that their paintings go through them and their style, and do not fantasize about a direct approach to reality. In effect, they are the anti-Barbizon. And it’s precisely in this that they turn their back on pre-Israeli and Israeli painting, with its missions and its hassles. They are not looking for the local light, for the Mediterranean palette, for the rhythm of the brush that’s analogous to the pace of life in the Levant.</p> \n<p>They observe with wonder and alienation what is around them everywhere they go. Their gaze is distant and objectifying, not only at sites of backwardness and marginality – the Bedouin village of Hura in the Negev, asylum seekers in south Tel Aviv – but also in the heart of the Israeli center: in Kibbutz Baram or in Rabin Square. Under their hands, everything becomes “nature,” which is painted in a style that does not derive from its materials and does not seek to emulate it.</p> \n<p>As such, their works try to posit a new center. It’s not that their non-hegemonic status as latecomers to the Israeli project – that is, as immigrants – drives them to seek out the peripheral because of a psychic or spiritual affinity. The peripheral materials they exhibit are long since familiar, in art and elsewhere, and their paintings do not respond to them, are not touched by them and do not change in their wake, but only cast them in a foreign language.</p> \n<p>In fact, they observe all of Israel as a peripheral place, somewhat obscure and backward, from the vantage point of a solid, remote cultural center: from Russian and Ukrainian culture, from the extensive painting traditions of the academies in Kiev, St. Petersburg and Moscow. Even when they come to Ein Harod and paint the kibbutz in the kibbutz, and now exhibit their paintings there, they do so as pilgrims from a great, far-off empire.</p> \n<p>Ein Harod is painted like a village in the south of France, created consciously from the dynasty of paintings of the village. The men around the table in the Central Bus Station of Tel Aviv are also Cezanne’s card players. The New Barbizon painters are not taking part in the attempt to become natives. They are engaged in the opposite movement to that of the iconic Israeli artist Joseph Zaritsky: from Kiev they will not arrive at kibbutzim he painted, like Yehiam or Tsuba. Their Ein Harod is revealed as the “Hura” of Kiev.</p> \n<p>The question is what the Kiev they are bringing to the Middle East contains artistically: whether they can maintain it as a living center in which they abide and that they can develop, or whether all that’s feasible is to cling to the apprentice academicism that they experienced there in the past. It may be necessary to wait another few years; possibly different painters from the group will have different answers.</p> \n<p>But one thing is certain: the notion of “back to life,” which is part of the exhibition’s title – encompassing joie de vivre and the joy of creation it entails – is not the coming back to life of Israeli painting. First, because Israeli painting has never been more alive; and second, because the painting by the group does not in the least wish to be Israeli.</p> \n<p>“The New Barbizon: Back to Life,” Mishkan Museum of Art, Kibbutz Ein Harod, (04) 648-6038 or (04) 648-5701; Fri 09.00-13.30; Sat 10.00-16.30; Sun-Thurs 09.00-16.30; until May 3</p>",

        "text":["<p>Here’s a legend for the modern era:</p> \n<p>Until the age of 12, Nabieh Ayoub could neither read nor write. Officially, he attended school in the Upper Galilee village of Fassuta, but mostly he helped his family till the land and herd the sheep. Today he is a biology professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, in Haifa, and a highly praised cancer researcher. In 2014, an article he published in the prestigious PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Science) was selected by the journal as being among the top 5 percent of the articles appearing in its pages that year.</p> \n<p>His is a riveting, thought-provoking and also somewhat ironic story about excellence, prejudice and education. But above all, about science. That’s what’s most important to Ayoub, and that’s what he wanted to talk about most, when I met with him at his Technion office.</p> \n<p>Prof. Ayoub, who’s in his forties, is married to Samahar Najjar, an educational consultant by profession. The couple live in Haifa with their three children, aged 8, 12 and 14. “Nabieh” means “cautious” in Arabic, and that definitely suits his personality. He’s very cordial and sociable, unpretentious and candid, but cautious.</p> \n<p>How is it that you couldn’t read or write until such a late age?</p> \n<p>“That’s a good question. I think schooling didn’t mean much to me then. I would go to school, warm the bench and return home. I preferred helping my father, who was a fellah, working in the fields or tending the goats. I couldn’t even write my name. I was diagnosed as having special needs and placed in a special-ed class. The teachers were amazed that I was so dumb, because my four siblings were all very good in school. Things weren’t easy socially, either, because the good students tended to stay away from me. Who wants to be around an imbecile? When you’re categorized as weak, you have to make an effort to carve out a path to be accepted by those who are strong.”</p> \n<p>When did the change occur?</p> \n<p>“I had a homeroom teacher, Ayoub Shahla, who took me to the teachers’ room during recess and taught me. He proceeded gradually, little by little, until I knew the letters, and then I learned how to read and write. A decisive event for me was a speech delivered by the principal at the start of the school year, when I was in the eighth grade. He said that those who are weak can improve, and cited me as an example. All he did was mention my name, but that generated a huge self-transformation. You have to understand: All in all, I had progressed from marks of 20-30 to 50, but the fact that he made reference to it had a tremendous influence on me. That was the beginning of the spurt.”</p> \n<p>The attention? The nice word about you?</p> \n<p>“Yes, it was a great thing. The teachers and the principal were held in awe then, and that kind of remark by him was like winning the lottery. Generally speaking, I think a teacher can have a huge influence on the direction in which a person takes his life. If you read biographies of successful people, you’ll find that many of them had a teacher or mentor who believed in them, and were it not for him they would not have achieved what they did. That principal, the late Jeries Khoury, became my life-teacher, and I also owe a great deal to my biology teacher, Assad Endrawes, thanks to whom I fell in love with that subject.</p> \n<p>“A teacher must accommodate the pupil. That’s the most important thing he can do for him. He has to make the pupil feel that they are on the same side, not one against the other. We pressure our children needlessly. After all, it’s not the marks that count. There is no connection between the psychometric examination [a standardized test for university admission in Israel] and a student’s achievements. In some cases, students with excellent grades ask me to be their Ph.D. adviser, and afterward it turns out that they don’t know how to work. And the opposite, too: Students with average grades can turn out to be excellent researchers.”</p> \n<p>DNA under attack</p> \n<p>For the past decade, Ayoub has been researching the structure of DNA and the mechanisms that repair it when it’s damaged. The fact is that DNA – the molecule that carries our genes and is responsible for our traits, abilities, functioning and health – is under constant attack. Every day, the DNA in a cell that is dividing is vulnerable to some 70,000 different types of damage – and that’s before we factor in smoking, exposure to solar radiation, food preservatives and other nasty items that exacerbate the damage. The basic harm is caused by by-products of regular life processes, which attack the cell’s DNA. These include the notorious free radicals, which we’re meant to neutralize through the consumption of antioxidants.</p> \n<p>If so, Prof. Ayoub, the damage is unavoidable.</p> \n<p>“It is unavoidable, because it occurs as a result of the cell’s routine activity. DNA is the only molecule that is not replaced by the body. In contrast to proteins, which break down and are therefore replaced naturally, DNA molecules are created once, and if they are flawed, the cell must repair them. In the conventional analogy, according to which the information stored in DNA is like a text whose meaning is determined by the letters and words of which it is comprised, then, obviously, damage to the identity or the order of those letters is liable to disrupt the text and distort its meaning. In biological language, distorted meaning means flawed functioning and perhaps even cancer – which is why cells developed repair mechanisms.”</p> \n<p>There are different types of damage – pursuing the text analogy, we can say there are specific spelling mistakes, words omitted or sentences added – and accordingly, there are different types of repair.</p> \n<p>“I like to compare the cell nucleus to a hospital with many departments, each of which has different specialist physicians. Each is responsible for diagnosing and treating a different disease, but if necessary, a physician from one field can do the work of a physician from a different field. The analogy: the existence of different families of enzymes, each of which is responsible for repairing a specific type of damage. Still, overlap sometimes occurs – you’ll have an enzyme that can do more than one thing and can take the place of another enzyme.”</p> \n<p>What do all these repairing enzymes do?</p> \n<p>“First, the cell has to sense that something is wrong. That’s far from simple, because DNA is not a dedicated, easily accessed molecule. It’s a very dense molecule about two meters in length – about the height of LeBron James, the basketball player – but packed so tightly in a cell that its physical length is only 10 to 15 microns [10-15 millionths of a meter]. That density is made possible thanks to special proteins around which the DNA is wrapped. The question, then is: If the DNA is so dense and coiled up, how is it possible to discover that it has been damaged?</p> \n<p>“So, the first stage is to identify the damage. Then the DNA has to be unraveled slightly at the appropriate place to enable access to it, after which the repairing enzymes are signaled to arrive. The repair itself is the last stage. At every stage, specific enzymes are involved, and the whole process occurs rapidly, seconds after the damage takes place.”</p> \n<p>What happens if there is no repair?</p> \n<p>“There are two possible scenarios. In one, the cumulative damage indicates to the cell that the situation is critical, and then the cell enters a course that leads it to a type of suicide.”</p> \n<p>Suicide?</p> \n<p>“The biological term is ‘programmed cell death,’ because it is not simply death as a result of processes gone awry. It is an orderly, foreknown sequence of stages, at the end of which the cell dies. This is one of the mechanisms by which the body copes with DNA damage, because the moment a cell dies it is gone.”</p> \n<p>What is the second scenario?</p> \n<p>“In the second scenario, the cell remains alive, and it develops cancer. In many cancerous growths we find mutations in the genes that are involved in DNA repair. If the repair mechanisms are defective, protection of the DNA slackens and the damage begins to mount. A case in point is hereditary breast cancer type 2. This is the type that got a lot of publicity thanks to its famous carrier, Angelina Jolie. This particular cancer is caused by a mutation in the gene that is responsible for repairing DNA breaks. It turns out that damage to different genes of the repair mechanisms leads to different types of cancer. We are trying to identify all these genes in order to develop anti-cancer therapies.”</p> \n<p>Can you be more specific?</p> \n<p>“First, we are trying to identify all the elements that are involved in the repair of DNA, in all its stages, from the time the damage is identified until the final repair. To that end, we damage the DNA, our working assumption being that the agents responsible for repair will move rapidly to the site of the damage. If we follow the course of the proteins, we will be able to see which ones arrive on the scene. Because the cell contains many hundreds of enzymes, we focus on particular suspects. We fuse the suspect enzyme to a molecule that emits a green light, so that when it goes through the cell it leaves a green trail. Afterward, a laser ray is beamed into the cell to break the DNA at a certain place, and then we follow the movement of the marked enzyme. A few years ago, using this method, we discovered a new enzyme that was hastening to the site. To prove that it was indeed a repair enzyme, we damaged the gene that is responsible for its creation, and the cell became very sensitive to radiation. We therefore inferred that the enzyme we found does in fact protect the cell from radiation damage.”</p> \n<p>Why did you single out this specific enzyme? Why did you suspect it from the outset?</p> \n<p>“It was due to theoretical considerations, which took into account what we knew about enzymes. In the scientific literature, enzymes are described as removing certain chemical groups from DNA, and it’s known that this action ‘re-formats’ the DNA. In a similar manner, we discovered quite a few more repairing enzymes of this sort.”</p> \n<p>How can identifying a repair enzyme help in developing a cancer treatment? After all, you don’t anticipate introducing it into the cancerous growth in order to repair the DNA and restore the cell to its previous condition.</p> \n<p>“Quite the opposite: The idea is to aggravate the damage to the DNA. By increasing the damage to the DNA and heightening the cancer cell’s genomic instability, we hope to turn the cell in the direction of suicide.”</p> \n<p>In other words: The worse things are, the better they will be.</p> \n<p>“That’s basically what regular chemotherapy does. The chemo materials act by way of arresting the division of cancer cells, and/or inducing DNA damage. The excess of DNA damage and prolonged cell-cycle arrest can trigger programmed cell death.”</p> \n<p>In what way is the treatment you’re proposing better than regular chemotherapy?</p> \n<p>“At present, chemotherapy attacks genes randomly. It does its work in both cancer cells and the body’s healthy cells. We want to aim the damage at the genes that are involved in DNA repair. If we succeed in striking at them specifically, the cell’s condition will deteriorate and it will embark on the course of planned death.”</p> \n<p>You said earlier that the repair mechanism is already damaged in a large percentage of cancerous growths. Effectively, then, you said that this is the cause of such cancers.</p> \n<p>“That’s correct, but we also said, when using the image of repairing enzymes acting like physicians, that sometimes their activity overlaps. One can do the work of the other, so that if one such enzyme is damaged, another can cover for it, at least for some functions. That’s the reason the cancerous cell is still alive and kicking and continues to divide rapidly. It’s only if both repair proteins are damaged that the cell will collapse. We can now diagnose patients’ tumors on an individual basis, such as by doing a biopsy from a woman’s breast cancer, and thus identify the flawed protein that led to that particular cancer. If we become highly knowledgeable about the repairing enzymes and their modes of cooperation, we will be able to develop material that will attack specifically the enzyme that is cooperating with the flawed enzyme, and thus we will cause the whole repair system to collapse.”</p> \n<p>You mean customized medicine.</p> \n<p>“Exactly. That’s medicine of greater precision, which reduces the harm to healthy cells. The ability to choose our targets intelligently and to intervene in them in a focused manner, will allow us to target only one of the constituents of the repair mechanism. The second constituent will remain in the healthy cells and take the place of the first one until the storm blows over.”</p> \n<p>How many repairing enzymes do we know about?</p> \n<p>“Given the fact that there are thousands of types of damage, we expect that there will be many dozens, even hundreds, of enzymes.”</p> \n<p>How did such sophisticated mechanisms develop in the course of evolution?</p> \n<p>“To begin with, you have to remember that these mechanisms are not 100-percent effective. That very ineffectiveness is the driving force of evolution: Natural selection operates by variance, which stems from the changes that occur in the DNA. So a delicate balance exists between the need to streamline the repair mechanisms intensely, and the need to leave a few errors in the DNA. In any event, repair mechanisms developed in all animals by degrees. A repair process exists even in bacteria, whose DNA is far simpler, and it is almost identical to one of our types.”</p> \n<p>‘Lesson for life’</p> \n<p>When he was in ninth grade, Ayoub transferred to an Arab high school in Ma’alot-Tarshiha, a mixed Arab-Jewish town in northern Israel. “There I really began to excel,” he notes with a smile. “It was a new institution and free of prejudice. The teachers and students attached no stigmas to me, and I was able to turn over a new leaf.”</p> \n<p>Subsequently, he enrolled as a biology student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, though that too turned out to be a difficult process. “Fassuta is a small, isolated village by the border,” Ayoub notes. “Until university, my only encounters with Jews had been when I went to the hospital in Nahariya for care. The only Jew I ‘knew’ was [television news anchor] Haim Yavin When I entered university, I started to watch more television and read the papers a little, to discover whether I was capable at all of understanding the [Hebrew] language.”</p> \n<p>However, in university, he recalls, “I couldn’t understand what the lecturers were saying, much less take notes. Fortunately, there was a beautiful student, a religiously observant woman name Ruthie – I still remember her name. I don’t understand why she always agreed to give me her notes, but that’s what saved me.”</p> \n<p>And now comes the de rigueur bit about how you, the gentle and educated Arab, fell in love with the captivating settler woman</p> \n<p>“I don’t think I allowed myself to fall in love with her,” he laughs. “By the way, she knew I was an Arab, of course, if only because of my accent. Still, after two weeks, I called my (late) father and told him I didn’t feel as though I belonged, and so I was coming home. That was the end of the world for him. He said, ‘Under no circumstances are you coming back! Did you think you were going to a health spa?’”</p> \n<p>So you stayed on because of your father’s demand?</p> \n<p>“Yes. I owe my father a great deal. He was tough but also emotionally sensitive and smart. He understood that there was no future for us, his children, in working the land, especially not in Fassuta, where it’s hilly and the soil is crusty. He had a mobile flour mill with which he made the rounds of the villages, and he took me with him just to show me how difficult and unprofitable it was. He wanted me to see how tedious it was and to get schooling instead. It was a lesson for life.</p> \n<p>“He encouraged me in my studies and never let me off easily. In high school, for example, when I was already a good student, I told him one day that I wouldn’t be coming to work because I had an exam the next day. He dismissed it, saying, ‘That’s your problem, not mine. You knew you had an exam and you knew you had work, too, so you should have planned your time to manage both.’ In today’s lingo, it’s called ‘time management.’ It was really a downer when I was a boy, but today I have a very high regard for the values he instilled in me. Regrettably, he did not live long enough to see how far I got.”</p> \n<p>What kind of father are you to your three children?</p> \n<p>“My dream is to be like my father, but unfortunately I’m not. I am very demanding with the children, I want my children to be the best, maybe to spare them what I went through. I am less flattering to them than my wife.”</p> \n<p>So you do resemble your father, after all.</p> \n<p>“Hmmm You’re right,” he exclaims in surprise. “I really am like him.”</p> \n<p>What you said about school – about the weak and the strong and about not encountering stigmas in the new high school – inevitably raises questions about your situation as an Arab in a Jewish society.</p> \n<p>“Personally, I have been very fortunate. I do not represent anyone here other than myself, but I have always been treated excellently by everyone with whom I’ve had occasion to interact. I met people who did a great deal by way of cultivating me. I did my master’s degree at the Hebrew University during the first intifada under the tutelage of Prof. Jacob Wahrman, who was an amazing individual. For my birthday one year, he bought me the novel ‘Arabesques,’ by Anton Shammas, whom I’d never heard of until then, even though he was from my village! Wahrman cut out items about Fassuta from the papers, a habit I learned from him.</p> \n<p>“I met many more good people – Prof. Amikam Cohen, who was my Ph.D. adviser, Prof. Haim Cedar, who was a member of my examining committee – and many colleagues, religious and nonreligious alike. If I was privileged to get different treatment, maybe it was for the good.”</p> \n<p>Maybe it was because you were especially good.</p> \n<p>“Maybe others were good, too.”</p> \n<p>Do you want to tell me that you never encountered racism here?</p> \n<p>“Not in academe. On the street, certainly. At the airport, always. I say to the airport security people: ‘Check the passengers’ identity before they get to the airport. Why do you humiliate people in this way?’ Luckily, I spend 99 percent of my time at the Technion, so my interaction with the street is very limited.”</p> \n<p>And your family, the children?</p> \n<p>“My children attend the [Carmelite Sisters] Italian School, in Haifa, a private institution of the Catholic Church, so they don’t encounter Jews very much. We also hardly use public transportation.”</p> \n<p>Life in a bubble</p> \n<p>It sounds like you’ve created a bubble for yourselves.</p> \n<p>“Academe is definitely a bubble in that regard, which is why I am against foreign calls to boycott it. It’s the sanest institution in the country, and therefore should be supported and also strengthened. I think that higher education, and in my case the Technion, where the number of Arab students is increasing amazingly from year to year, could be a model for equal opportunity and life together in this country.”</p> \n<p>You don’t sound in the least bitter, not even divided. Is the solution to live in a bubble?</p> \n<p>“If you’re asking me how I would describe my existence here, I would say [in the words of a popular Hebrew song], ‘both of us together and each separately.’”</p> \n<p>Meaning?</p> \n<p>“I am very much together with my colleagues. We have close interaction and common fields of interest. I am very much together with my Jewish friends. But there are things in which I am separate, because I am an Arab. That’s expressed in the holidays, for example, and in the music I listen to, in the way we host guests and in a few other practices of daily life. That basis remains mine, and it’s separate from that of Jewish society.”</p> \n<p>Does your being an Arab have an influence on the identity of the students who come to your lab?</p> \n<p>“Most of my students are Arabs, possibly because they feel more comfortable coming to me. Sometimes they come only to seek my advice, and if I see that they’re really good, I will try to tempt them to work with me. So I take good advantage of my status You could say that in regard to the good Arab students, I have an advantage over other [potential] advisers. But I have Jewish students, too, though only women, because to date no Jewish male students have approached me.”</p> \n<p>How do you explain that?</p> \n<p>“I have no idea. Maybe it’s because there are more women than men in biology in general.”</p> \n<p>A few years ago, Ayoub and 12 other Arab faculty members from all of Israel’s universities founded an organization they call Al-Maram [meaning “peak,” “high up”]. The association’s members visit Arab high schools in order to serve as inspiration and role models for the students. They encourage outstanding students to study the sciences at university – biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics.</p> \n<p>So you and Education Minister Naftali Bennett see eye to eye on that.</p> \n<p>“In regard to the importance of the sciences, definitely. Science needs the most brilliant minds, and we want the best to come to us and not only to medicine.”</p> \n<p>Do the top Arab students in Israel go into medicine?</p> \n<p>“Yes. Many are opting for medicine today, and for all kinds of reasons. In the past, Arabs went into the nursing professions, and the ratio was 80 percent Arabs and 20 percent Jews. The wave of immigrants from Russia [in the early 1990s] pushed out the Arabs, and the proportion was almost reversed: Today there are only 30 percent Arabs in those professions, while almost 70 percent are from the new-immigrant population. Jewish students today prefer high-tech to medicine, because the earnings there are higher, and that makes more room for Arabs. There’s also the matter of a minority that wants to excel and acquire a profession – like the Jews in the past. For all those reasons, there are many Arab physicians in the hospitals. But we want to cultivate the sciences.</p> \n<p>“In fact, I myself went into biology only in order to go on to medicine afterward. But when we started to learn about DNA and how it multiplies, how the double helix opens and how that wonder occurs, I fell in love. It was definitely love at first sight, and I understood immediately that this was my home. I think that’s the secret of my success, and that’s also one of the messages we try to convey to the high-school students: that the way to excellence is to do what you love.”</p> \n<p>You use words like “home” and “belonging” in the context of science, and not for a particular physical place.</p> \n<p>“If I have a connection to any one place, it’s to Fassuta, my small village in Upper Galilee. I love the view and the goats and the smells. When we lived in England, when I was doing a postdoc, which was followed by a research position there, we went on trips, and whenever we saw sheep – and they have plenty – the children would look at me and say: ‘Now Daddy is happy!’ Other than that, I’m in the world of science, which has no geographical venue.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>In many TV shows, a character’s Jewish identity can feel like a throwaway, usually to showcase “difference,” religious diversity, or a useful stereotype.</p> \n<p>Not so in “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” which makes the characters’ Jewishness an integral — but not overdone — part of their identities.</p> \n<p>The show, released Friday as part of Amazon’s 2017 Pilot Season — in which viewers help decide which of five shows the streaming service will produce — &nbsp;follows the life of Miriam “Midge” Maisel. She’s a 1950s housewife who seems to have a great life: She has a perfect Jewish husband, two young children, an apartment on the Upper West Side’s Riverside Drive, and, after four years of lobbying, a rabbi who has finally agreed to come to her place for the Yom Kippur break fast meal.</p> \n<p>But things are about to change.</p> \n<p>Soon after we meet the poised Midge (Rachel Brosnahan, “House of Cards”), her aspiring-comedian husband Joel (Michael Zegen, “Boardwalk Empire”) leaves her for his secretary.</p> \n<p>Upset and inebriated, Midge runs off to a downtown bar where her husband sometimes performs. She jumps onstage and starts cursing off her husband, much to the crowd’s delight.</p> \n<p>Although Midge’s impromptu flashing of the crowd earns her a 20-minute stint in jail, she impresses a local bartender, who is convinced that she is a comic genius. If the pilot is made into a series, it will follow Midge as she sets out to become a stand-up comedian.</p> \n<p>Writer/director Amy Sherman-Palladino, who also created “Gilmore Girls,” said the show was inspired in part by the late Joan Rivers, an educated, middle-class Jewish woman who broke into stand-up in the late 1950s. Sherman-Palladino’s father was Jewish gag writer Don Sherman, and his better known contemporaries, including Lenny Bruce, get shout outs in the pilot.</p> \n<p>The show is chockablock with Jewish content. Among the cast are Tony Shalhoub (“Monk”), who plays Midge’s traditional father Abe, and Marin Hinkle (“Two and a Half Men”), who plays her nagging mother, Rose.</p> \n<p>Here are the episode’s five most Jewish — and funniest — moments.</p> \n<p>1. When four years of apologies for serving shrimp pays off</p> \n<p>Midge is ecstatic when her family, after four years of trying, gets the rabbi to agree to come over to break the Yom Kippur fast. The relationship had been strained ever since her wedding, when she announced that the egg rolls being served contained shrimp. “It only took four years of apologies and a dreidel signed by Sammy Davis, Jr.,” Midge tells her butcher.</p> \n<p>2. Brisket is the currency for affection and favor</p> \n<p>Midge uses her Jewish cooking skills to curry favor with the owner of the downtown venue where her husband sometimes performs. In the beginning of the pilot, she presents the owner with homemade brisket — and she promises to bring latkes next time.</p> \n<p>3. When Joel is jealous of the rabbi’s laughs</p> \n<p>When Joel leaves Midge the day before Yom Kippur, he compares his stand-up act to the rabbi’s sermon. “I’m thinking about last week — we’re in temple, and the rabbi tells that stupid Sodom and Gomorrah joke and suddenly the whole synagogue goes nuts. He got more laughs in five minutes than I did in five months,” Joel bemoans. Midge quips: “You’re jealous of the rabbi? He was in Buchenwald, throw him a bone.”</p> \n<p>4. There’s a healthy dose of Jewish neuroses</p> \n<p>Midge parents are plenty neurotic. Her mother can’t stop pointing out that Midge’s baby daughter’s forehead is too large, and when her father finds out that Joel is leaving her, he blames her — after all, she picked a “weak man” during her studies at the “the fancy, goyishe” Bryn Mawr College.</p> \n<p>5. Plus a heaping portion of Jewish guilt</p> \n<p>Toward the end of the pilot, Midge has a minor freakout when she realizes that it’s already Yom Kippur and she is downtown, eating at a bar. “I’m supposed to be fasting, atoning for my sins in the eyes of God,” she exclaims, rushing out of the bar.</p> \n<p>Watch the trailer for Amazon’s five pilots below (skip to 0:59 for “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”):</p>",

        "text":["<p>In Steve Bannon’s 2014 speech at a Vatican conference on poverty, he referred 15 times to the “Judeo-Christian West”, “Judeo-Christian civilization” or “Judeo-Christian values.”</p> \n<p>At first glance, this admiration for anything “Judeo-Christian” doesn’t fit with the idea that President Trump’s Chief Strategist is a far right ideologue who has brought a new strain of fascism into the White House. Most fascists – to put it mildly – do not see Jewish values as a positive influence in Western thought.</p> \n<p>Bannon argues that “Judeo-Christian values” underpinned what he called the “enlightened capitalism” that helped build Western power and prosperity before, as he put it, “the party of Davos” took it all for themselves.</p> \n<p>These values are now under threat, he claims, from secularism, atheism and radical Islam; their salvation, according to Bannon, can be found in the “center-right populist revolt” that put Trump in the White House, will take Britain out of the European Union, and may sweep Marine Le Pen to power in France.</p> \n<p>This speech has been seen as Bannon’s most in-depth exposition of his political philosophy. It chimes which much of what he has said and written elsewhere: that a secular, materialist global elite has stolen the wealth and happiness of ordinary people but is now challenged by a global revolt of nationalist movements rooted in traditional religious values and social conservatism.</p> \n<p>Put this together with some of Bannon’s other views (his apparent appetite for chaos and conflict as the path to a new world, for example, or his embrace of some of America’s most extreme anti-Muslim commentators) and it’s easy to place him in a far right tradition that links interwar European fascism and post-war ‘New Right’ thinking to today’s radical populist Right.</p> \n<p>Normally, though, when far right thinkers argue that there is a ‘good’ capitalism and a ‘bad’ capitalism, they put Jewish capitalists on the ‘bad’ side of the ledger. Bannon, in contrast, says that the ‘good’ capitalism that built the West is rooted in Judeo-Christian values.</p> \n<p>He explicitly says that Jewish capitalists were motivated by their Jewish faith in spreading the benefits of wealth throughout society, and in doing so he distinguishes himself from an entire tradition of European far right anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>But still, it takes a remarkably selective recall of history for Bannon to claim that the West was built for 2,000 years on Judeo-Christian values while ignoring how the Church actually treated Jews for most of that time.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Bannon didn’t want to offend his Vatican hosts, but Jews shouldn’t feel compelled to go along with the pretense that the “Judeo-Christian West” is anything other than a relatively recent invention.</p> \n<p>In the late nineteenth century, British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli was regularly accused of favoring Turkey over Russia in his foreign policy because of his “Asiatic” Jewish origins. Disraeli’s “crypto-Judaism” led him to hate “Christian liberty”, wrote his great rival William Gladstone.</p> \n<p>The notion that Jews and Christians shared a common set of values had little purchase in the politics of the day, but the idea now enjoys widespread support because it is politically useful for both sides of the equation.</p> \n<p>This is where the danger for Jews lies in the current resurgence of nationalism, rather than a return to the politics of the 1930s. For all their assaults on democratic values, on the notion of political compromise, a free press and minority rights, today’s inheritors of the fascist tradition in Western democracies do not campaign for an end to democracy itself.</p> \n<p>Totalitarianism is not a political goal for anybody of relevance in Western politics. Those on the populist right who seek power regularly try to prove their political maturity by courting Jewish voters, particularly in Europe.</p> \n<p>In doing so, though, Jews – or rather, Jewish stereotypes – get enlisted in the service of other people’s political campaigns in which the question of what Jews actually think and want is secondary at best.</p> \n<p>In the first half of the last century, when the clash of totalitarian ideologies defined Western politics, ‘Jews’ were torn between two wildly contrasting stereotypes: the predatory capitalist and the rootless communist.</p> \n<p>Churchill famously hoped Zionism would suck Jewish support away from the “international Jews” behind Bolshevism. At the same time, British Labour Party leader Ramsay MacDonald hoped Zionism would end the exploitative practices of “the rich plutocratic Jew”.</p> \n<p>These stereotypes have been updated for this century’s contest between transnational liberalism and authoritarian nationalism.</p> \n<p>Douglas Carswell, at the time of writing the right-wing, pro-Brexit UKIP’s only Member of Parliament, wrote earlier this month that the British Left hates Israel because Israel “embodies beautifully the ideal of national self-determination”; whereas the Left is wedded to supranational institutions like the EU and the United Nations.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Marine Le Pen warned that French Jews who also hold Israeli passports will have to “choose their nationality” in the event of a Front National presidency (a policy she has only partly walked back)&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bannon claims UKIP and the French National Front as part of his global populist movement. So does this movement see Jews as archetypal nationalists, or as cosmopolitans of unreliable loyalty? It depends on who you ask and what agenda they have in mind.</p> \n<p>This is why Trump can declare himself to be Israel’s greatest supporter, while being so tardy in condemning anti-Semitism within the United States. It is why Bannon can claim to speak on behalf of the “Judeo-Christian West” while being at the heart of a campaign that repeatedly used the phrase “America First” – language with undoubted anti-Semitic resonance in American politics.</p> \n<p>It is why Marine Le Pen can insist the National Front is not anti-Semitic while also warning that under her rule, French Jews would have to stop wearing kippot in public.</p> \n<p>When your view of Jews, Israel and Zionism is shaped by stereotypes, support for Israel and an apparent lack of empathy or concern for Diaspora Jewry – and vice versa – are not as contradictory as might appear.</p> \n<p>So those who see opportunities for Jews and for Israel in this new administration ought to be wary. “Be careful with the government, for they befriend a person only for their own needs”, Pirkei Avot tells us.</p> \n<p>“They appear to be friends when it is beneficial to them, but they do not stand by a person at the time of his distress.” There’s a lot of wisdom in ancient Jewish teachings: but probably not of the kind that Steve Bannon has in mind.</p> \n<p>Dr Dave Rich is Deputy Director Communications at the Community Security Trust, an Associate Research Fellow at the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism, Birkbeck College, University of London, and author of ‘The Left’s Jewish Problem: Jeremy Corbyn, Israel and Antisemitism’.</p>",

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – An American Jewish leader close to key players in the Donald Trump-Benjamin Netanyahu summit believes&nbsp;the meeting will produce a commitment to cease all U.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority if it doesn’t ramp down ties with Hamas.</p> \n<p>Last month, Hamas and Fatah, led by PA President Mahmoud Abbas, agreed to form a Palestinian unity government.</p> \n<p>“It will be made clear to the PA that unless they stop anti-Semitic incitement in their schools, media and speeches, and stop naming schools, streets and sports teams after Jew killers, and end their alliance with Hamas, all $600 million in U.S. aid to the PA will end,” Mort Klein told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Klein, national president of the Zionist Organization of America, said the PA would also “be told to stop trying to unilaterally establish a PA state through the UN.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Get all updates on Israel, Trump and the Palestinians:&nbsp;Download our free App, and&nbsp;Subscribe&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>Klein heads the most right-wing of mainstream U.S. Jewish organizations and has relationships with people close to the president. When asked who in the Trump administration he was in touch with, like Jared Kushner, David Friedman or Steve Bannon, Klein said, “I’ve had personal conversations with several of the people you mentioned,” but he declined to be specific.</p> \n<p>Klein is also close to the ZOA’s largest funder, U.S. casino magnate and right-wing political underwriter Sheldon Adelson a major Netanyahu backer who received prime seating at Trump’s inauguration. The ZOA leader appears to be the only head of an American Jewish organization who has a direct line into the summit’s agenda.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Must read analyses and news on Trump-Netanyahu meeting:&nbsp;White House crisis, sparked by Flynn resignation, may overshadow Netanyahu-Trump meet&nbsp; |&nbsp;Netanyahu fantasized about a GOP president, cruel god gave him Trump instead&nbsp;|&nbsp;After eight years fighting Obama, Netanyahu is looking for victory lap in Trump's White House</p> \n<p>Others are relegated to searching for clues on the president’s Twitter feed or elsewhere. “Policy can be shaped by a tweet” by the president, one said. “That’s what we’re dealing with. Complete uncertainty.”</p> \n<p>What’s known is that Netanyahu shares a relationship and ideology with some of the people most involved in Israel-related policy.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, will he wax nostalgic with Kushner, the son-in-law Trump has appointed to bring peace to the Middle East, about the time the Israeli leader slept in the teenage Kushner’s New Jersey bed? (Kushner changed rooms for the night.) Will Netanyahu and Friedman, Trump’s designated ambassador to Israel, gush over their shared fondness for red-tile-roofed settlement buildings in Beit El and beyond?</p> \n<p>While the contours of Friedman’s and Kushner’s histories on Israel have been documented, the president has yet to issue detailed Mideast policy plans.</p> \n<p>Trump gets cautious</p> \n<p>Indeed, the very few specifics Trump has made public, like an intention to immediately move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, have often shifted. Though a quick embassy move was an oft-stated campaign promise that one spokesman repeated just before the inauguration,&nbsp;Trump stepped back, apparently after considering the larger dynamics in the region.</p> \n<p>As a result, some are keeping their hopes for the summit to a minimum.</p> \n<p>“Until we know more about the Trump administration’s approach, our first hope is that they do no harm and not make matters worse,” said David Halperin, the executive director of the Israel Policy Forum. The forum is a think-tank-like group that tries to build support for a two-state solution among influential people.</p> \n<p>Halperin hopes Trump and his advisers won’t allow what he calls “a far-right-wing agenda to be advanced unchecked” in Israel, one that would probably block the possibility of an Israeli-Palestinian detente.</p> \n<p>Mark Hetfield hopes the two leaders won’t discuss refugees. The HIAS chief executive has been on the front lines of the crisis wrought by the president’s January 27 executive order that abruptly halted immigration from Syria and seven other majority-Muslim countries.</p> \n<p>Israel and the United States share an interest in Palestinian refugees, said Hetfield, as well as concerns about other asylum-seekers in each country. Israel’s wall along its Sinai border with Egypt has brought down the number of asylum seekers, mostly originating in Eritrea and other parts of Africa, from “thousands each month to almost zero,” he said.</p> \n<p>Though that, rather than the separation barrier separating Israel from the West Bank, is more analogous to the wall Trump has pledged to build along the Mexican border, the difference in size makes comparisons odd. “It’s like comparing raisins to watermelons,” Hetfield said.</p> \n<p>“Prime Minister Netanyahu has already spoken in favor of the Mexican wall, much to the consternation of Mexican Jews. The two of them think similarly on refugee issues.” Rather than reinforcing each other’s thinking on the topic, “we’re hoping they don’t talk about it.”</p> \n<p>But should it come up, Hetfield hopes Kushner remembers his own grandparents, who were HIAS clients. “I would hope that Kushner would have a sympathetic attitude because he comes from refugees himself and would be able to influence Trump in that direction, but so far I haven’t seen that,” Hetfield said.</p> \n<p>Iran and ISIS</p> \n<p>Far more likely to be on the table is the Iran nuclear deal, which both leaders have vocally opposed.</p> \n<p>On the contrary, Haperin of the Israel Policy Forum says he hopes the leaders won’t squander a rare geopolitical moment. There is currently “a regional alignment of interests between Israel and Arab states that shouldn’t be considered an indefinite opportunity,” he said.</p> \n<p>“If the Israel-Palestine issue is enabled to deteriorate, I can’t see how that would help the U.S. working with Arab partners in the fight against ISIS. The last thing the U.S. needs right now is for the Israel-Palestine arena to become another boiling point.”</p> \n<p>The Reform movement’s Rabbi Rick Jacobs cautioned Netanyahu against being blinded by a warm Trump welcome. “The prime minister must not lose&nbsp;sight that millions of Americans, including the overwhelming majority of American Jews, are profoundly offended by many of the new administration’s policies,” Jacobs said. “The anticipated warm welcome may signal the prime minister’s endorsement of those policies and alienate wide segments of otherwise pro-Israel Americans.”</p> \n<p>Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, also says he hopes Netanyahu will bring key issues to Trump’s attention like reminding “the U.S. administration that the Jewish dimension of the Holocaust cannot be universalized and must never be forgotten.”</p> \n<p>Jacobs was referring to the International Holocaust Remembrance Day statement by the White House on January 27, which did not mention the Jews. “A thoughtful rebuke among friends and allies is both natural and at times required,” he said.</p> \n<p>The CEO of the American Jewish Committee, David Harris, said he was worried that, depending on what comes out of the meeting, anti-Trump activists and anti-Israel activists could find common cause.“That would, of course, be totally unfair, but it’s worth watching very closely,” he said.</p> \n<p>But all officials interviewed for this article said they were sure Trump and Netanyahu would publicly say reassuring things about the countries’ close relationship.</p> \n<p>“There will be smiles at the end of the meetings,” said Ezra Friedlander, a Hasidic Jew from Borough Park, Brooklyn, whose company specializes in government advocacy, public and media relations, and political-event management. Friedlander also runs the U.S.-Israel Security Alliance, a bipartisan group lobbying elected officials on matters relating to Israel’s safety.</p> \n<p>“It’s in both sides’ interest to have a positive atmosphere surrounding the visit before and after. It’s going to be a very collegial meeting, a lot of hugs and handshakes, reinforcement of the U.S.-Israel relationship. That’s what the optics will look like,” Friedlander said.</p> \n<p>And while the two leaders often seem to have similar styles and worldviews, and a shared fondness for walls, differences may emerge from their meeting.</p> \n<p>“There are turns and twists that you never anticipate,” Friedlander said. “It’s both premature to predict how this relationship will unfold in the Trump administration, and immature to assume that the U.S. and Israel will see eye to eye on every issue and they’ll be finishing each other’s sentences.”</p> \n<p>The ZOA’s Klein adds that Iran will be a focus of the summit. “Iran will be told the U.S. will not tolerate illegal missile testing and will not be pleased to see officially backed rallies calling for death to America and Israel,” he said, adding that more transparency in Iran’s nuclear work will be demanded.</p> \n<p>Klein also said the summit discussions would align closely with his own perspective. “It will be made clear that Jerusalem is never mentioned in the Koran and no Arab leader visited it from 1948 to 1967, except Jordan’s King Hussein, and it is not holy to Muslims,” he said.</p> \n<p>Therefore the Palestinians can “forget about dividing Jerusalem, and Jews have the religious, historical and legal right to live in Judea and Samaria.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>In an interesting sequence of events, only three weeks after the state said the settlement of Kiryat Arba had no authority to collect real estate tax (arnona) from two Hebron brothers, the Israel Defense Forces raided the home of one of them. It was the night between January 19 and 20.</p> \n<p>The arnona bill of 176,000 shekels ($47,360) levied on Abdul Karim and Zaidan Jabari in January 2015 was part of a larger interesting sequence of events. It was sent a few months after the two had petitioned the High Court of Justice against an illegal structure that Kiryat Arba residents had built on the brothers’ land. This is why the state to declare Kiryat Arba’s “lack of integrity” in issuing the arnona bill.</p> \n<p>On February 8, Jabari experienced another coincidence when he set out to plow his land only two meters from his home. Kiryat Arba’s security coordinator, Moshe Botavia, suddenly appeared and summoned soldiers and a policeman, who together stopped the plow.</p> \n<p>Botavia declared that Jabari’s working his land “hadn’t been coordinated” and launched into a long, arcane monologue that was filmed by one of two members of the grassroots group Ta’ayush who were accompanying the plow. The security coordinator, who seems full of himself and in full recognition of his power, encouraged them to film him and put the video on YouTube. In the clip you can see Jabari and the tractor driver he had hired – two men in their late 50s – looking embarrassedly and implacably at the armed, kippa-wearing Jew who wouldn’t stop pontificating.</p> \n<p>Since when does someone need to coordinate the plowing of the land where his house sits? The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories said, “To access his land, Mr. Jabari does not require coordination. It was recommended that he contact the Civil Administration and the IDF to accompany the work to make sure it was done properly.”</p> \n<p>Actually, Jabari did contact an officer at the Civil Administration. At first the officer told him he should plow on Tuesday, but later said Wednesday February 8 was better. But according to COGAT, “The accompaniment was not possible because of operational considerations, and this answer was given to Mr. Jabari.”</p> \n<p>COGAT, of course, did not explain why it had made that recommendation in the first place, but the reason is known: The Kiryat Arba settlers continue to do all they can to prevent the Jabari family from cultivating its 25 dunams (6.2 acres) of land.</p> \n<p>After two Jews, Betar resident David Cohen and Kiryat Arba resident Yehezkel Moalem, were murdered on the road leading from Kiryat Arba to Hebron’s Old City in July 2001, the Jabaris were forbidden to enter and work their land, harvest olives, plow, plant or let their animals graze there. The illegal structure put up on their land was built in 2003. The entry and cultivation ban was rescinded in 2007, only after the attorney Labib Habib petitioned against it.</p> \n<p>Jabari resumed working his land, but saplings that he had planted were uprooted, and when he and other members of the family went out to plow or do other work, they would be threatened and attacked by armed Israelis.</p> \n<p>In short, that’s why a man may not need coordination to enter the land at his doorstep, but a military chaperone is recommended.</p> \n<p>Fifty soldiers</p> \n<p>Proximity plays an important role here, too. Across from the Jabari home, right across the road, is the western entrance to Kiryat Arba. That’s also where the grave of murderer Baruch Goldstein is located. Among the 29 worshippers that he murdered in February 1994 at the Ibrahimi Mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron was Jabari’s oldest brother, Abdul Hak, who was 53 at the time.</p> \n<p>At the top of the hill is the Givat Ha’avot neighborhood, built on land that was declared state land in 1980. But aerial photos obtained by Dror Etkes, who researches settlement policy, prove that most of the land was being cultivated by Palestinians both before and after the declaration. There, at the edge of Givat Ha’avot, some 200 meters above Jabari’s home and 300 meters from the illegal structure, is the Kiryat Arba police station.</p> \n<p>Back to last month’s IDF raid. Family members estimate that some 50 soldiers, two female soldiers, two policemen in civilian clothes and a dog took part. Some of the soldiers entered the house, while others remained outside.</p> \n<p>“They knocked on the door at exactly 1 A.M. and said it was the army. I asked them to show me a warrant,” Jabari told Haaretz a week ago Friday.</p> \n<p>“They told me it was the army and there was no need for a warrant. At the same time, they knocked on the door of my son’s apartment. They said, ‘We’re counting to three and if you don’t open up we’ll blow down the door.’ He opened at the count of three. They were all masked, wearing black knitted hats, except for the two policemen.”</p> \n<p>They collected all the family’s cellphones and the video camera with which one of Jabari’s daughters, who is also a B’Tselem volunteer, had started to record. The two female soldiers made the 15 women of various ages strip down to their underwear. The two soldiers sufficed with merely patting down a 7-month-old baby, and the male soldiers sufficed with patting down the men, before confining all 25 family members to two rooms in two of the apartments.</p> \n<p>According to Jabari, the soldiers didn’t let the family bring milk and medicine for the baby who was trapped with them. “One of the officers in civilian clothes brought me my cigarettes,” he said. “He sent a Druze soldier to bring me a lighter. Another soldier said, ‘Don’t smoke.’ We started to argue and he yelled at me. Then the big officer came and told me, ‘It’s for your health.’ I said to him, ‘What do you care about my health?’</p> \n<p>“Meanwhile, I heard yelling outside from my son Diya [who suffers from dwarfism like four of his brothers]. The soldiers took me out to him so that he would stop screaming. I saw three of them, masked, carrying him, small and disabled. I also started to scream. They shoved me against the wall and yelled, ‘What are you doing, crazy man, we’ll beat you.’ I told them, ‘I’m in my own home, why would you hit me?’ The soldier told me to shut up and crushed me against the wall. In the end they put me inside and left my son outside in the cold.”</p> \n<p>The raid lasted until around 4 A.M. When the family came out of the two rooms, they didn’t recognize their home. Everything in the cupboards and draws had been dumped on the floor among piles of clothing, boxes, papers and mattresses that had been tossed around and ripped. There were overturned chairs, broken television sets, shattered cups, ripped-up floor tiles and smashed furniture. They still come across things that were broken or simply fell behind or under furniture.</p> \n<p>No one was arrested. According to the army spokesman, the soldiers informed Jabari immediately upon entering the home that they were looking for weapons. According to Jabari, they did not. They only handed him a summons to one Captain Amran in the police and said “it will tell you why we carried out the search.”</p> \n<p>The army spokesman’s office did not respond to a Haaretz query on whether any prohibited items were found in the house. It may be concluded that nothing was found, otherwise arrests would have been made.</p> \n<p>The IDF responds</p> \n<p>According to the army spokesman that night: “The IDF and the police carried out sweeps to find weapons in the home of Abdul Karim Jabari in Hebron, following intelligence information on the sale and possession of arms in the house. Contrary to the claims in the article, it was explained to the homeowners that the forces had come to look for weapons and the family was even given the possibility of taking valuables before the search was made.</p> \n<p>“The soldiers did not threaten the family and allowed them access to food and water during the search. The forces’ conduct regarding the manner of the search for weapons was investigated by the brigade commander, and search procedures were clarified thereafter.”</p> \n<p>On Sunday, Jabari went up the hill to the police station for a talk with Captain Amran. He waited for three hours and the police didn’t bother to open the gate. He then filed a complaint with the police officer at district coordination and liaison office regarding the destruction of property at his house by the soldiers.</p> \n<p>According to the spokesman for the police district in the territories: “The search in the home of the suspect was carried out during an operation by the security forces to find and confiscate illegal weapons. This operation joins many such operations carried out by the police in determined, ongoing fight against the possession of illegal weapons that have been used more than once to commit acts in one context or another. Mr. Jabari’s claims are not known; his complaint on the subject is being examined and dealt with and he will receive a response accordingly.”</p> \n<p>The meeting between “the suspect” and Captain Amran at the hilltop police station has not taken place to this day.</p> \n<p>It may thus be concluded that the intelligence information given to the army and the police was false, because nothing was found in the meticulous search and no one was arrested. There is no chance the source of this false information will be revealed. Will anyone be punished for such a large contingent wasting the IDF’s time and resources to harass a family of 25 over nothing?</p>",

        "text":["<p>A recent Haaretz headline, “Despite anti-Semitic Wave, U.S. Jews Won't Move to Israel Anytime Soon” reminded me of a family story. My mother used to describe how her younger brother ran into their Berlin home with a big smile and an outraised arm shouting, “Heil Hitler.”</p> \n<p>Jews in pre-war Berlin, just as demographer Sergio dellaPergola notes about present-day American Jews, “on the whole enjoy a very high socio-economic status, and that’s not something you give up easily.” One should not jump to analogies, but there’s something perverse about a Jewish academic glibly stepping all over the issue of Jewish vulnerability.</p> \n<p>DellaPergola goes on: “But more importantly, there is such a weakening in the relationship of American Jews to Israel that it is simply an illusion to think that they will come here during times of crisis.” Sociologist Steven Cohen adds,” By and large, American Jews are not all that attached to Israel, and most of those who are emotionally attached have shown little interest in moving there.”</p> \n<p>Are we right to be so completely disillusioned by the potential for immigration to Israel from the U.S.? Have we given up the fight just before one of its potentially critical and productive testing points?</p> \n<p>It is a common position held by the center and left that Israel will lose the demographic battle to survive as a Jewish state unless it withdraws to the security wall. I would suggest that without significant aliyah from North America, we will lose the demographic struggle in any case, whether we end up with one or two states.</p> \n<p>That’s because a 50-50 population ratio can't guarantee the future Jewish identity of Israel. But, the sceptics insist, only messianic dreamers really think there is a chance of a significant aliyah from North America.</p> \n<p>Let’s consider these “hard-nosed” takes on aliyah. Beginning with those messianic dreamers, wasn’t the whole idea of a Jewish State a pipedream? Hasn’t it been a feature of Jewish political history, from the time of King Cyrus in 510 BCE to the American Council for Judaism in the 20th century, to fail to voluntarily respond en masse to the challenge of Jewish sovereignty? If we’re already talking demography, isn’t it a bit Orwellian to dismiss the notion of aliyah?</p> \n<p>DellaPergola and Cohen may have their finger on the pulse, but in the early 2000s the Board of Governors of the Jewish Agency commissioned a market research study of the potential for aliyah from North America. The survey revealed that nearly one third of U.S. Jews would consider a move to Israel, even on a temporary basis. If even one third of that one third actually made aliyah, Israel would get another half a million Jewish olim.</p> \n<p>Not only would this push back against Israel's Jewish-majority demographic problem, it would also be a huge boon, in terms of both morale and economy, as has every major immigration to Israel. Aliyah by choice would pull the rug out from the anti-Israel propaganda that describes Israel as a colonial outpost to which refugee Jews were transferred by Western countries.</p> \n<p>And it would cut into assimilation and the distancing from Israel that Cohen refers to, because every American Jew would have a relative living in Israel.</p> \n<p>As far as one can tell, the Jewish Agency's Board of Governors shelved the research; it is not publicly available, and it does not appear that its surprisingly positive outlook for American aliyah was acted upon.</p> \n<p>This behavior is rooted in a long standing agreement between David Ben-Gurion and then-AJC head Jacob Blaustein in 1954 to suppress the subject of aliyah. As a result, “concerned&quot; American Jews from both sides of the political spectrum can act out their passion for Israel from afar, and demand that Israel conform to their moral expectations, without the inconvenience of participating in Israel’s actual political process.</p> \n<p>As a public policy analyst, I know that realism is important in considering options for the future. But I also know the one of the leading policy analysts of our day, Prof Yehezkel Dror, supported what he called an “Aliyah Project,” as part of a strategy for the Jewish future. Such a project is not limited to “pie in the sky” exhortations, or trying to make American Jews feel guilty about not moving to Israel.</p> \n<p>The above mentioned JAFI research project should have resulted in a marketing strategy that would use American olim to tell their story to U.S. Jews, but this was never acted on. I myself suggested to Birthright to supplement the exposure its participants get to Yad Vashem and heroic Israel Defense Forces officers, with visits to the homes of well-settled American olim.</p> \n<p>Let Birthrighters see the life, good, bad and ugly, that people similar to their parents are living. No preaching, just exposing young American Jews to aliyah as an option.</p> \n<p>Are Jewish and Zionist institutions really so afraid of even suggesting aliyah as an option? How does this play with the idea of North American Jews packing up and moving to Israel being such a “pipedream”?</p> \n<p>Let’s put things on the table. Israel has absorbed, with huge success, refugees from three of the four corners of the earth that Jews traditionally mention in our prayers every morning. One corner, the one that would involve aliyah by choice, is missing.</p> \n<p>Whether or not the ugly political and social trends emerging in the U.S. (which I witnessed firsthand during a recent six month sabbatical in New York) will make aliyah more likely is unclear. History tells us Jews wait too long, and, in any case, it would be a shame it were no longer aliyah by choice.</p> \n<p>But without such an aliyah, a necessary and possibly sufficient condition for survival of the Jewish people and Israel is lacking. The realists can kick back all they want, but perhaps if you will it (and don’t work systematically against it) it is no dream.</p> \n<p>David Chinitz is Professor of Health Policy and Management at the Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Public Health. He made aliyah from the U.S. in 1981.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for the Jewish Agency for Israel responded:</p> \n<p>Bringing Jews to Israel has been at the core of The Jewish Agency’s work throughout its existence, and it remains so today. The Jewish Agency’s innovative strategic plan, developed by our Chairman, Natan Sharansky, reflects our understanding that modern-day Aliyah cannot be marketed like just another product or service – the decision to immigrate from a Western country to Israel will come only out of a deep sense of attachment and a strong Jewish identity.</p> \n<p>Our continuum of Israel experiences—bringing young Jews to experience life in Israel for ever-increasing periods of time, from the ten days of Taglit-Birthright Israel through longer-term programs like Masa Israel Journey—was developed with the specific aim of strengthening participants’ Jewish identities and connections to Israel, inspiring them to either return to their communities of origin and become actively engaged in Jewish life, or make Israel their home. And indeed, we find that increasing numbers of immigrants from Western countries are the alumni of our Israel experience programs, demonstrating that our strategic plan is working. We look forward to continuing to bring Jews from North America and elsewhere to Israel well into the future.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Deep within the National Library archive, an unmarked cardboard box wrapped in fine linen contains 40 high-quality aerial photographs of pre-state Israel. A yellowing piece of paper sits atop the photos, with a brief inscription in Hebrew and German revealing the story behind their creation.</p> \n<p>The project was the result of a unique collaboration between a successful publisher and one of pre-state Israel’s greatest photographers. It was to produce the first-ever set of aerial photographs of pre-state Israel to be taken for nonmilitary purposes.</p> \n<p>What does the inscription tell us, and who are the men who created this unique album exactly 80 years ago this year?</p> \n<p>Against the backdrop of bloody events in Israel (the Arab Revolt) and Hitler’s edicts in Germany, a celebration was held in Jerusalem on October 23, 1937, to mark Zalman Schocken’s 60th birthday. On the second floor of his library building (which had been planned by renowned architect Erich Mendelsohn), Schocken got together with a small group of colleagues and peers. A tough and powerful businessman, someone like Schocken had few real friends. At the same time, many wanted to extend their best wishes to this influential man who was a patron of Hebrew literature and who had brought together the greatest creative minds in the burgeoning local Jewish community.</p> \n<p>Schocken’s public status in pre-state Israel was at its height. He held senior positions at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Jewish Agency, and had just purchased Haaretz – one of the most important dailies in pre-state Israel, which his son Gershom would then edit for 50 years. Zalman Schocken devoted most of his energies toward cultivating original and innovative cultural experiences – first and foremost with his Schocken Books.</p> \n<p>Author S.Y. Agnon headed a group of writers who “adopted” and looked out for Schocken, who in turn provided for them generously. Haim Hazaz, Shaul Tchernichovsky and other artists received generous stipends from him, in exchange for exclusive rights to their work.</p> \n<p>But while Schocken’s endeavors on behalf of literature are well-known, little has been written about his initiative to photograph pre-state Israel from the skies.</p> \n<p>We still don’t know exactly who connected him and Nachman Shifrin, owner of the Orient Press Photo Agency, in 1937. But their collaboration left a unique mark on Israeli photography.</p> \n<p>Photographers making aliyah</p> \n<p>Four years earlier, Shifrin had sold his large press photo agency in Berlin and immigrated to pre-state Israel, along with one of his best photographers, Zoltan Kluger. Four months after Hitler had come to power, Nazi restrictions on the activities of Jewish photographers had led Shifrin to the conclusion that he must get out. He also understood that the national institutions in pre-state Israel needed professional-looking photographs for the developing industries of propaganda and publishing.</p> \n<p>Shifrin was a talented entrepreneur and a shrewd and resourceful businessman. What he was not, though, was a photographer. He entrusted this to Kluger, a modest and highly skilled photographer from the Hungarian city of Kecskemet, who had worked in Berlin from the 1920s.</p> \n<p>The technical and artistic quality of Kluger’s work led him to become the preferred photographer of Keren Hayesod and the Jewish National Fund soon after his arrival in pre-state Israel, in November 1933.</p> \n<p>Shifrin and Kluger’s immediate success did not prevent them from examining other areas of activity, even though this created ill will from other photographers. But a new wave of immigration from Europe (the Fifth Aliyah) included a large group of photographers, some of international renown, which led to greater competition among the photographers.</p> \n<p>Shifrin grew concerned by other photographers’ complaints that Kluger was enjoying too much exclusivity working with the national institutions. This led him and Kluger to seek other ways to showcase their superiority in the field: The daring venture they eventually pursued would literally allow them to look down upon their rivals.</p> \n<p>Bird’s eye view</p> \n<p>So who actually came up with the idea of taking the aerial photographs? That remains unclear. Could it have been Kluger, who had served as a photographer in the Austro-Hungarian air force in World War I? Or was it the exuberant entrepreneur Shifrin who first thought of it? Or was it Schocken, who was known for his original ideas, especially in the field of advertising?</p> \n<p>What is known is that Schocken was the key figure in the initiative to hire a civilian aircraft and document pre-state Israel, for the first time ever, from above. Until then, aerial shots had been the preserve of military personnel, conducted through the auspices of the German Air Force and the British, especially during World War I. Now, Schocken was able to hire a plane through Aviron – the first “airline” in pre-state Israel – and let Kluger work his magic.</p> \n<p>And the photographer’s aerial shots did not disappoint: stunning pictures of the Judean Desert, the Jordan Valley, Tel Hai, Deganya, Ein Harod, Beit Yosef and Tirat Zvi in the Beit She’an Valley, and coastal communities – most notably Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>All of these shots were novelties in the pre-state Israel photo album. But the crowning glory was provided by Kluger’s aerial shots of Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>In a gesture (or perhaps in response to a specific request) to the project’s patron, Kluger photographed Schocken’s home and library – the luxurious buildings designed by Mendelsohn on the outskirts of Talbieh and inaugurated shortly before the photos were taken.</p> \n<p>One of the most amazing details in the Schocken house imagery is the pool and surrounding landscaped garden, designed by a gardener brought in from Germany specifically for the task.</p> \n<p>These photographs are important documents for the study of the Jewish part of Jerusalem during the Mandate era. There are also marvelous aerial shots of the Mount Scopus area, including the original National Library in Wolfson House.</p> \n<p>Belated thanks</p> \n<p>Jewish philosopher Martin Buber once said, “The older we get, the greater becomes our inclination to give thanks, especially heavenward.”</p> \n<p>Schocken, an admirer of Buber’s, also adopted this worldview and wished to thank his many well-wishers. The process dragged on – thanks in large part to the publisher’s meticulous attention to detail – but Kluger’s aerial shots eventually became albums: high-quality silver prints mounted on cardboard and packed carefully inside a box.</p> \n<p>Schocken then added a page, writing in both German and Hebrew: “I am pleased to send you, albeit belatedly, a collection of aerial photographs of the Land of Israel as a reciprocal gift for the generous present I received from you in honor of my 60th birthday.” Beneath the dedication, Schocken added a few words in German in his tiny handwriting and signed it.</p> \n<p>The careful production of the photos (which led to the time delay) must have been quite an expensive endeavor. Schocken, a sensible businessman who was always careful with his money, produced only a limited number of the albums that contained 40, hand-selected images. He also produced two mini-albums, which contained smaller collections of six to 12 photographs apiece.</p> \n<p>Who got the bigger album and who got a smaller one? A partial answer to that may be found in the National Library archives, where some copies of the albums are preserved. A few albums also lie in the personal archives of some of Schocken’s close associates.</p> \n<p>The advent of World War II led to restrictions on civil aviation in pre-state Israel, and aerial photography was banned. Consequently, the Schocken, Kluger and Shifrin project ended up being the sole nonmilitary documentation of the country for many, many years.</p> \n<p>Even today, 80 years on, the collection’s beauty and quality continues to amaze and inspire us.</p> \n<p>The writer works in the photographic archive at the National Library of Israel</p>",

        "text":["<p>The future of public broadcasting in Israel, the possibility of early elections and the police probes of the prime minister and his family aren’t the only issues of importance to the state these days. Israel may be tangential to regional developments, but it could be dragged into them at any time, as a result of miscalculation — it wouldn’t be the first time that the scent of an approaching election has affected military decisions — or for other reasons.</p> \n<p>The incident last Friday, in which Syria fired an anti-aircraft missile at Israeli warplanes after Israeli airstrikes in Syria, reminded the Israeli media about the ongoing civil war in that country.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;  Fighting Iran's ambitions in Syria, Israel risks angering Russia | Analysis&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>That war is the main, but not the only, arena for the larger struggle among forces in the region. The two main sides are the Iranian-led Shi’ite Muslim axis and the Saudi-led alliance of conservative Sunni Muslim regimes. Tehran has an advantage on nearly every front. Israel is a secondary player. Its focus is on trying to curb Iranian influence on the front that is most important to it, the border with Syria in the Golan Heights.</p> \n<p>Tehran has reason to be satisfied with trends on several fronts. In the wake of the fall of Aleppo to government forces, President Bashar Assad has the upper hand in Syria. The Saudi fight against Houthi rebels in Yemen has failed so far, and Riyadh finds itself stuck in a fatal swamp. The international coalition in Iraq is close to retaking Mosul from the Islamic State organization, as the Iraqi government and Shi’ite militias prepare to divide the spoils and the Iranians enjoy increasing legitimacy to the point that the United States has begun to train openly Shi’ite Iraqi militias, claiming that they are “positive” while ignoring their Iranian ties.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;  The role Russia played in the Israel-Syria missile clash | Analysis &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>Other Arab states — from Oman, which helps smuggle Iranian arms, to Jordan, which sent a conciliatory delegation headed by the speaker of the parliament to Tehran — don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>Israel is particularly troubled by developments in Syria and Lebanon. There are reports of Shi’ite militias in the Syrian Golan Heights (although still relatively far from the Israeli border). Members of Hezbollah, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps and pro-Assad militias routinely infiltrate into the northern Golan Heights. Tehran and the Assad regime are discussing a long-term lease of space in the Latakia port to Iran, which has also delivered to Hezbollah underground weapons factories that it established.</p> \n<p>Israel was forced to admit its airstrikes in Syria last week after the Arrow air defense system intercepted the Syrian missile that was fired at Israeli jets. The policy of ambiguity returned a few days later, when Jerusalem refused to comment on Syrian reports that an Israeli drone strike killed a local combatant in the northern Golan Heights. But remarks by the prime minister, the defense minister, the army chief of staff (twice), the Mossad chief and the outgoing GOC Northern Commander received widespread coverage in Israeli media outlets.</p> \n<p>The Israeli message, despite the Russian foreign ministry summoning the Israeli ambassador for clarifications, was firm. We will continue to attacking arms convoys in Syria as needed, in order to keep Hezbollah from obtaining weapons, including rockets, missiles, drones and chemical weapons. (The organization is not known to have expressed an interest in the latter.)</p> \n<p>The reserve-duty generals Amos Yadlin and Giora Eiland argued in two separate articles in the Yedioth Ahronoth daily this week that foiling arms smuggling is secondary to Israel’s main goal of thwarting Iran’s and Hezbollah’s presence in the Golan Heights.</p> \n<p>Yadlin, presumably reflecting the position of the military establishment, believes “a reassessment is needed” of the benefits of the effort to keep weapons out of the hands of Hezbollah (by striking convoys and arms depots in Syria) versus the risk of escalation posed by these actions. Yadlin said that while Israel should uproot the terror infrastructure in the Golan Heights, the most important strategic goal in the north is to prevent Iran from establishing a base in Syria, using its contacts in Moscow and in Washington.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;  Israel's growing tensions with Syria, Lebanon and Hamas leave little room for maneuvering | Analysis &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>Israel remains skeptical, assuming the Syrian dictator will have to repay the Iranians in kind. Mossad chief Yossi Cohen described Iran this week as “the primary challenge for the security establishment, with or without the nuclear deal.”</p> \n<p>Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, speaking at the same event, focused on the northern front. He said that in a future war with Hezbollah, Israel could target Lebanese state institutions, without making a distinction between the government in Beirut and the Shi’ite organization. It looks like a planned Israeli trend – renewing threats to wreak widespread destruction in Lebanon in order to deter Hezbollah from operating on the border in wake of its growing confidence based on Shi’ite successes in Syria.</p> \n<p>Will this verbal campaign be effective? A Lebanese researcher, who recently met with Israeli colleagues abroad, asserted that Israel should sharpen its message. Just stressing the potential scope of destruction, he explained, would deter Lebanese citizens from supporting provocations by Hezbollah that could drag the parties into war.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev and I differ on most public issues: She identifies with the Israeli right, with military power, with the Jewish character of the state and the contemporary version of Zionism as a land-grabbing enterprise. I identify with the internationalist left, with exilic Judaism, with socialist Zionism, and with European secular culture and politics. But me and her have three powerful common denominators: We are both women, we are both of Moroccan origin and we both live in Israel.</p> \n<p>In Israeli society, being a woman of Moroccan origin is such a powerful social marker that it is not surprising I found myself agreeing with one of her latest Facebook posts which read: “Blindness. It seems that even in 2017, about 70 years after the establishment of the state, qualified people among Middle Eastern, Sephardi and the non-Jewish sector have not been found eligible to receive the Israel Prize. The exclusion of Mizrahim, Sephardim and ultra-Orthodox Jews and the non-Jewish sector persists with regard to the Israel Prize – a prize that should provide an appropriate representation of all populations that make up Israeli society In Israel more than 50 percent [of the population] is composed of Sephardim and Mizrahim, and they have not found a place – not in the prize committees and not among the winners.”</p> \n<p>And Regev asks pointedly why the conclusions of the state comptroller in this matter from a few years ago have not yet been implemented. With no little irony, she hopes that “maybe next year our luck will improve or the committees will become unblinded.”</p> \n<p>The question of when and mostly how blindness stops is a fascinating one. But all the evidence suggests that this blindness is not near to seeing the light. Regev’s remarks were met by a thundering silence by the traditional liberal Ashkenazi left. With the exception of a tweet by Zehava Galon who agreed with Regev, no one reacted to the stunning fact that half of the population is hardly ever represented in the most prestigious ranks and distinctions of Israeli culture and scholarship.</p> \n<p>Whether this silence derives from embarrassment, irritation or indifference does not change the fact the liberal left still does not grasp that this issue has been the single most crucial determinant of its historical defeat, and the hidden mover of Israeli politics in general.</p> \n<p>Right-wing populism would have never won Israeli politics if it had not rested on the systemic exclusion and persistent denial of such exclusion. With very few exceptions (see Ehud Barak’s perfunctory apology), most Ashkenazis have consistently claimed that there has never been discrimination against Mizrahim or, when they did concede it, usually proceeded to claim that it does not exist anymore. Take the response by the Education Ministry, which managed to add insult to injury: “The Israel Prize is awarded to those who have excelled and made a breakthrough in their field.”</p> \n<p>The status of Mizrahi Jews inside Israeli society is the least discussed scandal of Jewish-Israeli history, the least well-known by foreign journalists or by Jewish communities abroad. The substance of this scandal can be summarized in simple words: For the past 70 years, Ashkenazi Jews have consistently and systematically used language, worldviews and policies toward Mizrahim that can only be compared to the relationship of colonialists to natives, with the major difference that Mizrahim and Ashkenazim are supposed to be part of the same religious, ethnic, national group.</p> \n<p>In official government papers or at informal dinner tables, Ashkenazim called their Sephardi brothers “inferior,” “dumb,” “primitive,” “ignorant,” “culturally backward” ( I personally frequently heard these words at some dinner tables). Ashkenazis played in symphonic orchestras and went to concerts on Friday morning, while Mizrahi women cleaned their houses, cared for their babies, cooked their food, filled the low-skilled jobs in factories.</p> \n<p>Not good enough</p> \n<p>The least discussed and most stunning scandal of modern Jewish history is this one: A Morrocan Jew, of any social class, literate or illiterate, with or without college education, fared far better in any Christian country than in Israel. S/he fared far better not only economically and socially but more primordially, as a human being. A Mizrahi Jew of any social class was more likely to be bestowed human dignity in a Christian country than in Israel. This simple fact has enabled right-wing populists – who, like Netanyahu, are not particularly bothered by the working classes or Mizrahim – to seize and hold on to power for so long.</p> \n<p>Liberal democracy is built on four pillars: on a parliament composed of elected members, on independent courts, on a free press and on a higher education system which pursues knowledge in the spirit of the fundamental value of equality between men and women.</p> \n<p>Israeli academia has betrayed its vocation of being a moral guide to the rest of society. Since its inception, it has functioned as a colonial gentlemen’s club. It has entrenched the myth that if no Mizrahi has been found worthy to enter the Academy of Sciences, to receive the Rothschild award, to preside over the Israel Prize committee or lead an Israeli university, it is because – well, how shall I say it – we Mizrahim are “simply not good enough.”</p> \n<p>Regev is right to mock the moral authority of such academic committees. Academia is the least transparent institution in society, because all its decisions are made by anonymous committees not accountable to anyone. These committees must make decisions only based on merit. But when an institution has managed so successfully to exclude half of its population (no other Western society has managed an ethnic discrimination of such scale from within its own nationals), we must suspect it makes its decisions in other ways.</p> \n<p>As much accumulated research and evidence suggests, the decisions of academic committees are likely to reflect the ethos and the tight networks of the elites which have governed, unchallenged, the Israeli academic system since the 1920s. These decisions are based on relationships of friendship, on fuzzily established reputations, on familial pedigree, on a hierarchy of disciplines and topics, and mostly on an unconscious (and sometimes conscious) classification of human beings according to their gender, religion and ethnicity. Ashkenazi men with family pedigrees will always appear as more deserving than members of minorities such as women, Mizrahim or Arabs, because they look more familiar and more authoritative to those sitting in the committees.</p> \n<p>The moral authority of academia relies only and exclusively on meritocracy, on its capacity to produce and recognize talent regardless of ethnic or religious membership. Such moral authority of academia is jeopardized when it justifies, and in fact perpetuates, inequalities and discriminations. It is not by chance that the very few Mizrahim who have entered the center of Israeli society did so in sectors that do not depend on the evaluation of Ashkenazi committees: in business and politics (mostly through religious parties). They entered the higher military echelons when the army started losing its prestige with Ashkenazis.</p> \n<p>The very reason why populists and extreme right-wingers have been in power in Israel for such a long time is exactly here: It is because the so-called liberal Ashkenazi elites never bothered to even pretend to represent the interests, the aspirations, the worldviews of Mizrahim. It is because the academic elites who view the university with such respect view Mizrahim with disdain, or at most with patronizing benevolence.</p> \n<p>Mizrahim never elicited the natural sentiment of brotherhood that should have been at the heart of a genuine socialist and nationalist politics of solidarity. Israeli academia has played a central role in justifying and perpetuating the cultural disdain for and exclusion of Mizrahim. It thus does not and cannot have any moral authority on the rest of society, precisely because, as the education minister’s declaration illustrates, it has nourished and cultivated the idea that Mizrahim are culturally and intellectually inferior, and if they are not rewarded it is because they do not deserve to be rewarded.</p> \n<p>The deep cultural isolation of Mizrahim from academia and European liberal culture has had deep political consequences. It has made Mizrahim alienated from the values and culture of democracy and liberalism, associated with hollow elites. This has produced the same result as with the white American working classes that elected Trump: They preferred the lies of a cynical political group that exploited them, as long as this group seemed to recognize their pain and plight. They revolted against the liberal establishment and yielded to populist, anti-democratic politics that promised to do them the justice that the liberals of the new Democrats seemed indifferent to.</p> \n<p>The Ashkenazi right wing has been on the whole the only ones to acknowledge and address the painful inequality and discrimination, even if for cynical electoral purposes. The greatest tragedy of Israeli politics is the same that plagues the liberal world: It is an anti-democratic politic that claims to fight the inequalities and injustice that have been silently eating the heart of Israeli society.</p>",

        "text":["<p>With the demonstrations in Beit El and attempts to return to the evacuated West Bank settlement of Sa-Nur last week, I’ve been thinking about where I was 10 years ago when the disengagement from Gaza took place. At the time, I was 18 years old and spending the year at Yeshivat Hakotel, one of the flagship religious Zionist yeshivas in the hesder yeshiva program (in which young Israeli men combine Torah study with military service).</p> \n<p>That academic year, from 2004 to 2005, Rabbi Mordechai&nbsp;&quot;Moti&quot; Elon was still head of the yeshiva and at the height of his popularity. (A scandal later broke out and he was convicted in 2013 for sexually assaulting two of his students.) The son of a Supreme Court judge and brother of a former Knesset member for a religious Zionist political party, Rav Elon served as a bridge between the religious and secular in Israel. He was one of the leading lights of the religious Zionist world; with a popular TV program and thousands of students attending his classes each week.</p> \n<p>The public debate in the religious Zionist community revolved around the question of whether soldiers should disobey orders if they were told to evacuate the settlements. In a memorable public class, Rav Elon presented his decision that a solider should obey the orders, but gave special permission to refuse orders to a soldier who said his wife would divorce him if he obeyed them.</p> \n<p>The color orange – the national symbol against the disengagement plan – decked the yeshiva's main hall. At every opportunity, the entire yeshiva would decamp to Gush Katif to show solidarity with the people there. At various points in the year, the entire yeshiva would even move their classes to outside the Knesset, linking the day's learning to protesting the government's decision to evacuate the settlements.</p> \n<p>I vividly remember being terrified that at one of the public demonstrations against the disengagement Rav Elon would be arrested and his students would respond with a violent riot. I was so upset by this concern that I went to Rav Elon and begged him to stop leading demonstrations. With compassion, he spoke to me about the need to ensure his students were all leaders and that all of them understood they were not just representing themselves, but the entire religious Zionist community.</p> \n<p>It was also during this time that I was starting to become very politically conscious. I was uncomfortable with the activism that the yeshiva was taking and chose to not go to Gush Katif to protest alongside my fellow classmates. I also skipped the Knesset protest.</p> \n<p>I did however go to Gush Katif on an educational trip with Bnei Akiva, the youth movement who was managing my yeshiva program, three months before the disengagement, to meet those who were going to be evacuated and ask them questions. Upon entering Gush Katif, I was struck by the beauty of the place alongside the absurdity of the situation. There were blocks of picturesque houses with a tank sitting on the corner of the settlement, looking out over what was an eerie, empty field, and Palestinian villages just a few hundred meters beyond that. The organizer of the trip was terrified that a Qassam rocket would hit our bus, as it was Gush Katif that had been the main target of rocket and mortar attacks up until that point.</p> \n<p>Two things remain fresh in my mind about that visit to the Gush Katif settlements. The first was meeting a farmer who was working in his greenhouse. When we asked if he had made any preparation for the evacuation in three months, he told us that one does not speak about a funeral when a patient is lying on their deathbed. The second was seeing another resident digging to prepare the foundations of a house. When we asked why he was building a house when the government was evacuating them in three months' time, he told us that there was utterly no way that it would happen, that G-d would reverse the evil of the decree. Seeing his children playing behind, him we asked if he had let his children know that they might be moving. He looked at us as though we were crazy.</p> \n<p>The disengagement was traumatic for the evacuees, with many subsequently suffering from emotional and physical health problems. The state's mistreatment of evacuees, including leaving them to live in temporary housing for years thereafter, contributed to the bedrock of mistrust between many in the settler community and the government. Beyond its impact on the individuals, the disengagement sparked a conversation within the religious Zionist community about whether the state is an object of divine intervention – a vehicle for redemption – or whether it just a secular thing that could prolong the coming of the Messiah.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Watching religious Zionist protesters in Beit El last&nbsp;week as they screamed, &quot;War, this is war,&quot; and urged one another to push back the Border Police, I can’t help but think that the State of Israel is facing a new constituency who refuses to accept the law of the land. I remember the time when Israel managed to dismantle multiple settlements with minimal violence and worrying back then that I was living though the moment where the state’s sovereignty over the religious Zionist community was being torn asunder.</p> \n<p>Joel Braunold is the U.S. Director of the Alliance for Middle East Peace.

        "text":["<p>The City of David in Jerusalem is a success story. Every year more than 400,000 schoolchildren, soldiers, students, tourists and whole families flock, coupons in hand, to the place “where it all began.” It’s no accident that David Be’eri, who conceived of this tourism site where Jerusalem was born, has won an Israel Prize for life achievement.</p> \n<p>The website of the Ir David Foundation (also known as Elad) is an invitation to an exciting experience: gravity-defying leaps between historical eras and interactive tours, not to mention offers of attractive prices. One video on the site features actor Mati Seri wearing an Indiana Jones-style hat. He tells the story of the Meyuhas family in the village called Shiloah in Hebrew; that is, the City of David.</p> \n<p>Seri stands beside an Arab house that flies the Israeli flag, testifying to the Jews’ return to the village. Seri exults in Rabbi Rahamim Natan Meyuhas, who bought a home in the area, moved there with his family and thus became “the first to return to the City of David in modern times.”</p> \n<p>The presenter skips among times and spaces. By leaps and bounds he goes from the largely Arab Silwan neighborhood, where the City of David sits, back to the end of the 19th century, when Jews moved outside the Old City walls. Then it’s further back in time – to the days of King David. His narrative creates a continuum of Jewish time and space, from the biblical Jewish kingdom to the Israeli republic.</p> \n<p>This is a thrilling story of rediscovery, returning home, pioneering and making the desert bloom. It’s also a journey in search of the lost past. The narrative is tightly constructed and polished in the style of an advertisement.</p> \n<p>But despite the considerable effort to wipe them off the map and bury their past, it’s hard to ignore the people who live near the archaeological site and the homes of the Jewish newcomers with their guard towers.</p> \n<p>Arabs have been living for hundreds of years in Silwan. The story of the City of David is the story of the eradication of Silwan. The popular tourism site conceals a violent project of taking over public and private space and robbing the inhabitants of their homes. Through no fault of their own, the Meyuhas family find themselves in this story.</p> \n<p>Theological and mythical baggage</p> \n<p>The Meyuhases moved just beyond the Old City walls in 1873. The move by a native-born Jew from the Old City to Silwan was perfectly natural at the time. Rabbi Meyuhas merely wanted to earn a living; he didn’t aim to change the space but rather to become a part of it, as is told in the biography of the family’s eldest son, Yosef Meyuhas. The narrative that the Elad nonprofit group is constructing piles theological and mythical baggage onto the family’s story that it packs into a smooth narrative.</p> \n<p>Elad was created about 30 years ago by a small group of Jewish settlers, and over the years it has become a policy project of the first degree. Along with receiving generous support from the state, the Ir David Foundation also collaborates closely with the Jerusalem municipality, the Education Ministry, the Defense Ministry and the Israel Antiquities Authority. As a result, every year thousands of young people, educators, soldiers, high-tech employees, young Jews from abroad in the Taglit-Birthright program and tourists are channeled to “discovering the secrets of biblical Jerusalem.”</p> \n<p>Many see this flourishing project as further evidence of the settler right’s takeover of Israel’s power centers and education system. Countless condemnations have been voiced in the political left and center since this month’s announcement that Be’eri, who founded and runs Elad, had won the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement. Opposition leader Isaac Herzog was among the few outside the right-wing coalition government who found the selection of Be’eri appropriate and congratulated him.</p> \n<p>Still, the City of David’s tremendous success isn’t a story of the marginal right taking over the Zionist narrative. The City of David has never been a marginal story. It’s a faithful reflection of basic building blocks of the Zionist mainstream and the principle of basing the return of the Jews on revisiting the biblical story. This idea drew an imaginary line between Zionist nationalism and Jewish sovereignty in the Bible. The leap in time makes it possible to base the demand for Jewish ownership of the territory while wiping out the history of the land and its Arab inhabitants.</p> \n<p>One of the first to point out the problems with this way of thinking was Yosef Meyhuhas, Rabbi Rahamim Natan’s son. He spent his childhood in Silwan, where he got to know the Arab-Palestinian tradition, which became an integral part of his own culture. For many years he helped translate the Palestinian Arabic tradition into Hebrew, in an attempt to forge a connection between the Jewish newcomers and the indigenous Arabs.</p> \n<p>A Hebrew-Arabic space</p> \n<p>In the introduction of his 1919 book on Palestinian peasant farmers he wrote: “One pervasive limitation inherent in us, the Jews from all walks of life, with respect to the land is that when we come to settle here we are trying to live our own life insofar as possible, without in the least considering the life of the people in it.”</p> \n<p>As he put it, “Along with all the excellent qualities we developed during our time in the Diaspora, we also developed many qualities and customs on which the seal of the Diaspora is embossed and which are very, very far from our own independent Eastern Jewish virtues. It is these that we can restore and adopt for ourselves precisely by going deeply into the lives of the populace, the people who have always lived in the land and by precise study and inquiry into them and their essence.”</p> \n<p>For many years Yosef Meyuhas, whom Elad has co-opted as a symbol, chided the Jews’ arrogance and alienation regarding the indigenous Arabs. Meyuhas was one of the most important translators and documenters of Palestinian Arab culture into Hebrew. He published scores of articles and books about the Palestinians and their way of life, customs and culture.</p> \n<p>In his 1919 book he wrote: “The ways of these good neighbors, their qualities, way of life, conversations and stories have endeared me. They became a kind of girsa deyankuta [knowledge acquired as a child], and to this day I love them, as they always stir in me memories of the good days of my childhood.”</p> \n<p>His most important work is the trilogy “Children of Arabia” (1927-1929), a compendium of translations of Bible stories from the local Arab oral tradition. Meyuhas proposed an unusual analysis of the relationship between the biblical text, the Arab inhabitants and the physical space of the land, and presented a political alternative to the doctrine that is still accepted in the Zionist narrative.</p> \n<p>Instead of seeing the biblical text as a basis for the historical Jewish ownership of the land, he pointed out the shared Muslim-Jewish tradition of the biblical text. Relying on the traditions shaped over generations, Meyuhas questioned the exclusive Jewish ownership of the biblical text and, by extension, of the land.</p> \n<p>About 75 years after his death, the only opportunity students have to learn about Meyuhas is an organized tour in the City of David. But they won’t hear about the shared Hebrew-Arabic space into which he was born and which he nurtured. When school groups stop in front of the Meyuhas home, with an Israeli flag flying from a window, they’ll be told about the place where the project of the return to the City of David and the dispossession of the Palestinians began.</p> \n<p>Instead of protesting the prize to Be’eri, one should embark on a journey to reshape the Jews’ connection to the soil in a way that respects the history of the place and its inhabitants, thereby continuing the path of Yosef Meyuhas.</p> \n<p>Yuval Evri is a sociologist and culture researcher at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies.</p>",

        "text":["<p>STOCKHOLM – Jewish culture is reigniting interest across Europe, and one of the interesting facets of this cultural revival is the collaboration between Jewish communities and other religious and ethnic groups. Cooperation is taking place especially in recent years in Sweden between Paideia – the European Institute for Jewish Studies and the Muslim-oriented Folk High School. Work between the two has recently shifted gears.</p> \n<p>“There is renewed interest in Jewish heritage,” says Prof. Fania Oz-Salzberger of the University of Haifa’s School of Law, who is also Paideia’s director. “There is study and awareness, museology, literature and film festivals, study groups and new institutes.”</p> \n<p>The story of Stockholm-based Paideia involves G&ouml;ran Persson, Sweden’s prime minister in the late 1990s, who decided to investigate neutral Sweden’s problematic role during the Holocaust. His venture included a committee of inquiry into Jewish property in Sweden after World War II, a new public authority for Holocaust education, and a book about the Holocaust commissioned by the government and sent free to hundreds of thousands of households. Persson also initiated the founding of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, an international body dealing with remembrance, education and research.</p> \n<p>“Paideia is also a product of that era,” says Noa Hermele, the institute’s deputy director. “The Swedish parliament decided to establish a European institute for Jewish studies, and the government and the Foreign Ministry pushed for it to be pan-European, not solely Swedish. Its primary mandate is to strengthen Jewish culture in Europe and the heart of activities is the one-year study program for 25 participants from Europe.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said the participants include people active in education, culture, communications and academia, and not all are necessarily Jews.</p> \n<p>The latest development is a new program based on studies of Jewish texts. Adult education is highly developed in Sweden and includes hundreds of institutions, some of which are special in that they offer open courses. It was only a question of time before Paideia would expand beyond the community house model and offer open courses of its own. However, the location of the learning and the partners are surprising: Paideia partnered with a Swedish Muslim institute, a popular Folk High School located in the suburb of Kista, northwest of Stockholm.</p> \n<p>The relationship between the two institutions began a decade ago, when a Muslim Folk High School was founded and Paideia members contributed their experience in adult education. “It’s not an interfaith dialogue in the narrow sense,” says Hermele. “There is a practical need here, not just words and slogans.”</p> \n<p>The adult education center is unique, being the only one with a Muslim profile. “The place serves an area in which tens of thousands of people live,” says &Aring;ke Larsson, the deputy director. “The largest group is Muslims from Africa and the Middle East.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>About 80 percent of students in Shista are Muslims. “The school’s goal is to foster a secure Muslim identity that can be part of Swedish culture, which is one of the most secular in the world,” says Larsen. “In Sweden, despite having many immigrants, there is a cultural difficulty in accepting people for whom religion has great significance. Our students also engage in the less-known sides of Swedish society. The connection with Paideia will expose parts of Europe and Sweden they aren’t familiar with. The groups from both schools will mix through the students, teachers, educational activities and even administrative elements.”</p> \n<p>Useless panels</p> \n<p>“Paideia’s open courses opened a number of weeks ago,” says Hermele. “We still have the 25 students from across Europe, as in the past 15 years, but this year there are also 25 Swedish students joining the Hebrew classes, as well as a class of our students which we added to existing classes in Shista. They learn a basic course to complete a matriculation exam alongside a discourse about religion, culture and history through a dialogue with students from the Muslim institution.”</p> \n<p>The partnership between the two institutions also includes Jewish instructors teaching at the Muslim Folk High School and plans like a course about interpreting the Koran and the Torah, joint learning by Jewish, Muslim and Christian students in both places on matters related to the different cultures.</p> \n<p>Oz-Salzberger connects the establishment of the new Folk High School to deep-seated developments in Europe. “In recent years I ran around Europe and sat on endless, useless panels of interfaith dialogue,” she recalls. “They place me on a stage together with a Muslim theologian and a German professor, and expect us to make love and peace. The first time I felt that something could be different was in Sweden, actually in Malmo. To my surprise, a Muslim Imam sat in the audience with a host of his students, including women in burkas and men in traditional dress. I told myself something was happening here. Here, it’s not about a token Muslim but rather a teacher with students.”</p> \n<p>She says that she later discovered in Stockholm that the Swedes had found a practical, much more effective approach than all the European bleeding hearts – a bottom-up creation of education that transcends religion and culture, with Jews, Muslims and other students learning together. “It’s a grass-roots, practical movement that is conducting an ongoing educational process, not just one-off conferences.</p> \n<p>“There are two completely different clocks ticking. One is the clock of xenophobia, anti-Semitism and white supremacy theories. Regretfully, it is presented in the Israeli press as the only clock working. However, there is a totally different clock – that of the new Jewish Golden Age.”</p> \n<p>She says that Jewish renewal has popped up in places we thought had died long ago, like Spain, Catalonia, Poland and Hungary. “In these and many other places, Jews returned and the youth among them are doing everything that creative youth do in the 21st century. Jewish culture was and is accessible to the entire world thanks to enormous breakthroughs of creativity. We are at the peak of such a breakout.”</p> \n<p>Oz-Salzberger says her job is to work on the side of the good clock, the clock of creativity. She speaks of courses in Jewish history for Muslim students and Muslim history for Jewish students, and not only about general discussions about the dangers of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. “Such courses are more than dialogue,” she adds. “They can be antidotes.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Let us begin with the story of one bit of graffiti on the walls of the Florentin neighborhood of south Tel Aviv. In January, the scribbles appeared on a wall and in less than three days a group of unknown people who forged a strange alliance of liberating evil between them –&nbsp;covered the walls of Florentin with abusive graffiti against the African migrants and refugees.</p> \n<p>“The infiltrators are a cancer,” “deportation now,” “this is not Africa, the people demand deportation,” “don’t despair, the deportation is soon,” and as it seemed impossible not to hate Arabs too: “Terrorists should be killed, infiltrators must be deported.”</p> \n<p>These statements aroused a response and were quickly covered up in a variety of ways, usually by replacing the word “infiltrator” with the word “racism,” so the corrected graffiti appeared as: “Racism is cancer.” On one wall, at 11 Florentin Street, a multi-stage battle took place: On December 3 the first writing appeared: “Infiltrators = Cancer.” On December 5, the first change was made: “The infiltrators are people, Racism = Cancer.” On December 26, a second change was made: A partial erasure left a somewhat ungrammatical message once again calling “infiltrators cancer,” with the addition of “don’t despair, the deportation is near.”</p> \n<p>On December 29, a third variation appeared: All the graffiti was covered over with paint and hearts, with a title was painted above it that said: “WE R 1.” Alongside it in pink, the words &quot;Love replaces hate,&quot; were scrawled. On Abarbanel Street, a surprising twist appeared. The word infiltrators was replaced and the graffiti read: “Corporations are cancer,” and “Jerusalem is now for everyone.”</p> \n<p>The person who is following the political graffiti in the small Florentin neighborhood and who has put together a file documenting it is Zipa Kempinski, a journalist and former senior editor at the Hadashot and Maariv newspapers. For five and a half years she has been wandering the beloved neighborhood where she has lived since 1993. In an archive dated and indexed on her computer, she has collected about 50,000 pictures of graffiti snapped by cellphone.</p> \n<p>“I am a researcher on my own behalf,” she said in an interview with Haaretz. “A bit in the spirit of journalism, maybe even a micro-local paper. I stand at a certain spot on the street and record.”</p> \n<p>For years Kempinski has passed through the streets of Florentin, sat in her favorite cafe, gone to the neighborhood grocery store – all as a matter of routine. But at the end of September 2011, the framework of her comfortable life changed drastically. A tragedy happened in her family and a favorite relative passed away.</p> \n<p>I didn’t know what to do, I couldn’t sit at home, she says. “The sorrow and the pain and the shock shook me so much that I was unable to do anything,” Kempinski said.</p> \n<p>“I was in shock and began wandering around the streets of Florentin. Walking, walking, walking. Automatically walking. Slowly I was taken in by the graffiti. There is a feeling of revelation when you walk alone and suddenly notice a picture that captures your eye. There is something arousing in it. I took out my cellphone from my pocket and began to photograph.”</p> \n<p>“The day-to-day photography was random. I wandered, observed. With time the pictures accumulated, and phenomena were revealed. My view, my 'if I try to escape it,' remains in the end a journalistic view, pointed and focused. There are days I take 300 pictures. Let’s say 10 of them are worth something? That’s pure profit on my part,” she says.</p> \n<p>A dialogue of defacement</p> \n<p>Last month, the Red House (the Sheikh Murad House) an alternative cultural center in the Shapira section of south Tel Aviv, opened a solo exhibition of Kempinski's work. The exhibition, entitled “The House is Burning and Grandma is Brushing her Hair,” was at the invitation of Oren Fisher, the center's director. Kempinski hung a few of her most intense photographic investigations of the graffiti. The timing was not a coincidence, because the exhibition marks 50 years of the occupation.</p> \n<p>In her clusters of photographs hung on the walls, Kempinski tries to show the efforts to erase the injustices of the occupation alongside the additions, such as hatred of the stranger, expressions of nationalism and racism that have spread in Israeli society.</p> \n<p>“It’s pathetic to think that my exhibition will be effective. Certainly it will not help the family of Lubna Munir al-Hanash, who was shot in the head on January 23, 2013. The graffiti concerning her shocked me.”</p> \n<p>According to an investigation by B’Tselem, al-Hanash, 21-years-old at the time, visited her relative Suad Jarah, resident of the Al-Aroub refugee camp. They walked the paths of the garden of the nearby technical college and at around 2:30 P.M. in the direction of the college gate, which is on Route 60. From there, al-Hanash was supposed to go home.</p> \n<p>But when they were about 100 meters from the gate, shots were fired at them. Jarah noticed the soldier who was shooting at them as he stood alongside the road on the other side of the gate. Al-Hanash was wounded in her head and Jarah in her hand. They were evacuated separately to the al-Ahali Hospital in Hebron, where al-Hanash died of her injuries.</p> \n<p>The B’Tselem report states that Lubna’s father, Munir al-Hanash, petitioned the High Court of Justice on April 10, 2014, with B’Tselem, seeking an order the Military Adjutant General to decide whether to put those responsible for his daughter’s death on trial. On June 29, 2014, the military prosecutor closed the case without putting the soldier who shot al-Hanash on trial.</p> \n<p>“The story of the killing of Lubna al-Hanash was very important to me,” says Kempinski. The wall devoted to this tragic story is one of the most powerful in the exhibition, and it is hard to look away from it. “The first time I ran into the story of the shooting of al-Hanash by an Israeli soldier was in graffiti painted on the wall of Zevulun Street, on February 11, 2013, 20 days after she was killed. Her image and the text were printed in orange-gold on the dark gray wall. I saw, photographed and continued on walking.”</p> \n<p>“Two weeks later, on February 26, I saw a different message, this time on Hashuk Street. This one told of the killing of Ouday Kamal Darwish, 21 years-old, by IDF soldiers on January 12, 2013 in the southern Hebron hills, near Meitar, when he tried to pass through the separation barrier. On March 11, at the end of Levinsky Street, I saw another message, about Anwar al-Mamluk, also 21-years-old, who was shot by IDF soldiers in the Gaza Strip on January 11, 2013. His brother, who was not injured in the incident, said that Anwar was studying for a test in an open area when he was killed. On March 30, 2013, I ran into on Markolet Street, a message that tells of the death of Samir Awad, 16, on January 15,2013, who soldiers shot with live fire alongside the separation fence near Budrus.”</p> \n<p>In May 2013, Kempinski noticed more and more similar graffiti in many places around the neighborhood, most of which concerned Lubna al-Hanash. “Some of the graffiti was already erased or ruined, some was complete. On Jaffa Road her face was spray painted, on Hahalutzim Street someone drew green tears streaming from her eyes and made a green X on the text, and later, on July 26, someone covered her eyes and mouth in black.”</p> \n<p>Since then more and more pictures were added. Another one was covered up on Zevulun Street on July 7, because the entire wall was painted in white. “Only recently someone printed, in exactly the same place, two cats’ heads. A few days later, on July 13, I noticed the orange-gold writing was covered in red and the drawing of her head had horns added. Since then, the wall has been painted gray and there is no sign of the message.”</p> \n<p>“Another piece of graffiti on Zevulun Street was painted in black. I saw it for the first time May 18, 2013, when it had already been defaced and the writing erased. In October 2013, I passed by again and saw that someone had pasted eyes on al-Hanash. Her look was piercing, but in December 2013 someone took out her eyes. It looked like abuse to me.”</p> \n<p>Kempinski did not succeed in learning who created the original graffiti about al-Hanash, with the English-language text. But she continued to follow the fate of the graffiti.</p> \n<p>What did you document?</p> \n<p>“In the graffiti in which the picture of Lubna and the three young people shot in 2013 appeared, the images of the young people remained but the text was completely erased. In this specific graffiti, the erasure was aimed at the content and someone returned to the picture to erase it. Some of the graffiti suffered damage from time and the weather, but some continued to be covered up and erased intentionally. Because the defacement was done in different ways, I assume it was not the same person who erased it then.</p> \n<p>&quot;Either way, as far as I’m concerned, the layers of erasure and covering, especially of the details of the shooting and killing, are more than the erasure and covering up of graffiti, they are an intentional cover up of the horrible actions that the occupation has given birth to, in order that we won’t know about them.”</p> \n<p>The “infiltrators” series in the exhibition was photographed in January and within three days, in dozens of places, the neighborhood was filled with graffiti: “Infiltrators equal cancer,” says Kempinski. “The House is Burning and Grandma is Brushing her Hair,” is a Romanian saying.</p> \n<p>“This statement, which is so right about Israel too, was imprinted into me and was appropriate for the name of the exhibition,” she says.</p> \n<p>“The word occupation was erased from consciousness, so the goal of the exhibition is to show how this term was erased on the street. We don’t want to know, don’t want to hear and also don’t want to allow others to talk about it. I want to talk about it. It is important to talk about it. What is this, defeatism? Because the left is a minority, we must actually speak clearly. I am not Haredi, not a settler, I am not Mizrahi, I don’t need to apologize for that and not only do I have the right to speak, I have the obligation to speak,” says Kempinski, born 60 years ago in Rehovot. She studied industrial design the Holon Institute of Technology and studied literature at Tel Aviv University, but never finished her degree because in 1984 she went to work in journalism. “With great sorrow I see what has happened to the press, I don’t know why I still care so much.</p> \n<p>&quot;I admit that I’m naive, but I think that journalism is done out of a motivation to fix the world, to influence and change the situation. In the years I taught journalism I noticed that young people do not want to change the world so much. What interests them is actually to become part of the system and make a living.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Twenty years before “Geder Haya” (“Borderlife”), Israeli author Dorit Rabinyan’s novel about a romance between an Israeli Jewish woman and a Palestinian man — which was denounced by the Education Ministry, became a best-seller in Israel and will be released in English on April 25 (as “All the Rivers”) — there was “Inta Omri.” Published in 1994, it is based on a relationship that its author, the Israeli poet and writer Smadar Herzfeld, had with a Palestinian man, and it is immeasurably more powerful and revealing than Rabinyan’s pleasant, adroit, apologetic and overly literary novel.</p> \n<p>But while “All the Rivers” kicked up a political fuss last year that inadvertently boosted sales, “Inta Omri” met with rage that silenced Herzfeld for a number of years. From the right, someone threatened to throw acid on her, while the left-wing literary critic Ariana Melamed, for one, called for a boycott and said the book was pornographic and racist.”</p> \n<p>“It was too barbaric, extreme and crazy,” says Herzfeld today. “I wasn’t broken, but it had a shell-shock effect and I had to forget about writing for a time. I had to heal.”</p> \n<p>She focused her attention on building a family, marrying and divorcing twice, and adopted two babies from Vietnam. Both are serving in the army.</p> \n<p>Herzfeld’s next book was about her spiritual journey in South America a decade earlier, seven years after “Inta Omri.”</p> \n<p>Now 65, she is reissuing the novel, having reacquired the rights a few years ago.</p> \n<p>“I felt I didn’t fight for its innocence, and decided to give it a second chance,” she says at a meeting in Talbiyeh Cafe, in the Jerusalem neighborhood by the same name. She has lived there for years, close to Hansen House. Parts of the novel are set in the building, a former hospital for people with Hansen’s disease (leprosy) that was recently renovated.</p> \n<p>It’s likely that “Inta Omri”’s attackers didn’t read the book. While it is set in the waning days of the first intifada, the narrative soon pivots from politics to the stormy emotional tie between its two stubborn, lost, educated main characters, both of them outsiders in their respective communities. It is precisely the nonjudgmental quality of the story that makes a possible allegory for life here. In any event, the novel’s sex scenes disqualify it for study in high school, so Education Minister Naftali Bennett is free to ignore it, unlike “Borderlife.”</p> \n<p>Herzfeld notes that the novel blends her experiences with imagination. “The romance happened, and we did both work in stores near Jerusalem,” she recalls. “And he had scars on his back from torture in a Jordanian jail, and the hikes together and the like. But, it is first and foremost a love story between two people who are miserable types. They are people who fail in life.”</p> \n<p>When asked about Melamed’s assertions of racism, Herzfeld says the critic accused her of having an elitist, colonialist attitude. “It was a wild attack,” Herzfeld says.</p> \n<p>“It is convenient for Herzfeld to ignore that my tough critique was based on the content and language of her book,” Melamed said recently, adding, “Decent people would do well not to read it.”</p> \n<p>Herzfeld says she wrote the book in “an outburst,” completing it within “a month, perhaps six weeks. ... I don’t even remember when I sat down to write it. It was suddenly there.”</p> \n<p>A superficial glance at the book can be misleading. It begins with some mutual violence between the couple, which externalizes the suspicion and nationalist hostility, for example the following insulting sentences said by the woman at a caf&eacute;: “’What did you do?’ I shouted at the Arab, wiping my lips with my sleeve, wiping his skin from my lips. ... ‘Do you always touch Jewish girls?’ I was right on the mark. I know that I had hit him in the heart.” However, these nationalist sadomasochistic scenes fade away quickly, and the couple’s love for each other turns personal and deep, devoid of any racism and certainly of pornography, too — unless by the word “pornography” one means simply sexual relations (which are in this case very creative). And perhaps the somewhat pessimistic end also arouses objection among those who hoped for a speedy peace in those days at the start of the Oslo Accords era.</p> \n<p>Herzfeld notes that the novel’s title is from the famous Umm Kulthum song. She recalls falling in love with the Egyptian singer through the cassettes of a friend. Umm Kulthum, the daughter of an imam, dressed and lived like a nun, she says. “‘Inta Omri’ is a secular love song, but her personality and the style of the song connected to my religious side,” she says. “My endless love for this woman remains to this day.”</p> \n<p>Herzfeld says that her own Arab boyfriend, like Omar in her book, was considered a traitor in his home village, in this case a refugee camp. She says she doesn’t know what happened to him. “It is a love story that ended and became a literary work.”</p> \n<p>In the book, Herzfeld describes submitting to his will. “That situation of obedience gave me pleasure,” she wrote. “It mesmerized me from within. It was like alcohol for me — a means to lose control.” She says today losing control is part of the story.</p> \n<p>Herzfeld says she is pleased with her choice of Eli Hirsch to edit the new edition. “He didn’t touch the words, but he divided the book into chapters, giving it a kind of breathing pace.”</p> \n<p>Sex and the Torah ark</p> \n<p>But before “Inta Omri,” there was “Shoshanei Duma” (“Roses of Death,” Herzfeld’s only published book of poetry. (Duma is a nickname for death, a place of silence, and in the Talmud a reference to a woman who is suspected of adultery.) Few have noticed the book’s rare innovation and magic. One poem, “Your Angels Come to My Lips,” exemplifies Herzfeld’s unique mix of sex and holiness, with snakes — also in their sexual meaning — and angels come to her together (and both, angel and snake, meet in the word seraph).</p> \n<p>She says the foundation for her poetry dates back to her student days at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the 1970s.</p> \n<p>“Those were the years when I moved between there and the world of my childhood in Tel Aviv. I studied Jewish philosophy and I was really attracted to the Catholic world. At a certain stage I worked at the YMCA library, where I met one of my best friends until today, an Armenian. I became part of a literary group called Marot (“views”), in which everyone was interested in religion. We all came from completely secular homes. Our group of Jewish poets then was quite a novelty.”</p> \n<p>She says the group included Moise (Moshe) Ben Harush, and Binyamin Shvili.</p> \n<p>“There was also my Armenian friend, who would write in English,” she says. “And [the poet and artist] Amira Hess — although she was not part of the hard core. And we were all a little crazy, crazy about poems, drunk on God.”</p> \n<p>In “Your Angels Come to My Lips,” Herzfeld compares her body during the act of sex to the Holy Ark. Today, the writer still sees a connection between sex and holiness.</p> \n<p>“My life as a woman always moved in a dichotomy between the celibate side and the public celebratory side, the side of ‘free love,’” she says. “I had bold, very physical, very dramatic, tales of love. On the other hand, I have been my own master for a large part of my life, living alone, deciding for myself, and I need it. I am my own man and woman.”</p>",

His boss, hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, was on the line.&nbsp;“I hear you’re going around saying I’m a white supremacist,” Mr. Mercer said. “That’s ridiculous.” ...&nbsp;“Those weren’t my exact words,” Mr. Magerman said he told Mr. Mercer, stammering and then explaining his concerns about Mr. Trump’s policy positions, rhetoric and cabinet choices. “If what you’re doing is harming the country then you have to stop.”  &quot;Until now, however, nobody within the tight-lipped hedge fund has gone public with a grievance.&nbsp;“His views show contempt for the social safety net that he doesn’t need, but many Americans do,” said Mr. Magerman, 48 years old, during an interview with The Wall Street Journal at the Dairy Caf&eacute;, a kosher restaurant he owns in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. “Now he’s using the money I helped him make to implement his worldview” by supporting Mr. Trump and encouraging that “government be shrunk down to the size of a pinhead.”&nbsp;Mr. Magerman, a 20-year Renaissance veteran who helped design the fund’s trading systems, says he is speaking only for himself, and that there is no sign of a broad insurrection at the firm.&quot;  &quot;Mr. Magerman makes millions of dollars a year, drives a Tesla and says he gives more than $10 million in charity annually. A research scientist, he is one of 100 partners at the firm, but he isn’t one of Renaissance’s most senior executives.&nbsp;“I’d like to think I’m speaking out in a way that won’t risk my job, but it’s very possible they could fire me,” he said. “My wife isn’t comfortable with me jeopardizing my job, but she realizes it’s my prerogative and agrees with my sentiments.”&nbsp;Mr. Magerman has one idea that would reduce the power of people like Mr. Mercer. He said he was thinking about reaching out to Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) to craft proposals to reduce speculative trading, which presumably would curtail Renaissance’s profits.&nbsp;“This is my life’s work—I ran a group that wrote the trading system they still use,” he said. “But I feel relieved I’m now doing something, and if they fire me, maybe it’s for the best.”&quot; [WSJ]  --Flashback: &quot;The Controversial David Magerman&quot; by Simon Van Zuylen-Wood in September 2013:&nbsp;&quot;Wealthy Main Liner David Magerman has given millions to Philadelphia’s Jewish community. The Jewish community is thankful. Sort of.&quot; [PhillyMag]  DNC WATCH -- Yesterday, at the final debate ahead of the election for Chairman of the Democratic National Committee taking place on Saturday, Rep. Keith Ellison addressed past comments, including praise for&nbsp;Louis Farrakhan, controversial&nbsp;views towards the Jewish community and his position on the U.S.&nbsp;- Israel relationship, that have&nbsp;caused many establishment Jewish Democrats to oppose his candidacy.  “These are false allegations,” Ellison said when asked about his past comments thirteen&nbsp;minutes into the live TV debate in Atlanta, “and that's why I have 300 rabbis and Jewish community leaders who have signed a letter supporting me I have a long, strong history of interfaith dialogue, interfaith communication, and that's why in my own community, I have strong support from the Jewish community. So these are smears and we're fighting back every day, but we're fighting back with people who know us. I just want to say, it is critical that we speak up against this anti-Semitism because right now, you have Jewish cemeteries being defaced and desecrated. &nbsp;Right now, you have Jewish institutions getting bomb threats. We have to stand with the Jewish community right here, right now, four square, and that's what the Democratic Party is all about.”  Ellison on Democratic concerns of his Israel record: “Here's what I say, I voted for $27 billion in bilateral aid to Israel over the course of about six or seven votes. I have been to the region many times and sat down with members of the Knesset and worked with them. I've been a stalwart champion of the two-state solution, which means that we've got to have Israel and a Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security. And I have made that a very key cornerstone of my advocacy I believe that the U.S.-Israel relationship is special and important. I've stood for that principle my whole service and my whole career. And you can trust when I'm the DNC chair that that relationship will continue. We will maintain the bipartisan consensus of U.S. support for Israel if I'm the DNC chair.” [YouTube]&nbsp;  INTERVIEW -- JI's Aaron Magid spoke with&nbsp;NORPAC&nbsp;National President Ben Chouake&nbsp;who spoke out against&nbsp;attacks on Sen. Bob Menendez for questioning&nbsp;David Friedman, while implying concerns around dual loyalty,&nbsp;during the&nbsp;Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last week.  &quot;Out of all the Democratic Senators, by far, Senator Menendez posed the most generous and friendly questions to Mr. Friedman,&quot; Chouake told Jewish Insider in a phone interview on Wednesday. &quot;He was trying to help Mr. Friedman explain himself and give him a lay-up so that he could bat it out of the park. The intention of Senator Menendez was to get reassurance from Mr. Friedman that he could do his job given his passion...&nbsp;It’s horrible and inappropriate because Senator Menendez is the exact opposite of anti-Semitic. I am working with this guy for 20 years. He is the go to person in the Senate. He is the person who spends day and night fighting for us. How do you accuse someone like that of anti-Semitism? The guy took a bullet for us on Iran.&quot;&nbsp;  Chouake on ADL's deleted tweet criticizing Menendez: &quot;Why did they delete it unless they thought they were wrong. You don’t delete stuff that you think is right. The guy asked a question. I don’t know if it was perfectly posed or not. His questioning to Mr. Friedman was very friendly. By far the most friendly Democrat on the panel. I think he was trying to help him. You have to look at everything in the context of what it is and the person who was asking. If I asked the same question, would you call me an anti-Semite? So, why are you calling him an anti-Semite?&quot;&nbsp;  On&nbsp;Friedman as Ambassador to Israel: &quot;I support him because he is committed to the issue and will do a good job. He is also a member of NORPAC. The problem was that he speaks awfully harshly about certain things. He apologized for it and that’s good. His heart is great. I like him and know the guy.&quot; Read the entire interview here [Jewish Insider]&nbsp;  DRIVING THIS WEEKEND: “Pence, Adelson to meet privately” by Theodore Schleifer: “...a meeting that cements the Republican billionaire's place as a key adviser to the new administration.

Eric Greitens (R) in clearing brush.” [WashPost]&nbsp;  -- From WH pool report: “Anti-Defamation League Regional Director Karen Aroesty spoke to Pence briefly just before he hopped onto the bed of the pickup. She said. &quot;I want to thank you for being here and thank the president for his words. We look forward to doing whatever we can to help. We're a resource for you if you want. Being here today is important for a lot of people.&quot; &quot;I didn't want to miss coming,&quot; Pence said As Pence walked away from delivering remarks he greeted people who had come to the cemetery to volunteer. Many thanked him for being there and the message that sent.

Keith Ellison (D-MN), who is running for Chairman of the Democratic National Committee on Saturday, calls on the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to take swift action against the bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers (JCC) across the country. “We urge the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to swiftly assess the situation and to advise Congress on what specific steps are being taken, or will be taken, to deter such threats from being made, to identify and prosecute the perpetrators for violations of federal criminal laws, and to enable JCCs to enhance security measures such as physical barriers and guards, in the event that an individual seeks to act upon these threats,” the letter states. “This is not an idle concern, given that there have been at least three casualty-causing attacks at JCCs or other Jewish institutions in the last two decades. This is a national problem and, as such, it requires a national solution.” the letter notes. [JewishInsider]&nbsp;  &quot;Clearly, the Trump administration has a problem with Jews&quot; by Bernard-Henri Levy: &quot;I had no idea how right I was, a month ago, when I wrote in The New York Times that American Jews should be wary of their new President...&nbsp;At best, Mr. Netanyahu will go down as a very distant relative of Joseph making an alliance with Pharaoh to protect his people.&nbsp;But we know how that story ends: just as a new pharaoh &quot;arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph&quot; and reduced his descendants to slavery, so, sooner or later, a new president will arise over America.&nbsp;Leading, according to the Talmud, to two equally tragic scenarios.&nbsp;Either the newcomer is indeed a new pharaoh and will associate the Jews with the predecessor whose cause and destiny they so recklessly embraced.&nbsp;Or, as the sages say, he is the same pharaoh but has changed sides. Translating this into present-day terms, the unpredictable Mr. Trump becomes another Mr. Trump; he makes a 180-degree perspective shift in his vision of the Jewish world; and he turns against an Israel about which, at bottom, he cares not a whit and which, therefore, has everything to fear, beginning right here and now, from his cynical &quot;pragmatism.&quot;&quot; [CNN] A CNN panel debates the president’s anti-Semitism trump card: His daughter Ivanka [WashPost]  “In Israel, Some Wonder Where The Outrage Is Over U.S. Anti-Semitic Acts” by Daniel Estrin: “Netanyahu's muted response has drawn criticism, including from Yehuda Bauer, the academic advisor of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial and museum. &quot;He follows President Trump,&quot; Bauer says. &quot;He did not react immediately.&quot; A former adviser to Netanyahu, Dore Gold, says he doesn't see anything wrong with Netanyahu's response. &quot;There has been a tendency to politicize this whole issue of anti-Semitism in America,&quot; he says. &quot;Opponents of the Trump administration want to blame it for anti-Semites coming out of the woodwork and attacking Jewish institutions. I think we should all be united in our struggle against anti-Semitism, and not look for a fall guy for what is happening.&quot;” [NPR]&nbsp;  TALK OF THE TOWN: “Anti-Defamation League Receives Bomb Threat at National Headquarters in New York” by Roseanne Colletti: “The bomb threat to the Third Avenue office was anonymous, according to ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt Police say they got a call about it shortly before noon.

Cuomo called the pattern a &quot;national crisis&quot; and directed the New York State Police to coordinate with federal and local law enforcement in the investigation. &quot;We are treating these incidents for what they are -- as crimes -- and we will not allow them to go unpunished,&quot; Cuomo said in a statement.” [NBC4]&nbsp;  HAPPENING TODAY: Governor Andrew Cuomo will hold a roundtable with Jewish Community and interfaith leaders at the Museum of Jewish Heritage at 2:00 pm EST followed by a press statement.  &quot;Bill Kristol: Hill Republicans asking if they can survive four years of Trump&quot; by Tim Skoczek:&nbsp;&quot;I think if you talk privately to Republicans on the Hill, it's like, 'Oh my God, what is going on? Can we survive this for four years?'&quot; Kristol told David Axelrod on &quot;The Axe Files&quot; ...&nbsp;A well-known proponent of a muscular US foreign policy, Kristol also expressed a deep concern with Trump's &quot;America first&quot; philosophy, which Kristol said signals America's withdrawal from an unstable world in need of its leadership. The reassurance Kristol found in some of Trump's Cabinet appointments, he said, has dissipated as Trump navigates the complexities of foreign diplomacy with a worrying degree of impulsiveness and bombast. &quot;I've got to say, this first month has been very unnerving to me and to many, many others,&quot; Kristol said.&quot; [CNN]&nbsp;  TRUMP TEAM: “Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Sees Tax Overhaul by August” by Rebecca Ballhaus and Nick Timiraos: “In his first week on the job, Mr. Mnuchin has spoken with around 10 foreign counterparts and other leaders The secretary has been in close contact with National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, his former colleague at Goldman Sachs Group Inc...

Sources have told POLITICO that the secretary of state was never consulted when Trump, in an appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, dropped the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians.

Currently enjoying the summer sun in Sydney, Australia, the PM announced he will be flying to Moscow in two weeks time. He will meet with President Putin to discuss Israel's&nbsp;concerns about Syria and Iran. The Russian trip will be the sixth that Netanyahu is taking during February and March. After London, DC, Singapore and Sydney this month, Netanyahu will be spending most of March abroad as well, traveling to Beijing and then back to DC for AIPAC after visiting Moscow. All of the trips have huge strategic and economic significance, but as a senior political figure told Kafe Knesset today, “it looks like Netanyahu is really trying not to be here.” In the wake of the ongoing criminal investigations and political rivals who are waiting to attack, Netanyahu appears to prefer the smiling photo ops with world leaders.

        "text":["<p>Israeli archaeologists have stumbled upon the mother of all garbage dumps: a massive landfill from early Roman times that may have been the result of the most sophisticated trash collection system in antiquity.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Layer upon layer of waste that was efficiently collected, piled up and buried some 2,000 years ago has been dug up on the slopes of the Kidron valley, just outside the Roman-era walls of Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Coins and fragments of pottery show the landfill was in use for about seven decades, from the beginning of the first century CE until the period of the Great Jewish Revolt against the Romans, which ended with the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, says Yuval Gadot, a Tel Aviv University archaeologist who led the dig.</p> \n<p>The landfill, which was excavated in 2013-2014 in conjunction with the Israel Antiquities Authority, rose to a towering 70 meters in height, from the bottom of the valley to the walls of the city. It was quite unusual in its size, Gadot says.</p> \n<p>It seems uncommon, he says. &quot;If you look at history, usually people don’t do that. They usually lived with their garbage, or they used it at some point, or it just sat out there in the street,” he says.</p> \n<p>Going back thousands of years before the Roman era, as far back as the Neolithic, humans would dig pits for their garbage. They might collect it for later use as fertilizer, or use it to level terrain when constructing new buildings – both practices are still done today. But ancient examples of large-scale collection and long-term storage of trash in a landfill are scarce, Gadot says.</p> \n<p>Down the drain in Rome</p> \n<p>Beyond Jerusalem, across the rest of the Roman Empire, garbage disposal was a chronic problem, especially in large cities.</p> \n<p>Rome has the Monte Testaccio, an artificial mound still visible today made up of millions of fragments of discarded amphorae. In this case, it isn't that the pottery pieces were collected from around the city – this was where the adjacent port on the River Tiber dumped trash. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>In Rome and Pompeii, trash was sometimes disposed of in the sewage system, which was commonly used to get rid of anything undesirable. Even the bodies of the third-century emperor Heliogabalus, who was murdered by his guards, and of the Christian martyr Saint Sebastian were dumped in Rome’s main sewer, the Cloaca Maxima.</p> \n<p>But most of the domestic trash was simply thrown into the street, usually after dark and with little regard for passersby, so much that the satirical poet Juvenal remarked that one should always make a will before going out for dinner, “because different forms of death can rain down from any open window.”</p> \n<p>When a young and ambitious Vespasian – later an efficient administrator, ruthless repressor of the Jewish Revolt and emperor – was in charge of city maintenance, he failed so spectacularly to clear the streets that, as punishment, the emperor Caligula (not the sanest of Roman rulers) had him covered in mud.</p> \n<p>Thou shalt take out the trash</p> \n<p>In Jerusalem, however, it seems that the system worked. The landfill located on the eastern slopes of the city is not just impressive for its size: its alternating layers of ancient trash and soil suggest there was a deliberate attempt to systematically cover the garbage to prevent smells and deter scavengers, Gadot says.</p> \n<p>It isn't that the people of ancient Jerusalem organized to collectively and obediently throw their dross over the city walls. “It looks like there was a mechanism in place that cleared the streets, cleared the houses, using donkeys to collect and throw away the garbage,” Gadot speculates.</p> \n<p>The system may have developed out of a combination of Roman administrative knowhow and a growing observance among Jews of religious purity norms, researchers theorize.</p> \n<p>Jews in early Roman Jerusalem were obsessed with purity and impurity, as shown by the proliferation of mikvehs (ritual baths), the frequent use of stone vessels (which were believed to be impervious to impurity) and the near absence of imported pottery.</p> \n<p>“It could be that it became a norm in Jerusalem that you have to take out the garbage, because it’s impure and has to be brought outside the city,” Gadot suggests. “It’s not the municipality saying so: God says so, and that makes it easier.”</p> \n<p>Gadot hesitates to say whether Jerusalemites were the first in history to organize such a large-scale waste management system.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know if it’s the first, but it’s unique,” he told Haaretz in a recent interview. “Maybe there’s another landfill in Rome that was for domestic use, but at the moment we don’t know about it.”</p> \n<p>One problem is also that archaeologists usually prefer to excavate large, impressive ruins rather than mundane sites like garbage landfills.</p> \n<p>Fish meals in a Jewish city</p> \n<p>Most of the garbage in the landfill is leftovers from “a typical middle-class lunch or dinner at the time,” including animal bones, charred remains of grains, olive pits and wood from household ovens.</p> \n<p>The picture that emerges is of a fairly wealthy city, with plenty of meat to go around and even fish brought in from distant locations like the Mediterranean and the Sea of Galilee.</p> \n<p>According to Abra Spiciarich, a student whose MA thesis focused on the animal bones found in the landfill, the meat mostly came from goats, sheep, with a smaller proportion of cattle and chickens. This confirms that Jerusalem’s population was overwhelmingly Jewish at the time, given the complete absence of pig bones and the marks of kosher slaughtering found on many of the remains.</p> \n<p>Archaeologists also found waste from the manufacture of glass and stone vessels, which were apparently made in small household workshops in the city.</p> \n<p>But very few bronze and iron artifacts have been found, not because they weren't in use, but apparently, because they were being recycled.</p> \n<p>“It seems that any material that they could recycle, they collected separately and it never reached the landfill. It was melted or reused,” Gadot says. “Maybe at the domestic level they sold scraps of metal to someone who specialized in that.”</p> \n<p>A Roman mop-up operation?</p> \n<p>Not everyone agrees with Gadot’s reading of the site.</p> \n<p>“We really don’t know what caused this accumulation,” says Alon de Groot, an Israel Antiquities Archaeologist who has participated in excavations in the area just above the landfill.</p> \n<p>That neighborhood, today known as the City of David, is considered the oldest part of the city and its original nucleus. De Groot noted that the area was destroyed when the Romans captured Jerusalem at the end of the revolt. Later, they used the ruined buildings as a quarry to reconstruct the city as a Roman settlement called Aelia Capitolina.</p> \n<p>“Then they just cleared up the whole hill, and as a result you find the garbage below, but this is not really garbage from that period: it’s mostly a result of the cleaning up of the area above after the city was destroyed,” de Groot told Haaretz in a telephone interview.</p> \n<p>Gadot says he remains convinced that the site functioned as Jerusalem’s garbage dump, arguing that if parts of the ruined city had simply been pushed down the slope, archaeologists would have found at least a few large stones used in construction, instead of just tiny pieces of pottery, bones and organic residue.</p> \n<p>Helena Roth, an archeobotanist on Gadot’s team, studied the charred remains of wood found in the landfill and compared them to samples taken from the destruction layers in the city itself. In the landfill she mostly found traces of olive and fig trees – which surrounded the city and probably provided a cheap source of fuel. In the city itself, she also found rare or imported materials like boxwood and Lebanese cedar, likely the remains of luxury furniture that was burned down with the rest of the city.</p> \n<p>The fact that the dump and city had different wood remains supports the idea that the landfill functioned as a garbage storage site, Roth says.</p> \n<p>The holiest garbage</p> \n<p>Another comparative study conducted by the Tel Aviv team was with materials found about a decade ago in a smaller landfill from the same period, very near by - just under the Temple Mount.</p> \n<p>There, a team led by archaeologists Guy Bar-Oz and Ronny Reich had found significant amounts of pigeon bones.</p> \n<p>Because these birds were often used a sacrificial animal in ancient Israel, they speculated that this dump was used to collect the remains of the cultic activities that took place at the nearby Temple. Gadot says that no pigeon bones have been found in the city dump he excavated, strengthening the theory that what was found in the northern landfill by his colleagues was indeed “holy garbage.”</p> \n<p>Click here for story: Pigeon meat is kosher.</p>",

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – The Zionist Organization of America is facing enormous backlash for its enthusiastic defense of Steve Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News and President-elect Donald Trump's appointee as chief strategist and senior advisor.</p> \n<p>Bannon is slated to attend the ZOA’s annual banquet Sunday evening, where Bernie Marcus, co-founder of The Home Depot and a prominent Trump supporter, will be honored with the group’s Louis D. Brandeis Award for Extraordinary Pro-Israel and Pro-Jewish Activism.</p> \n<p>A few large Jewish groups, including the National Council of Jewish Women and the Reform movement’s Religious Action Center, as well as J Street and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, issued statements condemning Bannon’s appointment. Many in the American Jewish community are upset, they say, not only about Bannon being given a coveted position in the coming presidential administration, but about his being invited to the banquet of a Jewish organization.</p> \n<p>Calls to protest went out on social media as soon as Bannon’s plan to attend the dinner was announced by the ZOA.&nbsp;On Wednesday and Thursday the ZOA office was inundated with calls to the point that its phone lines were overwhelmed, say some of those who called. Dozens of callers got through, according to ZOA president Mort Klein. Some tried to call and couldn’t get through or had their call cut off as soon as it was picked up, they told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>“I called because whether or not Bannon is an anti-Semite, or pro-Israel, he stands for everything that is repugnant to me:&nbsp; homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, racism, and the promotion of hatred and violence,” said Beth Levine, an attorney who lives in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.&nbsp; “I do not think he should be invited to a Jewish event or defended by a Jewish organization.”</p> \n<p>She felt spurred to call the ZOA by seeing friends’ Facebook posts saying that they had done the same.</p> \n<p>The ZOA’s Klein told Haaretz that he called back every person who phoned the ZOA to complain and left their contact information. Those he reached “were shocked it was me calling,” he said. But he dismissed their critique because they are not ZOA members. “They’re not members and they don’t support us. I speak for my membership and my board, not anyone else,” Klein said, “I don’t speak for the whole Jewish community. No one does.”</p> \n<p>Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie got through to the ZOA on Wednesday when he called. “Bannon's views are toxic and his support of Israel is no reason to ignore his dangerous positions and views against all minorities, including Jews,” Lau-Lavie, the creator of an independent New York City congregation called Lab/Shul, told Haaretz. “It's a polarizing disgrace and reflects deep lack of concern and respect to the rest of the Jewish community and the American people.” He was put through to a ZOA staffer, and got a polite reply, Lau-Lavie said.</p> \n<p>Libby Lenkinski, who works for the New Israel Fund but called the ZOA as a private citizen, said that when she saw that Bannon would be at the ZOA gala, “I felt all the rage of my ancestors boiling up. Both of my grandfathers – the Zionist pioneer and the Holocaust survivor – are rolling over in their graves today. We did not survive the Holocaust, we did not found the State of Israel, just so that less than two generations later we could cozy up to neo-Nazis,” she told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>“I will not watch that happen in the name of Judaism or Zionism without putting up a fight.” She got through and left a message with “No to Steve Bannon, no to white supremacy, no to anti-Semitism,” Lenkinski said.</p> \n<p>Some who called in, however, were supportive of the ZOA’s stance, says Klein. He estimated that more than half the calls were supportive of the ZOA position, and just under half critical.</p> \n<p>“We’ve had a ton of calls on both sides of the issue, many people thanking us for taking a stand for a man who is not an anti-Semite,” Klein said in an interview with Haaretz. “You can question Bannon’s judgment for allowing them [racists and anti-Semites] on the site, letting the ridiculous people on it, but he’s not an anti-Semite. He’s the opposite of an anti-Semite. He’s a philo-Semite.”</p> \n<p>When Bannon was first appointed on November 13, days after Trump won the election, the ZOA issued a statement welcoming his ascension.</p> \n<p>But the ZOA is almost alone among Jewish organizations in its stance. The Anti-Defamation League has been out in front in issuing statements about Trump’s racist, incendiary rhetoric throughout the presidential campaign, and has now put out statements condemning Bannon’s views.</p> \n<p>“It is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the alt right, a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists - is slated to be a senior staff member in the 'people's house,'” said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt. &quot;We call on President-elect Trump to appoint and nominate Americans committed to the well-being of all our country's people and who exemplify the values of pluralism and tolerance that makes our country great.&quot;</p> \n<p>The ZOA has publicly taken aim at the ADL for its criticism of Bannon, demanding that it retract its condemnation.</p> \n<p>A Change.org petition addressed to the heads of the Jewish Federations of North America that called to condemn Bannon's appointment on Thursday had 2,300 signatures. The JFNA issued a statement after the election congratulating the incoming president.</p> \n<p>“With hate crimes on the rise, we must address this as an issue of our collective safety. Having Stephen Bannon as a key strategist in the White House sends a clear message to hate groups that their belief system is no longer fringe, but now accepted,” says the JFNA petition’s letter.</p> \n<p>A website called “Never Shtadlanus” is keeping an accounting of dozens of Jewish organizations, including federations around the country, and listing contact information at those groups which have taken no position on Bannon’s appointment or are supportive of it, like the ZOA. Their aim, according to the website, is to encourage people to call or write to complain. Shtadlanus refers to shtadlanim, Jewish leaders appointed to curry favor with elected or royal officials, who are viewed as kowtowing at the expense of Jewish wellbeing.</p> \n<p>Other Jews on the left who take issue with Bannon’s new job are taking their protests to the streets.</p> \n<p>On Thursday members of IfNotNow, a grassroots, anti-establishment Jewish group, “stormed” the lobby of the Washington, D.C. building housing Trump’s transition team to demand that it fire Bannon.</p> \n<p>The INN is planning a major rally in New York on Sunday, when it will demonstrate outside the ZOA’s banquet after marching from Bryant Park several blocks away. On Thursday, some of its members marched on Trump Tower in protest.</p> \n<p>&quot;We're protesting because organizations like the Zionist Organization of America have an unbelievable double standard in welcoming anti-Semites because of their unwavering support for Israel,” INN leader Lizzie Horne told Haaretz. “Supporting Steve Bannon and welcoming him into Jewish organizations is exactly what ‘pro-Israel at any cost’ looks like. The Jewish community is so invested in supporting the occupation that it will cozy up to political leaders who are openly anti-Semitic, so long as they are pro-Israel,” she said.</p> \n<p>“We want to be clear that using pro-Israel [statements] to defend against accusations of anti-Semitism is unacceptable for our generation of Jews, and frankly, for our entire community. IfNotNow and our allies will not be fooled by the rhetoric floating around, and we plan to resist for our own safety and the safety of others.&quot;</p> \n<p>A letter protesting Bannon being signed by the New Israel Fund and other Jewish groups is in the works, said some who are involved in organizing it. It will be published by Monday, said one source.</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. President Donald Trump is diverting federal funds from climate-change research to job creation. Workers in Trump’s America may want to avoid breeding lobsters and shrimp, or farming, going by a new study showing that arthropod size depends on the temperature of their surroundings. The warmer the environment, the smaller the arthropod, from bees to shrimp to millipedes.</p> \n<p>In cold-blooded animals, including arthropods, body temperature depends on the ambient temperature. So does size, at least in the laboratory. When arthropods, such as insects, crustaceans and other creatures with external skeletons, are grown in warmer conditions, they usually develop more quickly, and are smaller when mature.</p> \n<p>“This biological phenomenon occurs in over 83 per cent of cold-blooded species,” wrote biologists Curtis R. Horne and Andrew G. Hirst, from Queen Mary University of London, and David Atkinson, from the University of Liverpool, in an article that was published on Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.</p> \n<p>So in a warmer world with warmer oceans, lobsters, shrimp and other crustaceans are likely to be smaller.</p> \n<p>As always in biology, the number of parameters that can affect any given characteristic, including the final size of adult shrimp or anything else, is vast. Other conditions that affect arthropod body size include the amount of oxygen in the water. But in the largest-ever analysis of data on seasonal arthropod body size variation around the world, the researchers say they found a statistically significant match to temperature, and it’s worse in the water than on dry land.</p> \n<p>“Aquatic species show approximately 2.5-fold greater reduction in size per degree-Celsius of warming than terrestrial species, supporting the hypothesis that greater oxygen limitation in water than in air forces aquatic species to exhibit greater plasticity in body size with temperature,” they write.</p> \n<p>Clearly, if arthropods shrink, it will have an ecological impact, which in turn will have an economic impact. “Arthropods are of huge economic and ecological value to humans,” said Horne. “For example, they include important species of pollinators, as well as zooplankton species, the most abundant animals in our ocean that form the basis of the food chain for commercially important fish species. It is in our interest to understand how these species will respond to warming.”</p> \n<p>It bears qualifying that each species reacts to temperature in its own way: Some are more affected than others. “In particular, aquatic species including important species of zooplankton, reduce their size much more with seasonal warming compared to species on land such as aphids and butterflies,” write the scientists.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, flanked by coal miners, Trump signed an executive order dismantling the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan. According to an article posted on the GQ website on Tuesday, the move demonstrates the new administration’s “shockingly feeble grasp of basic economics concepts,” according to GQ magazine and, its title suggests “will put us all underwater.” Well, if that water is warmer, arthropods will be smaller, the pollination of our food crops could be compromised and our dinners aside, how it will affect global environment is anybody’s guess.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Tel Aviv-Jaffa Municipality is preparing to launch an ambitious car-sharing project called Autotel by year's end, but the country's ultra-Orthodox community is one step ahead: It has enjoyed such a service, called City Car, for four years and currently boasts some 10,200 subscribers – a similar amount to what the seaside city is aiming for.</p> \n<p>Ultra-Orthodox families in Israel often have many children and no car, so the community is fertile ground for short-term car rentals. City Car operates in seven predominantly Haredi cities: Bnei Brak, Jerusalem, Beit Shemesh, Ashdod, Elad, Betar Ilit and Modi’in Ilit.</p> \n<p>The company’s fleet currently numbers 310 vehicles; dozens of cars were added in just the last month to meet the demands of the Haredi community. Still, City Car is unknown to most Israelis.</p> \n<p>City Car members pay a monthly fee of 10 shekels (about $2.60) for the service, and can pick up their car from any station around the cities where the company operates. Bnei Brak allows members to park their cars for free in all blue-and-white public parking zones, despite the city’s parking shortage. Jerusalem has no such arrangement, but City Car is due to compete in a tender that will allow it to have designated parking spaces. In other locales, like Betar Ilit and Modi’in Ilit, parking is free for all cars.</p> \n<p>City Car usage reached 19,000 a month during the final quarter of 2016 – that is, an average of more than 700 trips a day. Individual rentals cost 5-19 shekels an hour, depending on the time of day, plus 1.60 shekels per kilometer travelled. The price includes gas and insurance; the insurance policy is identical to that used by the major car rental companies.</p> \n<p>So far, users have had to return their cars to the same station from which they picked them up, but the company policy will change in the next two months or so to allow a renter to bring the car back to any of the cities in which City Car operates. There are plans for renters in Jerusalem to be able to return their car to any station in the city.</p> \n<p>City Car says it has developed software over the past three years to make its service more efficient. By April it is due to launch an application that will allow its members to pick up and return cars without any assistance from company representatives – although some 70 to 80 percent of the members own so-called kosher phones designed for Haredim that do not allow apps to be downloaded. In any event, with the new software, drivers will be able to locate the nearest available car and to release it via smartphone. Currently, the rental process must be approved via phone by the staff at service centers.</p> \n<p>City Car officials say the company invests mainly in technology development, which is more expensive than acquiring the vehicles and operating those centers.</p> \n<p>The owners of the company, Meir Rotem and Arye Blumenthal, who are both Haredim, hope to sell the management software they have developed to other short-term car rental concerns abroad.</p> \n<p>“The idea started when I drove a shared car in Europe. I told myself that this is a model that will fly with the Haredi community,” said Rotem. “The first years were very difficult. Members of the community are suspicious and less open to technological innovations. It took time and a lot of explaining until we took off.”</p> \n<p>Rotem describes the Tel Aviv car-sharing venture as “amazing,” adding that he ran into many obstacles with municipalities and local authorities.</p> \n<p>“It’s good that Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai is pressuring the nearby cities to join the venture,” he explained. “No one can foresee the future, but I believe they will succeed because the public in Tel Aviv is very open to change and innovation. The more such initiatives develop, the more people will understand my product, and they won’t view us as a strange bird.”</p> \n<p>Rotem said that City Car's initial investment was enormous – especially due to the software and the vehicles.</p> \n<p>“These [initial] years are dedicated to educating the market and instilling the concept of a shared car as an optimal mode of transportation,” he stressed.</p> \n<p>“The rate of membership growth indicates that the business potential matches the rate of growth of serious companies in the realm of car-sharing,&quot; Rotem noted, &quot;and therefore profitability will prove itself. Substantial investment in the venture is done with an eye to a growing membership.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Olga, Malvina and Ir&eacute;n (Orna) Csizmadia were three sisters who tied their fates to the Jewish people and the State of Israel. During the Holocaust they saved 30 Jews in Hungary, and after the war they all married Jewish men and immigrated to Israel. Last month, Orna Shurani, the youngest and last of the sisters to survive, died in Nahariya at the age of 89.</p> \n<p>The remarkable story of the Csizmadia sisters began in 1944. A camp with 210 slave-labor Jewish prisoners was set up near their home in the northern Hungarian town of S&aacute;toralja&uacute;jhely, near the Slovak border. The sisters, who were Christian, came to the aid of these prisoners, encouraged by their widowed mother Maria. Among other things they smuggled in food and letters, giving them their house as a safe place where they could meet their families. When circumstances allowed, they assisted several Jews in escaping the camp, hiding some of them in their house and other hiding places. Yad Vashem has recognized them as saving the lives of 29 Jews.</p> \n<p>One of the Jews they saved, Ladislav (Naftali) Shurani, told Maria, the sisters’ mother: “She will be my wife,” pointing at her daughter Ir&eacute;n. “She was only 14 and a half then and he was 10 years older, but he returned later and took her away,” said her daughter Tzipi this week. Ir&eacute;n converted and became Orna, after which she married Shurani. In 1949 they immigrated to Israel with a son born in Europe. In Israel they migrated between Haifa, Tel Aviv, Safed, Acre, Tiberias and Nahariya. Their daughter Tzipi was born in Israel.</p> \n<p>After they immigrated, Orna encouraged her mother and sisters to come to Israel as well. Olga also converted and married one of the Jews the family had saved, Carol Fischer. The third sister, Malvina, married an Israeli.</p> \n<p>Over the years the three sisters and their mother, who were living in Israel, were recognized as Righteous Gentiles. Tzipi says that her mother was obliged to undergo another conversion in Israel, after the rabbinate refused to recognize the one she did in Europe. Maria, the sisters’ mother, didn’t manage to complete the process.</p> \n<p>In 1956 the Shuranis opened a small hotel in Nahariya. Ladislav later worked as a chef on a ship. He died in 2002. In 2006 Olga died, with Malvina dying in 2010.</p> \n<p>During the Second Lebanon War, Orna’s house was hit by a Katyusha rocket, after which she suffered a cerebral stroke from which she never recovered. She was assisted by the ATZUM non-profit organization which helps 20 Righteous Gentiles living in Israel. Orna left behind two children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was meant to finish his political career on March 13, but because of a maneuver that the word “stinking” only compliments, he won a fourth term. Someone who wins power through racist incitement should not be surprised that he is drowning in a sea of incitement, both in his government and among his supporters.</p> \n<p>The term of office Netanyahu won was one too many and contravenes the law of nature, which switches seasons in the proper time. Seven years of diplomatic stalemate and colonial activity were meant to end, but Netanyahu blew frost into a spring that looked so promising. But although nature sometimes works slowly, when something goes too far, nature starts to act up. What’s been happening the past few days is a sign of this, and there’s no way to know what the next disaster might be.</p> \n<p>Every day that goes by like this is another day too many; Netanyahu stands like Don Quixote, battling an agreement with Iran that the whole world supports. The high point will be when he appears this week in the United States before his Republican patrons to attack the U.S. president. And this is without even mentioning the fire sale of the country’s gas resources, which are meant to improve the quality of life for Israeli citizens, Jew and Arab alike. There are too many other things to mention.</p> \n<p>Such a person cannot be expected to battle racism. It’s ridiculous, bordering on the absurd. That’s why, rather than demand the firing of the knights of incitement in Habayit Hayehudi, or the dismissal of some Likud ministers who compete with them to demonstrate their racism, we must focus our efforts on forcing Netanyahu to resign, because this is a man under whose umbrella all racists feel at home.</p> \n<p>Israel society is living in an “as if” reality. Even now, when thousands took to the streets to protest the horrible crime in the village of Duma and the stabbing attack during the gay pride march in Jerusalem, the public still hasn’t internalized that the person at the top of the pyramid is the problem. One cannot ignore the thick chain that links his saying that “Arabs are streaming in droves to the polls” with these recent attacks.</p> \n<p>The goal is to change the government. It’s not an easy mission, especially when the parliamentary alternatives, Isaac Herzog and Yair Lapid, drink from the same ideological well with regard to the occupation and the settlements. and are willing to stand behind a man who has a black flag flying over his regime. But there’s no choice but to recognize that as long as Netanyahu is at the helm, the situation will only get worse.</p> \n<p>The only real opposition today is extra-parliamentary. This opposition is the only option, given the shameful oblivion of the opposition in the Knesset. If there is true will to replace the government, it is no dream.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s salvation is coming from a different place. Hamas is already accusing Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas of being responsible for the Duma arson that killed a toddler. One would think that Abbas is the one who poured the fuel into the home of the Dawabsheh family.</p> \n<p>Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, claims the PA’s silence acquiesces to the attackers’ crimes and conveys a message that encourages attacks on West Bank residents. If the resistance could operate freely in the West Bank, Abu Zuhri said, the settlers would be unable to commit such a crime.</p> \n<p>However, as far as anyone knows, Abbas is not in Gaza; Hamas is in complete control there. If so, how is it that precisely there, under the rule of Hamas, 500 children were killed out of 2,200 fatalities, mostly civilians, during Operation Protective Edge? The logic is kept under wraps.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The First Amendment squarely protects the right to boycott. Lately, though, a legislative assault on that right has been spreading through the United States –&nbsp; designed to stamp out constitutionally protected boycotts of Israel.</p> \n<p>In a landmark decision from 1982, the Supreme Court ruled that an NAACP boycott of white-owned businesses in Mississippi, to protest segregation and racial injustice, was a protected form of free association and free expression. As the court recognized, political boycotts empower individuals to collectively express their dissatisfaction with the status quo and advocate for political, social, and economic change. These are precisely the freedoms the Constitution is meant to protect.</p> \n<p>Yet over the past several years, state and federal legislatures have considered dozens of bills, and in some cases passed laws, in direct violation of this important ruling. These bills and laws vary in numerous respects, but they share a common goal of scaring people away people from participating in boycotts meant to protest Israeli government policies, including what are known as Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns.</p> \n<p>Today, the ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging one of those laws — a Kansas statute requiring state contractors to sign a statement certifying that they do not boycott Israel, including boycotts of companies profiting off settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.</p> \n<p>People have very strong feelings on all sides of this issue. The ACLU takes no position for or against campaigns to boycott Israel or any other foreign country, but we have long defended the right to participate in political boycotts. We must do so again.</p> \n<p>We are representing a veteran math teacher and trainer from Kansas who was told she would need to sign the certification statement in order to participate in a state program training other math teachers. Our client is a member of the Mennonite Church USA. In response to calls for boycott by the church and members of her congregation, she has decided not to buy consumer goods and services offered by Israeli companies and international companies operating in Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. Our client is boycotting to protest the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians and to pressure the government to change its policies.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, our client was selected to participate as a contractor in a statewide training program run by the Kansas Department of Education. She was excited to use her skills to help train math teachers throughout the state, but when she was presented with a form requiring her to certify that she &quot;is not currently engaged in a boycott of Israel,&quot; she told the state that she could not sign the form in good conscience. As a result, the state refuses to let her participate in the program.</p> \n<p>Kansas’s law, and others like it, violates the Constitution. The First Amendment prohibits the government from suppressing one side of a public debate. That means it cannot impose ideological litmus tests or loyalty oaths as a condition on hiring or contracting.</p> \n<p>This principle was famously tested in the McCarthy era, when many state laws required government employees to declare they were not members of the Communist Party or other &quot;subversive groups&quot; in order to keep their jobs. The ACLU successfully challenged many of those laws on constitutional grounds, and anti-Communist loyalty tests have been mostly relegated to the dustbin of history.</p> \n<p>The same rule applies when the government asks someone to certify that they are not engaged in a boycott of Israel.</p> \n<p>Kansas should not be dictating political orthodoxy for its contractors. Although the government may impose reasonable restrictions on employee or contractor speech when it relates to their job duties or causes disruption in the workplace, people do not lose the right to participate in politics or speak out on issues of public concern just because they get paid by the state.</p> \n<p>By requiring all state contractors to certify that they are not engaged in a boycott of Israel, Kansas’s law unconstitutionally disqualifies people from working for the state based on protected expression and association that has nothing to do with their jobs.</p> \n<p>From the Boston Tea Party to the Montgomery bus boycott to the campaign to divest from businesses operating in apartheid South Africa, political boycotts have been a proud part of this country’s constitutional tradition.</p> \n<p>That’s why the ACLU has opposed anti-boycott bills in state legislatures for the past several years. That’s why we’ve come out against the Israel Anti-Boycott Act in Congress. And that’s why we’re suing to challenge Kansas’s unconstitutional anti-boycott law.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Brian Hauss is a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.

        "text":["<p>ANKARA – A diplomatic row between Turkey and the United States has made some Western embassies in Ankara fear they could be next in the fray and thus are leery about sending local staff on sensitive tasks, diplomats there say.</p> \n<p>The two countries suspended visa services for each other’s citizens following the arrest last month of Metin Topuz, a Turkish employee at the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul. American diplomats in Ankara say Turkish authorities have declined to give details on any charges against Topuz.</p> \n<p>“All they have is allegations from the pro-government press; they won’t restore normality until they get clarity,” said a senior diplomat from a large European country, referring to the Americans. He said the Americans would stick to their stance, “even though the measures they took are very harsh.”</p> \n<p>At some Western diplomatic missions, many Turkish staff members who liaise with Turkish institutions such as the police and judiciary are refusing to deal with sensitive files after worrying about what could come next, say diplomats in the capital. As a diplomat from a southern European country put it, “this has a strong, practical impact on bilateral relations between states.”</p> \n<p>The backdrop of the crisis is the long-standing charge that forces led by Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, have been working to subvert the rule of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, the AKP. Erdogan, for example, says Gulen orchestrated the failed coup of July 2016.</p> \n<p>According to the Turkish media, Topuz is accused of working with Gulenist police officers and prosecutors who improperly pushed corruption charges in 2013 against AKP officials.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said that “Turkey does not need Washington’s permission to prosecute Turkish citizens in Turkey,” while Erdogan has called the measures taken by U.S. authorities “saddening” and blamed the U.S. ambassador to Turkey, John Bass, for the escalation.</p> \n<p>Taking to Twitter</p> \n<p>Bass has argued that “speaking to and traveling with Turkish police is part of the regular duties of an employee who works in an office devoted to strengthening law enforcement cooperation.” He was addressing the diplomatic stand-off in a video posted Monday night on the Twitter account of the U.S. Embassy in Turkey.</p> \n<p>As a diplomat from an English-speaking country told Haaretz after a meeting Tuesday between all European ambassadors to Turkey, “All embassies have employees who liaise with Turkish police, no matter who they are. It’s not our fault if they’re riddled with Gulenists.”</p> \n<p>Now local staffers in other Western embassies, many of whom say they believe that Topuz is innocent, fear that routine interactions with members of the Turkish police and judiciary could lead Ankara to “target other embassies with specious judicial actions against local employees in the future,” the diplomat said.</p> \n<p>Unlike diplomats, local staff are not protected by diplomatic immunity and are fully liable to prosecution under Turkey’s judicial system. Precautionary measures – like not sending Turkish employees alone to meetings – have been taken by some Western embassies since the arrest of a U.S. diplomat at the consulate in Adana in March. These measures will now be strengthened.</p> \n<p>In Bass’ statement posted on Twitter, he said: “This arrest is raising questions over whether the goal of some officials is to disrupt the long-standing cooperation between Turkey and the United States.”</p> \n<p>As a diplomat from a southern European embassy put it, speaking to Haaretz, “Nothing happens in this country if there is no political will behind it. If this was the doing of an independent prosecutor, and Turkish authorities wanted to stop the escalation, he would have been reined in already.”</p> \n<p>According to the diplomat from an English-speaking country: “It is statistically credible that, within a mission like the U.S.’s, which has almost 1,000 employees, some of them would be Gulenists.”</p> \n<p>Tension with Germany</p> \n<p>The Ankara director of the German Marshall Fund think tank, Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, agrees with the southern European diplomat about a political will behind the arrest of Turkish employees for U.S. missions.</p> \n<p>“Everyone knows that the judicial system in Turkey works in strong coordination with the executive; that’s why the American reaction has been so harsh,” he said, adding that his colleagues in Washington think tanks noticed how sanctions by Russia and travel warnings by Germany during other diplomatic rows put pressure on Turkey.</p> \n<p>“The Americans have been considering going down the same route for a while,” he said, citing his discussions on recent trips to the United States.</p> \n<p>But the greatest source of tension between Washington and Ankara is Gulen. Over the past year, Turkey has requested his extradition, but the Americans have denied it, citing weak evidence and procedural obstacles. At the end of last month, Erdogan suggested a swap between Gulen and American Christian missionary Andrew Brunson, a pastor who has been detained for more than a year in Turkey over an alleged link to Gulen.</p> \n<p>Embarrassingly for U.S. diplomats, the request took place as a delegation of American religious leaders was visiting Turkey. Washington dismissed the offer and called for Brunson’s unconditional release.</p> \n<p>A number of officers at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara have interpreted Topuz’s arrest as retaliation for the rejection of the deal. Others see the crisis as further evidence of a lack of strategy and coordination in Turkey’s crafting of foreign policy.</p> \n<p>“Indeed, bilateral relations between Ankara and Washington are getting as strained as the ties with Germany,” says Unluhisarcikli of the German Marshall Fund.</p> \n<p>German-Turkish relations have been racked by a number of issues, including what Ankara considered an improper ban on campaign events with the Turkish diaspora ahead of this year’s referendum on increasing Erdogan’s powers.</p> \n<p>Either way, the U.S.-Turkish confusion is heightened by the fact that Ambassador Bass is leaving; he has already been assigned to his next mission: Afghanistan.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When he was in the fourth grade in elementary school in the Arab town of Majd al-Krum in Upper Galilee, Adel Manna took part in the preparations to celebrate Israel’s 10th Independence Day. At home, he told his father, Hussein, about how thrilled he was to be in a play about the achievements of the Zionist movement and the young state. His father’s face clouded over. Sitting Adel, his firstborn child, by his side, he explained with much forbearance why the event was not a cause for celebration for the Arabs, rather a day of grief and trauma. “It is not a day of istiqlal [independence] but of istakhlal [conquest, occupation],” he said.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;With his back against the wall, Abbas puts one-state solution on the table | Analysis</p> \n<p>“My father told me about the murders that Israel Defense Forces soldiers committed in Majd al-Krum in November 1948, and that months after the end of the war, hundreds of residents were expelled, including our family,” Manna tells me during an interview in Jerusalem. In January 1949, his family crossed into Jordan and afterward went on to Ein al-Hilweh refugee camp in southern Lebanon.</p> \n<p>Sixty years have passed since Manna grasped the difference between those two Arabic words. The circumstances of his family’s exile and subsequent return to the ancestral home have haunted him all his life. Now, following a difficult gestation, those experiences have produced a groundbreaking historical study, “Nakba and Survival: The Story of the Palestinians Who Remained in Haifa and the Galilee, 1948-1956,” which first came out in Arabic and has recently been published in Hebrew. The term Nakba, or “catastrophe,” is used to describe Israel’s War of Independence, when hundreds of thousands of Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes. In the Hebrew version of his book Manna uses the Hebrew word sordim for survivors, i.e., those who remained (as opposed to the term nitzolim, connoting Holocaust survivors, which he says has in essence been appropriated by the Jews).</p> \n<p>I begin our conversation by asking Manna when he arrived at the decision that the book’s protagonists would be those who survived/remained after the events of 1948-49.</p> \n<p>“Survival is strength,” he replies. “It is the ability to confront a disaster, such as an earthquake, and to hold on and rescue your family and property. That is what happened to the Arabs in Israel, and that disaster did not end in 1948 but went on at least until 1956. The Palestinians became a minority ruled by the Jews, with whose language and laws they were not familiar. Formally they were citizens, but effectively they were under occupation. Their rights were trampled, their property was expropriated and plundered, they could not leave their village without a permit, and so on. One needs strength, and above all strategies, to survive. I call it the strength of the defeated: not to yield to despair, and to ensure that your family remains alive. [Israeli] historian Benny Morris and others like him hate my book, because I am taking the story from them and brazenly also claiming that the Palestinians survived, even though after World War II and the Holocaust, the Jews have a monopoly on the word ‘survival.’”</p> \n<p>Aren’t you actually replacing the [Arabic] term summud – steadfastness – with [the Hebrew] hisardut, or survival?</p> \n<p>“In the Arabic version of the book, I use the word bakaa, which means remaining alive. The Palestinians did not face extinction in the 1948 Nakba, as I emphasize in the book. Not everyone managed to come through and rehabilitate his life; some despaired and left. Families split apart and did not see one another for years. Some Palestinians preferred to remain in the homeland under military rule and to bend in order to survive, despite their private tragedy, which was also a national and political tragedy.</p> \n<p>“This is also a story of rebirth. The term summud is from the 1980s, and connotes a political and ideological approach: namely, I must hold fast to the land. After the West Bank Palestinians despaired of the possibility of liberating Palestine, they spoke of a commitment to cling steadfastly to the territories that were occupied in 1967.”</p> \n<p>When did the Palestinians in Israel grasp that it was incumbent on them to survive?</p> \n<p>“At the start of the war in 1948, many fled for their lives, believing they would soon return. But in short order they understood that central Galilee and western Galilee, which in the United Nations partition plan were supposed to be part of the Arab state, would be lost. When you realize that those who left will not be able to return, and hear that the conditions in the refugee camps in Lebanon are dire, you realize that abandonment is not an option.</p> \n<p>“The residents of the Arab city of Nazareth and its 20 surrounding villages were not expelled in Operation Hiram [in October 1948, aimed at taking control of the Upper Galilee from the Arab Liberation Army]. When the Israel Defense Forces reached locales such as Bana, Deir al-Assad, Nahaf and others” as part of the operation, Manna continues, “the soldiers entered the villages, put the men in groups, shot a few and ordered everyone: ‘Yallah, to Lebanon!’ The villagers ostensibly left and started to walk northward. The soldiers did not go with them. Often, after going five or 10 kilometers, and without a soldier in sight, they returned and found people to liaise with the Israeli commanders. People started to develop survival skills.”</p> \n<p>The book, then, focuses on the Palestinians who were not expelled, and Manna focuses on groups such as the Druze, who joined the IDF as early as June 1948, and others such as the Circassians and some of the Bedouin villages in Galilee. In the main, Manna deals with Nazareth and many of its surrounding villages, which emerged almost unscathed from the Nakba in the wake of an Israeli decision of July 1948. The author analyzes the circumstances that allowed about 100,000 Palestinians to remain in Galilee and Haifa, whereas another 750,000 were dislocated and fled.</p> \n<p>Christians vs. Muslims</p> \n<p>“In 1948,” he says, “the high-ranking political decision makers issued explicit directives to IDF officers not to harm or expel the residents of Nazareth and many villages around it. Israel’s policy in regard to the Christians was more moderate than toward Muslims. There is the well-known case of the Christian village of Ilabun, where a massacre was perpetrated and the villagers were expelled to southern Lebanon – but, in a unique instance, those refugees were allowed to return to their homes and their land. In contrast, the Muslims in Galilee were victims of ethnic cleansing.”</p> \n<p>On what basis do you maintain that most of the deportees were Muslims?</p> \n<p>“If we focus on Galilee, the fact is that many Christians from Acre and Haifa were also expelled. This contradicts the account of Israeli historians to the effect that Haifa mayor Shabtai Levy drew up an emotional leaflet, urging the Arab residents not to leave the city where they had lived for so many years. I interviewed Haifa residents – members of the Communist Party who are not nationalists and certainly do not hate Israel. Not one of them ever heard of that leaflet, and on the day it was supposedly distributed, the Haganah [pre-IDF paramilitary organization] shelled the Arab neighborhoods from Mount Carmel. In Haifa there was no expulsion in the sense of people being forced onto trucks at gunpoint. But when entire neighborhoods were shelled, people rushed to the port. The same pattern was repeated in Acre and Jaffa.”</p> \n<p>Did Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion pursue a policy or issue an order aimed at getting rid of the Muslims?</p> \n<p>“I am not looking for a directive or a document bearing Ben-Gurion’s signature. He addressed the subject often, and I quote his statements in the book. For example, on September 26, 1948, he declared, ‘Only one task remains for the Arabs in the Land of Israel: to flee.’ The Israeli leadership understood and also concurred that, for the Jewish state, the fewer Arabs the better. The subject was mooted already in the late 1930s. Yosef Weitz, a senior official of the Jewish National Fund, supported extensive expulsion of Arabs and advocated a population transfer. The IDF commanders at different levels knew what the leadership wanted and acted accordingly. Massacres were not perpetrated everywhere. When you shell a village or a city neighborhood, the residents flee. In the first half of 1948, at least, they believed they would be able to return. When the fighting in Haifa ended, many residents tried to return from Acre in boats, but the Haganah blocked them.”</p> \n<p>Does your study confirm, or prove, that ethnic cleansing took place?</p> \n<p>“The book’s goal is not to prove whether ethnic cleansing occurred. My disagreement with [the review of my book in Haaretz by] Benny Morris did not revolve around the question of ‘whether ethnic cleansing took place or not,’ but deals with the question of whether the leadership did or did not make a decision in a particular meeting to implement a policy of ethnic cleansing.” In this connection, Manna quotes Daniel Blatman’s response (Haaretz, Aug. 4) to a review of his book by Morris (Haaretz, July 29). One might think from Morris’ book, Blatman noted, that “when Ratko Mladic decided to slaughter over 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995, he made his orders public.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, Manna points out, “The first historian who uncovered the fact that ethnic cleansing occurred and that there were also cases of massacre, rape and expulsion was Benny Morris. He reached the conclusion that there was no [official] policy, in light of the fact that no authoritative archival documentation exists. In one village, they decided a certain way and in another, differently. Still, there is a pattern: The soldiers perpetrated another massacre and carried out another expulsion, and another massacre and another expulsion, and no one was brought to trial. If there was no policy, why weren’t these war criminals tried?”</p> \n<p>A case in point: the atrocities that were carried out in the village of Safsaf, northwest of Safed, on October 30, 1948, which included murder, expulsion and rape. Manna writes that a member of his wife’s family was raped and murdered in cold blood by IDF soldiers: His wife, Aziza, is named for the rape victim. He heard the account nine years ago from a woman named Maryam Halihal, now 80, who was 10 at the time of the events.</p> \n<p>Rape is considered a dishonoring of the family in Arab society. Did you have qualms about publishing the story and the identity of the victims?</p> \n<p>“Rape generates deep shame in the victim’s family. Aziza Sharaida is no longer alive – why make her harsh story public and shame her family? When I met the woman who would become my wife, she told me that she was named for a cousin, Aziza Sharaida, without elaborating. As part of my research, I interviewed members of my wife’s family, and Maryam Halihal decided to talk about the incident, over her husband’s angry objections.</p> \n<p>“The soldiers entered the family’s house and tried to rape Aziza Sharaida in front of her husband and children. She resisted. The soldiers threatened to kill her 17-year-old, firstborn son if she went on resisting. She resisted with force and they shot her son. The soldiers threatened to shoot her husband, too, but she refused to give in, and they shot and killed him. The two younger sons, who witnessed the atrocity, went into exile in Lebanon. My wife’s mother, a relative of the murdered woman, decided 63 years ago to name her daughter Aziza. As I write in the book, even though Haim Laskov [later a chief of staff] was put in charge of the interrogation of the perpetrators of the horrors in Safsaf, none of them paid the price for war crimes, which included shooting prisoners and acts of abuse and rape.”</p> \n<p>Manna began his research in 1984. Over the years, he interviewed 120 men and women and compiled documents, diaries and letters from the period, which in some cases had been stashed away in drawers. He also drew on written Palestinian sources, which helped him confirm oral testimonies. Memoirs published in Arabic and newspaper articles form the period, in Arabic and Hebrew, contributed to the research. Manna also made use of many studies by Jewish Israeli historians. However, he says, he did not resort to the sweeping preference for Israeli archives that characterizes such historians as Benny Morris. “The blatant manner in which oral testimonies are disdained and ignored by researchers in Israel reflects a domineering attitude,” he writes in the book’s introduction.</p> \n<p>He will not deposit the material he’s collected over the years in an Israeli archive. It will go either to Bir Zeit University, near Ramallah, or to the Beirut-based Institute for Palestine Studies. “Palestinian students can’t get to the Hebrew University [of Jerusalem],” he says.</p> \n<p>Palestinian ‘illegals’</p> \n<p>As a Muslim born in 1947 in Majd al-Krum and as a historian who researched the special story of his village in the 1948 war, Adel Manna decided that it was his obligation to write the history of the 120,000 Arabs who remained in Israel – the generation of his parents, Hussein and Kawthar.</p> \n<p>“They survived the policy of a military government under which their rights were trampled, and despite that were able to raise nine children and instill in us the message that no one is entitled to treat us as inferior people,” he says.</p> \n<p>Turning to his parents’ ordeal in the 1948 war, Manna relates, “The first person in Majd al-Krum who was blindfolded and made to stand against a wall in the village square – before being shot to death by a squad of six soldiers – was the husband of my grandmother, Zahra,” he explains. Subsequently, “In January 1949, 536 residents were expelled, including members of her family and her children, and became refugees in Lebanon. Her brother was murdered by a resident of [the Jewish community of] Pardes Hannah; her son, Samih, was killed when he stepped on a land mine. After the war, she worked as a maid in Haifa with her daughter. For two years, my father ‘infiltrated’ into Israel to visit them and take back a little money that grandmother had saved up for him and for his brother in Lebanon.”</p> \n<p>Manna was a year old when he and his parents were among the many from Majd al-Krum who were herded onto IDF trucks that took them west to the village of Al-Birwa (today, the location of Moshav Ahihud), then south toward the Jezreel Valley and Wadi Ara.</p> \n<p>“The trucks stopped there,” he relates. “The people were ordered to get off amid shouts of ‘Yallah, go to King Abdullah’ [in Jordan]. My parents spent one night in a mosque in Kafr Ara and from there walked to Nablus [then part of Jordan]. We spent the hard winter of 1949 there. People were crowded into tents under grim hygienic conditions. In April, the Jordanians encouraged the refugees to leave. My parents decided to go north and reached Ein al-Hilweh [in Lebanon]. I almost died in the refugee camp, like other infants.”</p> \n<p>Due to an intestinal ailment, Manna did not stand or walk until he was 2 and a half. “A woman in the camp deduced that this was why I couldn’t stand and made me a potion from herbs and castor oil. It eradicated the parasites, and within a day or two I was walking. We returned to Israel in 1951 in a fishing boat that set out from the port of Tyre in Lebanon and brought us, the Palestinian ‘illegals,’ to the beach of Shavei Tzion [returners to Zion], north of Acre. How symbolic,” Manna says with a smile.</p> \n<p>How did you manage to get back?</p> \n<p>“Like many Galilee Palestinians, my father had repeatedly ‘infiltrated’ into Israel. On one such occasion he learned that a lawyer, Hana Naqara, had petitioned the High Court of Justice on behalf of 43 Majd al-Krum residents, each of whom had returned to the village more than once but had been expelled back to Lebanon each time. Naqara argued that these people had [Israeli] ID numbers – a population census had been conducted in Majd al-Krum in December 1948, the month before they were originally deported. [Those who received an official ID number were considered citizens.] Like them, my parents also had ID numbers. Back in Lebanon, my father told my mother: ‘Prepare what’s needed – tonight we’re going back to the village.’</p> \n<p>“My mother was seven months pregnant, how was she going to walk 40 kilometers? Father told her that a Palestinian fisherman from the village of Az-Zeeb [Hebrew name: Achziv] had discovered that transporting refugees by boat was more profitable than fishing. As a child I believed that my father was a great hero, who had thought up the idea of our return by boat. While researching the book I learned that many Galileans had returned to Israel via the sea – a subject that awaits historical research.”</p> \n<p>‘Don’t be a donkey’</p> \n<p>“Nakba and Survival” is dedicated to the memory of Manna’s father. His mother, Kawthar (“pure water”), 89, lives in the family home in the village, and contributed considerably to the book.</p> \n<p>Manna recalls that the first Jews he met as a boy were women. At the time, he traveled to the Haifa suburbs of Kiryat Motzkin and Kiryat Bialik to sell figs from the family grove. There he discovered not only that the Jews lived in apartment buildings and that shade trees had been planted along the road, but also that Jewish women were very affable. One of them, Mrs. Miller by name, treated him warmly, and when police officers showed up to confiscate wares of Arab peddlers, she hid his baskets of figs in her home.</p> \n<p>Adel remembers his father telling him, “Don’t be a donkey like me, who works as a manual laborer all his life from morning to evening and has a hard time providing for his nine children. Get an education, so you can get a job with a good salary.”</p> \n<p>Manna obtained a B.A. in history from the University of Haifa, then his master’s and doctorate from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, writing his dissertation on the history of the Jerusalem district in the Ottoman period. His adviser, Gabriel Baer, advised him to steer clear of issues such as the Nakba and the conflict, he recalls: “Prof. Baer intimated that the topics I had in mind would not help a student like me forge an academic career. In retrospect, I appreciated his advice.”</p> \n<p>Manna’s political awareness was honed in the 1970s, when he was a student in Haifa, living in the dorms. He was elected secretary of the Arab Students Union, whose activity included organization of cultural and political events. His political activity exacted a price, he says: “I came under pressure from Shin Bet [security service] agents, who tried to recruit me as a collaborator and promised that in return I would be allowed to become a teacher. ‘What are you going to do with a B.A. in history?’ a Shin Bet agent named Carmi said to me. Instead of giving in or being afraid, I told Gideon Spiro, the editor of the student newspaper, about it.</p> \n<p>“The newspaper published a report headlined ‘Shin Bet harassing Arab student,’ on February 2, 1972, a week before I received my degree. The article stirred a furor in the university and in the Hebrew press. In its wake, the weekly magazine Haolam Hazeh ran a follow-up article. I didn’t panic. I began M.A. studies at the Hebrew University and was elected to the Arab Students Union there, which led the resistance to the forced ‘protection’ of Arab students in 1974-1975.</p> \n<p>“All along I was haunted by the story I’d heard from my father and from others in the village. When I told [Jewish] students about it, I always got the same response: ‘We didn’t expel anyone and the only massacre was in Deir Yassin [outside Jerusalem, in 1948]. The Palestinians simply fled.’ The silencing and denial of the Nakba prompted me to write an article titled ‘Letter to an Israeli Friend,’ which was published in Haaretz in June 1984.”</p> \n<p>The article began with a concise description of the events in his village in 1948, his philo-Zionist schooling and the shock Manna endured when he learned, while taking part in demonstrations against Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, that two of his cousins from Ein al-Hilweh were incarcerated in the IDF detention facility at Ansar in southern Lebanon. Shattered by the news, he decided to abandon his doctoral studies and devote himself to writing a book about the Nakba.</p> \n<p>“My wife was shocked,” he recalls. “‘Are you out of your mind? What will you do with a book like that? You have to finish your doctorate,’ she insisted. It was a rough year, 1984. There was a stormy campaign for the Knesset elections, the members of the Jewish underground who perpetrated terrorist acts in the territories were arrested – all of which diverted my attention from [the thesis topic of] the administration and society in the Jerusalem district between two invasions: Napoleon in 1799 and Muhammad Ali in 1831.”</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Manna received a Ph.D. degree cum laude, and subsequently did postdoctoral research at Princeton, where his daughter, Jumana, was born, in 1987. He and Aziza then spent another year abroad, at Oxford, before returning to Israel in 1989. At this point he realized that an academic career was not in the offing: “The Hebrew University offered me a one-year untenured lectureship in the Middle East Studies Department, and I would write a research paper on 19th-century Egypt, and then ‘we’ll see.’ I decided to concentrate on my research of the 1948 war.”</p> \n<p>The Mannas’ first priority was their children’s education. They both worked, and one salary went to pay the high tuition for their three children at the Anglican International School in West Jerusalem, where the lingua franca is English. Manna notes that he and his wife aimed to provide their children with more languages and intellectual tools than Arab children in Israel generally receive. Possibly they had an inkling already then of what the future held for the three.</p> \n<p>Manna frequently mentions the support he has received from Aziza. They met in 1974, at the Hebrew University’s Mount Scopus campus, where she was taking Islamic studies. After her marriage she studied early-childhood education and worked a coordinator and instructor in that sphere in the Arab community under Hebrew University aegis. Adel, currently a senior research fellow at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute, was initially involved in the administration and management of the Center for the Study of Language, Society and Arabic Culture at Beit Berl College in Kfar Sava. Afterward, he headed the Center for the Study of Arab Society in Israel at Van Leer until 2007. From 2009 until 2012 he was the director of the Academic Institute for Arab Teacher Training at Beit Berl.</p> \n<p>“From my perspective,” he says, “that was the closing of a circle with regard to the Shin Bet, whose agent in Haifa assured me in 1972 that I would never be a teacher in Israel because of my political activity.”</p> \n<p>He and his wife live in Shoafat, a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Ironically, their children have not remained here: All three left the country. The eldest, Fadi, 41, a lawyer who has three children, lives in the United States, where he is vice president and associate general counsel at HP. Shadi, 37, is a software engineer; he and his wife live in Barcelona. Jumana Manna, an artist and film director, divides her time between Berlin and Jerusalem. Her 2015 documentary film, “A Magical Substance Flows into Me,” is a look at musical traditions of ethnic communities in Jerusalem in the 1930s, as compiled at that time by Jewish-German ethnomusicologist Robert Lachmann.</p> \n<p>“We’ve remained alone,” Manna says. “It’s part of the harsh reality here. My son Fadi advanced to a professional level that an Arab in Israel cannot attain. Shadi worked in Israel for a time, but felt that he was constantly being reminded of the ‘privilege’ that had befallen him as an Arab to be employed in software engineering. Finally he got fed up and told me, ‘I don’t want to be the Jews’ Arab.’ He went to the U.S., earned an MBA and got a job with an American company.”</p> \n<p>Do your children think that you’ve stayed in Israel at the price of being “the Jews’ Arab”?</p> \n<p>“Our children understood that few options were available to us. As a member of the old generation, I am one of those who remained. In their perception, I somehow got used to the Jews and to their treatment of Arabs. They think that despite my origins in my father’s house, as the son of a construction worker who raised nine children, and even though I worked very hard and received a doctoral degree cum laude, perhaps I didn’t get tenure because I’m a Muslim. I don’t know. The children did not want to go through a similar experience or feel inferior to the Jews.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Awards ceremonies are invariably full of surprises, but when the Israeli film world descends on Ashdod for the “Israeli Oscars” on Tuesday evening, two things seem certain.</p> \n<p>First, Samuel Maoz’s “Foxtrot,”&nbsp;which just won the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and dazzled critics at the Toronto International Film Festival, will walk away with an armload of Ophir Awards – including, in all probability, Best Movie (which automatically makes it the country’s contender for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2018 Academy Awards).</p> \n<p>Second, Culture Minister Miri Regev will be conspicuously absent from proceedings, after Israel Academy of Film and Television Chairman Mosh Danon disinvited her and other politicians from the ceremony.</p> \n<p>These two certainties are not a coincidence: Regev has had a charged and hostile relationship with the arts community since entering the ministry in the spring of 2015. She has repeatedly threatened to withhold state funding against any artistic expression that she views as overly critical of the state and its policies, saying they “play into the hands of our enemies.”</p> \n<p>“Foxtrot” is the latest target of her wrath. Telling the story of a Tel Aviv couple and their son’s military service in which he mans an isolated checkpoint, the film delves into the charged issue of the occupation and its effect on Israeli society.</p> \n<p>When the film premiered in Venice recently, Regev released a statement calling the film a “disgrace” that “shamed the reputation of the IDF” and showed “contempt for the state and its symbols.”</p> \n<p>While admitting she had not yet seen the film, Regev probably based her statement on accounts of the disturbing finale and Maoz’s previous film, “Lebanon” (2009), which also won international acclaim (winning the top prize at Venice) and took an unflinching view of the harsh events he experienced as a tank gunner in the first Lebanon war. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Maoz told one reporter &nbsp;in Venice this month his hope was that “Foxtrot” would trigger discussions in Israel over what happens in the military, and its consequences.</p> \n<p>“I feel that people prefer to repress it, to deny it, to bury it,” he explained. “If I had done a movie about a terrible crime in the police, the next morning [people] would say nothing happened – they would understand it was a film. But if you touch the army, it’s very sensitive.”</p> \n<p>Asked if he was concerned about being viewed as a “traitor” in Israel, he replied: “The opposite. Every human society should strive to be better and improve itself. The basic and necessary condition for improvement is the ability to accept self-criticism. If I criticize the place [where] I live, I do it because I worry. I do it because I want to protect it. I do it from love.”</p> \n<p>Vocal critic</p> \n<p>“Foxtrot” is not the only reason Regev is unwelcome at this year’s Ophir Awards, which celebrate the best Israeli films and television of the past 12 months. Since Regev took the reins at the ministry 18 months ago, there has been as much drama in the ceremonies and public events she has attended as in the art being honored.</p> \n<p>She makes no secret of her displeasure with the Israeli artistic community, which she believes is both left-wing and controlled by the old Ashkenazi elites (Regev has been vocal in her support of Mizrahi culture, referring to works produced Jews of Middle Eastern or North African origin). Regev has launched a full-on crusade against plays and films she feels portray Israel in a negative light, or which she feels violate the sensitivities of the religious community with displays of nudity.</p> \n<p>Although she has threatened to withhold state funding from projects she finds unacceptable, she’s had a hard time backing up her words with action. That’s because the film committees doling out state funds are mainly independent bodies – though artists fear Regev is working to stack the selection committees with those who would do her bidding.</p> \n<p>In his statement last week, the Academy’s Danon said his organization was determined “to do everything in its power to prevent a repeat of [previous] regrettable incidents.”</p> \n<p>Danon was referring specifically to the 2016 Ophir Awards, when Regev stormed out of the hall when performers Tamer Nafar and Yossi Zabari took to the stage to recite Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish’s “ID Card.” She left her seat in protest at the recitation and, as she said later on stage – in a speech interrupted by jeers and booing – because Darwish was a writer who “called for the destruction of the State of Israel.”</p> \n<p>Danon said there was no protocol that dictated a culture minister must be invited, and that since Regev had failed to “respect” the industry in the past, he preferred for her to stay away rather than spoil the celebration with words of criticism, not congratulation. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>It isn’t difficult to imagine that “Foxtrot” and Regev would have been a combustible combination. She already chose to slam the movie when its Silver Lion prize was announced earlier this month, taking to Facebook with a post that was anything but congratulatory.</p> \n<p>“When an Israeli film wins an international prize, the heart fills with pride and my natural desire is to strengthen and encourage the Israeli success,” Regev wrote. “This rule has one exception, and it takes place when the international embrace is a result of self-flagellation and cooperation with the anti-Israeli narrative.”</p> \n<p>Regev added in a follow-up statement it was “outrageous that Israeli artists contribute to the incitement of the young generation against the most moral army in the world by spreading lies in the form of art.”</p> \n<p>The culture minister plans to broadcast a speech live on her Facebook page during Tuesday’s ceremony, to push back against the “cowardly and undemocratic” effort to “silence” her – and in which she will surely have harsh words for “Foxtrot.”</p> \n<p>While Regev shows no tolerance for Maoz’s decision to grapple artistically with the toll that army service and the occupation takes on families and society, viewing it instead as national defamation, critics have found the film’s themes of grief and guilt to be universal.</p> \n<p>“There are moments in this film that are funny and others that are beautiful, but more than anything else there is a sadness that is truly profound,” Jordan Hoffman wrote in Vanity Fair. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Unlike Regev, it is clear to Hoffman that “this is an allegorical film and, although its temperament is very Israeli, its content could just as well be about any nation and its Army.”</p> \n<p>Hoffman added that, ironically, Regev’s very public objections to the film may prove to be an effective tool in “boosting the movie’s profile.”</p> \n<p>But it seems the film won’t need the controversy in order to be noticed. Website Firstshowing.net was unsparing in its superlatives, critic Alex Billington giving “Foxtrot” 10 out of 10: “Oh my goodness, this film is brilliant. You won’t be ready for this when it hits you, no matter how prepared you think you may be. ‘Foxtrot’ is the new film from Israeli director Samuel Maoz and clearly confirms that he’s a master filmmaker who has so much to show us. ‘Foxtrot’ is both the story of a family, and the story of a soldier. It’s distinctly an Israeli film, criticizing not only the society and culture of the country, but especially their military and the idea that they’re supposedly doing good. I had heard great things before, but I was still completely floored by this film when I saw at the Venice Film Festival. It’s the kind of perfect film that leaves you speechless at the end, you don’t even know what to say other than ‘Wow.’”</p> \n<p>Several other critics and film aficionados who viewed “Foxtrot” at Venice or Toronto took to Twitter to share their enthusiasm:&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Unlike Regev, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin says he will reserve judgment on “Foxtrot” until he actually sees the film. “I did not watch the film, but I’m going to watch it. I do not know if I will like it, but I will watch it as I try to watch every Israeli film,” Rivlin told a visiting delegation of Hollywood producers and executives to Israel last week.</p> \n<p>“In general, I am a great fan of Israeli cinema, which is a symbol of freedom of expression and the strength of Israeli democracy. Israeli cinema is one of the most important ambassadors of Israel in the world because of its quality, and because of the way it reflects different aspects of life in Israel, with all the challenges and magic within it,” he added.</p> \n<p>Although Regev will not be in attendance on Tuesday night, her comments over the weekend ensured she will still be the main talking point. She told Channel 2 TV that with the current agreement for film funding expiring next year, “I’m telling you now that what has been going on will not continue.” She added that anyone “who thinks we’ll allocate the [state] budget to the same film funds” is in for a surprise.</p>",

        "text":["<p>There’s magic among the alleyways of the Jaffa flea market. Everything here is bustling, lively and noisy, one could say restless, and at the same time there’s a sense of serenity and a feeling that time has stopped.</p> \n<p>During the daytime the busy market is a warren of stalls and shops selling clothes, chotchkes, old furniture and old stories looking for a final chance. In the evening, all that gives way to those whose time is here and now and whose story beckons from all directions — people laughing out loud, talking, eating and raising a toast from every corner of the ancient streets. A genuine celebration of life.</p> \n<p>The restaurants, bars and eateries in the area of the flea market have been experiencing a reawakening. In light of the appetizing culinary offerings, we went to the market in order to welcome the new places and meet up with old friends. A foodie tour of the flea market and environs — that’s how it is when you fall in love again.</p> \n<p>Jericho</p> \n<p>Chefs Idan Peretz and Tomer Agai, two cuisines from different and contrasting worlds, joined forces and created a successful and exciting combination in the guise of a tasty and simple Levantine cuisine that only recently joined the area’s eateries. The bar-restaurant is inside a square in the Greek market. There’s outdoor seating on the plaza as well as an indoor space and a delightful bar, with a unique and elegant cocktail menu. In the center of the kitchen you’ll also find a magnificent taboun clay oven (that wouldn’t shame even the veteran Abulafia bakery), from which quite a few piping hot pizzas and other fragrant dishes emerge. Chicken confit in goose fat, a salad of fresh ful (fava beans) and raw red drum fish wrapped in hot pepper, with bulgur wheat, crushed lemon and yogurt that has been dubbed “torn beach ball” because of its shape.</p> \n<p>Suitable for: passionate foodies, a food-centered romantic date or guys in flip-flops who come for pizza and beer. In other words, everyone.</p> \n<p>4 Pinhas Ben-Yair St.</p> \n<p>Raisa</p> \n<p>Chef Uri Levy’s Raisa opened just recently in the heart of the bustling flea market. It offers diners a fun Mediterranean cuisine in a relaxed atmosphere. Fresh ingredients are more than just a clich&eacute; here, and the chef makes sure to use only Israeli fish and fresh seafood — a bonus that is not self-evident in today’s restaurant market. A quick glance at the menu and you’ll see that in addition to a large selection of dishes from the sea, you’ll also find interesting mezes and noshes, first courses and small portions of meat. The calm atmosphere during the day gives way to an ethnic and more joyous atmosphere at night and on weekends.</p> \n<p>Suitable for: Friends who stay in touch over a beer and couples who want a fun place in which to spend time. Also suitable for large groups.</p> \n<p>8 Rabbi Yohanan St.</p> \n<p>Parakalo</p> \n<p>Stretching north of the flea market, across from the amazing Jaffa beach, the new Parakalo restaurant brings Greek cuisine several meters to the right of Israel’s coast. With good and simple raw ingredients (which are actually the whole secret of this cuisine), they have assembled a rich menu here of cold and hot mezes along with fresh fish dishes, main courses, light salads and several breakfasts that don’t diverge from the restaurant’s strictly Greek menu. The well executed pastoral design, along with the pleasant breeze and the seascape, create an atmosphere that’s hard to beat. The alcohol menu includes a number of types of ouzo, to complete the experience.</p> \n<p>Suitable for: Friends and families that want to open a table on a pleasant Mediterranean wave, or to begin the morning with positive energies. The sea in the background will complement any daytime or evening experience.</p> \n<p>6 Nahum Goldman St.</p> \n<p>Pundak Deluxe</p> \n<p>Pundak Deluxe, of the Deluxe Group, which introduced the American culture of smoked meats into the Israeli mainstream. The professional and uncompromising place offers sworn carnivores a large selection of meats that undergo a process of slow and meticulous smoking by hand — each cut is treated differently. After soaking, seasoning and smoking, the meat reaches the customer at its peak and is served with sauces on a metal tray, for eating with your hands (the closest you’ll get to “Game of Thrones”) or inside a sandwich (if you are wimps). One can also find fun and addictive additions that only daring restaurateurs know how to serve, like a plump macaroni and cheese with peas and bacon (order your own, we’re not sharing), classic coleslaw and hot and crispy cornbread, along with an extensive menu of boutique beers.</p> \n<p>Suitable for: carnivores and gourmands of all types, Israelis and tourists.</p> \n<p>7 Olei Tzion St.</p> \n<p>Onza</p> \n<p>In the south of the flea market you can find Onza, the lively Turkish sister of Kitchen Market. The dynamic menu is based on the various offerings of Ottoman cuisine interpreted by chefs Arik Darhani and Muli Magriso, graduates of elite restaurants. You’ll find Turkish-style hors d’oeuvres, main courses and good things from the taboun that you can down with generous cocktails from a menu that was planned especially for the restaurant. Every Sunday there’s a real Turkish celebration here, with unique dishes like spinach bourekas made from a very thick yufka dough, fried barbounia fish and anchovies, lots of ethnic music and chasers that will cap everything.</p> \n<p>Suitable for: Young people who like to raise a drink and have fun with something tasty at hand, and groups that are looking for a creative place that combines good alcohol with well-honed food in meticulously designed surroundings.</p> \n<p>3 Rabbi Hanina St.</p> \n<p>Tashtash Shvili</p> \n<p>When you feel like getting something good and hot to go, the magical encounter between melted cheese and very fresh dough does the trick. At Tashtash Shvili, a new khachapuri place from the owners of Tash and Tasha, which is right around the corner, you’ll find the traditional Georgian food in a variety of styles and with unusual additions — mushrooms and garlic, caramelized onions, blue cheese and more.</p> \n<p>Alongside the boat-shaped bundle of cheesy goodness one can drink a beer or a Georgian lemonade (“natakhtari,” which has little in common with lemonade, but is no less tasty and flowing), and lovers of churchkhela, a snack of walnuts and grape must, can finish here with a sweet munch. For those who are too lazy, the place makes deliveries to Jaffa, Tel Aviv and Bat Yam, for special events too.</p> \n<p>Suitable for: People passing through the market and people who come just for a moment in order to solve the hunger problem along the way, without compromising.</p> \n<p>15 Olei Tzion St.</p> \n<p>Asia</p> \n<p>The fresh and aromatic cuisines of Vietnam and Thailand are represented in Jaffa by the Asia restaurant, which brings to the flea market the tastes and smells of the Asian Golden Triangle. Chefs Lilach Raveh and Omri Zakheim have created a menu full of crisp vegetables, fish, seafood, meats and a variety of handmade dumplings, and maybe you’ll even get to see them in action while you gaze into the open kitchen from the bar.</p> \n<p>Recently a new and heartwarming dim sum menu was launched here, which you can enjoy from 7 P.M. to 8:30 P.M. Sunday through Thursday, with original Asian mezes and small dishes (and not necessarily the familiar steamed dumplings) and a sea curry, crushed by hand with lemony herbs, enriched coconut milk, rice noodles, shrimps, scallops and mussels, served with cilantro and chili.</p> \n<p>Suitable for: Families that like spicy food and groups of friends that want to share tastes from their last trip, but in style.</p> \n<p>3 Rabbi Nahman St.</p> \n<p>And here are a few more that shouldn’t be missed:</p> \n<p>Italkia Bapishpishim – An Italian street restaurant located on the most prominent corner of the flea market. It offers a variety of homemade pastas, gnocchi and pizzas, in a relaxed atmosphere. Don’t miss the wonderful mushroom risotto, and the spinach and ricotta ravioli will warm the hearts of lovers of the plump dumplings. 16 Olei Tzion St.</p> \n<p>Hasoania – A Balkan eatery with a happy family atmosphere. Hasoania is located in the heart of the Greek market, in an ancient building space dating from the Byzantine period. Until now the restaurant served mainly familiar Mediterranean dishes like Greek souvlaki and Turkish borek, but there’s a new guiding spirit now. About a month ago chef Alon Barnea joined the team and he promises a new menu very soon, much tighter and tastier. 18 Shimon Hatzadik St.</p> \n<p>Casino San Remo – Chef Noa Levy is in charge of the menu, which centers around beloved Mediterranean cuisine. One can also find various breakfasts, not only for tourists. Another advantage is the cocktails, sold throughout the day for 25 shekels each. 2 Nehama St.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A note at the entrance to a Tel Aviv apartment building caught my eye recently: “Hey dog, even though our entry gate is the favorite spot for you and your friends to urinate, please don’t do it because it makes us sad. Your neighbors thank you.”</p> \n<p>The request, appealing to the dog’s goodwill, sounded like nothing more than an urban joke concocted by the building’s occupants, their creative way of protesting the pee stains on the sidewalk. But the next day, in a different part of town, I came across another such request, this one complete with vowel signs and addressed to both genders: “Dear male and female dogs, please do not pee here.”</p> \n<p>I quickly realized that the appeal to dogs’ sensibilities is a significant trend, and symptomatic of a much deeper change – an attempt to make animals part of the human community. Even if the notes’ authors don’t really expect dogs to read what they’ve written, they still imagine the dogs as four-legged people.</p> \n<p>An examination of contemporary culture shows this to be quite a widespread phenomenon. One striking example is the prominent representation of the animal kingdom in popular culture. Until about a decade ago, films and images of animals generally focused on the savagery and otherness of the animal world. A typical movie would show a cheetah pursuing an antelope on the Serengeti plain in Tanzania, catching its prey and devouring it. But the tendency now is to portray nature very differently. Often, attempts are made to depict animals as “more human than humans.”</p> \n<p>Popular YouTube clips show an odd harmony between species, like in end-of-days prophecies: True friendship between a kitten and an owl; a polar bear and a dog frolicking together; a lioness feeding a tiger cub.</p> \n<p>And if nature doesn’t provide these saccharine images itself, they will be created artificially. A much-viewed video on social media, for example, showing a pack of wolves being led by its older and weaker members, turned out to be fake – like many clips from the “human animals” genre.</p> \n<p>On the face of it, the contemporary era is characterized by greater sensitivity for animal rights, reflected in the spread of veganism and the enactment of legislation to protect animals. But it’s also becoming increasingly clear that an effort is being made to strip the animal world of its animality. Nature is being portrayed as non-beastly and, therefore, human.</p> \n<p>This shows a lack of respect for the foreignness of nature to the human world. It demonstrates an inability to tolerate the existence of a creature that does not share the values of liberal society; that in fact does not share values of any sort, because animals do not have values.</p> \n<p>It’s easy to predict the next stage of the process: an attempt to impose human laws on the animal kingdom. It’s likely that the extension of universal rights to animals will lead to a demand to reduce the immense suffering and distress that animals endure in the wild. Already today, there are calls for animals to be protected from the diseases, hunger and violence to which they’re exposed in nature – in part from other animals.</p> \n<p>Recent years have seen the publication of numerous books and articles calling for the introduction of a policy of “wildlife welfare.” There are also practical suggestions. British “transhumanist” philosopher David Pearce urges the elimination of suffering from the world through genetic and chemical means, as “Aversive experience is a sinister anachronism in the age of post-genomic medicine.” This would end physical pain in the world for humans and animals alike.</p> \n<p>Obviously, such efforts are doomed to fail. Indeed, it’s clear that, in contrast to other publics that suffer from an attitude of symbolic erasure, animals are not offended by having humanity imposed upon them, in the perception of humans.</p> \n<p>In any event, the discussion about animal rights is a one-sided affair. It’s not superfluous to note that animals don’t read Facebook posts or attend academic conferences. The realm in which animals exist is completely different from the human sphere. Though animals possess emotions and feelings, the absolute majority of them lack any self-comprehension, still less concepts about people. It’s only in movies like “The Jungle Book” that animals address each other by name and have views about the proper attitude to be taken toward mankind.</p> \n<p>Return of the big bad wolf</p> \n<p>In fact, it’s humanity itself that is being hurt by the humanization of animals. There is a danger in attempting to annul the animal and assimilate it into the human. “A dog’s life is short and has to suffice for many experiences and much pampering,” the opening of a report on Channel 10 News asserted recently. According to the reporter, then, it is seemingly impossible to imagine a life that is not consumerist – including a demand for self-realization and a self-indulgent leisure culture. Similarly, reports about the Israeli army’s canine unit, Oketz, depicted the dogs as ambitious, patriotic, reconnaissance soldiers, interested in meaningful combat service.</p> \n<p>We educate children who do not recognize the possibility of a radically different existence from their own self-experience. Ultimately, this is an extreme extension of narcissism – imperialism of “the absolute ego,” which leaves no room for anything external to it.</p> \n<p>From this perspective, there was something refreshing in recent reports that wolves in the Judean Desert have been trying to prey on the children of hikers in the area. Precisely after wild animals were wholly subdued – to the point where they exist, in the human consciousness, only as a decoration, as a reflection of the bourgeois self or an object of saccharine compassion – the big bad wolf of fairy tales has suddenly lurched out from the darkness. This is a wild dog that does not need experiences and pampering, does not respond to requests to behave nicely and has no qualms about “saddening” humans or snatching their babies.</p> \n<p>But you do not need a vivid imagination to guess what happens next: The wolves will be destroyed. After all, they are not behaving the way they should in terms of what’s acceptable in a progressive society. Because if animals have rights, they also have obligations. The same logic that seeks to foist humanization on animals will lead to the physical destruction of the animals whose behavior doesn’t live up to expectations. This time, though, it will not be symbolically, but with the help of a bullet to the head.</p>",

        "text":["<p>On the face of it, the owner and president of the Roman soccer club Lazio seemed to be taking a very firm stance against the latest episode of anti-Semitism by his club's hooligan supporters. Earlier this week the hard-core fans, known in Italy as ultras, plastered stickers of Anne Frank wearing the jersey of Lazio's rival club, Roma, in their shared stadium. Lazio's president, Claudio Lotito, condemned the episode, headed to the Great Synagogue of Rome with a blue and white flower wreath – his club's colors – and promised to bring 200 supporters every year to the Auschwitz concentration camp for an educational trip. Twenty-four hours later, however, Italian police found the flowers floating in the waters of the Tiber, the river that runs through the city. The local Jewish community did not take the solidarity gesture well.</p> \n<p>“I can confirm that the flowers were thrown away by members of the Jewish community,” said Daniele Regard, a 31-year-old Italian Jew who works as a press officer for Nicola Zingaretti, the president of Italy's Lazio region. “To most people in the community, those flowers were too little, too late,” he added. At the beginning of the month, the Italian Football Federation decided to close down the northern curva, or stadium stands, where Lazio’s hard-core supporters normally sit. The decision was taken after they booed black players from the Sassuolo club, something Lazio fans have a long history of doing. Instead of letting them stay at home for Lazio's match against Cagliari, Lotito decided to open up the southern stands of the stadium, the place where Roma's hard-core fans usually sit. He sold tickets for 1 euro – virtually a gift to the banned fans – giving them the opportunity to paste the controversial stickers all over the enemy's terrace. The Italian Football Federation has now decided to take measures against the move.</p> \n<p>“Lotito made concessions to the hard-core fans after they engaged in racist behavior, and then he thought he could get away from the Anne Frank scandal by turning up at the synagogue with a bunch of flowers,” says Enrico Camp, another young Jew from the Rome community. “We expected concrete steps, not trivial gestures,” he concludes.</p> \n<p>“The visit came across as a rushed way to clean Lazio’s conscience,” agrees Daniele Di Nepi, a soccer fan from Rome who lives in Israel and works at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. To make matters even worse, a recording where Lotito dismissed his visit to the synagogue as a “charade” – that is, a necessary PR operation because of the widespread outrage over the stickers, rather than a sincere way to show solidarity – emerged on Wednesday. In another misstep that gave the impression he didn't take the case seriously enough, Lotitio said on a radio program that the media outrage surrounding the Anne Frank stickers could be a conspiracy against Lazio, “because we are doing so well this season.”</p> \n<p>In the aftermath of the scandal, the Italian Football Federation deemed that passages from Anne Frank’s famous diary would be read ahead of this week’s matches in the Italian Serie A league. On Wednesday evening, referees gave copies of the book, along with Primo Levi’s &quot;The Drowned and the Saved,&quot; to the captains of the teams, who in turn gave it to the children who traditionally walk them to the pitch. But these measures are not effective, members of Rome's Jewish community told Haaretz. “It is extremely stupid and wrong to treat the current incidents as an episode, and to try to address them with an emergency response,” said Camp. “Racism is a structural, long-standing problem for Italian soccer, which includes not only anti-Semitism but also discrimination against black players and territorial discrimination against the poorer regions of Italy’s south.”</p> \n<p>In yet another expression of racism, a few days ago, fans of the Benevento club from the southern province with the same name put up a banner calling their former coach a “Gypsy” after a series of bad losses for their team. Southern supporters are often mocked as “terroni,” a derogatory term which literally means “people of the land” or “farmers,” by their rivals.</p> \n<p>Lazio’s hooligans were genuinely surprised at the public's outrage to their Anne Frank stickers, since their recent behavior isn’t any different than what they have consistently been doing for decades. Di Nepi thinks it will not go away: “Sometimes a scandal on racism in Italian soccer erupts, people kick up a big fuss about it and then everything goes back to where it was before,” he says. “Racism among hooligans is a problem for most Italian teams.” His friend Daniele Regard agrees. “It takes more than a few readings of Anne Frank or some flowers to solve such a deep-rooted, profound cultural problem,” he says. Many hard-core supporters across Italy did not react well to the exchange of books about the Holocaust in the pitch, chanting disrespectful slogans or ignoring the event altogether. Supporters of the Ascoli club went as far as purposely remaining outside of the stadium when the ceremony took place ahead of their team’s match.</p> \n<p>“If anything, the current round of measures against anti-Semitism will make the phenomenon go bigger. The Jews will come across as annoying, as always behaving like they are victims,” says Clemente Mimun, a prominent Italian journalist who happens to be both a Jew and a Lazio fan. As someone who knows Lazio well, he swears that Lotito actually had long years of conflict with the hooligans and that he is not complicit when it comes to racism and anti-Semitism. “Israeli ambassador Ehud Gol used to sit next to him at Lazio matches,” he recalls, even though he admits giving out tickets to banned ultra fans two weeks ago was a mistake on Lotito's part.</p> \n<p>Politically, the Jewish community in Rome has been closer aligned to the right to the left in the last few years. But when the most conservative segment of the right bring up references to their fascist past and proudly uphold them, the entire community feels a deep sense of unease. Mimun, who is 64, says that he suffers a great deal from the racism of the fans of the very team he supports: &quot;Soccer was the last game connecting me to my childhood, and they broke it, I don’t know if I will be able to go to the stadium anymore, I’m so pained and angry.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Research into ancient Egyptian records from the 12th century B.C.E. is shedding new light on a mystery archaeologists have been debating for decades: the origin of the Philistines and other marauding “Sea Peoples” that appeared in the Levant during the late Bronze Age.</p> \n<p>The research, and other recent discoveries, suggest the enigmatic Philistines may have been a native Middle Eastern population, rather than invading pirates from the Aegean islands, as traditional scholarship holds.</p> \n<p>The Philistines may also have played a much less nefarious role than previously thought in the sudden and unexplained collapse of great civilizations – including the Hittite empire, Egypt and Mycenae – that occurred around the 12th century BCE.</p> \n<p>“We shouldn’t think of the Philistines and the other Sea Peoples as this huge coalition of Mediterranean fighters who whoosh through the land and destroy everything in their way,” says Shirly Ben-Dor Evian, the curator of Egyptian archaeology at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, whose doctoral research at Tel Aviv University resulted in the article published last week in the Oxford Journal of Archaeology.</p> \n<p>Biblical influences</p> \n<p>The study reinterprets ancient Egyptian records from the reign of Pharaoh Ramses III, which have long been known to researchers and have formed the basis of what we know about the early history of the Sea Peoples, of which the Philistines were just one group.</p> \n<p>The so-called Harris Papyrus, a biography of Ramses III written under his son and successor Ramses IV, tells us that the pharaoh defeated the &quot;Peleset&quot; – as the Egyptians called the Philistines and other Sea Peoples early in his reign (around 1190 B.C.E.) and brought them back as captives to his lands.</p> \n<p>Historians have used this document to explain how the Philistines first settled on the southern coastal plain of Canaan: They were brought there as prisoners and then gained independence when Egyptian control over Canaan waned a few decades later, just in time to become the wicked archenemies of the Israelites described in the Bible.</p> \n<p>But there is a problem with that interpretation, Ben-Dor Evian notes. The papyrus literally says the defeated foes were “brought as captives to Egypt,” not Canaan, and “settled in strongholds” there.</p> \n<p>Previous generations of scholars may have been too eager to interpret Egyptian texts to fit the Biblical narrative, she says.</p> \n<p>“We know from the Bible that the Philistines lived in five main cities – Gaza, Ekron, Gath, Ashkelon and Ashdod, and we know that Gaza used to be an Egyptian fortress so we put two and two together and say: ‘Aha, Ramses settled them in Gaza,’” Ben-Dor Evian explains. “But this papyrus was written in the 12th century B.C.E., while the Bible, most scholars today agree, was probably written much later.”</p> \n<p>Resettling prisoners in the heartland of the empire, rather than in peripheral areas like Canaan, was common Egyptian practice, Ben-Dor Evian says (and the Israelites would experience similar treatment at the hands of the Babylonians centuries later).</p> \n<p>There is evidence that the captives “from the Great Green” – one of the terms with which the Egyptians referred to the Sea Peoples – were probably resettled in the west of the Nile Delta region, and may have even been pressed into military service. A different papyrus from Ramses’ time tells us that the pharaoh mobilized 100 Philistines and 200 Sherden (another of the Sea Peoples) to help deal with a Libyan rebellion to the west of Egypt. This would only make sense if the warriors were close at hand – rather than far off to the east in Canaan, Ben-Dor Evian argues.</p> \n<p>A vicious enemy, or embellishment by Ramses?</p> \n<p>But where did those defeated Philistines originally hail from?</p> \n<p>The answer may come from inscriptions and reliefs found at Medinet Habu, Ramses’ funerary temple, which describe the pharaoh’s campaigns against the Sea Peoples, depicting two large battles, one at land and one at sea. The reliefs do not give names for their locations, and traditional scholarship held the battles were coordinated assaults that occurred almost at the same time in northern Sinai and the mouths of the Nile. But not all agree.</p> \n<p>“There was this vision of a coordinated attack form land and sea,” Ben-Dor Evian says.&nbsp; “It’s part of the allure of the Sea Peoples: they were so good that they could coordinate their attacks on Egypt on land and sea at a time when there was no instant communication.”</p> \n<p>But the battle reliefs at Medinet Habu are not connected; they are interrupted by a scene of Ramses hunting lions, suggesting the two encounters probably happened at very different places and times. Furthermore, the land battle scene is accompanied by depictions of humped oxen and carts carrying women and children.</p> \n<p>These images, previously interpreted as further evidence of a mass migration of the Sea Peoples from foreign lands, are actually standard iconography used to identify locations in Syria and the northern Levant, Ben-Dor Evian says.</p> \n<p>“Egyptian war reliefs don’t contain a location for a battle, because the reliefs are on the outside of the temple, and most people can’t read so there’s no point in writing,” she told Haaretz in an interview. “They used artistic conventions, icons, just like we do.”</p> \n<p>Further confirming the northern context of the land battle is an inscription at the temple, describing the Sea Peoples as a scourge that had made a camp in Amurru after laying waste to Hatti (the Hittite empire), Alashiya, Carchemish and Arzawa.</p> \n<p>All these kingdoms – except for Alashiya, which was in Cyprus – were located between modern-day southeast Turkey and northern Syria.</p> \n<p>This list of terrifying deeds is likely historically inaccurate, Ben-Dor Evian notes: the Hittite empire had already fallen decades before Ramses’ campaign, while Carchemish is one of the few cities that was not destroyed during the Bronze Age collapse.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Ramses was trying to justify his decision to go to war, or was making his foes look more powerful than they were to aggrandize his victory. If so, his propaganda effort worked so well that thousands of years later this inscription is still the basis for viewing the Sea Peoples as an all-powerful military machine that swept, barbarian-invasion-style, through the entire Mediterranean.</p> \n<p>As the Hittites fell</p> \n<p>Ben-Dor Evian suggests that while piracy by the Sea Peoples and warfare may have contributed to weaken the great empires of the age, we need to look elsewhere for the main causes of the Bronze Age collapse, such as the increasing complexity of those civilizations and the difficulties centralized powers faced in sustaining them. In 2013, a study by Tel Aviv University added climate fluctuation to the list of possible culprits, showing a long period of drought in the late Bronze Age that may have driven mass migration and conflict.</p> \n<p>As for the origins of the Philistines, Ben-Dor Evian says it seems likely the people Ramses III defeated may have been simply locals from Syria or Anatolia who filled the vacuum created by the fall of the Hittite empire.</p> \n<p>A Levantine origin for the Philistines is further supported, she says, by the fact that the Medinet Habu inscriptions identify the Sea Peoples as teher – the same term reserved to describe Syrian or Anatolian warriors allied with the Hittites during the battle of Kadesh, the great clash that Ramses II had won against his northern foes around 1274 B.C.E., nearly a century earlier.</p> \n<p>“So, they were not this unknown group that suddenly appeared out of nowhere,” Ben-Dor Evian concludes.</p> \n<p>The Aegean hypothesis fights back</p> \n<p>Some archeological discoveries also seem to support this view. The presence at Philistine sites of Aegean-style pottery, long seen as evidence of their Greek origin, has now been shown to be a local imitation of Cypriot earthenware.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the discovery at Tel Tayinat, in southeastern Turkey, of several inscriptions referring to the kingdom of “Palastin” or “Palasatini” also suggests the Philistines may have started as a neo-Hittite power in the northern Levant and later migrated south as the Egyptians lost control of Canaan in the mid 12th century.</p> \n<p>That does not mean that the Aegean hypothesis has completely lost steam. Archeologists who last year uncovered the first Philistine cemetery ever found, in ancient Ashkelon, have described the burials there as typically Aegean.</p> \n<p>It is likely that the Philistine culture that emerged in southern Canaan was the result of various influences and migratory waves from different locations across the Mediterranean, says Aren Maeir, a professor of archaeology at Bar-Ilan University who heads the excavation at Tell es-Safi, the site of ancient Gath.</p> \n<p>“In the material culture of the early Philistines we see something from Greece, from Cyprus, from Crete, from western Anatolia,” Maeir told Haaretz in a telephone interview.</p> \n<p>The archaeologist does agree with Ben-Dor Evian that the Philistines appeared earlier than previously thought and have been unfairly characterized as particularly warlike invaders.</p> \n<p>“We see many people of different origins who settled aside the Canaanite inhabitants,” he said. “Despite some localized destruction, most of the Canaanite sites continue to exist peacefully alongside the Philistine ones.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“The Jews of Ankara are so far and few between that I can fit them all around my dining room table,” says Israel's ambassador to Turkey, Eitan Na’eh, as he surveys the congregants for Yom Kippur services in the nearly empty synagogue.</p> \n<p>Located in Ulus, the tumbling old quarter of Turkey’s capital, the synagogue dates back to the 19th century and was radically refurbished by an Italian architect in 1906. Na’eh is surrounded by a sea of little carpets that are laid out on the synagogue benches, which remain unoccupied throughout the holy day.</p> \n<p>In 1923, Mustafa Kemal&nbsp;Ataturk&nbsp;proclaimed Ankara the capital of&nbsp;the newly founded&nbsp;Turkish republic, but the history of the city — and that of its Jewish community — date back much further.</p> \n<p>The Jewish community of Ankara can be traced back to the biblical period. The Byzantine-era Jews, known as Romaniots, inhabited central Anatolia well before a wave of thousands of Sephardi Jews came to the region following their expulsion from Spain in 1492. The community peaked at about 5,000 members in the 1930s, according to researcher Enver Arcak, who has produced a new documentary, “Hermana,” (“Sister” in Spanish) on the history of the local Jews.</p> \n<p>Ankara’s Jewish community now numbers a mere 24 people, and that includes the Jewish members of the diplomatic corps and UN officials posted in the city. Just a few of the 24 turned up promptly for the start of Saturday morning’s Yom Kippur service, which was led by a rabbi sent from Istanbul. It took several hours and many desperate phone calls to gather a minyan, the minimum of 10 male Jews required to start the prayers.</p> \n<p>“When I was a child the whole neighborhood of Samanpazari of Ulus was bustling with Jewish life,” bemoans Can Ozgun, president of the local Jewish community. “The synagogue was open every day,” adds Moshe, one of the community elders.</p> \n<p>“Now I only open it once or twice a year,” Ozgun says, fidgeting with the keys to the synagogue. The rest of the year Ozgun is rarely available, declining requests to open the synagogue for curious passersby.</p> \n<p>In his documentary, Arcak tries to identify the key turning points in the Jewish depopulation of Ankara and the region. “Thousands of Jews, as well as Greeks and Armenians, were forced to leave Turkey in 1942 after the issuing of the so-called levy on wealth and extraordinary profits,” he says. “The tax was deliberately tailored to transfer their riches to ethnic Turks by requesting sums from the minorities that they were unable to pay.”</p> \n<p>Against the backdrop of an economic slump following World War II, another wave of Turkish Jews left for the newly founded State of Israel, Arcak explains. While Turkey’s neutrality during WWII helped save the Turkish community from the fate of European Jewry, Turkey did not prove immune to the postwar economic downturn that crippled much of Europe. Like many other Europeans, Ankara’s Jews packed their bags to search for better economic fortunes overseas, heading to North America and Israel; others settled closer to home, in Istanbul and Izmir.</p> \n<p>By the 1960s and '70s, the Jews of Ankara numbered 500 to 600 people. “We would sit in the right-hand corner [of the synagogue] squeezed together,” recalls Ozgun’s wife, Vicky. “That’s where the young people would sit, and our mothers would sit on the central balcony over there,” she continues, pointing to the empty, dusty women’s balcony above. Broken neon lights flicker above the terrace. On the ornate ceiling, with cracked, peeling paint, a chandelier dangles above us, half its bulbs burned out.</p> \n<p>Moshe was born across the street from the synagogue in 1948 and is a proud speaker of Ladino, the Judeo-Spanish dialect. “We are the last generation to keep the language alive,” he says. Moshe and his wife grew up in the Jewish quarter of the old city, which lies below the Roman citadel. “We moved away from Ulus in 1956 toward Kizilay, the modern central quarter of the city, where there was running water and electricity; we then moved upward toward Ayranci, the city’s hilly residential area,” he recalls.</p> \n<p>Moshe now lives in a modern high-rise apartment block a far cry from the abandoned houses in front of the synagogue, in the heart of what is now the slums of Ulus. “With the jobs [available] in Istanbul, people moved on,” he says, especially as they became less involved in civil service and government institutions in the capital. Most Jews are in trade and found better work opportunities on the Bosphorus, he adds.</p> \n<p>With the exception of some 1,400 Jews who live in Izmir, Istanbul is home to almost all of Turkey’s 17,000 Jews. But there, too, the community has been shrinking. As many as 500 Jews have left for Israel since the July 2016 failed coup that ushered in another era of political and economic instability in Turkey. Of those who have remained, thousands have obtained Spanish and Portuguese citizenship, based on laws passed in both countries offering citizenship to descendants of Jews exiled from the Iberian Peninsula in 1492.</p> \n<p>As Yom Kippur draws to a close, one of the elderly women of the community slumps down in her chair next to me. “It breaks my heart that he married a Muslim,” she laments while flicking through her phone showing me pictures of her son’s wedding, where he is pictured standing next to a pretty Turkish woman in a d&eacute;collet&eacute; dress.</p> \n<p>The last wedding in Ankara’s synagogue was held in 2008; the one before that, 16 years earlier. With the closing prayers of Yom Kippur, she slips her phone back in her purse, and the muezzin's call from the local mosque echoes through the broken window. Before long, she grabs her phone again, this time to film the pinnacle of the Yom Kippur prayers, the ne’ila, and send the clip to her son.</p> \n<p>When it comes to religious observance, the community is very relaxed, with members using their phones in the synagogue. Indeed, the Jews of Istanbul make fun of the president of the Ankara community, Ozgun, who is a wholesale supplier of non-kosher meat.</p> \n<p>Before the closing prayers and the symbolic shutting of the front door, the women fuss over Can and Vicky’s daughter, a tall woman in her early 20s, with long brown hair. “You have to go to Israel to find yourself a husband darling,” one of the women tells her. “Hedi, hedi,” they add for good measure — the Turkish word for “c’mon.”</p> \n<p>Intermarriage has played as important a role in the disappearance of the local community as migration has.</p> \n<p>“We can’t remember the last person to have used the mikveh,” says Hannah, one of Ankara’s elderly Jews, referring to the ritual bath where a woman immerses herself before her wedding. “It must be somewhere around here,” she adds. “I assume it’s under some rubble around the synagogue. When I was married we used the hamam,” she chuckles, referring to the Turkish bath.</p> \n<p>The last rabbi of Ankara’s community immigrated to Israel in the 1980s. In the wake of a coup in 1980, the community sent half of its Torah scrolls to Israel for safekeeping, but they have gone missing, say local Jews. In the run-up to the military takeover that year, which included violent clashes between left-wing and right-wing factions in universities and public places, many Jews and other Turks left for good.</p> \n<p>At the end of the Yom Kippur service the Torah scrolls are taken to a back room, more of a former janitor’s cubby hole for safekeeping, “in case they are stolen or if there is a fire,” says Meir, a younger member of the community, who clings to the scrolls tightly.</p> \n<p>Ozgun, holder of the key and president of the tiny community, ushers the few remaining Jews out the door and flicks the lights off. “Will see you next year, Inshallah,” Vicky waves as she watches her husband lock the gates of the centuries-old synagogue. Before she bids her final goodbye she turns and adds, “that is, if we are still here next year.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“You shall rejoice in your festival.” In honor of the Sukkot festival the State of Israel is imposing a closure of 11 days on the entire West Bank, and nobody is objecting. The left is exhausted and in despair, the center is indifferent and silent, the right is probably pleased. For most Israelis it seems reasonable that in response to a single terror attack by a single terrorist, a prolonged siege is being imposed on millions of people. Second class people, of course, the kind whose movement and livelihood can be restricted for a week and a half, so that the members of the Chosen People can celebrate in peace and quiet in their sukkahs and travel comfortably all over the Promised Land.</p> \n<p>The attack is of course only an excuse. Nor is this a precedent, it’s actually routine. Only the unusual length gives some emphasis to the cruel and draconian nature of the punishment. But this length derives mainly from the calendar, and from the way the festival and the following weekend fall on it. The truth is that for Israelis it’s already a natural situation: Every time they have holidays, the Palestinians have a closure. They can pray and ask forgiveness on Yom Kippur, praise human freedom on Passover, mark their flight from a tyrannical and oppressive government on Sukkot – and at the same time paralyze the lives of the subjects living beyond the hills of darkness. It turns out that there’s no limit to the blindness and unawareness.</p> \n<p>It’s really a grotesque historical situation. After 50 years, the involvement with the occupation and its consequences is limited to procedures, symbols, esoterica. With what passion everyone here has been involved for the past year and a half with the trial of Elor Azaria. How much verbiage has been spilled over one scene in the film “Foxtrot” and on the burning question of whether its artistic design faithfully represents reality.</p> \n<p>We argue to the skies over whether a Supreme Court justice should or should not attend an official celebration to mark the 50th anniversary of the settlements. But what about the thing itself, the way of life itself? The occupation is not a film or a ceremony. The occupation is the ability – and the ongoing choice – to forcibly steal from other human beings their land, their independence, their freedom, their movement.</p> \n<p>The present closure is characterized not only by cruelty, but by a considerable degree of cynicism as well. The only reason that really makes it possible to impose it for 11 days is economic. This is a period in which the economy is almost entirely on holiday, and there’s no need for cheap Palestinian labor.</p> \n<p>The lead editorial in Haaretz on Tuesday wondered how the entire security establishment aligned itself this time with the government of folly. How did it happen that the army, police and Shin Bet security service all stood at attention? After all, their traditional position is to enable normal life to go on. Collective punishment has been proven ineffective and is even liable to lead to the opposite results. As moderate and sober as it may be, this position also has a practical basis. First and foremost the moral discussion should be taking place, but it is has apparently been exhausted in the Azaria affair.</p> \n<p>But if the question has already been asked, there’s no escape from proposing an answer, as frightening and conspiratorial as it may be: Is it possible that the hidden motive for this vengeful, disproportionate punishment is actually the first signs of Palestinian reconciliation between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas?</p> \n<p>The last time such a reconciliation was in the cards, in the guise of a Palestinian national unity government, the Netanyahu-Bennett-Lieberman government greeted it with Operation Brother’s Keeper, which quickly led to Operation Protective Edge. It’s not clear what kind of escalation they’re preparing for us this time. But there’s no question that an 11-day siege on the Palestinians while the Jews are celebrating and having a good time sounds like a good start.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The abyss between the dominant Israeli Jewish narrative and the Arab narrative was revealed once again this week – in a conversation between journalist Yaron London and social activist Abed Abu Shehada on the TV current events program “London and Kirschenbaum.” The conversation took place due to the tension in Jaffa that arose after a young man was shot to death by police during a chase, which led to demonstrations and residents burning tires by in protest.</p> \n<p>London’s opening sentence – “A shot discharged from the weapon of a lawman in Jaffa. Police hit killed a young criminal apparently a young criminal,” already says it all. Abu Shehada, for his part, refuses to discusses details of the incident because “the police haven’t opened the file, there’s a gag order.”</p> \n<p>The starting point for Abu Shehada is “that there’s a young man who was murdered and a policeman who fired at the upper torsos of two young men,” whereas London asks him “to do justice to the facts,” but adopts the police version, which Abu Shehada rejects.</p> \n<p>Dialogue of the deaf</p> \n<p>“In your opinion, did the police shoot him because he was an Arab?” asks London, adding with false naivete, “It’s not certain that the police knew that he was even an Arab.” From here the conversation quickly developed into a dialogue of the deaf, at the end of which London preaches to the social activist authoritatively: “How about becoming involved in social activity in order to prevent crime in Jaffa?”</p> \n<p>Without a shared starting point there is no communication, understanding or dialogue. The question of what is a fact becomes a political interpretation that cannot be resolved. Like the narrators in the film “Rashomon,” each side adopts a different aspect of the story of the murder. In the Jewish-Arab Rashomon, the testimonies are contradictory and the spectator is unable to discover the truth.</p> \n<p>As someone who lives in a mixed city, researches the various aspects of life there, and is familiar with both sides, I watched the conversation and was shocked at the lack of communication. This isn’t an isolated case, but a distillation of points of view that differ so greatly that there is no possibility of any political acknowledgement. What is self-evident for Arab citizens is groundless for Jews, and vice versa. In Umm al-Hiran, Kafr Qasem and Jaffa, the conclusion of the two groups stemmed from this basic interpretative bias – the Arabs assume that the police are hostile to them and the Jews believe that the police are doing the right thing. That’s the root of the problem.</p> \n<p>The controversy is also apparent on social media and at the points of encounter and friction in the city. This is what Rima Abu Sif writes in a post that was erased by the managers of the Jaffa Community Facebook group: “Jaffa is burning. The events in Jaffa are events of survival, and if you don’t see that you’re part of the problem. Part of the 70-year-old occupation and oppression. On Shabbat the violent Israel Police murdered a boy of 20 with seven bullets in his upper torso, when he was unarmed. Fortunately for the policemen the boy is an Arab, and therefore the claims that surfaced about his criminal behavior are relevant for you, after all, boys and men in Jaffa are only criminals and policemen. Everyone in Jaffa is a criminal. Correction, all the Arabs in Jaffa are criminals.</p> \n<p>“You, ladies and gentlemen, are angels, because you weren’t born in Jaffa to an Arab family, lucky you,” Abu Sif continued. “You’re the problem, and if you don’t support our protest, you’ll only prove that you’re here for hummus, French fries, salad and a Jaffa landscape, without the Jaffa residents. In Jaffa there’s no coexistence, because there’s no existence in the first place. You have a right to close your eyes, but when it harms you personally because you didn’t stand together with your Jaffa neighbors, don’t come to us with complaints.”</p> \n<p>Two days after the untimely death of the 20-year-old, Jaffa is full of vans belonging to the traffic police, the Yasam special police patrol unit and the Border Police. Jaffa is once again being singled out as an area of violence, and Jews who aren’t locals are staying away from the city. Tense young Arabs are walking the streets in groups. The tension is hovering in the air, but the balance of terror is being maintained. The shooting and the police’s handling of the ensuing events place a frightening mirror before Israeli society.</p> \n<p>Stupidity or conspiracy?</p> \n<p>There are two possible interpretations regarding police involvement: The first is a combination of faulty judgment and systemic stupidity, and the second hints at a Machievellian-like conspiracy. It’s hard to assess whether the police simply acted with a lack of understanding stemming from human error, or with over-sophistication whose objective was to heat things up in order to demonstrate their power and show who’s boss in the neighborhood. For the purpose of the discussion, let’s start with the basic assumption that the system is rational, we’ll let the police off easy and assume that this is a matter of stupidity and a reaction triggered by fear.</p> \n<p>There are several conclusions to be reached from the events. In light of the other incidents on the Temple Mount last week, the police should have behaved with added caution and restraint. The atmosphere in Jaffa is tense in any case, and the alienation between the Arab – and especially the Muslim – population and the state and its representatives who walk around in the city like sheriffs, is at a dangerous height.</p> \n<p>According to police procedure, a police chase will take place only when there is no real chance of harming innocent people, when it doesn’t constitute a greater danger to the police, the suspect and passersby than the crime committed by the suspect; and when it is a reasonable alternative, and there is no other way of arresting the suspect.</p> \n<p>In principle, an escaped criminal is preferable to a dead one. In a properly administered country, property damage is preferable to bodily harm. In the riots throughout France in 2005, rioters set fire to about 10,000 vehicles and about 126 policemen were wounded, but the police didn’t harm civilians. Whereas in the riots in Israel in October 2000 – the start of the second intifada – Arab demonstrators blocked roads in the Triangle and Galilee, threw rocks and in some cases set businesses on fire, and in response policemen shot and killed 13 demonstrators.</p> \n<p>In Jaffa too, according to testimony from the field, after the shooting incident the Abu Kabir national forensic institute delayed the release of the body to the family and aroused the anger of the crowds. The riots began in a random, disorganized manner, but intensified due to the harassment of one of the young men by the Yasam.</p> \n<p>The immediate association is police treatment of black individuals in the United States, who are at times shot while innocent of any crime, due to the “mistaken judgment” of the frightened policeman, which Americans call “subjective danger.” There as here, in most cases the policeman who fired is acquitted. In the United States it’s a matter of cognitive racism, which subconsciously identifies a black man as a potential violent attacker.</p> \n<p>In many ways, the demonstrations on the streets of Jaffa are similar in spirit to the Black Lives Matter movement. On Monday night a young man stood alone in Hashnayim Garden on Yefet Street holding a sign: “51 Arab citizens have been murdered by the police since October 2000. Who’s next?”</p> \n<p>The second comparison arises when we compare the military treatment of Arab citizens by the police (in Umm al-Hiran, Kafr Qasem and Jaffa) to the gentle handling of violent Haredim and settlers by the same police force. We remind you that the police arrive unarmed to handle the evacuation of illegal outposts, and amazingly the incident usually ends without civilian casualties. (During the evacuation of Amona, about 60 unarmed policemen were hurt, some from acid, with no casualties among the settlers.)</p> \n<p>The careful thought invested in dialogue with the settlers’ leadership and the kid gloves with which senior police officers handle the most extremist settlers are in evidence only after the fact in Arab communities, when officers arrive only afterwards to arrange a sulha (peace-making) with the bereaved families. The difference cries out to the heavens and every intelligent young Arab understands, in the words of Israeli film hero Kazablan, “They spit at you and say it’s rain.”</p> \n<p>Leader was born, too</p> \n<p>Another conclusion points to the unplanned results of the ferment on the Arab street. In Jaffa children walk around with phosphorescent shirts bearing the dead youth’s name in large letters. A shahid was born in Jaffa, and he symbolizes the regime of force that discriminates between Arab and Jewish blood. The violent and widely covered arrest (accompanied by the curses of the commander of the police station) of Abed Abu Shehada, a representative in the elected Islamic Council and a Balad party activist, led to another unplanned result: A leader was born. Like the famous arrest of social activist Daphni Leef, the act of police violence is consolidating the status of Abu Shehada as an authentic local leader who doesn’t hesitate to lead the community at a most difficult hour.</p> \n<p>Abu Shehada is a community and political activist who is well known and admired in the community as a balanced and pragmatic person, since the days of the social protest in 2011. He is a critical academic who writes razor-sharp articles in Hebrew, Arabic and English (mainly on the Haokets website). But like former MK Azmi Bishara before him and Marwan Barghouti in the West Bank, he constitutes a threat, and some claim that that’s why he was arrested. When it comes to the policy of the defense establishment and the Jaffa police, it seems that the more things change, they more they stay the same. The Arabs are the same Arabs, the sea is the same sea. It won’t end well.</p>",

        "text":["<p>After 10 years in the media and four years as host of Channel 2's early-evening current affairs program &quot;Sichat Hayom,&quot; (&quot;The Talk of the Day&quot;) Lucy Aharish has made it into prime time. On Wednesday, Channel 2 launched Aharish's interview show &quot;Hamashpi’im&quot; (&quot;The Influential Ones&quot;).</p> \n<p>For her debut show, Aharish, the highest-profile Israeli Arab on Israeli TV, interviewed a former defense minister and chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Moshe Ya’alon. They covered issues including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the trial of Elor Azaria, the soldier who shot an already incapacitated Palestinian assailant in Hebron last year. There was of course also plenty of criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>Still, Aharish managed a conversational tone, not an adversarial one. She reflects rather than probes.</p> \n<p>“I mainly wanted to adopt a documentary style,” she responds to a question on why she switched from a rough current-events program to a more magazine-like format. “It’s fun to talk to people and discover who they are beyond the TV persona that emerges in 10-minute interviews. Behind every image there's a person whose existence we sometimes forget.”</p> \n<p>The choice of Ya’alon for your maiden program was no accident. Is it related to him being one of the prime minister’s bluntest critics?</p> \n<p>“I don’t think that choosing Ya’alon was a political decision. We chose him because for me he's a riveting character. One can agree or disagree with him but he’s someone who has seen a lot of ups and downs in the last two years, with some dangerous things said about him in that period. For me, personally, it rankles that a person who has given his entire life to the country is labeled a leftist, a traitor and an enemy of the state, only because he chose to stick to his principles.</p> \n<p>&quot;For me, this is precisely the place where people forget that these are people with a history behind them. In Ya’alon’s case it was very striking in the Elor Azaria case and in the submarine affair [regarding suspected corruption in Israel's procuring of German submarines]. He’s called a traitor and a whiner, and I think he was wronged. It’s time to see the human being behind the image.”</p> \n<p>And yet, when Ya’alon says there's no solution to the occupation, you don’t give him a hard time. Didn’t you want to challenge him on that?</p> \n<p>“We had a day with 14 hours of taping, with nine hours of raw material at the end. From that we had to reduce it to half an hour of broadcasting. I think all possible questions were asked, beginning with what he eats for breakfast and ending with his Pilates exercises. We had a lot of material in the editing room, but my aim isn't to batter the interviewees over every issue.</p> \n<p>&quot;In two months I start another current-events show with Ehud Segal, and there I can ask the tough questions. When I interviewed Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked I also didn’t ask her all the burning questions.</p> \n<p>&quot;Ultimately, I don’t get the chance every day to spend a day with the justice minister and see her meeting author Meir Shalev, whom she describes as a person who greatly influenced her. I’m trying to make a statement that it’s okay if we don’t see things eye to eye but can still see the person behind the image that we’ve so forcefully branded.”</p> \n<p>In &quot;Sichat Hayom&quot; you invited radical right-wing activist Bentzion Gopstein to the studio and you got abuse. </p> \n<p>“Gopstein and his ilk won't be on the new program. He affects very specific people and only a particularly vocal minority — I don’t think they should be given a platform. You sometimes make a mistake in life, but you don’t have to repeat it.”</p> \n<p>Do you still receive threats to your life following things you’ve said on TV?</p> \n<p>“Just two weeks ago I filed a complaint with the police over a 16-year-old who sent me a video with his photo, saying he was coming to beat me up. He ended up spitting on the screen. It reached my Facebook inbox.</p> \n<p>&quot;To the police’s credit they dealt with this quickly. He arrived at the police station with his parents and got a warning. I experience this on a daily basis and I think the conversation I want to advance on my program is connected to this issue. I want to show that we can get along as human beings even if we disagree politically. I know it’s a clich&eacute; but that’s my motto.”</p> \n<p>Aharish doesn’t hide her excitement about her entry to prime time. “It’s very significant for me,” she says. “I’ve come a long way in the media world to get to this point. I still pinch myself to make sure it’s really happening. Some people believe it came easily and I just got things effortlessly, but they forget that I entered this world as a breaking-news announcer on Channel 10 in 2007. Since then I’ve gone through a long process.”</p> \n<p>Would you have made it to this point quicker if you were Jewish?</p> \n<p>“I think it would have been easier. In contrast, if I were a Mizrahi [Middle Eastern] Jew from the country's outskirts with a family name like Abutbul, would my life have been easier? If I were Ethiopian would it have been easier? My situation is similar to that of many people who face difficulties. It’s true that not every Arab correspondent gets to where I've gotten, but if I’m here it has the sweet taste of victory. I've worked hard and I’ve made it.”</p> \n<p>Do you think we’ll see an Arab news anchor on Channel 2 or 10? </p> \n<p>“I think that will also happen. At the end of the days of the 'Mabat' news magazine they had a Druze newscaster. The public has been ready for it much earlier than decision-makers in news corporations are.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Israeli public has no problem with Arab presenters. We’re no longer in a place where Natasha Mozgovaya's accent annoyed so many people. When I’m in 'Sichat Hayom' and transfer to the newsroom, with Shibel Karmi Mansour presenting the news, with him handing it over to a report by Furat Nasser, you suddenly realize there are three Arabs in one frame. That’s a huge change, a welcome one.”</p> \n<p>To what extent will a proper representation of the Arab community in your new program be important to you?</p> \n<p>“We’ve already taped an episode with Hisham Suliman. He's undoubtedly one of the most influential actors in Israel. He played the terrorist in the series 'Fauda.' To be the most beloved 'terrorist' in Israel and receive such adulation attests to an essential change. If I don’t give Arabs their representation, what will others say?”</p> \n<p>There has been criticism, such as by the team producing the satire &quot;Matzav Ha’uma&quot; (&quot;State of the Union&quot;), implying that Channel 2 franchisee Reshet isn't sufficiently open to political opinions outside the consensus. Aharish, who opened every &quot;Sichat Hayom&quot; episode with a political monologue, argues that Reshet never censored a word she wrote or said.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know what happened with 'Matzav Ha’uma,' but we address many social agendas on our program,&quot; she says. &quot;Even when we dealt with topics connected to Reshet shareholders, no one tried to cancel any item, never. Personally, I’ve never encountered this in the four years I’ve been working here.”</p> \n<p>Is it possible that you’ve never been censored because your opinions are relatively easy to digest?</p> \n<p>“It amuses me that there are people who think that. It’s enough to go to the 'Sichat Hayom’ Facebook page to see how easy it is for the public to digest my opinions. If easy-to-digest opinions encounter such threats and violence, I don’t know what hard-to-digest opinions are.”</p> \n<p>Do you see yourself as an influential figure in Israel?</p> \n<p>“If I have some impact in my own little patch and can move something a little for someone, that means that getting up in the morning and going to work are worth it.”</p> \n<p>Who's the person who most influenced you?</p> \n<p>“Beyond the obvious — my family — the person who affected me the most was Meir Cohen, a former social affairs minster and my high school teacher. He fought for me, the only Arab student at that school, on many fronts.</p> \n<p>&quot;I was a high school student in the '90s, during all those awful terror attacks. Besides my parents, who were like a protective wall, I don’t know where I’d be today without Meir Cohen. I wouldn’t have survived high school without him.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>BOSTON – When I told friends that my 10-year-old daughter was going to be spending a month at overnight camp this summer, I got two totally different responses. Most Jewish friends melted into nostalgia for their own camp days and gushed over how much she was going to love it. But several non-Jewish friends and Israeli friends gave me bewildered looks and asked: How can you bear to be away from your daughter for so long?</p> \n<p>Although I know Jews are not the only ones to send their kids for month or longer sessions at an overnight camp, I became curious: How did such camps, specifically Jewish ones, became such a quintessential part of summer for generations of American Jews? And what is the draw today for parents and kids?</p> \n<p>The secret sauce seems to lie in the possibility of slipping into another world – often wooded and alongside a lake – where a fun way of being Jewish is baked in along with the requisite campfires, hikes and color wars (and, more recently, the addition of everything from organic farming to coding and even surfing-themed camps), with friends one’s own age and young counselors in an immersive, weeks-long experience lived and breathed together.</p> \n<p>“Jewish life is not being shoved at you by authorities like parents or teachers at home and it's more egalitarian, and you are outside. Everything is led by youth. It’s more creative and more of a choice. I think it lodges a kind of a more personalized Jewish identity somewhere deep,” said Libby Lenkinski, who spent many summers at Camp Shomria in the Catskills Mountains of New York State, a camp associated with the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement. She now chairs the movement's board, and also serves as vice president of public engagement for the New Israel Fund.</p> \n<p>Lenkinski credits summer camp as the formative experience of her life, shaping her ideas of Jewish community and leadership. “And whether true or not, you feel as kid you are part of creating those rituals and making a decision about those rituals, as opposed to learning a bunch of Hebrew words and reciting them together. [This] makes for a different kind of ownership and sustained connection,” she added.</p> \n<p>'Wrapped up with joyfulness'</p> \n<p>For David Adelson, dean of the New York campus of Hebrew Union College, a Reform movement seminary, whose son was the third generation in his family to go to Jewish sleep-away camp – this sense of immersion is what it’s all about.</p> \n<p>“In American religious life, religious and spiritual life feels very separate from the rest of life,” Rabbi Adelson told Haaretz. However, he added, at camp, “the Jewishness is wrapped up with joyfulness of playing and being surrounded by deep connection. All of it happens, it’s all of a piece. That’s powerful and identity-building and it's happy.”</p> \n<p>“Whereas American Jewish parents may agonize over whether to send kids to Hebrew school or not and wonder what it will do for their identities, they know that at summer camp, their kids will be happy while having their Jewish experience and it will be effective,” said Adelson, who is a faculty member at the Reform-affiliated Eisner Camp in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts.</p> \n<p>The research seems to back this up: A 2011 study found that individuals who had attended Jewish summer camps were more likely to attend and to be members of synagogues, and more likely to contribute to Jewish causes. An early study, in 2010, found that the overnight camps have played the key role in grooming future leaders of the Jewish community: Some two-thirds of these individuals had spent summers at them.</p> \n<p>“This is where people find their Jewish role models, find Jewish friends and forge a lifelong connection to being Jewish and to joyous Judaism,” said Jeremy Fingerman, who heads the Foundation for Jewish Camp, which advises and advocates on behalf of the summer camps. “For me it’s that smile, it’s the joy of being Jewish – not the chore of it all” that makes camp work, he added.</p> \n<p>This summer some 90,000 children went to Jewish sleep-away camps – about 15 percent of all U.S. Jewish children, according to Fingerman. Some were spending their first summer at one of these camps and as such, were eligible to receive a grant of up to $1,000 as part of FJC's Happy Camper program. Some 80 percent of recipients sign up for a second year of camp, he noted, after getting the foundation grant the first year.</p> \n<p>That kind of funding can be essential for families, since camp – even the nonprofit ones that are supported by the foundation – don’t come cheap: The cost on average for a week at these camps is $1,100, according to FJC and most sessions are about a month long.&nbsp;These are big operations, with staffs to pay, extensive logistics, food to supply and prepare, year-long planning and high insurance costs.</p> \n<p>Historical roots</p> \n<p>The historical roots of Jewish overnight summer camps began with the rise of the American camping movement in the late 19th century. This included YMCA and Fresh Air Fund camps, which worked to bring children, many of them immigrants, out of the overcrowded, sweltering cities into the open spaces and healthy air of the countryside. I myself went to one of those camps for two summers, Camp Louise in Maryland's Cascade Mountains. It was founded to cater to Jewish girls from inner-city Baltimore, some of them already employed as factory workers.</p> \n<p>Some of those immigrant Jewish children would have found the rustic camp experience familiar from Europe, where some belonged to organizations like Blau-Weiss, an early Zionist youth movement whose members – my great uncle among them – would trek through the mountains and countryside, mirroring their counterparts in German youth movements.</p> \n<p>But although the youngsters at these then-philanthropically funded camps in America may have been Jewish, there was little about the camps that was educationally Jewish in any way. Instead, most of them were focused on acculturating immigrant children into American life. Some, however, were ideologically driven camps with a majority of Jewish campers, like Camp Kinderland in the Berkshires.</p> \n<p>Kinderland was founded by the Workman’s Circle in 1923 with a leftist-socialist inspired ethos that prevails today – and which also made it the target of investigation during the McCarthy era. There were also Yiddish-speaking camps and Zionist camps modeled as training farms for kibbutz life.</p> \n<p>Then came the 1941 to 1952 era, a period that Jonathan Sarna, professor of Jewish history at Brandeis, a second-generation Jewish camper and alum of Camp Ramah Palmer, describes as “the crucial decade of Jewish camping.”</p> \n<p>“It’s when it was discovered that it (camp) can also be a venue for Jewish education,” said Sarna.</p> \n<p>That’s when the denominational camps affiliated with America's Reform, Conservative and Orthodox movements were launched, as well as other experiments in Jewish education, from Hebrew-immersion camps to camps that functioned as summer schools of Jewish learning.</p> \n<p>Today Jewish sleep-away camps are considered a cornerstone of Jewish education.</p> \n<p>For example, Rabbi Adelson taught an elective at Camp Eisner this summer on Jewish mindfulness practice. The camp also featured interactive activities that demonstrated the values of good behavior toward one another and the world, the concept of tzedakah, or charity, and justice.</p> \n<p>FJC's Fingerman likes to call such camps the “laboratories of Jewish life.”</p> \n<p>At pick-up day in July at Camp Young Judaea Sprout Lake in New York State, where my daughter spent her first summer session away, parents crowded into a sprawling white tent, happily reunited with their children after almost a month’s separation. Hebrew songs blasted from the loudspeakers as various bunks came up to show off newly learned line dances, and campers described highlights of their session, including volunteering at soup kitchens and making sandwiches for the homeless.</p> \n<p>“Did we have fun?” Did we make a difference?” Helene Drobenare, Sprout Lake's director asked the rows of campers sitting in the grass before her, noting the camp’s focus on social action.</p> \n<p>Cheers and whoops rose up from the children in happy reply.</p> \n<p>Sci-tech and outdoors</p> \n<p>Speciality camps are the latest development in Jewish camping, echoing specialization seen in other camps around the country. Since a 2010 grant was made by the Jim Joseph Foundation to the FJC, 11 new such camps have opened. They are aimed in part on attracting kids, particularly teenagers, who would not normally have chosen to go to a Jewish camp.</p> \n<p>Among them are the Reform movement’s Six Points Sci-Tech Academy camp, located in a boarding school north of Boston, where 450 youngsters and teens spent the summer doing robotics, gaming and chemistry along with celebrating Shabbat and other Jewish activities, as well as a Ramah camp of the Conservative movement that boasts a rugged outdoor experience in Colorado's Rocky Mountains. There are also plans for a Jewish filmmaking camp and another one focused on the performing arts.</p> \n<p>One of the first of these specialty camps was Eden Village, the first environmental, organic farm-to-table Jewish camp, which opened in 2009 in Putnam Valley, New York.</p> \n<p>“We have the word 'village' in camp intentionally. Because back in the day, we came from shtetls and tribes and we’ve lost that, and we bring that village vibe back. These counselors are partnering with you parents, partnering to help raise your kids. That’s the best thing about being part of a village,” said Yoni Stadlin who co-founded the camp with his wife, Vivian Lehrer.</p> \n<p>At Eden Village campers meld caring for the earth with Judaism. As Stadlin told Haaretz: “We literally grow wheat in our farm and kids grow it, care, winnow, thresh, grind make their own flour and bake their own challah. When that happens you do not ever need to convince a kid to make a brachha (blessing) over bread; they have a natural inclination.&quot;</p> \n<p>The campers also squeeze grapes for juice, make herbal medicines and create candles out of beeswax. Food at Eden Village is all organic, locally sourced and prepared from scratch in the camp kitchen.</p> \n<p>“Camp gives us the opportunity to backtrack on rituals. We get to experience the why, not to say ‘do this’ and ‘do that.’ This naturally leads kids to have an attitude of gratitude,” said Stadlin.</p> \n<p>“We also think a fundamental organizing principle of our religion is to be ‘world fixers,’ to be caring citizens for [the] world. And farming, cooking and herbalism are a vehicle that gets us to that bigger underlying principle,” he added.</p> \n<p>Campers for life</p> \n<p>Gene Meyer, a Washington, D.C.-area journalist and author, sent his two sons to Camp Moshava, which is run in Maryland by Habonim Dror, a Labor-Zionist youth movement. Meyer, who served as president of the camp’s board for over five years, marvels at the programming there, planned and led by young people, with a strong focus on social justice and social consciousness. Hebrew is part of the daily vocabulary there, he explained, and the camp is rooted in progressive Judaism.</p> \n<p>Habonim Dror camps received attention last year when they decided to create their own gender-neutral form of Hebrew to help make transgender campers feel included.</p> \n<p>Camp alumni, Meyer said, “don’t generally become corporate lawyers or developers. They tend to be teachers, social workers and get involved in effecting a positive society.&quot;</p> \n<p>And, he added, “They are 'Habos' for life, it’s just extraordinary. They pick colleges based on where Habo friends are going, they keep in touch with their Habo friends, they are really tight.”</p>",

Ryan Dillon, tweeted on Thursday that the SDF has cleared 98 percent of the city, adding that some militants remain holed up in a small pocket east of the stadium. Dillon added that buildings and tunnels are being checked for holdouts.</p> \n<p>Even as the guns have gone quiet, preparations for a reconstruction are underway.</p> \n<p>In Saudi Arabia, a state-linked news website said a high-level Saudi official was in Raqqa to discuss the kingdom’s “prominent role in reconstruction” efforts. The Okaz site quoted unnamed Saudi sources as saying that Thamer al-Sabhan met with members of Raqqa’s city civil. The website said the United Arab Emirates will also play a role in rebuilding.</p> \n<p>The report included a photograph of al-Sabhan, apparently in Raqqa with Brett McGurk, the top U.S. envoy for the coalition battling the ISIS. Saudi Arabia is a member of the coalition. Al-Sabhan was previously ambassador to Iraq, but left amid threats from Iranian-backed militias.</p> \n<p>The SDF is expected to hold a news conference in Raqqa on Friday during which the city will be declared free of extremists, for the first time in nearly four years.</p> \n<p>The fall of Raqqa marks a major defeat for ISIS, which has seen its territories steadily shrink since last year. ISIS took over Raqqa, located on the Euphrates River, in January 2014, and transformed it into the epicenter of its brutal rule.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar Assad met with a visiting Iranian army commander on Thursday to discuss bilateral relations, the state news agency SANA said. The Iranian general also conveyed a message from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p> \n<p>SANA said Assad and Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri focused on military cooperation, “which has witnessed a qualitative development during the war that Syria and its allies, mainly Iran, are waging against terrorism” in Syria.</p> \n<p>Iran has been one of Assad’s strongest supporters since the country’s crisis began more than six years ago and has sent thousands of Iranian-backed militiamen to boost his troops against opponents.</p> \n<p>SANA quoted Bagheri as saying that the aim of his visit is to “put a joint strategy on continuing coordination and cooperation at the military level.” He also stressed Iran’s commitment to help in the reconstruction process in Syria.</p> \n<p>Bagheri met with several Syrian officials on Wednesday, including Defense Minister Fahd Jasem al-Freij, and Syrian army commander, Maj. Gen. Ali Ayyoub.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile the al-Qaida linked Levant Liberation Committee released a rare video of its leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani, showing him speaking with his fighters. The release comes two weeks after Russia said it seriously wounded him in an airstrike.</p> \n<p>The video appears to have been shot before an al-Qaida offensive on a central government-controlled village on Oct. 6. Two days before the attack, Russia’s military claimed that al-Golani was wounded in a Russian airstrike and had fallen into a coma. The military offered no evidence of al-Golani’s purported condition.</p> \n<p>The al-Qaida-linked group subsequently denied al-Golani was hurt, insisting he is in excellent health.</p>",

        "text":["<p>IZMIR, Turkey&nbsp;– Dotted along Turkey’s Aegean coastline are a smattering of villages that the country’s Afro-Turks call home.</p> \n<p>“The first generation suffers, the second generation denies and the third generation questions,” reads the opening line of Mustafa Olpak’s book, the first and the last autobiographical and introspective study of Turkey’s dwindling black minority. Olpak coined the term Afro-Turk and founded the movement to help resurrect their identity,but the history of the estimated 1.3 million people who were forced into slavery and shipped from Africa to the territories controlled by the Ottoman Empire remains little more than a footnote of Turkish history.</p> \n<p>While “the library of the Congress of the United States of America has over 600 personal accounts of African-American slaves, none could be found in Ottoman archives,” notes Turkish historian Hakan Erdem in his commentary to Olpak’s book. Before his death last year, Olpak had dreamed of delivering a copy of his book to former U.S. President Barack Obama, and had even traveled to Istanbul’s airport in a hopeless attempt to meet him as he landed for a state visit.</p> \n<p>Today the number of Afro-Turks is estimated at only a few tens of thousands. Many still live in the villages of Haskoy, Yenicifler and Yenikoy, near Izmir, while some reside in rural areas around Ayvalik, Antalya and Adana, as well as in Istanbul. Most were first brought to Turkey to work as domestic servants or in the tobacco and cotton fields along the Aegean Sea; they settled near Izmir once they were freed. Although the slave trade was officially made illegal in 1857 following pressure from Britain and other European powers, it took until the beginning of the 20th century to eliminate the practice altogether and to liberate those who were owned by Ottoman families since before the slave trade was outlawed.</p> \n<p>In Izmir, the state provided safe houses for former slaves as well as assistance to integrate them into the labor market; whole villages and neighborhoods inhabited by the Afro-Turks were dubbed “Arap” areas – the Turkish word for Arab, which is still used as slang to refer to black people.</p> \n<p>As we drive into Haskoy, the village where he grew up, Sakir Doguluer states, “We are Turkish, Muslim and proud.”</p> \n<p>Sakir is a retired mechanic who took over the leadership of the Africans’ Culture and Solidarity Society after Olpak’s death in 2016. At the entrance we make a brief pit stop to say hello to friend, an Afro-Turk who, like most men from the village on this sleepy Sunday afternoon, is sitting in the tea shop, sipping tea, smoking a cigarette and flicking his worry beads between his fingers. The tea shop whose walls are plastered with posters of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, the modest mosque down the road and the meandering cats make Haskoy every bit the clich&eacute; postcard-perfect scene of rural Turkish life.</p> \n<p>“I never asked myself why I was black,” says Sakir’s sister-in-law Hadije, who also lives in the village. “We didn’t know or care about why we were.” That was the case until 2006, when Turkish national television made a documentary about the community and Olpak’s new book, “Kenya-Crete-Istanbul: Human Biographies from the Slave Coast.” Until then Olpak’s own daughter Zeynep, today a flight attendant for Turkish Airlines, “had no idea” that her grandparents where slaves.</p> \n<p>Zeynep is mixed race, and her ever-so-slightly dark olive skin and long wavy hair do not raise eyebrows in Turkey. “I struggled to read the book and had to read it in sessions, crying after each part,” she says. “My father searched for his identify, but most Afro-Turks were not very happy to find out.” She smokes a cigarette before heading off to work – a flight that will soon take her “back” to Kenya, she chuckles.</p> \n<p>“Our grandparents did not want the new generations to know, they kept it a secret,” but “almost 10 years have passed since my father’s book came out, in those 10 years people’s reactions have changed,” Zeynep concludes.</p> \n<p>'A second trauma'</p> \n<p>While shame and pain played a role in many Afro-Turks’ choice to bury their past, these were not the only factors. Upon arrival, slaves were immediately converted to Islam, their names were changed and they were forced to put all aspects of their free life in Africa behind them. With a version of Islamic law ruling over the Ottoman Empire, treatment of slaves was different from America. Children of slaves were born free citizens, intermarriage was legal and after a period of seven to 10 years, Islamic law encouraged owners to release their slaves.</p> \n<p>Beyond this, a large number of Afro-Turks were among the half-a-million Muslims from Greece who were forcibly exchanged for a million Christians from Turkey in the population swap that came after the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. For the Afro-Turks, the transfer represents “a second trauma” and a “second displacement,” explains Lulufer Korukmez, a Turkish academic who studied the group, at Ege University in Izmir. Ironically, one of the main promoters of the plan was League of Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Fridtjof Nansen, who believed that creating more ethnically homogeneous states would diminish forced displacement and war in the long run.</p> \n<p>Afro-Turks also went through “a powerful Turkification” with the founding of the Turkish Republic, which set in motion a process of “nation-building that subsumed and suppressed other consciousnesses,” explains Ehud Toledano, an expert on slavery in the Ottoman Empire at Tel Aviv University. “At the end of it all, of their old identity very little is left,” he remarks,</p> \n<p>“I am proud of my African origins,” explains Messur&eacute;, Sakir’s sister, but “I only know the village where I grew up.” Messur&eacute; can neither read nor write. “I didn’t have the chance to learn to read, but if I had, I would have no doubt done better than you all,” she says.</p> \n<p>Deniz, a mechanical engineer who commutes to Izmir from Haskoy every day, retorts that while he can read, he doesn’t “have time to sit around researching my family.” The Afro-Turkish community is largely working-class and these rural villages feel like they have fallen through the cracks of Turkey’s rapid modernization and industrialization over the last two decades.</p> \n<p>Beyond the hardships of working-class life in rural Turkey, the Afro-Turks have to deal with the second hurdle of racism, according to Korukmez. “Being equal is not enough,” she says, “just because there is no structural racism does not mean that there isn’t in reality.” Back in the village, when Cihan, Deniz’s 11-year-old daughter, tells us she wants to be a doctor, there is a chorus of “inshallah” from her illiterate female cousins.</p> \n<p>A few family members recognize that their life has not been easy. In villages, some Turks put their hands over their children’s eyes when Afro-Turks walk by, believing that they are bad luck. Others, however, consider their black countrymen talismans for good luck. “In cities, we often struggle to find jobs for no apparent reason,” they admit, even though they normally prefer to downplay problems of discrimination.</p> \n<p>It was racism and discrimination that led the workers' rights activist and self-taught writer Mustafa Olpak to investigate his family history. The result was a work similar to Alex Haley’s 1976 novel “Roots,” which tells the story of an African sold into slavery in the United States and the lives of his descendents. Indeed, the impact on the lives of Afro-Turks was huge, but few are able to take up the challenge of perpetuating the newly discovered identity.</p> \n<p>Impact on real life</p> \n<p>“It is rare for historians to witness the impact that their work can have on the lives of real people,” writes Toledano in a draft of the introduction to the English edition of Olpak’s book, due to be published by Stanford University Press next year. But in the end, he concedes: “Sometimes as historians we create artificial identities.”</p> \n<p>“The annual Calf Festival [known in Turkish as Dana Bayram] is the only tradition that they managed to resurrect, the rest having been long forgotten,” says Korukmez. The traditional dishes, languages and customs have long since been condemned to history with the passing of generations. “All that is left is the color of our skin,” admits Sakir himself. “I say to my grandchildren: Look at the color of my skin, because soon you won’t see it around here anymore. We risk losing the last visible proof that we are descendants of slaves of the Ottoman Empire.”</p> \n<p>At the peak of the slave trade to the Ottoman Empire, as many as 15,000 to 18,000 Africans were brought over every year. A large number came from West Africa, passing through Agadez in Niger; those from Eastern Africa made the perilous journey across the Sahara before being shipped to the Ottoman Empire. For centuries Agadez has been the departure point for those making the difficult and dangerous passage across the Sahara. According to the International Organization for Migration, approximately 120,000 to 150,000 individuals departed from Agadez en route to Europe in 2016. Many never make it across the Sahara, falling off the back of trucks or dying of starvation or dehydration after their convoys get lost traveling on the unpaved routes in the desert.</p> \n<p>Patrick Kingsley’s book, “The New Odyssey,” which discusses the current migration crisis, describes the desert crossing as a journey more dangerous than the trip across the Mediterranean. In 1849 the Ottoman statesman Mustafa Resid Pasha deemed the trade route across the Sahara to be too dangerous and penned a note to the governor of Tripoli asking him to make it more “humane.” Pasha requested that the governor “punish the traders who did not respect this.”</p> \n<p>A desert crossing that ends “often with the same result” is how Ottoman expert Toledano describes the form of “modern slavery” endured by the masses of refugees and migrants making their way northward from Africa today.</p>",

        "text":["<p>BAGHDAD, Iraq – This year marks a decade since a car bomb ripped through Al-Mutanabbi Street, this city’s cultural and intellectual oasis, killing 30 people and wounding many more.</p> \n<p>Once teeming with philosophizing poets, vociferous activists and erudite scholars, the book-laden street was left charred and desolate for months to come.</p> \n<p>After almost two years of towering blast walls and restrictive checkpoints, the street – named after the 10th-century, Iraqi-born poet – was officially reopened in December 2008, breathing life back into a corner of Baghdad that had been deemed unsafe.</p> \n<p>Iraq has since undergone huge changes, including the official withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011 and the violent occupation of much of the north by the Islamic State in 2014.</p> \n<p>Here, leisure reading is considered an act of indulgence more frequently reserved for those who are not confronted with the trials of war. And in Iraq, where violence has become an all too common backdrop to people’s lives, evading reality is not as easy as delving into the pages of a novel.</p> \n<p>Neighbor’s lament</p> \n<p>“There’s no intellectual scene left in Baghdad,” lamented 61-year-old bookkeeper Badeea Hyawee. “Before, we were busy selling and reading, now we have too many issues.”</p> \n<p>According to Hyawee, who was raised by his bookkeeper father on Al-Mutanabbi Street and runs one of seven family-owned bookshops, the saying “Cairo writes, Beirut publishes, Baghdad reads” is no longer applicable to Iraq.</p> \n<p>“If you want to destroy a country you need to hit its intellectual scene and make the country uneducated,” he explained, pointing a finger at the U.S.</p> \n<p>“I used to print 5,000 books a year, now it’s 500 a year,” estimated Mr. Hyawee’s colleague, 71-year-old Sabah al-Anbari, a soft-spoken shopkeeper and publisher of law books. “All of the cities are fighting, so they’re not reading books.”</p> \n<p>According to the two men, more than half of Iraq’s books were once sold to residents of Mosul. “Now they can’t even breathe,” said Mr. Hyawee.</p> \n<p>But while older generations are disillusioned with the decay of Iraq’s literary scene, hope for revival comes in the unexpected form of a petite 28-year-old, Baghdad-born, female entrepreneur, who is set on reviving the country’s dormant intellectual arena and disrupting a society steeped in male chauvinism. Just a short distance away from the historic Al-Shabandar Caf&eacute;, a 100-year-old gathering place frequented by Baghdad’s literati, Baraa al-Bayati sits in her tiny air-conditioned bookshop, Al-Baraa. She is Al-Mutanabbi Street’s only female bookstore owner, publisher and journalist.</p> \n<p>“I needed to give something [back] to the community,” explained Bayati when asked why she chose to open a bookshop.</p> \n<p>After graduating university in engineering in 2012 with a passion for books, she was confronted with the widespread unemployment that haunted Iraq and the bleak realization that despite her degree and determination she might remain jobless. Her brother, she explains, had been largely unemployed 10 years.</p> \n<p>Korans near Marquez</p> \n<p>“Is this the future I want? To sit at home, maybe get married and do nothing?” she recalled. “I didn’t do it because I needed money, I did it because I needed something of my own.”</p> \n<p>Inside her shop, the wall-to-wall shelves are laden with neatly placed books – colorful Korans sit opposite classics like Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s “One Hundred Years of Solitude” and history books on the coexistence of Jews and Arabs in the Middle East. Unlike her male colleagues’ businesses, Bayati’s shop is bright and airy and decorated with flowers.</p> \n<p>After two years of work at a bookshop in exchange for reading material, Bayati asked her father for financial help. Believing in his only daughter’s business plan, the 70-year-old former state employee funded it out of his own pocket. In February 2017 Bayati finally carved out her own literary nook in a male-dominated neighborhood industry.</p> \n<p>“My father was really supportive, even now he comes to the shop and helps me,” she said. On Sundays, her day off, she takes time out to drink coffee with him and discuss their latest read, a ritual she has grown to love.</p> \n<p>“A lot of people supported me other women were saying, ‘You mean something to us.’ It’s a big responsibility when young women say that to you,” she said. But while most bookstore owners and clients proved receptive to the newly opened Al-Baraa, not everyone welcomed the energetic new tenant. Many took to social media to discredit and insult her. One man went as far as verbally harassing her once a week for four weeks in a row.</p> \n<p>“Each Friday [he] would come to the shop and yell: ‘You have a degree, you opened a bookshop, what else do you want?’ I wanted to tell him that I’d like to become a better painter or learn to play the guitar,” recalled Bayati. “I would just laugh. I kind of miss him now,” she added with a little laugh.</p> \n<p>No clich&eacute;d narrative</p> \n<p>Although Bayati doesn’t go in for sometimes clich&eacute;d narrative of the struggling Arab woman in a male-dominated society, she appreciates the importance and symbolism of her role on Al-Mutanabbi. “The community says women should sit at home [but] I wanted to give [women] something important to be educated, because they’re the ones who are raising the new generations,” she said.</p> \n<p>“Even those who wear the mask of being educated, when they see a woman practicing her freedom they’ll comment,” she said. “Even though we’re strong, we can’t do anything to stop the negative comments,” she added, especially on the internet.</p> \n<p>The young bookseller knows her clients well and takes pride in choosing which books are likely to sell best. Her wide range of clients sees her investing in all sorts of genres, from children’s books to Russian literature.</p> \n<p>Unlike her older colleagues, Bayati exudes optimism for the future of Iraq’s intellectual scene. However, she does so with the pragmatism of those who have lived through war.</p> \n<p>“Despite everything the situation is better than [it was] in 2007,” she said. “Iraqis are very strong.”</p> \n<p>Down the road from Al-Baraa, shielded from the harsh midday sun, Badeea Hyawee continues reminiscing about Al-Mutanabbi’s better days, blaming what he calls the government’s indifference to literature and exorbitant export taxes.</p> \n<p>High cost of war</p> \n<p>The high cost of the war against ISIS and tumbling oil prices have strained an already weakened economy, forcing some booksellers to shut down their businesses and search for new jobs, further depleting Baghdad’s literary life.</p> \n<p>But in a country where continuous change seems inevitable, the rebirth of Iraq’s intellectual community is by no means impossible and even the most hardened Iraqis can sense that – especially with the arrival of a new, younger generation of book vendors.</p> \n<p>Beneath his cynical exterior, a streak of encouragement and good neighborliness emerges in Hyawee when he is asked about his female colleague, Baraa. “We really welcomed her, we’re very proud – especially because she’s a woman,” he said. “I have also encouraged other women to open bookshops.”</p>",

It delves into the charged issue of the occupation and how it effects those who partake in it as part of their required military service.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Foxtrot&quot; won seven of the 13 awards it had been in the running for on Tuesday night, including Best Movie, the ceremony's highest honor. Moaz won the best director award and Lior Ashkenazi won best actor for his role.</p> \n<p>When the film premiered in Venice recently, Regev released a statement calling the film a “disgrace” that “shamed the reputation of the IDF” and showed “contempt for the state and its symbols.”</p> \n<p>Earlier Tuesday, Regev had also taken the Israeli Film and Television Academy and its chairman, Mosh Danon, to task for the academy's decision not to invite her to the ceremony.</p> \n<p>Danon didn't shy away from the topic in his opening speech. Though not explicitly naming Regev, he defended the ceremony against charges of being anti-Israel in honoring films that provide a critical look at the government and its policies.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We all belong to this place, no less than anyone else,&quot; Danon said, &quot;We care about this place, no less than anyone else. We are storytellers, we are not traitors.&quot;</p> \n<p>Maoz told one reporter &nbsp;in Venice this month his hope was that “Foxtrot” would trigger discussions in Israel over what happens in the military, and its consequences.</p> \n<p>“I feel that people prefer to repress it, to deny it, to bury it,” he explained. “If I had done a movie about a terrible crime in the police, the next morning [people] would say nothing happened – they would understand it was a film. But if you touch the army, it’s very sensitive.”</p> \n<p>Asked if he was concerned about being viewed as a “traitor” in Israel, he replied: “The opposite. Every human society should strive to be better and improve itself. The basic and necessary condition for improvement is the ability to accept self-criticism. If I criticize the place [where] I live, I do it because I worry. I do it because I want to protect it. I do it from love.”</p> \n<p>At last year’s awards, Regev left the hall the moment performers Tamer Nafar and Yossi Zabari took to the stage and recited the opening lines from “ID Card” by Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish: “Write it down, I’m an Arab.” When she returned to the hall and went onstage to present an award, her speech degenerated into a confrontation with members of the audience.</p> \n<p>&quot;Foxtrot&quot; won the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival earlier this month and now, having won Best Film at the Ophir Awards, will be Israel's entry in the Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, to be held in March 2018.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The importance of the Balfour Declaration in the history of Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel is clear. But because of that it is actually appropriate to dig deeper into its international context and complexity of its formulation, in what it says and what it does not say, in this, the centenary year of the declaration.</p> \n<p>The key is the opening sentence, in which “His Majesty’s Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.” But alongside this sentence we must pay attention to what is missing from the letter of British Secretary Lord Balfour to Lord Rothschild. The letter does not speak of establishing a Jewish state and not of turning Palestine into a Jewish state, but rather of the establishment of a “national home.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Special Coverage:&nbsp;The 100th anniversary of the Balfour Declaration&nbsp;&nbsp;■&nbsp;For Theresa May, Netanyahu's arrival in London couldn't come at a worse time&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;Banksy throws Balfour 'apologetic' party for Palestinians&nbsp;■&nbsp;How Britain can redress its broken promises to the Palestinians | Opinion&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>The declaration does not declare that Palestine will become the national home of the Jewish people, but that a national home will be established there. This is intentionally ambiguous wording and over the years it has had many contradictory interpretations. Immediately after it was publicized it was said that the declaration was not intended to harm the civil and religious rights of the non-Jewish communities in Palestine – even though Arabs or Palestinians are not explicitly mentioned.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For the first time the Zionist movement received in the declaration diplomatic support for the goal formulated in the Basel Program in 1897: Establishing a home (Heimst&auml;tte) for the Jewish people in Palestine. During all his years of intensive international action, Theodor Herzl tried to achieve this in the form of a charter from the Ottoman government – and did not succeed. By the time World War I began the World Zionist Organization had still made no progress with this goal.</p> \n<p>When the war broke out, the Zionist movement found itself in a deep crisis: Most of the leadership was concentrated in Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but most of its supporters and members came from the Russian Empire, which at the time included most of historical Poland, including Ukraine and Lithuania. The war cut off the Zionist leadership from its base and in light of this difficult situation, it was decided for the Zionist movement to preserve its neutrality. The center of its activities was transferred to Copenhagen, which let movement leaders stay in touch with people living in countries on both sides of the war.</p> \n<p>It seemed like a cautious and wise decision, but in practice it diminished the Zionist movement. At the time, Chaim Weizmann was living in Manchester, England and understood that at a time when the fate of the world – and the future of Palestine – would be determined by the war, the neutrality of the Zionist movement meant that it was removing itself form the forces acting in the international arena. The power of the Zionist movement really was rather small, but the neutrality, as far as it was understood, made it even smaller.</p> \n<p>When it turned out that as a result of the Ottoman Empire joining the Central Powers in the war, Palestine might be captured by the British, Weizmann was among those who understood the Zionist movement must take action with those who would determine Palestine's fate after the war. This political insight on Weizmann’s part was what spurred him to take advantage of his connections and present the Zionist cause to British leaders.</p> \n<p>We must remember that Weizmann did not have a leading position in the Zionist movement. He may have been well-known, but he was only one of the deputy chairmen of the British Zionist federation. He conducted his contacts with the British leadership on his own authority alone without any mandate from the Zionist leadership, whose official neutrality paralyzed it in practice.</p> \n<p>Some even viewed his actions as an illegitimate and even dangerous gamble.</p> \n<p>The broader context of the Balfour Declaration was connected to the circumstances of the entry of the United States into the war alongside Britain, France and Russia in the spring of 1917. It was not easy for the United States to enter the war. There was backlash from those who maintained the traditional position that America must not become involved in European conflicts. And then there were German and Jewish immigrants, both of whom opposed entering its fray.</p> \n<p>Looking back, it seems to be a strange partnership, but it was not so in the second decade of the 20th century. The German immigrant community, which is estimated to have numbered some 20 million Americans at the time, was partly united in the powerful organization of the German Bund, which alongside its focus on preserving its cultural and linguistic identity, did not want to see its new homeland going to war against its historic birthplaces.</p> \n<p>The Jewish community was much smaller, and the Jewish opposition to America going to war came on two levels. The traditional Jewish leadership was to a great extent in the hands of the moneyed aristocracy composed mostly of Jews with German roots. This leadership did not want the United States to go to war against Germany, where they preserved significant links to its culture and Jewish community.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, most of the Jewish immigrants, the masses who came from Eastern Europe to the United States in the waves of mass migration after the pogroms of 1882 and 1882 in Russia, were not enthusiastic about the idea that their new “Goldene Medina” would go to war alongside the Czarist regime they had escaped from. Political connections were spun between the German and Jewish communities in their joint opposition to going to war against Germany and the idea of fighting on the side of Russia.</p> \n<p>The main goal of the Balfour Declaration as far as Britain was concerned was to reduce the opposition of the American Jewish community to going to war on its side. Among the reasons the declaration was written as a letter to Lord Rothschild was also the consideration that the Rothschild family’s connections with Jewish financiers in New York would aid in this mission.</p> \n<p>In the Zionist historic memory, Weizmann’s development of his acetone production process, which may have allowed him access to the policy setters in London, as well as his own persuasive powers that played on deep religious tones, especially for Prime Minister David Lloyd George. But what decided the issue was the realpolitik considerations directed at the Jews of the United States. Ironically, exactly during the period when the Balfour Declaration was issued, Lenin and the Bolsheviks took control of the government in Saint Petersburg – the act that led to Russia leaving the war.</p> \n<p>Another irony, that the Zionist memory does not always deal with adequately, is in the fact that the Balfour Declaration was given in the form of a private letter to Lord Rothschild. It may have been publicized widely, but at the time Britain had yet to conquer most of the territory of Palestine, and it was not at all certain that it would actually end up ruling Palestine. But the British government, which had decided to issue the declaration, was a party in the Sykes-Picot agreement (which was still being kept secret at the time). The significance of the agreement was that Britain and France would – in some form or another – control the territories captured from the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>The fact that London was associated with promises given to Sharif Hussein of Mecca (through British intelligence agents in Cairo, inspired by Lawrence of Arabia), as well as the contradiction between these promises and the Balfour Declaration (despite its vague wording) hounded Britain for the entire period during which it ruled Palestine.</p> \n<p>However, Weizmann’s greatest achievement was not the obtaining of this declaration. It lay in less dramatic and less known steps that were taken in the days that followed it, and in his tireless efforts to embed the promise made in this declaration in the political arrangements that were made after the war ended.</p> \n<p>Weizmann’s feverish activity began while the war was still on. With the conquest of the southern part of the country by the British at the end of 1917, Weizmann managed to persuade the British authorities to allow him to lead a Zionist delegation on a visit to Palestine. The mandate of this delegation, referred to in British documents as The Zionist Commission, was never clearly defined, but the very act of sending it was an indication of the status the Zionist movement enjoyed in the territory that had just been transferred to the British military authorities.</p> \n<p>However, the Commission received no mandate from the official Zionist leadership, which wanted to continue maintaining neutrality [vis-&agrave;-vis the Ottoman Empire]. The delegation was handpicked by Weizmann himself, and included people from countries belonging to the triple alliance between Britain, France and Italy, a combination which did not well represent the countries making up the Zionist movement or its leadership before the war.</p> \n<p>The Commission arrived in Palestine and, in the absence of a clear mandate, behaved as if it were in charge, not the British army under General Allenby. Weizmann and his associates received royal treatment in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and in other Jewish communities. The fact that they were accompanied by Jewish British officers in uniform, such as James Rothschild and Edwin Samuel, whose father would go on to become the first British High Commissioner in Mandatory Palestine, lent an air of formality to their appearances. Weizmann also decided to lay a cornerstone for a Hebrew University on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem, based on land titles held by the World Zionist Organization.</p> \n<p>This is how without any kind of official authority granted by either Zionist or British leaders, the Commission in practice laid the foundations for what would eventually become the autonomous institutions of the pre-state Jewish community in Palestine, the Assembly of Representatives and subsequently the Knesset. General Allenby didn’t exactly like these moves, which in fact comprised the establishment of a parallel administration to the British military one.</p> \n<p>He protested to London. But to no avail. Weizmann managed to create facts on the ground.</p> \n<p>The next move took place in the international arena. It still wasn’t exactly clear who would rule the land after the war was over. The boundaries delineated in the Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916 left much that was unclear, leading to a struggle between Britain and France. Weizmann was determined to ensure that control would be left solely in the hands of Britain. This clashed with the stance of another Zionist leader, Nahum Sokolow who, because of his French connections, wished to see joint British-French control of Palestine.</p> \n<p>Weizmann viewed this strategy as dangerous and foolish. Britain had a clear commitment to the Zionist Movement, made in the Balfour Declaration, whereas French considerations in the region were different, given its ties to the Maronites in Lebanon and Syria, as well as to other Christian communities in the region. Weizmann managed to foil Sokolow’s efforts, which would have in effect undermined the gains made by obtaining the Balfour Declaration. At the San Remo Conference in April 1920 the Allies decided to transfer Palestine to British rule.</p> \n<p>The transfer of control in the region to Britain and France by the League of Nations was done using a new form of government, the Mandate. The Mandatory powers were committed by this system to move the new countries that were formed this way (Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Mandatory Palestine) towards independence. For Palestine, the League of Nations determined special arrangements: the principles outlined in the Balfour Declaration were included in the mandate given to Britain. The second clause in the Mandate stipulates that the British government commits to promote the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people and the fourth clause says that a Jewish Agency would be formed to represent the Zionist movement.</p> \n<p>The mandate transformed the Balfour Declaration from a British document to part of international law.</p> \n<p>This, and not the Declaration, gave the seal of approval for the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in terms of international relations and international law. It imposed on Britain the obligation to advance towards this goal, subject to reservations that also derive from the Declaration. These related to the rights of non-Jewish communities. The Mandate system required the Mandatory power to report to a Mandate Committee at the League of Nations on the progress towards the fulfilment of this goal. In the 1920s and 1930s League headquarters in Geneva received periodic reports from Britain, with both sides, the Jews and the Arabs, protesting British policies.</p> \n<p>On the eve of discussions around the Balfour Declaration in the Mandate, Weizmann, who had just been elected as the president of the World Zionist Organization, whose headquarters had just moved to London, had to confront other Zionist leaders, less familiar with or experienced than him in international affairs.</p> \n<p>Members of the socialist Poalei Zion group, for example, demanded that the Mandate specifically include a British commitment to turn the country into a Jewish state and not make do with the vague term “national home”. It wasn’t always easy for Weizmann to curb such baseless demands. How could the League of Nations, based on the principle of the right to self-determination (which was included in the definition of these mandates), embrace a policy which would grant the Jewish community, which comprised ten percent of the population at that time, dominion over the remaining 90 percent?</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Weizmann’s sober and realistic position received the support of Zionist institutions, so that the first significant international achievement for the Zionist movement came in the form of this Mandate document.</p> \n<p>Obviously, the complicated wording of the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate put Britain in an impossible position. It had to advance the building of a national home for Jews in Palestine without harming the rights of the Arab population, whose positions were increasingly nationalistic.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the British came out as losers on both counts.</p> \n<p>Today, the path leading from the Balfour Declaration to the UN General Assembly resolution approving the establishment of Israel in November 1947 seems like a natural progression, almost deterministic, but this was not the case. Much could have gone wrong during the upheavals of World War II and post-war settlements.</p> \n<p>It was only Weizmann’s determination which helped transform a unilateral British document, formulated in the midst of war, into a cornerstone of British rule in Palestine and of international law.</p> \n<p>Weizmann realized that in the dynamic and fluid conditions of war one must take the initiative – even without a mandate from Zionist institutions. He pushed for interpreting the Balfour Declaration as a licence to begin behaving as partners with the British military authorities in determining future political arrangements. He knew how to steer diplomatic moves so that the Declaration would not become a worthless piece of paper, as happened to many other documents that were signed during and immediately after the war.</p> \n<p>A blending of determination and flexibility were always a beneficial combination for the Zionist movement in its moves towards attaining sovereignty. It was lucky it had leaders who knew how to combine these qualities in a thoughtful way, while mobilizing support at home and abroad.</p>",

The meme is laden with anti-Semitic imagery.</p> \n<p>Update: Following outcry, Yair Netanyahu has removed the meme from his Facebook page. Evidence of David Duke's support, however, is still visible.</p> \n<p>The meme, captioned &quot;the food chain,&quot; features a photo of George Soros dangling the world in front of a reptilian creature, who dangles an alchemy symbol in front of a caricature of a figure reminiscent of the anti-Semitic “happy merchant” image.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Get all updates on the Netanyahus:&nbsp;Download our free App, and&nbsp;Subscribe&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>The other figures in the chain are former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, anti-Netanyahu protest leader Eldad Yaniv and Meni Naftali, a former chief caretaker at the Netanyahus’ official residence who implicated Sara Netanyahu&nbsp;in the case she is being indicted in.</p> \n<p>David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, tweeted the following in an apparent show of support for Yair Netanyahu:</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;When David Duke Agrees With Netanyahu's Son: As Probes Intensify, the Prime Minister and His Family Lose Control&nbsp;■&nbsp;Why Netanyahu Hates George Soros So Much</p> \n<p>Soros, a Hungarian-born Jewish American billionaire, has spent a large part of his fortune funding pro-democracy and human rights groups. Among the organizations he funds is Human Rights Watch, a frequent critic of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and its policies toward the Palestinians. The images of Soros and the reptile evoke anti-Semitic conspiracy theories claiming that Jews control the world.</p> \n<p>The neo-Nazi Daily Stormer also posted an article regarding the meme entitled &quot;Netanyahu's Son Posts Awesome Meme Blaming the Jews for Bringing Down his Jew Father,&quot; in which they called Yair Netanyahu &quot;a total bro.&quot;</p> \n<p>This version of the meme seems to have originated on a right-wing&nbsp;Facebook page. The meme is nearly identical to, and appears to be adapted from, a viciously anti-Semitic image that has been repeatedly posted across the internet in recent years on racist and conspiracy-theory message boards.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Like most memes, it is impossible to determine who originally created it. In one instance, it was posted&nbsp;by a white supremacist named John de Nugent with the title &quot;Illuminatus Jew Dumb American Burger&quot; in its URL.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the original version of the meme, the first figure in the “food chain” is an obese walrus in an American flag T-shirt tempted by a hamburger dangled in front of him. Behind the man is an Orthodox Jew motivated by money, controlled by the same Illuminati figure featured in the cartoon that Netanyahu posted, with the same giant lizard looming over them all.</p> \n<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center describes de Nugent as &quot;a prolific writer who has worked with numerous hate groups including the neo-Nazi National Alliance and the Holocaust-denying Barnes Review. De Nugent has run for elected office, and has even vowed to one day become president. While maintaining racist views about numerous racial and ethnic groups, de Nugent is particularly anti-Semitic, believing that the Jews are, along with nefarious space aliens, intent on exterminating the Aryan race.&quot;</p> \n<p>After Haaretz published a report about his meme, Yair Netanyahu dismissed the claim that he is anti-Semitic and accused the newspaper of being exactly that.</p> \n<p>Barak, who is depicted in the meme chasing money, suggested that Yair Netanyahu should see a psychiatrist. “Is this what the kid hears at home?” he said. “Is it genetics, or a spontaneous mental illness? It doesn’t matter. In any case, we should fund his psychiatrist instead of security guards and a driver.”</p> \n<p>Labor leader Avi Gabbay, also on Twitter, said: “It’s a particularly sad day for Israel when a caricature that’s endorsed by the head of the KKK emerges from the home of the prime minister of the Jewish state.”</p> \n<p>MK Zehava Galon (Meretz) added that “motifs in the Netanyahu family are anti-Semitic par excellence.” MK Merav Ben Ari (Kulanu) said that “this post deserves all manners of condemnation, from the left and the right. I’m on the right.”</p> \n<p>Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit announced Friday that Sara Netanyahu would be indicted&nbsp;for fraud and breach of trust. She is to be charged with spending 359,000 shekels ($102,000) in state funds on catering at the prime minister’s official residence, while falsely claiming that the house did not employ a cook. The indictment is subject to a hearing, whose date has not yet been announced.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Netanyahu has accused Naftali, the last link in Yair Netanyahu’s meme, of inflating spending on food during his tenure as chief caretaker of the official residence.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The incitement against Yitzhak Rabin continues to this day, said the son of the prime minister who was assassinated 22 years ago this week. Yuval Rabin said his father was never treated with kid gloves by the media, yet his father did not initiate legislation or act to silence his opponents.</p> \n<p>“He did not flee responsibility and was not a crybaby,” Rabin said, speaking Wednesday at the memorial ceremony for his father at Mount Herzl.</p> \n<p>“Anyone who thinks differently is marked as a traitor,” he added. “Rabin did not receive any pleasure from the High Court of Justice or from well-funded nonparliamentary organizations.”</p> \n<p>After the official ceremony at Mount Herzl, another ceremony was held in the Knesset, in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Yuval Rabin’s remarks.</p> \n<p>I understand your pain in the face of the waves of slander and smears against your father. Believe me, I understand,” Netanyahu said.</p> \n<p>As he put it, “I call for national reconciliation and unity. I have done so many times in the past, but in light of your emotional call, I once again repeat this message in full force. And I call for unification around the security and diplomatic principles shared by most of the people. May the memory of Rabin, a Jewish, Zionist and Israeli patriot, be safeguarded in the heart of our people forever.”</p> \n<p>Opposition leader Isaac Herzog (Zionist Union) told the Knesset: “The role of the leadership is to stop hating and prevent hatred. Its obligation is not to tear the people into pieces. The role of the leadership is to preserve Israel united and democratic, capable of managing internal disputes and making decisions with respect, as difficult as they may be, without hatred and without violence.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu also spoke at the ceremony on Mount Herzl. He said that 22 years after the murder of Rabin there was agreement in Israel about the future of the country and its policies.</p> \n<p>“My position on Jerusalem is like Rabin’s. He emphasized that Jerusalem will&nbsp;include Ma’aleh Adumim and Givat Ze’ev. That is my position; it is the position of most Israelis,” Netanyahu said, referring to two West Bank settlements.</p> \n<p>President Reuven Rivlin also attended the memorial ceremony, as did new Supreme Court President Esther Hayut and the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Gadi Eisenkot.</p> \n<p>Rivlin spoke of Rabin’s connection to Jerusalem. “Taking responsibility for Jerusalem in its entirety is Rabin’s legacy,” he said.</p> \n<p>Esther Brot, a resident of the Ofra settlement who will speak Saturday night at the annual Rabin rally in Tel Aviv, spoke with Israel Radio on Wednesday. “The public discourse on both sides led to the murder of a prime minister,” she said.</p> \n<p>The theme of the rally is “We are one people,” yet protests against the organizers continues. The organizers of have been trying to avoid being labeled leftists. The rally is being organized this year for the first time by the groups Darkenu and Commanders for Israel’s Security.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the Facebook page for the rally was hacked, with the phrases “fight the occupation” and “strive for peace” added.</p> \n<p>The organizers only learned about the changes when Haaretz informed them. They alerted Facebook, removed the changes and said they would file a complaint with the police.</p> \n<p>“We regret that the discourse surrounding the memorial rally for the murder of Yitzhak Rabin, of blessed memory, has deteriorated into illegal acts and a break-in into the rally’s Facebook page,” the organizers said in a statement.</p> \n<p>“We condemn in every way these illegal and violent acts that do not honor Rabin’s memory – all the more so on the official day of commemoration of the murder that falls today.”</p> \n<p>The original text of the ads for the rally does not mention that Rabin was murdered, nor do the words “peace” or “occupation” appear at all, ostensibly out of a desire to appeal to the broadest possible audience. As a result of the criticism, the organizers added the word “murder” to their posters and ads.</p> \n<p>“We are one people,” reads the headline of the ad. Underneath it says, “A mass rally in memory of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, of blessed memory,” with a photo of Rabin and the Israeli flag in the background.</p> \n<p>“On November 4, we will stand together, all Israelis from all corners of the country, and we will strengthen the unity of the people, moderation and Israel’s secure future – for the eternity of the nation-state of the Jewish people in Israel and the Diaspora, a democratic state in the spirit of the principles of the Declaration of Independence,” reads the invitation. It states that the rally will be “without the involvement of political parties or speeches by incumbent politicians.”</p> \n<p>Many on the left have criticized the rally’s organizers and accused them of blurring both Rabin’s legacy and events that led up to the murder.</p> \n<p>In response to the report in Haaretz that the organizers also told left-wing parties and movements they would not be allowed to put up booths at the event as they have done in the past, the organizers will now allow booths.</p> \n<p>The keynote speaker will be former Mossad chief Shabtai Shavit. This decision was made after the organizers failed to bring together on one stage the six living former IDF chiefs of staff.</p> \n<p>Oded Ravivi, head of the Efrat Local Council and Yehuda Meshi Zahav, head of the first aid service Zaka, are scheduled to speak, as is Brot from Ofra. The invitation to the three settlers to speak also stirred even more criticism from the left, as well as the fact that Brot lived in a house built on private Palestinian land. Also, she was evicted from her home at the order of the High Court of Justice.</p> \n<p>There will be performances by singers Esther Rada, Shiri Maimon, Yehuda Poliker, Moshe Peretz, Agam Buhbut, Hanan Ben-Ari and the Sharonit Choir.</p>",

        "text":["<p>ANKARA – Hundreds of feminist protesters descended Thursday evening on the largely secular seaside city of Izmir, waving miniskirts and chanting “we will wear want we want” as they kept last week’s momentum going.</p> \n<p>Smaller initiatives by the movement also took place at Kugulu Park in the capital Ankara, and in Istanbul, where a thousands-strong march rocked the Kadikoy district last week.</p> \n<p>The name of the group, Kiyafetime Karisma, also translates as “Don’t meddle with my outfit,” a slogan that’s usually accompanied by the image of a clothes hanger.</p> \n<p>“We insist that women should be free to wear what they want with no interference,” the movement’s leader Gulsum Kav, a 45-year-old doctor and longtime feminist, told Haaretz. She says recent acts of aggression against secular women in Istanbul were the “symbolic last drop” convincing the women to act.</p> \n<p>Earlier this summer, university student Asena Melisa Saglem was slapped on a bus by a man who considered her outfit “shameful,” while a woman named Cagla Kose was told to leave an Istanbul park by a private security guard for wearing “immodest clothes.”</p> \n<p>Still, the activists say they want to avoid polarization and hope to bring together women from all walks of life in the name of the “right to wear a miniskirt and a head scarf.” The initiatives in Izmir, Ankara and Istanbul have all featured a minority of veil-wearing women and girls.</p> \n<p>“We are socialists and nationalists, atheists and religious, left- and right-wing women, all united to claim our empowerment in the public sphere,” says the movement’s communications officer Ozden Oz, who reaches most of her university-aged activists through social media.</p> \n<p>Social engineering via government rules and guidelines on dress is an old battlefield in Turkish politics, as is the societal unrest that follows. After Turkey’s War of Independence in the early 1920s, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk revolutionized Turkish society by trying to emulate Western customs and norms. His decrees outlined what people should or shouldn’t wear, ushering in an era where the head scarf was castigated as a sign of backwardness and was eventually banned from the public realm.</p> \n<p>Historic ambassador</p> \n<p>Now secularists feel that the tables have turned and accuse the government of creating an atmosphere where secular outfits spark abuse. To extend the reach of their protest, the women seek the support of their conservative sisters.</p> \n<p>“I appreciate all efforts to come together by women to claim equal opportunities and freedoms in what is still a strongly patriarchal society,” says Ravza Kavakci Kan, a prominent deputy in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s AKP party.</p> \n<p>The significance was clear last week when Kan’s sister, Merve Kavakci, was appointed Turkey’s ambassador to Malaysia. In 1999, Kavakci was stripped of her citizenship and accused of “insulting the dignity of the state” for wearing a head scarf at her swearing-in at parliament in Ankara.</p> \n<p>Now, after a successful academic career in the United States, Kavakci has become the first veiled ambassador in Turkey’s history. The diplomatic corps, a traditionally Kemalist bulwark, was mocked by the Erdogan faithful as “the realm of out-of-touch mon cheries,” an allusion to the diplomats’ Westernized manners and knowledge of French.</p> \n<p>In her 2010 book “Headscarf Politics in Turkey,” Kavakci argued that secular Turkish elites “colonized” the country for decades espousing an “Orientalist” framework whereby Turkish women were deemed unworthy unless they were “modernized in a Western fashion.” But toward the end of the book, she outlined a growing tendency of progressive feminist groups to work alongside conservative women, in a way anticipating the spirit of the “Don’t meddle with my outfit” movement.</p> \n<p>Still, there are women at both ends of the sociopolitical spectrum who feel uncomfortable with acting as one in the struggle.</p> \n<p>“If there is one thing I cannot agree on with conservative feminist organizations it is the dress code,” says Cigdem Cidamli from the socialist-feminist group Halkevleri. “For us the head scarf is a symbol of oppression, but we can find common ground on pressing issues like child brides, equal opportunities and domestic violence.”</p> \n<p>All kinds of feminists</p> \n<p>According to a report by the organization We Will Stop Femicide, on average, more than one woman has been murdered every day in Turkey this year, often by a man she knows. Moreover, the issue of child brides has sparked joint advocacy among feminist organizations before: last autumn, when protests against a bill that would have softened punishment for sexual violence on minors.</p> \n<p>The feminist organization KADEM, which is run by Erdogan’s daughter and is very close to the government, proved decisive in blocking the law amid street protests by feminist activists of all stripes.</p> \n<p>Starting from radically different premises from those of left-wing activist Cidamli, the former head of the AKP’s women’s branch in Istanbul, Jane Louise Kandur, also supports common action on anything but the outfit issue.</p> \n<p>Kandur says she’s outraged at how Kiyafetime Karisma tries to suggest a comparison between the repression of women who covered themselves yesterday and those who uncover themselves today.</p> \n<p>“Secular elites were using state violence against the over 67 percent of Turkish women who wear the head scarf, preventing people like me from teaching in public schools,” she says. “Today the government allows for all sorts of outfits, and the Kiyafetime Karisma are turning a few isolated cases into a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre.”</p> \n<p>Kandur contends that the rise of Erdogan and the AKP liberated women rather than the other way around. And she feels uneasy about the not-so-subtle anti-government undertones of the Kiyafetime Karisma campaign.</p> \n<p>But for Kav, the doctor, and her followers in the movement, the joint demonstration in Istanbul’s Kadikoy district last week and Thursday's in Izmir showed that there “is strong enough common ground.”</p> \n<p>“Between 5 and 10 percent of the women were wearing a head scarf, and they marched alongside those waving their mini-skirts towards the sky without the blink of an eye,” says Oz, the communications officer. She says that “our protest has just begun.”</p> \n<p>The campaign’s demands range from better implementation of laws protecting freedom of lifestyle to prosecution for domestic violence to the creation of a ministry for women’s affairs in Turkey.</p> \n<p>Ending the phenomenon of child brides is another matter on which different strands in Kiyafetime Karisma usually converge. According to Prof. Erhan Tunc at Gaziantep University, one in three marriages in Turkey involves a minor.</p> \n<p>“But the biggest challenge for us is to keep together, then the rest will come,” warned an activist in Ankara as she put up banners to advertise the march in the capital’s Kugulu Park on Saturday.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The towering 150-meter granite cross and massive underground basilica overlooking the Valley of the Fallen, 60 kilometers northwest of Madrid, is one of the most awesome yet despised monuments in the world. Fascist dictator Francisco Franco conceived the monument at the end of World War II, invested billions of dollars and thousands of slave laborers in its construction and inaugurated it in 1959. He is buried there in a marked grave, along with an estimated 40,000 victims of the Spanish Civil War, Nationalists and Republicans alike.</p> \n<p>The Spanish parliament adopted a declaratory resolution two months ago to exhume Franco’s body from his grave, which has become a place of pilgrimage to what remains of “El Caudillo’s” fans. Over the past two to three years, several Spanish provinces have started to exhume some of the remains of the tens of thousands of people executed by both sides during and after the 1936-’39 Civil War. It could signal the beginning of the end of the collective repression that enabled Spain to smoothly convert from dark dictatorship to splendid democracy. The ruling conservative People’s Party prefers not to stir the hornet’s nest now, when Spain is finally emerging from the terrible economic decade it has endured since 2008.</p> \n<p>Around the world, the trend is going in the opposite direction. The bloody Civil War that riveted the world’s imagination for a good part of the 20th century is receding in memory. The romance of the 40,000 volunteers who naively and tragically joined the International Brigade to fight the Fascist usurpers of Spanish democracy is dissipating as their generation passes. Ernest Hemingway’s “For Whom The Bell Tolls” and George Orwell’s “Homage to Catalonia” are no longer required reading. Israeli leftists often shout, “Fascism will not pass” in their lonely demonstrations, but few are aware that it was legendary Communist leader Dolores Ib&aacute;rruri, widely known as La Pasionaria, who made it famous. When Franco took Madrid, he reportedly said, “We have passed.”</p> \n<p>Many historians have focused on the international aspects of the civil war, widely seen as a practice run for World War II, which broke out five months after it ended. Britain abandoned the democratically elected government in Madrid just as it sold out Czechoslovakia a few years later. The Spanish conflict was war by proxy for the Soviet Union, which set up the International Brigade and mismanaged much of the Republican campaign, and Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, which forged their “axis” in Spain and supplied Franco with arms and fighting units. Berlin utilized the campaign to perfect its fighting methods in advance of its onslaught on Europe. Picasso’s “Guernica,” which depicts the German bombing of the Basque town in 1937, attracts masses of tourists to Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid.</p> \n<p>But as British historian Anthony Beevor wrote in his book “The Battle for Spain,” the focus on the international elements of the Civil War underplays the ferocity of the national conflict, which, he asserts, would have erupted and ended exactly the same without it. And while Spanish history from the Inquisition to the abolition of the monarchy in the 1930s crafted the unique characteristics of the Civil War, its main cause seems particularly relevant today, especially in the United States and Israel. It was the acute polarization – the total religious, political, economic and social divide – that split Spanish society and drove each part to see the other as a mortal enemy, worthy of death.</p> \n<p>The clash pitted capitalists against communists, monarchists against anarchists, conservatives vs. libertarians, fascists against democrats, religious fanatics against secular extremists, centralists against those who backed regional independence for Catalans, Basques and others. The tensions were fueled by the spread of Fascism and Communism, which undermined democracy and enabled each side to describe its enemy in demonic terms. “Both Stalin and Goebbels,” Beevor writes, “exploited, with diabolic ingenuity, that potent combination of fear and hatred. The process stripped their ‘traitor’ opponents of their humanity as well as their citizenship.”</p> \n<p>Beevor notes that it is difficult today to appreciate the totality of the ideological conflict and the perceptions that defeat could spell extinction. When he rewrote his 1982 book for 2006 publication, Beevor could not have known that two years later the world would experience an economic meltdown resembling the Great Depression, which paved the way for the forces of evil. He could not have foreseen the hunger in Africa, the Arab Spring, the emergence of ISIS or the civil war in Syria, which created waves of refugees that sparked the same kind of nationalistic, racist and often anti-Semitic reaction that pushed 1930s fascists to the forefront, including Franco, the Spanish Phalanges and the Catholic Church, which saw a Jewish-Freemason conspiracy behind every corner. Beevor could not know that within a decade, social media would revolutionize personal and political communications, accelerating polarization, empowering the extremes and erasing the moderate middle ground. He could not foresee that disgust with George W. Bush would bring Barack Obama and that hatred towards Obama would spawn Donald Trump, who makes the apocalypse seem real.</p> \n<p>Trump didn’t have a particular ideology when he decided to run for office but he has embraced the dark recesses of the American right to achieve victory, and he returns there in times of trouble, which for him are a 24/7 condition. The numerous missteps, failures, controversies and scandals of his presidential tenure, which will mark 200 days on Monday, are sparking growing opposition but his monumental ego prevents him from mending his ways. Instead, he heats up his base even more, incites against concocted enemies, divides America into “us” and “them.”</p> \n<p>When Trump pushes a ban on Muslims entering America, he marks those already there as dangerous. When he announces that transgenders won’t serve in the army, he signals that LGBTs are tainted as well. When the Justice Department probes whether colleges are discriminating against whites, it’s a sign that affirmative action for blacks is over. When the White House presents immigration reform that’s focused on bringing skilled, English-speaking immigrants in but keeping unskilled, low-wage laborers out, it’s a return to the good old days when even so-called Southern Europeans, including Jews, were better left out. And when Trump blames Congress rather than Vladimir Putin for tensions with Russia, he is assuming his followers would prefer to despise enemies within than to waste their energy on dictators far away.</p> \n<p>By the same token, when Yair Netanyahu, the prime minister’s son, describes the New Israel Fund as the Destroy Israel Fund, he is marking it and its supporters as existential threats. When his father warns about Arabs swarming to the ballot boxes, he casts them as a fifth column, a term that originated with the Fascist invasion of Madrid and the help it would get from supporters in the city. When Netanyahu talks about European funding for human rights NGOs, he wants to paint them as agents of hostile powers.</p> \n<p>It’s all aimed at dispelling any illusion that the political battle pits two legitimate ideologies one against the other. Rather, it’s a fight to the death, all or nothing, pride or shame, prosperity or ruin. With a knife at the country’s throat, what are trivial allegations of corruption if not a sinister plot by the enemy, and what are democracy and the rule of law compared to the preservation of life and the country’s honor?</p> \n<p>Of course, there are only a few similarities between 20th-century Spain and 21st-century Israel or the U.S., both of which have a long tradition of democracy and an army that’s loyal to the state. But both have also enjoyed extended periods of relative security and economic stability, which prevent hatred and strife from getting the oxygen that would make them more dangerous.</p> \n<p>Yet make no mistake. The two countries might not handle new crises or catastrophes, God forbid, as they have before. The atmosphere is more tense. The alienation is greater. The hate is more intense. The dialogue is more venomous. When conflict comes, the mob will vent its rage against immediate suspects, those that have been marked so well in recent years.</p> \n<p>In the end, Franco’s Fascists won because they had several inherent advantages. They were united, disciplined and focused on victory and revenge while their rivals were anarchic and divided, in the conduct of their war as well. The Monarchists and authoritarians yearned to obey one supreme leader, while the Republicans argued, voted, disputed and split into 10 more pieces.</p> \n<p>And while the Republicans carried out their fair share of cruel massacres against Catholic clerics and other enemies, their hatred for Fascists could never match the loathing of Franco’s men for the heathen Communists. After years of being told their enemies were traitors out to kill them, it was easier for the Fascists to slaughter them by the tens if not the hundreds of thousands. On their anonymous and often unmarked graves, they built one of the most despicable regimes of the 20th century.</p>",

Since the terror attacks of 9/11, American Jewish and Muslim groups have made a concerted effort to forge bonds of understanding and cooperation. Those have been nursed along despite the ongoing conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, not to mention the enduring friction between Israelis and Palestinians.&quot;&nbsp;[JewishJournal]  2020 WATCH: “Zuckerberg hires former Clinton pollster Joel Benenson” by Annie Karni:&nbsp;“Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have hired Democratic pollster Joel Benenson as a consultant Benenson’s company, Benenson Strategy Group, will be conducting research for the Zuckerberg-Chan Initiative, the couple’s philanthropy The hiring of Benenson is sure to fuel renew speculation that Zuckerberg is getting more serious about how he plays in the political and policy worlds.

McMaster Cleans House at the National-Security Council” by Rosie Gray:&nbsp;“Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a 31-year-old former Defense Intelligence Agency officer... was let go from the council this week According to a senior administration official familiar with the matter, Cohen-Watnick is expected to move to another job within the administration. The official said that there had been a plan to keep Cohen-Watnick in the job until a new position was finalized, but that Cohen-Watnick was called in to a meeting with McMaster on Wednesday in which McMaster informed him he would be leaving now A source close to Kushner said “Jared is a big fan of Ezra’s and is grateful for his contributions to the administration as part of the NSC but obviously completely defers to General McMaster on all NSC personnel decisions. He looks forward to seeing what’s next for Ezra.””&nbsp;[TheAtlantic]&nbsp;  “Inside the McMaster-Bannon War” by Michael Warren:&nbsp;“The national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, has removed three NSC aides loyal to Trump aide Steve Bannon in the last three weeks... For some time, Steve Bannon has been considering leaving the White House A newly emboldened H.R. McMaster, purging Bannonites with the backing of John Kelly (and the president), could hasten his exit.”&nbsp;[TWS]&nbsp;&nbsp;  Far-right Israeli columnist Caroline Glick writes:&nbsp;&quot;The Israel angle on McMaster's purge of Trump loyalists from the National Security Council is that all of these people are pro-Israel and oppose the Iran nuclear deal, positions that Trump holds.&nbsp;McMaster in contrast is deeply hostile to Israel and to Trump. According to senior officials aware of his behavior, he constantly refers to Israel as the occupying power and insists falsely and constantly that a country named Palestine existed where Israel is located until 1948 when it was destroyed by the Jews.&quot;&nbsp;[Facebook]  DRIVING THE DAY --&nbsp;The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on the Taylor Force Act during a business meeting that began&nbsp;at 10:00am. The legislation would suspend aid that directly benefits the Palestinian Authority until they end payments to families of terrorists.&nbsp;  AIPAC backs Taylor Force Act in letter to Senators -- by Aaron Magid and Jacob Kornbluh:&nbsp;“We urge all members of the committee to work together to move this important legislation forward and to VOTE YES to report the bill from committee,” Brad Gordon and Marvin Feuer, AIPAC’s Directors on Policy and Government Affairs, wrote in a letter to members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “We are hopeful that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee markup will produce a strong, bipartisan bill that will send a very clear message to the Palestinian Authority: Stop these payments to terrorists and their families or your assistance will be cut.”  Noah Pollak,&nbsp;an advocate in favor of the Taylor Force Act, said that AIPAC’s formal backing is a “welcome development and something we have been encouraging for many months. We hope that AIPAC will now put its considerable resources behind promoting the bill, even if it is not possible to earn a perfectly equal number of Republican and Democratic votes.”  Jonathan Schanzer, Senior Vice President at the Foundations for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), added, “Once this bill became bipartisan, it became easier for a wider range of groups to support it.”&nbsp;When informed of AIPAC’s support of the bill, Senator&nbsp;Marco Rubio&nbsp;(R-FL) said the decision was helpful. While AIPAC’s view on the Taylor Force Act&nbsp;isn’t conditional for Rubio, the pro-Israel organization’s position “is influential with me,” he added.  Eugene Kontorovich, Professor of Law at Northwestern University, tells us&nbsp;“For too long, some supporters of Israel have feared cutting funding to the PA because it would ‘destabilize’ a supposed peace partner. Now, hopefully, [they] all understand that continuing to fund the PA while it funds murder legitimizes their policy and keeps peace further away. The Palestinian government’s salaries for convicted terrorists is not just a reward for murder, it is murder-for-hire.”&nbsp;[JewishInsider]&nbsp;  The Republican Jewish&nbsp;Coalition&nbsp;sent a&nbsp;letter urging&nbsp;Senators to reject amendments that would dilute the final bill before being sent to the Senate floor&nbsp;[Doc]&nbsp;  ON THE HILL --&nbsp;Senators’ Views on anti-BDS Bill Diverge -- by Aaron Magid:&nbsp;Independent minded Senator&nbsp;Rand Paul&nbsp;(R-KY) told&nbsp;Jewish Insider, &quot;I haven't looked at the specific language, but if it bans the ability to protest, I don't know how that could possibly be constitutional.&quot; In contrast to Paul, Senator&nbsp;Roger Wicker&nbsp;(R-MS) wholeheartedly backed the legislation, &quot;I think it's pro-free speech. I think it's self-explanatory.&quot;  But, for Democrats, criticism of the bill by progressive advocacy groups is pushing liberal lawmakers in an uncomfortable position. When Senator&nbsp;Cory Booker&nbsp;(D-NJ) was asked last week by Jewish Insider about his view on the legislation, he declined to voice support or opposition. Senator&nbsp;Tom Udall&nbsp;-- arguably the most progressive Senator on the Foreign Relations Committee regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- similarly declined to offer any substantive comment. &quot;I've got to get briefed on the whole thing before the deal comes up,” he noted.&nbsp;[JewishInsider]&nbsp;  Video:&nbsp;An Israeli social media user Hen Mazzig&nbsp;added clips to&nbsp;an Al Jazeera video&nbsp;explaining&nbsp;the BDS movement and the Israel Anti-Boycott Act.

Seven minutes later, Miller found himself apologizing to CNN’s Jim Acosta over the fiery, bizarre, combative and confusing exchange that had just ended. The dialogue culminated in the senior White House aide lobbing insults at a member of the White House press corps, prompting Acosta to note that he'd just been called &quot;ignorant&quot; on television.

The diplomat was referring to Netanyahu’s chilly relations with former President Obama, including a 2015 address to a joint session of Congress that he delivered without coordination with the White House “This is the result of a longtime, ongoing, obstinate policy that doesn’t even bother for the sake of appearances to be considerate to any partner, friend or foe.

Last night the main TV news shows opened with a reports about Ari Harow, Bibi's former Chief of Staff, becoming a state’s witness. According to these reports, Harow will provide details on issues that have to do with all of the ongoing investigations.  At the same time, Netanyahu received some American legal support this week, as Alan Dershowitz gave a series of interviews in which he defended the Prime Minister&nbsp;and accused the opposition of “using the judicial system as a political tool.” In a front page interview in Adelson’s Israel Hayom, Dershowitz addressed the similarities between the legal affairs of the Netanyahu family and the Trump family. “It is a similar tactic to spread endless accusations and hope that one of them could eventually stick. Meanwhile the news diverts the leader’s attention from what he is trying to accomplish.”  Dershowitz staunchly brushed off any criminal aspects of both Trump and Bibi, stating:&nbsp;“I have been teaching criminal law for 50 years, and I am very knowledgeable about all the laws, and I can not find any proof of any accusation against Trump that would be a federal offense.” Dershowitz explained that he similarly does not find any criminal signs in Bibi’s behavior: “Even if his talks with Yedioth Ahranoth happened, what is criminal about it? Every politician in history tried to reach understandings with the media and in any case it did not happen. It was just talk. If we would bring politicians to justice based only on what they say, all the politicians in the world today would be under investigation.&quot;&nbsp;Read today's entire Kafe Knesset here[JewishInsider]  Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin Says We Will Care for Transgender Vets We Displace:&nbsp;“Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin says his department has compassion for the transgender vets whom the President is kicking out of the military.

The accord’s collapse “would shift the mainstream of Iranian politics to the right,” forcing Rouhani and his chief ally -- Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif -- to adopt a more confrontational approach, he said.”&nbsp;[Bloomberg]&nbsp;  “Trump signs what he calls ‘seriously flawed’ bill imposing new sanctions on Russia” by Abby Phillip:&nbsp;“Trump noted that he supported tough measures to punish the three regimes (Russia, Iran and N. Korea), and said that he will honor the review period prescribed in the bill. But in a potential warning to lawmakers that he might not observe those parts of the law, Trump added that he would “give careful and respectful consideration” to other provisions that direct the administration to undertake diplomatic initiatives.”&nbsp;[WashPost]&nbsp;  “Like other presidents, Trump signs a bill with his fingers crossed” by Michael McGough:&nbsp;“Even as he approved the legislation, Trump insisted on issuing a “signing statement” registering constitutional objections to parts of it.&nbsp;For example, he asserted that two sections of the bill “purport to displace the president's exclusive constitutional authority to recognize foreign governments, including their territorial bounds, in conflict with the Supreme Court's recent decision in Zivotofsky vs. Kerry.”&nbsp;The sections the president objects to state that the United States doesn’t recognize the acquisition of various territories by force or the Russian annexation of Crimea. Trump says he doesn’t disagree with those statements as policy, but he notes, absolutely correctly, that the Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution gives the president, not Congress, the power to recognize foreign governments.&quot;  &quot;That was the holding in the 2015 case of Zivotofsky vs. Kerry.Zivotofsky was Menachem Zivotofsky, an American boy born in Jerusalem in 2002, whose parents wanted the State Department to list his place of birth on his passport as “Israel.” The State Department refused, despite a law passed by Congress ordering it to do so at the request of a citizen born in those circumstances. The justices ruled for the State Department, holding that the Constitution’s text and structure grant the president the power to recognize foreign nations and governments.

Too often, writing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its key players denies readers insight into domestic Palestinian affairs. Not here. Messrs. [Grant] Rumley and [Amir] Tibon treat readers to their combined expertise and understanding of internal Palestinian politics. Mr. Abbas’s story, as they argue, is a tragic one. He appeared to be the man with the greatest political potential on the Palestinian side to make peace with his neighbors. Instead, he has turned into a power-consolidating silencer of dissent who eulogizes some of the more contemptible impulses of Palestinian nationalism.&quot;[WSJ]&nbsp;  TALK OF OUR NATION: Daniel Shapiro writes Israel and American Jewry: Stepping Back from the Brink:&nbsp;“The crisis over the Kotel and the conversion bill took many Israeli political leaders by surprise, which itself is evidence of a deep disconnect between Israeli leaders attuned to Israeli voters, and the attitudes of American Jewish leaders and activists. Anyone who spends time these days in American Jewish communities cannot fail to take notice of the anger, disgust, and feelings of personal betrayal.”[INSS]&nbsp;  “The Jewish People in 2017: Fault Lines, Threats, and Opportunities” by Shalom Lipner:&nbsp;“The prism through which [Trump] views the Jewish community—reflected by the comparatively hawkish Orthodox faction that backed him, and to which his daughter, son-in-law, and even ambassador to Israel belong—is one that sees Israel as a bulwark against Islamist extremism and upholds (at least in principle) its essential right to settle the Jewish homeland. This complicated calculus has generated the following equation: The governments of Israel and America, together with a plurality of Israelis, appear ideologically aligned behind current Israeli policy toward the peace process. At the same time, sitting on the other side of the scale are many American Jews whose personal belief systems are antithetical to those of Trump, Netanyahu, and the majority of the Israeli electorate.”&nbsp;[Tandfonline]&nbsp;  TALK OF THE TOWN: “New York congregation owns oldest U.S. synagogue, court rules” by Chris Kenning:&nbsp;“A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled that a New York Jewish congregation is the rightful owner of the nation's oldest synagogue, in Rhode Island, along with a set of bells worth millions. The decision by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston marks the latest turn in a long-running legal battle that began when members of the Touro Synagogue in Newport tried to sell a set of ritual bells, called rimonim, worth some $7.4 million. New York's Congregation Shearith Israel attempted to block the deal, citing an 18th century agreement that named it a trustee.”&nbsp;[Reuters]&nbsp;  “Menashe Is a Moving Drama of Hasidic Life” by David Sims:&nbsp;“Though Menashe (played by Menashe Lustig) is quite a relatable ne’er-do-well, his story is set in Hasidic Jewish Brooklyn, one of America’s most insular communities But Menashe is wise not to be preachy, or to make sweeping judgments about Hasidic life. Weinstein’s workmanlike camera style allows him to act as a bystander who has gotten closer to a world that’s still sealed-off (the director struggled to convince Hasidic actors to participate in the project). In grounding the story in a particular personality, and the familiar connection between a father and son, Weinstein has created a subtly powerful work of human drama, driven by the charismatic, if frustrating, man at its center. Menashe bodes well for Weinstein’s future as a storyteller; it succeeds at taking older cinematic traditions of everyday storytelling and using them to help illuminate a world most viewers know little about.”&nbsp;[TheAtlantic]&nbsp;  SPORTS BLINK: “Shaquille O'Neal to battle Maryland casino owner David Cordish&nbsp;in free-throw contest” by Callie Caplan:&nbsp;“Have you ever wanted to watch an NBA Hall of Famer battle a casino owner in a free throw competition?...

        "text":["<p>The last time the Ark of the Covenant was supposedly seen was in Jerusalem, some 2,600 years ago.</p> \n<p>Now archaeologists are exploring the ancient town of Kiriath Jearim, where the Bible says the ark was kept for 20 years before being taken to Jerusalem. Even if the excavators don’t expect to find the ark itself, and they don't, they have made discoveries that shed new light on the history of the ancient Israelites and the birth of Judaism itself. Their finds also support theories that King David may not have been the one who moved the ark to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>According to the biblical tale, after the people of Israel bore the Ark of the Covenant through the desert and following Joshua’s conquest of Canaan, it was kept in the Tabernacle at Shiloh – and was then lost in a terrible battle to the Philistines. But God punished the Philistines with sickness and other plagues and they wisely returned their booty to the Israelites, who then settled the ark at Kiriath Jearim for 20 years.</p> \n<p>Then, goes the story, King David took it to Jerusalem to be housed first in a tent, and later in King Solomon’s Temple.</p> \n<p>From that point, until Jerusalem's destruction by the Babylonians, the ark strangely disappears from the biblical narrative. Nowhere does it figure in the exploits of the kings of Judah or Israel, points out Thomas R&ouml;mer, a world-renowned expert in the Hebrew Bible and a professor at the College de France and the University of Lausanne.</p> \n<p>Supernatural powers</p> \n<p>That hasn't stopped scholars and archaeologists from seeking out any clue about its true history. Maybe the ark's enduring mystique lies in the fact that, according to the Bible, it contained the original stone tables of the Ten Commandments, and it had godly powers, which could rally the Israelite armies in battle or strike dead anyone who dared touch it or look inside it.</p> \n<p>When they return daily to base camp, the archaeologists digging at Kiriath Jearim divide their finds into various baskets with labels like “glass,” “animal bones” or “small finds.” Just one basket remains inevitably empty: the one jokingly labeled “the ark.”</p> \n<p>No, no one expects to find any trace of the elusive ark in the ruins of this ancient Israelite settlement.</p> \n<p>“I am not interested in the historicity of the Ark Narrative. I want to know what’s behind it, what it tells us about the history of Judah and Israel, of the cult of the God of Israel and the Temple in Jerusalem,” says archaeologist Israel Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University, who has conducted digs at two locations said to have housed the ark: at Shiloh, north of Jerusalem, back in the 1980s, and this month at Kiriath Jearim, in a joint project with the College de France.</p> \n<p>Not King David after all?</p> \n<p>Many Biblical scholars think the story of the ark was a separate text, the so-called “Ark Narrative,” dating from around the 8th century B.C.E., which was later incorporated into the biblical texts, in the books of Samuel, perhaps just before the exile to Babylon.</p> \n<p>The story in 2 Samuel 6 about how David brought the ark to Jerusalem is actually a later tradition that was tacked onto the original Ark Narrative, which initially ended with its arrival in Kiriath Jearim, R&ouml;mer suspects.</p> \n<p>It has long been forgotten who wrote &quot;the Bible&quot;: different parts were clearly written in different times by different people, over hundreds and hundreds of years. But the Davidic or Solomonic texts are not believed to have originated in their own time, only centuries later.</p> \n<p>Also, while there is still debate over the historicity of figures like David and Solomon, most scholars agree that there is little archaeological evidence for the large, united Israelite kingdom in the 10th century described in the Bible.</p> \n<p>The biblical texts that recount this glorious empire and Solomon’s building of the Temple seem to have originated from the late 7th century B.C.E., in the time of King Josiah, around three centuries after the supposed Davidic era, R&ouml;mer says.</p> \n<p>Josiah was the Judean king known for expanding the borders of Judah and centralizing the worship of Yahweh at the Temple in Jerusalem while stamping out all other cults.</p> \n<p>“It is possible that the ark stayed much longer at Kiriath Jearim, and it was only Josiah who brought it to Jerusalem when he wanted to centralize all cultic and political activity there, and his scribes justified it by writing the story about David taking the ark,” R&ouml;mer postulates. “This might explain why there are no more stories about it,” since after Josiah’s reign (640-609 B.C.E.) Judah would survive less than three decades before falling to the Babylonians.</p> \n<p>The Bible itself, in what may have been an editorial slipup, appears to confirm Josiah's role in bringing the ark to Jerusalem. It is he, not David, who tells the Levites in 2 Chronicles 35:3 to “put the holy ark in the house that Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. You need not carry it on your shoulders.&quot;</p> \n<p>Nine-foot thick wall</p> \n<p>There is also extra-biblical evidence for the &quot;Josiah theory&quot; coming from the dig at Kiriath Jearim, which is a tell (an artificial hill created by stratified remains of human habitation) located just 12 kilometers west of Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>This is the first time that this biblical site has been investigated in depth. The remains uncovered there range from the early Bronze Age to the Byzantine period.</p> \n<p>The major discovery of this season so far has been a massive retaining wall, three meters thick and still standing two meters tall – which, judging from the pottery shards that surround it, dates from the 8th or 7th century B.C.E.</p> \n<p>This wall supported an artificially flattened terrace at the top of the mound. As was common for settlements across the Levant, the terrace could have housed a temple, Finkelstein told Haaretz during a tour of the site last week.</p> \n<p>“This site might have been one of the most important cultic centers of the country,” says Christophe Nicolle, an archaeologist from the College de France who jointly directs the Shmunis Family Excavations at Kiriath Jearim with Finkelstein and R&ouml;mer.</p> \n<p>“This reinforces the idea there was a temple here in the 8th or 7th century B.C.E., perhaps in competition with the Temple in Jerusalem,” Finkelstein says. Such competition, at least initially, would have had a strong national character: Although the Judahite capital of Jerusalem was just a few kilometers away, Kiriath Jearim was a Benjaminite town, according to the Bible.</p> \n<p>So, in certain periods, Kiriath Jearim could have been a border settlement belonging to the northern Kingdom of Israel, which encompassed all the tribes of Israel except Judah.</p> \n<p>This kingdom of Israel, which dwarfed Judah in size and power, was often at loggerheads with its southern neighbor until it was destroyed by the Assyrians in the late 8th century. Only then, mainly during Josiah's time, was Judah able to expand into Benjamin and other areas, which is also why Judah and Benjamin were the only Israelite tribes that were not lost in the Assyrian conquest.</p> \n<p>In other words, the archaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at Kiriath Jearim in the 8th and 7th centuries B.C.E., well after King David was supposed to have carried off the ark, but before King Josiah brought the area under Jerusalem's control.</p> \n<p>There are hints of the rivalry between Judah and Israel in the fact that the Book of Joshua repeatedly mentions that Kiriath Jearim, which means “Town of Forests” in Hebrew, was also known as Kiriath Baal or Baalah, linking it to the worship of the Canaanite god Baal – something akin to anathema for the biblical scribes of Josiah’s time. The dual name is also mentioned in 1 Chronicles 13:6: &quot;David and all Israel went to Baalah of Judah (Kiriath Jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the Lord&quot;.</p> \n<p>If these theories are correct, it would mean that the Ark of the Covenant, one of the symbols most associated with Judaism, was in fact housed in Jerusalem only in the final decades before the Babylonian invasion. For most of its life, it would have been at Kiriath Jearim and its previous home, Shiloh – today in the northern West Bank.</p> \n<p>Baal and Asherah inside?</p> \n<p>In fact, for most of its existence, the ark may have been associated with religious practices that would seem completely alien to Jews today.</p> \n<p>The biblical verses that claim the ark contained the Tablets of the Law are also considered to be late texts, dated to King Josiah’s era or possibly even later, R&ouml;mer says. Furthermore, he notes, the apologetic verse in 1 Kings 8:9 stating that “There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb&quot; (Mt Sinai) may be an indication that the Ten Commandments had substituted something else.</p> \n<p>Early Israelites worshipped Canaanite gods like Baal and El, as suggested by the 8th-century Hebrew inscriptions found at a shrine in Kuntillet Ajrud, in northeast Sinai, and by both the biblical subtext and the archeological record.</p> \n<p>In the early days, Yahweh himself was far from an invisible, universal deity. He was worshipped in the form of a bull or a sitting god; he had a divine consort, Asherah, and, as shown again in the Ajrud inscriptions, had localized cults that venerated “Yahweh of Samaria” and “Yahweh of Teman,” rather than a centralized worship in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>In his book “The Invention of God,” R&ouml;mer writes that throughout the Levant, it was common for pre-Islamic Arabs and Bedouins to carry holy chests that contained two sacred stones or the statues of two gods, that were later replaced by the Koran. Similarly, the ark may have originally contained two statues representing Yahweh and Asherah, he speculates.</p> \n<p>Indirect support for the theory abounds. Baal was the Canaanite god of storms associated with war and fertility. Aside from Kiryath Jearim's alternative name of Kiryath Baal, throughout the biblical narrative, the ark is connected to war – for example, it is carried into battle by the Israelites. It is also connected to fertility. Hannah, the Prophet Samuel’s mother, is a sterile woman who is blessed with a child after praying at the Tabernacle in Shiloh and then dedicates her son to the service of God.</p> \n<p>On the flip side, when David brings the ark to Jerusalem, he dances ecstatically and semi-naked before it – and when his wife Michal criticizes this display, she is punished with sterility.</p> \n<p>These biblical stories may all contain echoes of the ancient cults connected to the ark. It is difficult to completely untangle the many layers of history and myth contained in this story thousands of years later, but a broader message does emerge.</p> \n<p>The Bible appears to describe the ancient Israelites, from Moses onward, as staunch monotheists who sometimes err towards paganism and are punished for their sins by God. But this picture may be the result of mostly self-serving propaganda by the priests and scribes of the late monarchic or post-exilic periods.</p> \n<p>The reality emerging today from the combined work of biblical scholars and archeologists is much more complex and diverse. It indicates that Judaism as we know it today evolved slowly and organically, incorporating a variety of influences and religious traditions from the mosaic of cultures that lived side by side in the region.</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON — Democrats on Capitol Hill are reexamining their support for a bipartisan bill intended to fight boycotts against Israel and the settlements after the American Civil Liberties Union warned U.S. senators last week that it endangers free speech in the United States and could lead to citizens’ going to prison simply for expressing a political opinion.</p> \n<p>Two Democratic staffers who are involved in discussions over the legislation told Haaretz that over a dozen Democrats in both houses of Congress have already began to reconsider their positions in light of the letter the ACLU sent to U.S. senators. One of the first members of the House of Representatives to publicly announce such a review is Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a Democrat representing Massachusetts. Kennedy, a grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, is considered a rising political star in the Democratic Party and is one of 240 co-sponsors of the bill in the House.</p> \n<p>The controversial Israel Anti-Boycott Act was proposed in the both the Senate and the House in March, but it only garnered national attention after the ACLU issued the letter last week expressing strong opposition to it. The leading civil rights organization warned that under the bill’s current language, U.S. citizens could face fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and potentially even go to prison for up to 20 years, simply for expressing support for boycotts of Israel and the settlements.</p> \n<p>Another organization that came out against the legislation last week was J Street, which opposes boycotts of Israel and the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement but warned that the bill caused “serious concerns” because of its potential for restricting free speech. J Street also noted that the legislation does not differentiate between boycotts targeting the entire State of Israel and those aimed specifically at settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p> \n<p>Criticism of the bill has not been limited to the political left. The American Interest, a magazine that is considered to have a centrist, pro-Israeli editorial line, wrote last week, “It’s true that the bill is probably not as blatantly unconstitutional as some of its opponents are arguing: it modifies a decades-old law that has been upheld in court, and legal scholars are still debating exactly how it would be enforced. But it’s not free-and-clear either. It seems possible, for example, that a person funding a student campaign for a university to enforce a UN or EU-backed Israel boycott could be exposed to criminal liability. Now, in fact the courts would quickly throw a case like that out — the First Amendment easily trumps a piece of feel-good legislation that Congress whooped through to gain popularity points. But it is hard to base a case for supporting a legal proposal on the argument that some of its obvious applications to domestic circumstances would be dismissed out of hand.”</p> \n<p>These warnings have caused two of the bill’s original co-sponsors, Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, and Rep. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, to publish a letter on Friday responding to accusations that the bill would endanger free speech. They wrote that the bill’s critics misunderstood its’ language and that despite the ACLU’s warnings, no U.S. citizen will face legal penalties for supporting a boycott of Israel under the new legislation.</p> \n<p>The two congressman explained in their letter that the most controversial part of the bill — the one detailing the criminal penalties for participating in boycotts of Israel — was in fact an expansion of a law, enacted in 1977, prohibiting U.S. companies from taking part in state-led boycotts of Israel. That bill was adopted in order to counter the Arab boycott of Israel. The new bill adds a new component to it, stipulating that the penalties for participating in a state-led boycott of Israel will also extend to participation in boycotts led by international governmental organizations such as the United Nations and the European Union.</p> \n<p>Jay Michaelson, a legal affairs analyst for The Daily Beast, published a piece on Friday that reached a similar conclusion: The new bill only technically expands the 1977 anti-boycott law, in a way that would make it illegal for U.S. companies to cooperate with any boycotts of Israel and the settlements initiated by the UN or the EU. Michaelson accused AIPAC, the powerful pro-Israeli lobby which supports the legislation, of exaggerating its importance, thereby provoking a harsh response from the left that he says was not in keeping with the language of the draft law.</p> \n<p>Not all of the bill’s critics are convinced. “The language in the bill is confusing and doesn’t clearly state what Cardin and Portman wrote in their letter,” one Democratic staffer told Haaretz, adding that “it wouldn’t surprise me if a large number of Democrats will ask to amend this, making it much more clear that citizens expressing support for boycotts will not be punished for their political opinion.” Organizations supporting the BDS movement are worried that even if the bill doesn’t in fact include harsh penalties for supporting boycotts, it could be used to deter and frighten activists who support such boycotts from expressing their opinion.</p> \n<p>Democratic members of Congress face a difficult decision on the bill, since many of them have pro-Israeli donors and constituents who would likely be pleased by the passage of a bill making it harder to boycott the country, but they also need the support of the progressive wing of the party, which is paying more and more attention to this legislation in recent days. A key Democratic politician to follow with regards to this bill is Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, the only Democratic co-sponsor of the bill who is considered a possible contender for the 2020 presidential election. Gillibrand was one of 43 senators who co-sponsored the legislation.&nbsp; An aide to Senator Gillibrand said: &quot;We have a different read of the specific bill language, however, due to the ACLU's concerns, the Senator has extended an invitation to them to meet with her and discuss their concerns.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>In an essay he wrote for the scholarly anthology “Where Heaven and Earth Meet: Jerusalem’s Sacred Esplanade,” the Muslim Palestinian philosopher Sari Nusseibeh makes the point that it couldn’t have been the Prophet Mohammed's night journey to al-Haram al-Sharif – what the Jews call the Temple Mount – that bestowed holiness on that spot: “rather, Muhammad’s visit must have been made because of the spot’s already-existing sanctity.”</p> \n<p>Temple Mount crisis: Political rivalry led to Netanyahu's grave error ■ Jordan, Egypt try help Israel out ■ Between political and legal fears, leadership in Israel is absent ■ Abbas: Freeze in ties with Israel includes security coordination</p> \n<p>One needn’t be a nonbeliever to acknowledge that Jerusalem in general, and the Sacred Esplanade – to use the neutral terminology employed by the ecumenical team of editors and writers of “Where Heaven and Earth Meet” (principal editors Oleg Grabar and Benjamin Z. Kedar) – in particular, is of central symbolic significance to Judaism, Christianity and Islam. And it’s hardly a coincidence, considering that first Christianity and then Islam built upon the traditions of their predecessors and claimed to supersede them. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the stories all three of these monotheistic faiths tell about the Mount.</p> \n<p>It is only because of the never-ending conflict between Israelis and Palestinians – a political struggle that is taking on an increasingly religious character – that either side feels compelled to insist that its claim to the Mount is an exclusive one, and insists on denying its rivals’ connection to it.</p> \n<p>No one can say what the significance of the hill known as Zion and as Moriah was to the Canaanites who inhabited Jerusalem before the Israelites conquered it in roughly 1000 B.C.E. We’re told in 2 Samuel 24 that the conqueror, King David, insisted on paying for the threshing floor he received from the Jebusite king Araunah. It was there that God instructed him to establish an altar and make an offering, thus bringing to an end a calamitous plague that had killed 70,000 of his people.</p> \n<p>Later, it was David’s son Solomon who built the Temple on the site of that same altar. These Biblical accounts are not contemporary records of events. Rather, the narrative of Solomon that appears in 1 Kings 6, like the books of Joshua, Judges and Samuel, was probably written hundreds of years later, at about the turn of the 7th century B.C.E. It may well be that the reports of David’s altar and his city and of Solomon’s Temple being built on the location of the Jebusite town were written that way in order to clearly establish how the Israelites’ monotheism superseded the pagan religion of the Canaanite Jebusites.</p> \n<p>The later a Hebrew text was written, it seems, the further back the Israelitic claim to Jerusalem seems to go. Genesis 22, for example, places the Binding of Isaac in the Land of Moriah, but it is only in 2 Chronicles that the connection is made between “Moriah” and Jerusalem. There we read how, “Solomon began to build the House of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where [the Lord] appeared unto David his father; for which provision had been made in the Place of David, in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite” (2 Chronicles 3:1). That text, say Bible scholars, was likely written several hundred years later still.</p> \n<p>Finally, the Talmud, compiled even later, claims that “the world was created from Zion” (Yoma 54b), and in it and later midrashic texts we find references to Adam, Cain and Noah having made sacrifices to God in Jerusalem. (It is actually a Christian tradition that places “Mount Zion” in the spot just outside the southwest corner of the Old City, presumably because of the belief that this is the location of David’s tomb, and David is the progenitor of Jesus. Locating Mount Zion there also reflected “the [Christian] wish to annul the Temple Mount’s sanctity,” according to scholar Rachel Elior.)</p> \n<p>Christianity is meant to be a universal faith based on spiritual beliefs, not acts of sacrifice. Nonetheless, its seminal texts establish Jesus’ bona fides, so to speak, by having some of the major events of his life take place in Jerusalem, beginning with the tradition, in the Gospel of Luke,&nbsp;that Jesus’ parents brought him to the Temple to &quot;redeem&quot; him after his birth (his pidyon haben), and that he returned at age 12, and ended up staying to talk theology with the teachers in &quot;my Father's house,&quot; as he later told his worried parents.&nbsp;Later, all of the gospels describe Jesus coming to the Temple and turning out in disgust the animal traders and money-changers from its courtyard.&nbsp;In John 4, Jesus tells a Samaritan woman whom he meets at Mount Gerizim that “the time is coming when it will no longer matter whether you worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.” The sacrifices and the Temple where they are offered become unnecessary after Jesus himself is sacrificed in Jerusalem by way of his crucifixion.</p> \n<p>The Koran, Islam’s primary scripture, does not mention Jerusalem by name. It is only in the hadiths, the supplementary texts that report on the words and acts of the Prophet Mohammed, that the connection is made between al-Masjid al-Aqsa, the “Farthest Mosque,” mentioned in sura 17 of the Koran, and Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>According to the Koran, Mohammed made “a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque whose precincts We did bless, in order that We might show him some of Our Signs.” According to Muslim scholar Mustafa Abu Sway, “the hadith scholars, Qur’an commentators, and all of Islamic tradition take this particular verse seriously and consider the Sacred Mosque to be in Mecca and the Farthest Mosque to be in Jerusalem. No Muslim scholar challenged this position throughout Islamic intellectual history” (from his essay “The Holy Land, Jerusalem, and the Aqsa Mosque in the Islamic Sources” in “Where Heaven and Earth Meet”). These later texts also make the connection between Aqsa (Farthest) Mosque and “Bayt al-Maqdis” – House of the Holy, or “Beit Hamikdash,” the Hebrew term for the Temple.</p> \n<p>As noted, for details of Mohammed’s night journey, in which his horse Buraq carried him from Mecca to Jerusalem (a trip called the “Isra”), where he prayed and then ascended to Heaven (the “Mi’raj”) to converse with God before returning to earth – all of this in the course of a single night – one has to turn to the hadith texts.</p> \n<p>What the account does do, however, is establish the Muslim link to Jerusalem. In fact, Jerusalem quickly became universally considered the third-holiest site for Muslims, after Mecca and Medina. Mohammed died in 632 C.E. and was succeeded as caliph first by Abu Bakr and then by Umar (although this succession was disputed by the group that became the Shi’a). It is the latter who conquered Jerusalem in 635-638 and established the Dome of the Rock (sometimes mistaken called the Mosque of Umar) and the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the site of the ruins of the Herodian Second Temple.</p> \n<p>The reign of Umar in Jerusalem was known for its relative tolerance. The next millennium and a half, of course, was characterized by successive conquests of the city, with the fortunes of the different faiths in it rising and sinking depending on who was sovereign there.</p> \n<p>The turn of the Jews came only in 1967, with the Six-Day War and the unification of the divided city under Israeli rule. In general, Israel’s policy has been one of religious tolerance and openness. When Israeli authorities closed the Temple Mount to Muslim worshippers for two days after the July 14 killing of two Border Policemen there, it was the first time they had done so since 1969. But the question of who’s in charge has been a sensitive one – an extreme understatement – since the day in June 1967 that an Israel Defense Forces soldier raised an Israeli flag over Al-Aqsa Mosque, only to have Defense Minister Moshe Dayan order it removed minutes later. In such a situation, it is not surprising that there is little room for magnanimity, with each side on constant alert for any change in the status quo and any sign that the other side is gradually encroaching on its position. Any backing down is interpreted by both publics as a sign of weakness. Infinitesimally small actions can set off a conflict whose stakes will be unthinkably high.</p>",

Thou Shalt Not Kill.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But it seems that I missed the memo from some quarters of leftist activism and pro-Palestinians social media actors (including from some of my fellow academics) that murdering settlers at Shabbat dinner is only...sort of...wrong.</p> \n<p>As the initial logic of a larger camp of activists goes, Jewish-Israeli settlers are just soldiers of state expansion in Sabbath attire, carrying out ethnic cleansing even without the army uniform, destroying the dignity and potential sovereignty of the Palestinian people in plain sight, and so don’t need IDF camouflage attire. (There were even some echoes of these ideas in a recent Haaretz op-ed.)&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For some, the farthermost reaches of this argument arrives at the point that a family of ten sitting down to a festive meal is fair game for slaughter. After all, today settlers are barely viewed as human beings to many on the left and blamed as the sole obstacle to peace in the occupied territories.</p> \n<p>I never thought I would need to put this to paper but here it is: human rights aren't only for the politically-correct people of the planet. The inalienable freedom not to be murdered in your kitchen as you sit down to dinner with your family applies to all. There is no moral or political justification for wanton slaughter. One's political beliefs have no bearing on the fundamental entitlement to life and safety. Settlers, too, are human beings with human rights. [Full stop.]</p> \n<p>I hope that Omar al-Abed, the Palestinian terrorist, will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and that others in his community who may be inspired by these acts will know the crushing force of judicial and social recrimination.</p> \n<p>Now for the inevitable accusation that I’ve drunk the settler Kool-Aid: Believing that all human beings - even those with controversial ideologies - deserve equal protection doesn’t mean one subscribes to ultra-nationalist politics. You are lying to yourself if you say you are a liberal but don’t actually think all peoples are deserving of the same dispensations; that the lives of Yosef, Chaya, and Elad Salomon are somehow less worthy than other lives in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Moreover, for those of us concerned about the human rights of Palestinians in the occupied territories, it is sheer hypocrisy to decry the death and disenfranchisement of a population under occupation on a daily basis, while turning a blind (even benevolent) eye to terrorists that would do the same to their neighbors in their own homes.</p> \n<p>I am not nave about the idea that deployment of rights-based discourses is ripe for manipulation in respect to the occupied territories - I wrote a whole book about it recently. I don’t deny the slipperiness of the distinction between 'settler' vs 'soldier’, when most are armed veterans living in a dangerous environment, nor the blurriness of what constitutes a civilian or a battlefield in the age of asymmetrical warfare. (Of course, these are certainly questions we ask about Gazans living under Hamas' regime.) The juridical position that renders settlements (land) but not settlers (people) as illegal is a distinction that's apparently hard to make, not least for terrorists themselves.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It’s also worth considering how Israel’s settler-colonial state compares to many other modern liberal democracies and whether civic nationalism is a fantasy - is every citizen of a nation-state merely a conscript of the regime’s agenda? It is also relevant to discuss the role of armed resistance in other conflict zones and their transitions to peace and democracy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While these topics may make for interesting philosophical discussion about the limits of international law and liberalism over a boozy dinner at Oxford — they cannot be a thought-experiment played out over a bloody Sabbath meal in the occupied territories. Words have meaning, and the pen (or the tweet) can be equally mighty to the sword in a West Bank settlement. Academic and activist conversations have consequences - deadly consequences.</p> \n<p>That said, retribution is also not on offer on this bloody table: the Halamish attack and similar attacks do not entitle settlers or the State of Israel to deprive others of their human rights, civil freedoms, or basic dignities (not to mention political will), so I pray that reprisals - which we should call clearly and full-throatedly as terrorism and demand equal punishment -- will not be forthcoming.</p> \n<p>The cycle of violence in Jerusalem, which has now spread to the West Bank, is still within human control. I hope Palestinians and Israelis will disavow those within their own communities who choose violence and revenge and make the difficult concession of returning to the path of reconciliation after a week like this.</p> \n<p>At the heart of the matter is this: if we allow human rights to be applicable only to some of history's subjects, we will all have lost our humanity at Halamish.</p> \n<p>Dr. Sara Yael Hirschhorn is University Research Lecturer and Sidney Brichto Fellow in Israel Studies at the University of Oxford.

        "text":["<p>Talking to: Eran Tzidkiyahu, 36, research associate at the Forum for Regional Thinking, and a “geopolitical” tour guide. Where: at the foot of the Temple Mount. When: Sunday, 10 A.M.</p> \n<p>What does it mean that you are a “geopolitical guide”?</p> \n<p>It means that I engage in the conflict from the perspective of its geographical and political aspects. Essentially, I take people out and show them the conflict in the field – on the Temple Mount, in the territories, in settlements. In places that are holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims.</p> \n<p>What sorts of people are interested in this type of tour?</p> \n<p>Representatives of various civil-society organizations, students and faculty members from universities in Israel and around the world, American Jews, groups of rabbis. Not long ago, I guided senior officials from the Mossad.</p> \n<p>We also went up to the Temple Mount earlier today. The policeman at the entrance asked if we wanted an escort, warned us not to touch anything, not to enter the mosques. He said that the situation is sensitive.</p> \n<p>I think that we need to stop for a moment and look at this place from the outside. I really try to read the space as if it were a text. I am interested not only in the main event that is going on, but also in the little things all around it. The guard, the bitterness of the group of Haredim [ultra-Orthodox Jews] waiting on the bridge. The conversations conducted by the policemen.</p> \n<p>Interesting. What did you see that I couldn’t see?</p> \n<p>For instance, all of the entryways to the Western Wall [Plaza] are very wide. Only the [non-Muslim] entry to the Temple Mount is small and off to the side. The state isn’t interested in having you enter there, it intentionally doesn’t make this entrance into a terminal with 10 inspection points. No, it is a little station, and the Jews standing there are held up for quite some time.</p> \n<p>Before they inspected my bag, you asked me if I was carrying a copy of the Book of Psalms. You said it might cause us more trouble than the tablet and the voice recorder. What did you mean?</p> \n<p>Jews aren’t allowed to bring religious objects up to the Temple Mount. The police enforce the status quo that prevents Jews from conducting ritual acts on the Mount. And if someone is not aware of that and has such an object in his possession, his entry to the Temple Mount will be significantly delayed.</p> \n<p>But there was a huge group of Haredi Jews waiting to go up. Aren’t they carrying siddurim [prayer books]?</p> \n<p>There are special cabinets down below for them to store their objects. Anyone who pulls out a Jewish book on the Temple Mount plaza will immediately be detained by the police. Something new that I noticed today for the first time is that they’ve installed sunshades along the path. Someone made the decision to provide shade to this narrow and uncomfortable column of people waiting in line.</p> \n<p>And what do you make of that?</p> \n<p>In my opinion, it reflects a change in approach by the police. I think it is evidence of the great deal of pressure being exerted on the authorities responsible for the Temple Mount by the various pro-Temple groups. That these groups are becoming increasingly more powerful.</p> \n<p>Perhaps you could tell me about the Temple groups.</p> \n<p>Currently it is a real conglomerate of organizations and groups and individuals that put the Temple Mount at the top of their agendas, whether it is to attain rights to ascend and pray on the Mount, or whether it is to promote the establishment of the Third Temple. Back in the 1990s, these groups were marginal, they were considered way out there. Today a significant share of their demands has entered the mainstream. To a large extent, [Likud Knesset member] Yehudah Glick is the man responsible for the unification of these groups into a single body that acts to strategically promote its objectives. Together with [Public Security Minister] Gilad Ardan, [Culture and Sports Minister] Miri Regev, and the commander of the Jerusalem police district, he has succeeded in attaining real achievements.</p> \n<p>Define the achievements.</p> \n<p>The Temple Mount is talked about in the corridors of the Knesset and in the Prime Minister’s Office. The Internal Affairs and Environment Committee chaired by Regev has held several hearings on the right to pray on the Temple Mount by Jews. The Murabitun and the Murabitat [Muslim groups, the former for females, latter for males, that see themselves as the gatekeepers of the Temple Mount] have been declared illegal. Jewish groups ascend the Temple Mount in numbers and frequency that are continually growing. But the primary achievement, as I mentioned, is the penetration into the mainstream. Nowadays, every secular Israeli can be expected to say that we have rights on the Temple Mount, and many of them even support the right to pray there.</p> \n<p>It’s a change in public consciousness.</p> \n<p>One that also has its expressions in the field. From the level of Gilad Erdan, who speaks out against the status quo that he is supposed to maintain, to the leaks from the cabinet on the matter of the metal detectors, which demonstrates that their conduct is not limited only to what is practical and feasible – that there are also considerations related to religion, identity, even messianic beliefs; to things that I can see with my own eyes.</p> \n<p>It is the police that are supposed to deal with Jews ascending to the Temple Mount. To impede, to delay, to thin out. Supporters of the Temple are familiar, of course, with the policemen on the Temple Mount, and the policemen recognize them. In the past year, I have seen a real, closer relationship emerging between the policemen and the Temple supporters. This year, a month or so before the murder of the Druze policemen [on July 14, 2017], police Major General Yoram Halevi went up to the Mount with a group of Temple supporters, where he was photographed with them. He is the district commander, and he received a blessing from them on the Mount that was photographed and documented. That is sheer lunacy. On his blog, Arnon Segal, a Temple activist, wrote that this [specific] ascent to the Temple Mount was a “national-state ascent” dedicated to the memory of Hallel Ariel, the girl who was murdered in Kiryat Arba [in 2016]. Her parents are extremely enthusiastic and dedicated Temple activists. Her mother constantly speaks of a Temple consciousness.</p> \n<p>What does “Temple consciousness” even mean?</p> \n<p>Living your life with the awareness that your purpose in this country as a Jew is to live in accordance with the commandments of the Torah, and that there are a great deal of commandments that cannot be observed without a Temple. So one has to live with full intention with respect to this. For instance, she works with women on baking of the special bread that needs to be prepared for the Temple. For these people, the Temple is our reason for being here.</p> \n<p>Does it come across as authentic to you?</p> \n<p>Absolutely. These are interesting and serious people, and I would by no means dismiss them. Partly because of the potential repercussions of what they are doing, and partly because we are speaking of intelligent people possessing a profound religious and national consciousness, some of whom are immersed in it with all their heart and soul. The closer I get and watch and listen to them, the more I see this experience as highly authentic.</p> \n<p>I understand that you are in close touch with them.</p> \n<p>I know all of these people personally. I even completed a course for Temple Mount tour guides run by the Temple Mount Heritage Foundation.</p> \n<p>What is a Temple Mount tour guide course?</p> \n<p>In view of the fact that increasingly more Jews are going up to the Mount, the Temple Mount organizations decided to launch an initiative: The goal is for each Jew who comes to the Mount to encounter another Jew who will accompany him, tell him about it, and explain the history and theology.</p> \n<p>I can’t see you fitting in in a course like that.</p> \n<p>When I joined the course they really were pretty apprehensive. They asked me what my motives were, because they know me and my opinions. When I said that I simply wanted to understand, they agreed that I could join – on condition, of course, that I would not write any posts on Facebook or share the course contents with anyone.</p> \n<p>But there is an obvious agenda.</p> \n<p>For sure. The course is led by prominent Temple activists. Yehudah Glick himself conferred the certificate for completing the course on me.</p> \n<p>What was the content of the course?</p> \n<p>Mainly it was historical religious content concerned with the Temple and the Mount. A great deal of attention was paid to the dimensions of the Temple. One of the main reasons for the halakhic [Jewish legal] ban on ascent to the Temple Mount has to do with the concern about entering forbidden holy areas, so this is extremely relevant to them, as they want to know where it is permissible for them to walk and where it is forbidden. For them, the most interesting question is where exactly the altar on the raised platform to the east of the Dome of the Rock actually stood.</p> \n<p>Why?</p> \n<p>Because you don’t need a Temple to offer sacrifices. The Passover sacrifice, for example. They are saying, “Why shouldn’t we come in with a young goat and offer the Passover sacrifice on the Temple Mount?” After all, that would not deter from the sanctity of the Muslims. It is permitted. It’s even required. For that, it is important to know where the altar is.</p> \n<p>I can’t even begin to tell you how hard it is for me to relate to this.</p> \n<p>Look, when you are standing up there on the Mount, with these people, and they are standing on the northern steps and looking at the Dome of the Chain, they’re not seeing what you see. They are seeing the place of the sacrificial altar. The site of the Temple. They are in a different dimension.</p> \n<p>As in some sort of a vision? Is that what you felt when you were among them?</p> \n<p>Totally. They’re on a high. They are not seeing the things that surround them – the line or the cops or the Waqf. They only want to go up already, and the moment that they pass through the gates, some of them bow down and prostrate themselves. That is permissible in Judaism only on the Temple Mount. Total prostration, hands and feet stretched out on the ground. Anywhere else, that is considered idol worship and is forbidden. These people are seeing on the Mount a mythological past and a mythological future, and not the present.</p> \n<p>Yes. That definitely explains a great deal.</p> \n<p>As far as they’re concerned, the building of the Temple is a logical and correct idea. Look, “Zion” is not, after all, about building kibbutzim. If you had asked a Jew 200 years ago what the meaning is of “Return to Zion,” he would reply, “returning to the Holy Land and rebuilding the Temple.” That is what people pray for and that is where all of “Zionist” consciousness was directed – until the advent of Zionism. Zionism is essentially a repudiation of this discourse, an attempt to secularize it, to nationalize it. Zionism attempted to escape from this idea of Temple, and now you’re seeing it coming back.</p> \n<p>Is it coming back, or is it being brought back by religious Zionism?</p> \n<p>Essentially, it reentered the arena in response to the possibility of territorial compromise. The Gush Emunim folks did not focus on the Temple. Oslo was the crisis that has brought broader segments of the religious Zionist public to express interest in the Temple Mount. In March 1996, the Yesha Rabbinical Council [representing the settler rabbis] issued a call to ascend the Temple Mount. It was at the height of the month of Ramadan, and on the Friday that followed the issue of this call, 250,000 Palestinians came to pray there. This is the dynamic of the two sides. A few months later, the Western Wall Tunnel riots broke out and the [Israeli] Islamic Movement decided to engage full-on in the Al-Aqsa issue.</p> \n<p>The status quo, the unwritten agreements between the authorities and the Waqf, that had held for 30 years, collapsed. Essentially, both the Yesha Rabbinical Council and the leadership of the Islamic Movement in Israel are united around the same holy site. It is not a coincidence. It is impossible to speak of the Temple Mount as driving Jewish identity without speaking of Al-Aqsa [by which Muslims refer to the entire esplanade] as driving Palestinian identity. In the same way that this idea was raised at a time when there was an attempt to reach a compromise and perhaps end the conflict, the same thing happened on the Palestinian side. It isn’t an academic question or a philosophical argument; it is a fact of life for all of the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Are you convinced of that?</p> \n<p>Just before we met, an old Palestinian man in the Muslim Quarter said to me, “As a Palestinian, I am commanded to protect this site; I am speaking with you from the heart and not from the head.” It isn’t that every Palestinian in Jenin and in Umm al-Fahm is thinking of Al-Aqsa all the time, but at the heart of the Palestinian identity, what distinguishes them from the Arab and the Islamic world around them is their connection to Al-Aqsa and their sense of the timeless mission of protecting it against the takeover of the heretics, throughout history. This is a Palestinian-national message no less than an Islamic-religious one. In the same way in which Jews see as holy the Second Temple period, the ethos of Masada and Hanukkah, the last period of Jewish sovereignty, so does Islam in this country unite around the idea of protection of the holy sites in Jerusalem – “Al-Aqsa, whose precincts we did bless” [from Surah 17:1 of the Koran] – as the third holiest site to Islam, there we are protecting the holy places of Islam from the dangers that lay without. That is a very deep foundation of the Palestinian identity here.</p> \n<p>We won’t review the whole, long history of clashes on the Temple Mount here, but what is common to all of them, I think, is a dynamic of reaction. One side is dragged into it in the wake of acts committed by the other side.</p> \n<p>People look at it, both on the Palestinian side and on the Israeli side, as if “the other side is doing this to us,” when in effect the situation is as you described it, there is a constant flow of response and counter-response.</p> \n<p>Maybe you could describe to me this place through the eyes of the Palestinians. Through the eyes of the individual who comes up to the Mount to pray five times a day.</p> \n<p>The Temple Mount is not only the third-holiest place to Muslims in Israel, it is also the largest park in East Jerusalem, the biggest open space in an area that is otherwise an urban disaster. It is the only place where there is a certain degree of freedom and independence for Palestinians, because it is the place where Israeli sovereignty is at its most imperfect and the Israeli occupation is less present. Therefore, here you can see families getting together for picnics, people passing through here for no special reason in the middle of the day, just to rest, to pray, to eat. This phenomenon has changed gradually in recent years, and this is precisely what the Palestinians feel that they are losing – not only their national symbol, but also their personal expanse of freedom, to which they are connected not only at the religious level, but also at the individual level. Again, you have to understand – there are no parks, no gardens, there is only the Temple Mount. The childhood memories of many of them are rooted in this place. In light of the balance of forces in this space, they interpret everything that happens on the Israeli side as an attempt to deprive them of their place here.</p> \n<p>On the matter of sovereignty, yesterday I read an old quote from the historian Shlomo Ben-Ami, who argued that more than we are sovereign on the Temple Mount, we are hostages of the Temple Mount.</p> \n<p>He’s right. We are hostages of the sovereignty question on the Temple Mount. Our sovereignty here is the problem and not the solution.</p> \n<p>Every times there’s a flare-up, when it is put to the test, we rediscover that in actual fact, we do not have sovereignty.</p> \n<p>That is true, in my opinion, for all of Jerusalem. The State of Israel believes that the solution in Jerusalem is application of sovereignty, but it has already been 50 years that sovereignty in Jerusalem has been expressed only through power, and every child who takes an introductory course in political science can tell you that the more you use physical strength, the less real institutional power you actually possess. A sovereignty that is expressed by means of battalions of Border Police officers is not a profound sovereignty, and there will be no solution to the Temple Mount so long as we speak in terms of absolute sovereignty. Who is the “registered” owner of the Temple Mount? Does it matter at all? Is the legal process suitable for the management of this thing? At the end of the day, we do not have sovereignty, neither on the Temple Mount nor in eastern Jerusalem, and that is the fact. We aren’t even able to put metal detectors in place.</p> \n<p>Some people are referring to the sense of accomplishment among Palestinians in the wake of this recent round [of violence]. What are you hearing?</p> \n<p>I am hearing Palestinian friends, even totally secular ones, speaking with total euphoria about the power and the communal organization. They said they haven’t felt this way ever. If they were children during the second intifada, or they were born afterward, they aren’t at all familiar with this sense of collectivism; they’ve only known day-to-day survival, being afraid of everyone they see. All of a sudden they’ve received a connection, a sensation of communalism, a hope that it can be different. The Palestinian media is filled with calls to draw conclusions from this victory. The first conclusion is that Israel cannot stand up to organized, mass, nonviolent actions.</p> \n<p>Whose idea was it – for Muslim worshippers to refuse to enter the compound [so long as the metal detectors were in place]? Of the prayers of defiance outside of the gates?</p> \n<p>I don’t know. I was sitting here a few days ago with friends, experts on Jerusalem, among them Palestinians, and we weren’t able to come up with an answer as to who started it – the religious leaders, the Waqf or the residents. After all, the Waqf couldn’t have known that the residents would support it.</p> \n<p>How did it look out in the field?</p> \n<p>Tons of people in the streets. The women of the city brought out piles of food for them. We are talking about five prayers a day, which is basically all day long. People coming from every corner of the country. I was in Baka al-Gharbiyeh the day before, where I met with some well-known Arab intellectuals who were saying – we are going up to Al-Aqsa tomorrow, the whole family. We are on a mission here, we have an obligation here. The police put roadblocks on one road. At night they checked each and every car to try and deter people from trying to get through, but tens of thousands nevertheless made it.</p> \n<p>What exactly is the role that the Waqf played in the story of the spontaneous organization?</p> \n<p>What has happened here in the past two or three weeks rose up from the Palestinian street of East Jerusalem. In Jerusalem there is no leadership. There simply isn’t. There is the Waqf. It is the largest and most influential institution. In the wake of these events, the Waqf and the street found each other. A well-organized organization with power and money and hierarchy encountered a street that was yearning for leadership and collective action. The interests converged – the Waqf gained renewed strength from the street, and the street gained leadership. To a certain degree, it is the same Jerusalem street that has been looking out for Al-Aqsa for years.</p> \n<p>When [Jordan’s King] Abdullah and Bibi [Netanyahu] agreed on the installation of cameras in 2015, the street simply did not let it happen. Now the street has again entered the picture. In my opinion, a profound change in the conception of organized activity in East Jerusalem has taken place. New structures have emerged, a new modus vivendi. It is reasonable to assume that new leaders will also arise here. Something big has happened here – a non-violent populist organization that forced Israel to cave in. The Palestinian internet is already dealing with the subject.</p> \n<p>What are you seeing there? What are they writing?</p> \n<p>“We’ve succeeded in having an effect on Israel and we have to keep it up.” This public, that always had deals being made over its head, is now the public that spearheaded the process, and [Turkish President] Erdogan and [U.S President] Trump and King Abdullah and Bibi could only hover around it. The Jerusalem street is currently rediscovering its strength.</p> \n<p>Do you think Netanyahu understands this?</p> \n<p>I don’t know. On the Temple Mount issue, Netanyahu is constantly hiding behind low-ranking cops.</p> \n<p>What about Yoram Halevi, the Jerusalem district commander, whom we spoke about earlier?</p> \n<p>I don’t know him. Judging his performance alone, it’s a disgrace. Yoram Halevi goes up to the Temple Mount along with Temple activists, changes their status, goes on record arrogantly on the matter of the metal detectors, as if this were the entrance to a shopping mall. We are speaking of a lack of professionalism and a failure to understand the turf. It’s that idea of wanting to teach a lesson, of acting inflexibly in a manner that will ignite popular protest.</p> \n<p>He wanted “to prevent the Palestinians’ having a picture of victory.”</p> \n<p>That is what he said. And in the end, he lost. If he is indeed a serious professional, he is apparently motivated by other considerations.</p> \n<p>The bottom line of this conversation is very depressing.</p> \n<p>I am actually optimistic. I think that if we remove the matter of sovereignty from the equation, it would be possible to think of creative solutions. Of a discourse of cooperation. When we stand as equals, there will not be the difference in the balance of forces that currently exists; we could carry on this conversation, and Jews would be able to pray on the Temple Mount as do the Muslims.</p> \n<p>I wouldn’t hold my breath.</p> \n<p>Why not? It happened in Ireland, with the Good Friday Agreement. There, too, there was a conflict going back centuries, bearing a religious aspect. It is a long path, and it is up to us to try and take that path – or to succumb to pessimism. We cannot change the course of history, we can only choose our path.</p> \n<p>You know, I came back here, after three years in France, in the middle of Operation Protective Edge [in 2014]. From tranquil Strasbourg right into the air-raid sirens. It wasn’t a simple thing, but I have no doubt that I made the right decision. I feel that my life is full of value and meaning, in spite of the challenges and the concern over the future of the children.</p> \n<p>Strasbourg gave me inspiration. After all, it stood at the center of the French-German conflict for centuries, and it became a symbol of European reconciliation. There are a large number of French-German couples who live there and who are unable to understand how someone could have fought over it, in the same way as the children born after the reconciliation in Ireland.</p> \n<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it is that you have to be humble when it comes to history, and not to say that something will not happen, because it can always happen. A child who is born a minute after the agreements are signed here will be unable to understand how we could have thought or lived otherwise.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The arrest of Dareen Tatour // By Revital Hovel</p> \n<p>Dareen Tatour, 35, of Reineh in northern Israel, was charged in November 2015 with incitement to violence and support for a terror organization, over three items she posted on Facebook and YouTube. According to the indictment, one video shows masked men throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at Israeli forces. In the background, Tatour is heard reading a poem she wrote, whose English title is “Resist, my people, resist them.”</p> \n<p>The day after uploading the video, she wrote in a post: “The Islamic Jihad movement hereby declares the continuation of the intifada throughout the West Bank. ... Continuation means expansion ... which means all of Palestine. ... And we must begin within the Green Line ...for the victory of Al-Aqsa, and we shall declare a general intifada. #Resist.”</p> \n<p>The State Prosecutor’s Office interpreted this text as support for Islamic Jihad and a new intifada.</p> \n<p>The third, allegedly criminal, post was uploaded five days later. It was a photograph of Asra’a Abed, a 30-year-old Israeli Arab woman who was shot and wounded by police after waving a knife at officers in the bus station in Afula in October 2015. Tatour captioned the image, “I am the next shahid,” or martyr.</p> \n<p>Two days later the police arrested Tatour at her home. In her request to hold Tatour for the duration of legal proceedings, prosecutor Alina Hardak cited the “real danger to public welfare” posed by her posts.</p> \n<p>After initially denying any connection to the Facebook page and the image of Abed, Tatour told investigators that, like other Arab poets, she writes about prisoners and her homeland. She stressed that her intentions were nonviolent, that she doesn’t want to be a shahida and that she favors only peaceful means.</p> \n<p>In January 2016 Tatour was released, after being fitted with an ankle monitor, to house arrest at the home of her brother in Kiryat Ono, which has no internet access.</p> \n<p>After successive relaxations of the terms of her house arrest, Tatour holds down a part-time retail job, but is still prohibited from accessing the internet. A verdict is expected soon.</p> \n<p>The Jewish State versus Dareen Tatour // by Yehouda Shenhav</p> \n<p>Dareen Tatour is not Jewish. She’s a Palestinian citizen of Israel who lives in the village of Reineh near Nazareth. She had dreamed of being a poet since she was a child. Alina Hardak, the diligent and determined prosecutor, destroyed her dream by attempting to prove that Tatour is not a real poet. This came to light in public, in an unprecedented ars-poetic theatrical hearing held at the courthouse.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor, who can be imagined wearing a cloak and brandishing a sword, insists for seven full hours on resolving the irresolvable riddle of poetry, namely, who is a poet? As if it was the poetic equivalent of Fermat's Last Theorem.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor is an attorney. She has a career and is trying to be objective, as her profession demands. But she also has thoughts, and once in a while the mouth releases what those thoughts are. You must read it to believe it. Instead of the hearing discussing the semantic and political implications of a poem written in Arabic for Arabs, the hearing in the palace of justice revolves around the “credibility” of its translation into Hebrew.</p> \n<p>I was not in the courtroom myself, but here are a few of the things that were said there, which together make up a theater of the absurd of two systems.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Act One: Who is a poet?</p> \n<p>Witness: Prof. Nissim Calderon, who teaches Hebrew poetry and edits a poetry journal. Cross examination: About two hours</p> \n<p>Prosecutor: You begin by assuming the accused is a poet.</p> \n<p>W: Yes.</p> \n<p>P: You agree that you have no prior acquaintance.</p> \n<p>W: I read the indictment, and there’s a poem there, and the person who wrote the poem is a poet.</p> \n<p>****</p> \n<p>P: Who defines a poem?</p> \n<p>W: There is no authoritative entity. ... What the poet defines as a poem is a poem.</p> \n<p>P: How do you know the poet defines it as a poem?</p> \n<p>W: It was published in short lines, and when it has a rhythmic element we can reasonably assume it’s a poem. ... “Resist, resist my people,” that’s musicality that stems from repetition. There’s a musical and literal connection in the refrain. ... The prosecutor also understood that it’s a poem.</p> \n<p>P: If I write a text eight lines long, and after every two lines, two lines are repeated, is that a poem to you?</p> \n<p>W: Yes.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor delves into the differences between prose, poetry, a figure of speech, reliable poetry and imitative poetry. She apparently disagrees with generations of giants. Tatour is not a poet, even if this isn’t her first poem in Arabic and contains a rhythmic element and short lines that repeat. If she is a poet, the trial is a farce; in a democracy, poets are not tried and cut off from the world for a year and a half.</p> \n<p>In a democracy, poetry enjoys creative freedom, minority opinions must be heard, etc. The prosecutor won’t allow Tatour to be called a poet, because if she is a poet, Israel is China or North Korea.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor begins to realize that she is arguing with a leftist academic. She tenses when the expert explains that the poem was written in a genre customary to Palestinian national poetry, that there are thousands like it and they have parallels in all national poetry traditions, including Zionism.</p> \n<p>When the witness says there is no authority to determine what is a poem, the prosecutor resolves to prove that the court is hearing a leftist disguised as an objective witness.</p> \n<p>She cites an event the witness took part in, “Poetry in the Shadow of Terror,” in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>We can only assume that the prosecutor will demand regulations and a code of ethics for poets. The Culture Ministry will establish a licensing unit for poets, with rules against poetic negligence. The Public Security Ministry will guard against impersonators, who may be jailed without charges. The Health Ministry will revoke the license of a poet who has suffered an attack of lunacy or divine inspiration (whichever comes first).</p> \n<p>Now the indefatigable prosecutor must prove that “shahid” means terrorist. She asks her translator to take the stand.</p> \n<p>The witness is an old man, with 30 years in the Nazareth police. For the first time in his life, he is being asked to translate a literary text into Hebrew.</p> \n<p>When his translation was submitted to the court, he apologized for flaws and omissions. Much was lost in translation. And “shahid”? He got stuck in the middle, between Arabic and Hebrew. “Shahid” is “shahid.” For the prosecution that’s enough, because in Hebrew culture a shahid is a terrorist.</p> \n<p>But the next witness, an expert on translation for the defense, enumerates various dictionary definitions of shahid: a martyr, one who has fallen in battle, a victim.” I assume the prosecutor realized that once again she had before her a witness who is not objective and has leftist views. Apparently it’s important that every word in Arabic have only one meaning in Hebrew, even if it’s removed from its semantic context. For the prosecution, it was preferable to leave shahid in Hebrew transliteration, and to rely on its meaning in Hebrew culture — as though a word in Arabic and the meaning with which it was burdened in Hebrew are identical.</p> \n<p>Act Two: Who is a translator?</p> \n<p>The witness: Dr. Yonatan Mendel, a translator and researcher of Hebrew-Arabic translation. Cross examination: about five hours.</p> \n<p>In the cross examination, during which it seemed that the witness had become the accused, short films (unrelated to Dareen Tatour), were screened that showed scenes of rioting all over the West Bank. The soundtrack repeatedly voiced words such as “shahids,” “terror,” “blood,” “the sanctity of the land” and “the right of return,” until to Jewish ears it seemed as though these were quotes from the poems of Uri Zvi Greenberg we studied in class: “Blood will determine who will be the sole ruler”; “A land is conquered with blood. and only when conquered with blood is hallowed to the people with the holiness of the blood”; “A return to the village is a miraculous return, the felled tree returns to connect to its source”; “I hate the peace of those who surrender.”</p> \n<p>P: Do you consider yourself an objective witness?</p> \n<p>W: Yes.</p> \n<p>P: How good is your knowledge of Arabic?</p> \n<p>W: It’s excellent.</p> \n<p>P: When you’re listening, it’s hard for you to understand. Why?</p> \n<p>W: There’s a difference between simultaneous interpretation and translation of a written document.</p> \n<p>****</p> \n<p>P: In your opinion, is the Palestinian people a people living under occupation?</p> \n<p>W: The Palestinian people are a divided people, they don’t live in a free country.</p> \n<p>****</p> \n<p>P: Do you think that there’s a right to resist the occupation?</p> \n<p>W: I’m in favor of nonviolent resistance.</p> \n<p>****</p> \n<p>P: You claim Israelis automatically interpret “shahid” as related to terror.</p> \n<p>W: Correct.</p> \n<p>P: You say the Israeli-Jewish interpretation of the word is really distorted ... and every Palestinian who hears it understands it as “those who have fallen” and not as “shahids”?</p> \n<p>W: I would say more as “victims,” not as “aggressors.”</p> \n<p>P: Previously your wrote “those who have fallen” as opposed to “shahids,” and now you’re saying “victims” as opposed to “aggressors.”</p> \n<p>W: The word shahids — in Hebrew it’s fraught, the vast majority of the shuhadaa, or in Hebrew “shahids,” are civilians who didn’t go out to harm Israelis.</p> \n<p>P: In the police translation it sounds like a call for violence.</p> \n<p>****</p> \n<p>P: You translated “one who rises up,” whereas he translated “one who resists.”</p> \n<p>W: The root of the word in Arabic is kuf-yud-mem — and I’m looking for a similar root in Hebrew, “rose up.” “”Resisted” is not a mistake, but “rose up” is more appropriate.</p> \n<p>Maybe someone will also propose the “Translation Law,” since it’s impossible for a specific word to have several translations.</p> \n<p>And that’s how the discussion of a poem in Arabic is conducted in Hebrew, by people who don’t have a sufficient concept of Arabic. Equipped with a Robinson Crusoe mentality, they are certain that Friday will speak their language, and believe that every word in a language that they don’t understand has only one meaning in Hebrew. All the more so, when it comes to a familiar word like “shahid.”</p> \n<p>The long hours that the court spent surrounding the issue of the translation are a masquerade, trickery. Does anyone really think that such a discussion can be conducted in Hebrew? The translation came up because the prosecutor — like everyone else in the courtroom — doesn’t understand Arabic. Because if the discussion had been conducted in Arabic, an official language in Israel, the court wouldn’t have needed a translator. We would expect a prosecuting body with integrity, which time after tme repeated the presumption of objectivity, to bow its head and to set aside the case.</p> \n<p>But the prosecution also knew about a 2015 study that found that only 0.4 percent of Israeli Jews are capable of understanding a complex text in Arabic. For its own reasons, the prosecution did not set aside the case. On the contrary, its determination to assemble a cast for the theater of the absurd only increased.</p> \n<p>P: [The poem] is not referring only to the West Bank.</p> \n<p>W: Correct.</p> \n<p>P: And actually there’s also a reference here to within the Green Line.</p> \n<p>Like a shot in a concert hall, the Green Line is the issue. That’s the unfortunate boundary line that has long since been erased from the Jews’ maps, in an impressive colonialist process. Nobody talks about the Green Line any more except for our prosecutor, the anti-Semites at the United Nations and a handful of peace envoys who visit the region from time to time. The Jews no longer have a Green Line, Yesha (Judea and Samaria) is here, and this is the land of our forefathers, and the Jews cross the Green Line, but only the Jews. And so that the Palestinians — in other words those who are called Israeli Arabs - don’t cross the Green Line, it has to be etched into their awareness.</p> \n<p>If Dareen Tatour had lived in a village near Ramallah, I believe nobody would ask her if she’s a poet. They would jail her without charges for incitement. But within the Green Line, such measures are extreme, so it must be proved that she isn’t a poet. In the end, the prosecutor is doing what she’s supposed to do: to frighten, to deter, to censor poetry and to turn a poet into an enemy. All that remains is to call her an “inciter.” If we say it enough, it will succeed. And what about all those who weren’t suspected of incitement, despite their words. A senior MK (“Anyone who pulls out a knife or a screwdriver — you have to shoot him to kill”); a senior Likud member (“The Sudanese are a cancer in our body”) and a prime minister (“The Arab voters are going in droves to the polls”). The list goes on.</p> \n<p>Nobody in the courtroom could see that this was a theater of the absurd: That before us was a prosecutor arguing in Hebrew about the interpretation of Arabic words, whose meaning can be understood only within the Arabic poetic tradition. Whereas the debate was not about the poem, or about its quality, but about the quality of the translation into Hebrew.</p> \n<p>And still, within all this confusion, with the learned assistance of the prosecutor we learned several basic facts about the state of culture in Israel. What is a poem in Arabic: One that can be explained in Hebrew, because in the original language it has no existence. What is a translation: That which uproots the sapling from its soil and its cultural environment and plants it in foreign soil in order to create a Tower of Babel of words. Who is a translator? Some who is authorized by the government to find a for every word in Arabic only one interpretation in Hebrew. What is a prosecution: That which will do anything in its power to prevent Palestinian national poetry within the boundaries of the Green Line. And what is a poet? Someone who reveals the depths of her soul and the lies of the government. The prosecution’s question reveal what it is trying to conceal: That there are people who are groaning under oppression and loss of rights and are not eligible for privileges like the Jews.</p> \n<p>In a response statement, the State Prosecutor’s Office said that every judicial proceeding in Israel is conducted in Hebrew, including the one under discussion. “At the same time, the course of the discussion was translated for the accused into Arabic by a court-appointed interpreter, even though the accused is a Hebrew speaker.</p> \n<p>“As far as the content is concerned, as indicated by what is attributed to the accused in the indictment, this is a poem that was publicized as part of a video clip showing violent scenes from the intifada, and not as a separate text.</p> \n<p>“The translation of the text that accompanied the video was done by a veteran policeman whose mother tongue is Arabic. It’s a literal translation that didn’t presume to interpret the words.”</p> \n<p>With additional reporting by Revital Hovel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>My Saba, Yoseph Amit, made aliyah as a young man from Germany in the late 1930s. He was escaping the rise of fascism and anti-Semitism in Europe, and aspiring toward what he called then, in the Hashomer Hatzair Youth youth movement, Hagshama Atzmit, self-realization, in Zion.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;With his back against the wall, Abbas puts one-state solution on the table | Analysis</p> \n<p>Would my Saba, a devoted Socialist Zionist pioneer who left everything he knew to build kibbutzim and create a new life, be accepted by today’s institutions in Israel? Or would he be targeted by this Israeli government as an undesirable for his left-wing opinions?</p> \n<p>This week the Jewish Agency for Israel withdrew its funding for Achvat Amim, a Masa-funded program overseen by Hashomer Hatzair based on spurious allegations by a shadowy group called Ad Kan.</p> \n<p>Ad Kan is an arm of the most extreme elements of Israel’s settler movement. It has been called &quot;Israel’s volunteer thought police,&quot; a group that recruits Israelis to become citizen-spies, reporting on their fellow Israelis in a two-bit McCarthyist attempt to weed out anyone who doesn’t fit their vision of an Israel for Jews only.</p> \n<p>Armed with hidden cameras and microphones, Ad Kan members lie about their identities, join left-wing organizations and try to capture &quot;gotcha&quot; moments with members. Other times they scrutinize and “investigate” individual activists and then offer their deceptive material to Israel’s mainstream news.</p> \n<p>In this case, Ad Kan was incensed that Jews would participate in nonviolent activism alongside Palestinians in the West Bank. So they got to work identifying individual activists to name, shame and blame.</p> \n<p>This is the settler right’s tried and true tactic: guilt by association. Ad Kan and other extreme right-wing organizations like it understand that when the public conversation focuses on how policies like the occupation affect people’s lives, they lose. So instead, they create bogeymen and come up with convoluted chains of association among them to imply some nefarious cabal.</p> \n<p>Sound familiar? These are the same types of fantasies about power and treason that anti-Semites used for generations to target Jews. It’s eerily similar to the implication of the cartoon posted by Yair Netanyahu to Facebook – for which he has been embraced by neo-Nazis in America.</p> \n<p>Ad Kan and its settler right allies, like Im Tirtzu and the Samaria Settlers' Committee, have been reading from the same anti-Semitic playbook for some time. In 2009, Im Tirtzu created a campaign designed to topple the New Israel Fund using imagery of NIF’s then-president, Naomi Chazan, with a horn on her head.</p> \n<p>The attacks on NIF by Im Tirtzu and others did nothing to hamper our activities to promote democracy and equality for all Israelis. But this time, guilt-by-association tactics led the Jewish Agency to withdraw funding from a Hashomer Hatzair-affiliated volunteer program.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is a disappointing surrender to the settler right, and not just because of its underhanded and dishonest tactics. These decisions determine what kind of Zionism is acceptable in today’s Israel, and the answer is far narrower than ever before in Israel’s history. The incremental witch-hunting that attempts to mark and silence undesirable elements often starts in organizations like Ad Kan. But dropping the Hashomer Hatzair program is just the latest example of how these actions influence policy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There can be no mistake: the Jewish Agency canceled its support of Achvat Amim because of the leaders’ progressive political perspective – though plenty of right-wing programs receive Jewish Agency support.</p> \n<p>If these institutions insist on one narrow and far-right political perspective, they shouldn’t be surprised when their participant pool dries up. Young American Jews are overwhelmingly progressive. They are committed to an Israel in which Jews’ right to self-realization must not come at the expense of others’ same rights; they believe that we can and must always dream of a better future and work to create it.</p> \n<p>And rather than embrace them, Israeli institutions are closing their doors. Daniel Roth and Karen Isaacs, who founded Achvat Amim, are two aspirational Zionists who defy the trend of turning away from Israel. They made aliya directly out of their commitment to a better future in Israel and their contemporary&nbsp;Hagshama Atzmit. They should be seen as among the great examples of the success of the Zionist project.</p> \n<p>In fact, before cowing to Ad Kan’s smear campaign, Daniel and Karen’s now-defunded program was held up as an example by the Jewish Agency, which surely must know that American Jews will stop participating in its programs if it does not provide a place for progressives too.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they are told to shut up and sit down – and, underneath it, to get out.</p> \n<p>You can’t curate away the truth. American Jews are not blind, though these government-sponsored programs may try to keep the blinders on. American Jews can see the occupation; half of young American Jews believe settlements are hurting prospects for peace. No amount of censorship will stop this. Instead, these institutions are closing the doors to every authentic access point that young (and older) American Jews have to engage with Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I want to ask my Saba Yoseph what he dreamed of when he left his home to go to Palestine as a pioneer in the 1930s. We have never had this conversation, and my mother, also a Shomeret, never had it either. Saba Yoseph died in 1948 defending Israel in the War of Independence. My mother was born in the kibbutz that he helped found just a few months later. But knowing that he was raised in Hashomer Hatzair, I know that included in his ideology, as is included in mine, is the core concept of Achvat Amim: Solidarity Among Nations. I know it meant something different to him –&nbsp;given the changes in the world and in Israel – but Israel was built by Zionists with a variety of ideologies and his was a left-wing one.</p> \n<p>We cannot allow a small group of radical extremists to define what it means to be Zionist, or to be an acceptable part of Israeli society. If Israel’s institutions now turn their backs on Daniel and Karen, on their program and all their participants – past, present, and future – whose aspirational Zionism is based upon solidarity among nations, not racist and exclusionary ideologies, would those institutions also turn their backs on Saba Yoseph? And more importantly, will there be anything left of the Zionist dream that my children and grandchildren will be able to connect to?</p> \n<p>Libby Lenkinski is the Vice President for Public Engagement at New Israel Fund and the Board Chair for Hashomer Hatzair North America.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Only a few years ago no one knew anything about Samuel (Shmuel) Lederer. Even his name was undocumented. The farmer and public figure, one of the 13 Jews who lived in the remote Hungarian village of Magyarmecske, disappeared without a trace.</p> \n<p>Statistically, he was only a number, just one person out of the million anonymous Holocaust victims, whose names remained unknown some 70 years after the end of World War II.</p> \n<p>Recently, the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem completed a unique documentary project, giving Lederer his name back – along with his life story. Yad Vashem now knows not only that Lederer existed but also his birthdate (July 31, 1864), where he grew up (in the small village in southwestern Hungary’s Baranya district), his parents’ names (David Lederer and Fanni nee Honig), his younger brother’s name (Rudolph “Reszo” Lederer), his wife’s name (Gizella Fleischer) and how many children he had (two daughters).</p> \n<p>The people responsible for turning Lederer from a number into a name with a story and life are the team behind the Names Recovery Project, which has collected the names of Hungarian Jews murdered in the Shoah for Yad Vashem for the past decade. Dr. Haim Gertner, the director of Yad Vashem’s archives division, told Haaretz last week that the team’s work is revolutionary.</p> \n<p>The figures speak for themselves. When the project began in 2007, Yad Vashem’s Central Database of Shoah Victims’ Names&nbsp;held the names of 260,000, or around 43 percent, of some 600,000 Hungarian Jews murdered by the Nazis. The completed project added 225,000 names, such that over 80 percent of the Hungarian victims now have names.</p> \n<p>“So far, we had the schedules of the transports and we knew when every train left Hungary for Auschwitz, from exactly where and with how many people,” said Dr. Alexander Avram, the director of Yad Vashem’s Hall of Names. “But we did not know who were the people on the trains.”</p> \n<p>The documentation they have found has made it possible to retell the stories of entire families, from which no one remained alive, added Gertner.</p> \n<p>How was Yad Vashem able to complete the project? First, they needed to make major changes to their basic assumption that a single, unified and orderly list of all the Jews deported from Hungary exists. “For years we thought there was such a list. The moment we understood there was not, we stopped looking for it,” said Gertner.</p> \n<p>So instead of searching for the list, they began a no less difficult mission of compiling their own list by using a combination of meticulous archive searches and the most innovative technology available to process the information they discovered.</p> \n<p>Some 20 local researchers were recruited in Hungary, Rumania and Serbia – because parts of the other two countries belonged to Hungary during World War II. “They searched about 20 archives for a decade, and turned page after page looking for documents that detailed the fate of Hungary’s Jews in the Holocaust,” said Avram.</p> \n<p>Before starting their work, it was necessary to change Hungarian law to allow Yad Vashem unlimited access to the documents, some of which were personal. “In 2005, at the request of Yad Vashem, Hungary changed the law and allowed us to operate freely,” said Gertner.</p> \n<p>The work was divided into number of stages. The first stage was mapping and surveying all the potential sources across Hungary, from central government archives to those of small towns and Jewish communities. “The greatest challenge in this critical stage was to locate the relevant material because there is no special marking of materials related to the Holocaust or Jews in some of the archives,” said Avram.</p> \n<p>In the next stages, all the documents including the names of Jews preserved in all these archives were collected and copied. The names were hidden in correspondence and various records, for example the catalogue of Jews who were drafted into the work companies, the census conducted in Hungary, records of property confiscated from its Jewish owners and records of Jewish land owners.</p> \n<p>Some of the documents were official papers from the Hungarian interior, defense and agriculture ministries. Other documents were found in the archives of local, sometimes extinct, Jewish communities. “In certain cases, no one was left from the community but its archive survived in the house of one of the members’ neighbors,” said Avram.</p> \n<p>Yad Vashem amassed some 168,000 files containing 2.5 million pages and listing 694,000 names of Jews. Then then needed to find out which Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, who survived, and who were already listed in Yad Vashem’s database.</p> \n<p>The Yad Vashem team used innovative technology that allowed it to manage the large amounts of data gathered from different sources in different formats and of varying quality. The key term was “big data,” one of the hottest fields in high tech today. “Today, we know how to conduct smart and far-reaching searches with various partitioning and with an enormous amount of material, which in the past no one would have dreamed it was possible to do,” said Gertner.</p> \n<p>The 694,000 names were then entered directly into the Yad Vashem database, where the team processed the data, cross checking it and looking for duplicates, to identify the 225,000 new names.</p> \n<p>One of them was Shmuel Lederer. His information was hiding in two different documents, preserved in different archives. One was his “labor service” card in Hungary, issued by the Hungarian Defense Ministry. The other document was found in a collection of Agriculture Ministry files, which dealt with confiscating land from Jews.</p> \n<p>Studying the documents revealed not just Lederer’s name but also the story of his life – and death. It turns out that along with his brother, he inherited 77 dunams (19.25 acres) of land. He also was an active participant in public life in his village and county. He served as the government-appointed village magistrate and as a member of the regional council.</p> \n<p>In 1939, the second anti-Jewish law took effect in Hungary, which allowed the confiscation of the property of Jewish landowners. In 1941, the two Lederer brothers filed a complaint in the court in the nearby city of Pecs against the confiscation of their property. The complaint was of course rejected and the Agriculture Ministry issued the final decision on their property’s confiscation in October 1942.</p> \n<p>Shmuel Lederer and his wife Gizella were murdered in Auschwitz on May 28, 1944. They were but two of the 600,000 Hungarian Jews murdered by the Nazis, one-tenth of all the Jews killed in the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>Lederer’s name has now been added to the 4.7 million other names in Yad Vashem’s online database of Holocaust victims. The exact number of Jewish Holocaust victims is unknown. “There is a very large argument since the 1960s among scholars, demographers and historians,” said Avram. “The estimates vary from 5.1 million to 6.1 million. The majority opinion is close to 6 million.”</p> \n<p>“We are trying to reach 5 million [names]. Beyond that it is almost impossible,” said Avram when asked about his goals. The reason a complete reckoning cannot be achieved is related to the lack of documentation of many of the acts of murder.</p> \n<p>“Most of the names of those murdered in Central and Western Europe – like France, Italy, Germany, Holland and Belgium – are known because there was documentation for them; in other places the situation is different,” said Avram. “In the Soviet Union, Jews were murdered all over the place without any records. In most of the Polish ghettos, records were not preserved and the Jews were sent from there directly to extermination.”</p> \n<p>The project to gather the names of all Shoah victims started in 1954. For the first few decades it was conducted using “Pages of Testimony” filled out by survivors and the victims’ families, which listed the victims’ names and other details. Now the entire searchable database is available online, while new names can be added using online “Pages of Testimony.”</p> \n<p>New names are still being discovered through these pages, but Yad Vashem directs most of the resources in a different direction.</p> \n<p>“The Names Recovery Project is continuing and will remain with us until the last name, but our work methods have changed,” said Gertner. “Today we are aided by technology to use the existing databases in a smart way and to retrieve details that we could not in the past,” he adds. The case of Hungary demonstrates this. The “new” names discovered during the Hungarian project did not come from pages of testimony but were simply waiting for decades for someone to come and extract the names from the archives gathering dust in Hungary and neighboring countries.</p> \n<p>The project was carried out with the support of the French Foundation for the Memory of the Shoah. Yad Vashem is using the same model for other name gathering projects for Poland, where about 900,000 names of Jewish victims are still missing, the former Soviet Union and Balkan nations.</p> \n<p>“This is the most successful project we are running in the field of Holocaust documentation.

        "text":["<p>I am a left-wing purist. I can’t stand the thought that the Labor Party is headed by a man, Avi Gabbay, who says that he “doesn’t deal with the rights of the Palestinians.” (And who will deal with them? Avidgor Lieberman? Naftali Bennett? Maybe Marwan Barghouti, from prison?) </p> \n<p>Someone who asks, maybe out of embarrassing ignorance, maybe out of pretended ignorance: “If you make peace, why do you need to evacuate settlements?” Who brags like the worst right-wing thug: “They fire one missile? You fire 20. That’s the only way they understand in the Middle East.”</p> \n<p>Who bases the country’s existence on the divine promise to Abraham, who opposes evacuating “80,000 settlers,” as if this number will ever provide even a partially just solution. Who calls the Palestinians “Arabs” and says he has nothing in common with the Joint List Knesset faction.</p> \n<p>I am a left-wing purist, the kind that those who see themselves as leftists love to attack. They aren’t purists. They are so practical and sober, realistic and pragmatic. They don’t like purists. They think Avi Gabbay is a worthy candidate who shouldn’t be criticized, because the goal of every non-purist leftist is to rid ourselves of Benjamin Netanyahu – and after him, the d&eacute;luge. </p> \n<p>I am a purist who thinks that the plagiarized version of Netanyahu isn’t preferable to the original, that the silence of cowardly Labor Party MKs in the face of their leader’s remarks is shameful, and that it only proves why there’s no need for their accursed party or for cursing their new leader. At least Yair Lapid gets filmed in boxing matches, even if they’re ridiculous. </p> \n<p>I’m a left-wing purist who thinks you have to keep drawing people’s attention, over and over, until the end of time, to the elephant in the living room. Precisely because it’s so boring and annoying, so expected and unoriginal, so repetitious, just as the occupation is repetitious, annoying and expected. So-called leftists have tired a bit from dealing with it. They’re against it, but they know it’s not topical or attractive, not sexy, and, above all, not a vote-getter. The country is right-wing, so everyone tacks to the right. There are other things to deal with. The number of teachers’ assistants in kindergartens is more interesting. </p> \n<p>But nothing is less of a vote-getter than impersonation. The only reason the Labor Party isn’t in power is because of its vacillating, because it hasn’t presented an alternative, and because it doesn’t have a single figure like Jeremy Corbyn to restore it. On our left wing, there are endless leftist charlatans and cowards, with their left-wing advisers telling them if they would only look to the center and imitate the right, ignore the occupation and Palestinian rights, they would without a doubt get elected, Isaac Herzog after Shelly Yacimovich, election after election. But the elections always end in tears. </p> \n<p>It’s not a matter of purism. On the other hand, neither is it a matter of being left-wing. Sticking to one’s basic principles, the most basic that the left has, such as the idea that dealing with the occupation takes precedence over anything else, that it’s the most crucial, most decisive, most bothersome issue – that’s not purism. It’s essential realism, the height of political realism. </p> \n<p>It’s actually those who are repressing and denying the issue who are not seeing things correctly, misleading themselves and others. They think that if they don’t deal with the sore, it will heal itself. But it won’t. Ever. And they won’t get elected either. </p> \n<p>There’s the left wing and the right wing, and 50 shades of gray in between, which are also legitimate. What isn’t legitimate, however, is deceit. It doesn’t exist on the right. MK Bezalel Smotrich doesn’t deceive, and no one claims he is a right-wing purist. Even Netanyahu himself no longer engages in pretense. </p> \n<p>In the face of their proud nationalism, all the left can say is something to the contrary. Gabbay talks right and delegitimizes left-wing positions by concealing them. In the process, he is sticking to his party’s most trusty path. </p> \n<p>There is no left-winger who can remain silent over this, because if left-wing people remain silent, they’re saying Gabbay is right, we don’t need to deal with Palestinian rights, which also represent Israel’s moral image. Let’s transfer manufacturing to China, as Gabbay suggests. We’ll fire 20 missiles for every incoming rocket. We’ll build settlements that we’ll never evacuate and believe it’s our right because of the divine promise to Abraham. What’s important is for Gabbay to get elected, and all those purists can go explode. </p>",

        "text":["<p>Not a whole lot of Jews immigrating to Israel are named Mohammed. So when this particular groom-to-be began the tedious process of registering to get married, the local rabbi naturally had some questions.</p> \n<p>Mohammed? Jewish? Prove it.</p> \n<p>Against all odds, he did, and this week, Shlomo Babayev – the name he assumed not long after relocating from Azerbaijan to Israel 20 years ago – will stand under the chuppah with his betrothed Lorena at a wedding officiated by a state-sanctioned Orthodox rabbi.</p> \n<p>A year ago, when he got engaged, Babayev understood that his former name (which still appears on his Israeli ID card) and family background would raise a red flag for the Orthodox-run Chief Rabbinate, which controls all matters of marriage and divorce for Jews in Israel. Like any Jew seeking to marry in the country, he was asked to provide documentation that he was Jewish according to halakha, religious law. A Jew by halakha is someone born to a Jewish mother, and for most Israeli Jews, the ketubah, or Jewish marriage certificate, of their parents is sufficient evidence of this.</p> \n<p>Babayev, whose father is Muslim, could produce no such document since his parents never had a Jewish wedding back in Baku. Neither had his grandparents.</p> \n<p>The 25-year-old, who grew up in the southern town of Yeruham, heard about a group that might be able to help him obtain the proof he needed of his maternal Jewish roots. Established 10 years ago, Shorashim is a voluntary association that assists young Israelis, particularly immigrants, to locate documents they need to marry legally in the country and thereby avoid having to go through the arduous process of conversion. It operates as a branch within Tzohar, an organization of Orthodox rabbis who aim to make religious ritual more palatable to nonobservant Israelis.</p> \n<p>The prognosis he received was not very promising. As Babayev recounts, after his first meeting at Shorashim, he was given the following words of advice: “If you believe in miracles, then pray.”</p> \n<p>Mohammed becomes Shlomo</p> \n<p>Shorashim handles about 2,500 cases a year, most of them involving immigrants from the former Soviet Union and their children. Under the Law of Return, potential immigrants to Israel need a Jewish grandparent or a Jewish spouse, or have to have been converted to Judaism by a rabbi in an established Jewish community. An estimated 300,000 Russian-speakers who moved to Israel during the mass immigration of the 1990s, taking advantage of the Law of Return, are not halakhically Jewish, or at least can’t prove they are, and therefore are prohibited from marrying in the country.</p> \n<p>Babayev, who today lives in Tel Aviv, where he works installing fire-extinguishing systems, moved to Israel in 1997 with his parents, grandmother and mother’s brothers. It’s not clear what if any proof they provided at the time to prove their eligibility under the Law of Return.</p> \n<p>Two years after moving to Israel, Mohammed was officially renamed Shlomo at a ceremony in his neighborhood synagogue. He also changed his last name to his mother’s more Jewish-sounding maiden name.</p> \n<p>While growing up, Babayev attended religious school and observed Shabbat and the laws of kashrut, as he was taught to do. Up until his enlisted in the army, he says, he also always wore a kippa on his head.</p> \n<p>As far as he had been told, his mother was Jewish; both her mother and grandmother were Jewish. If he could prove this, he would be a halakhic Jew and be eligible to marry in Israel.</p> \n<p>The challenge was proving it with documentation. As a first step, Rabbi Avraham Flaks, the chief investigator at Shorashim, drove down to Yeruham, where he met with Babayev’s maternal grandmother.</p> \n<p>“They brought down a box of documents from the attic – birth certificates, marriage certificates, you name it,” Flaks recalls. “It was pretty remarkable that they had all these papers. The only problem was that not on any one of them did it say that their nationality was Jewish.”</p> \n<p>From Odessa to Baku</p> \n<p>Flaks decided to try his luck abroad. Shorashim operates a large network of fixers and sleuths in the former Soviet Union adept at accessing old records and archives in out-of-the-way places.</p> \n<p>“In 90 percent of the cases, we’re able to find the documents we need,” says Ori Schechter, executive director of the organization, “and in 100 percent of the cases, the Chief Rabbinate accepts the documents we provide as sufficient proof.”</p> \n<p>In a matter of months, a key document required to prove Babayev’s Jewish lineage was unearthed: his great-grandmother’s marriage certificate, dated 1931, which notes – “in black and white,” as Flaks puts it – that her nationality was Jewish. This great-grandmother had married an Azeri Muslim in her hometown of Odessa and moved with him to Baku. In Azerbaijan, Jews and Muslims enjoyed good relations, and intermarriage between the two groups was very common. So according to Flaks, it wasn’t surprising that both Babayev’s mother and maternal grandmother had also married Muslims.</p> \n<p>The Shorashim team now needed to produce evidence that the woman whose name appears in the 1931 marriage certificate was indeed the mother of Babayev’s grandmother, and that this grandmother was indeed the mother of his mother. All that evidence was found in the documents discovered in the family attic.</p> \n<p>During the Soviet era, Flaks explains, the children of mixed marriages in Azerbaijan – like Babayev’s mother and grandmother – could decide at age 16, upon receipt of their ID papers, whether they preferred to be listed as Jewish or Azeri. “Obviously, in a place where the Jews were a minority, many opted for Azeri nationality, and this explains why on Shlomo’s mother’s and grandmother’s papers there was no mention of the fact that they were Jewish,” he says.</p> \n<p>A thick dossier containing the entire paper trail was submitted to the local representative of the Chief Rabbinate a few weeks ago, and Babayev’s request to marry in Israel was approved on the spot.</p> \n<p>Looking back, Flaks says it was one of the most challenging cases he ever handled. “Back in the day, we used to curse the Soviets for forcing people to identify as Jews on their personal documents,” he says. “Today, it’s these documents that are providing the crucial evidence needed by people like Shlomo to get married in Israel.”</p> \n<p>He’s not the only one who stands to benefit from the dusty old marriage certificate discovered in an archive somewhere in the former Soviet Union that Flaks prefers not to name. “Now that we have established that the great-grandmother was Jewish, about 15 other members of Shlomi’s family here in Israel – his siblings and cousins – should be able to get married in Israel without any problem whatsoever.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – Sitting in a black office chair on the seventh floor of a luxurious Manhattan office building, the internationally renowned Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei takes a deep breath when asked whether there is a place he can call home. “This is a question I have been recently thinking about,” he tells Haaretz. “There is no place I can call home, since home is a place that can accept the totalness of you. It is the place where you feel most comfortable. I am still Chinese by nationality, but China has never been a location in which I can feel comfortable.”</p> \n<p>After being detained, prosecuted and closely watched by the Chinese government, Ai moved to Berlin, where he established an art studio in a 150-year-old underground beer cellar. He recently traveled to New York to promote his new ambitious documentary, “Human Flow,” a 145-minute chronicle of the global refugee crisis shot in more than 40 refugee camps in 23 countries. The film, which premiered in September at the Venice International Film Festival, will open this weekend in the United States and will be released online by Amazon this February.</p> \n<p>Over 200 crew members were involved in this grand-scale production, but to some extent the main protagonist of the film is the 60-year-old Chinese dissident himself. “Human Flow” opens with a beautifully shot sequence in which a seagull circles around what seems to be a small, yellow vessel. The striking contrast between the clear sky and the vast ocean mistakenly creates the impression that we are about to watch a maritime legend like Sinbad the Sailor. But as the camera zooms in, the small yellow dot is revealed to be a dangerously packed boat carrying refugees to Greece.</p> \n<p>The next scene replaces the tranquility of the drone footage with the shakiness and urgency of hand-held cameras: We see exhausted, confused refugees approaching the shores of the island of Lesbos. Amid the relief and hectic encounter with volunteers and activists, one of the refugees meets Ai, who hands him a cup of tea. The nameless man then tells the star of the contemporary art world, “you’re a good man.”</p> \n<p>This opening scene introduces the viewers to the two main subjects of “Human Flow”: the refugee crisis and Ai Weiwei. The film rapidly shifts between disheartening depictions of Syrian refugees heading to the Greek-Macedonian border, refugees from Nigeria and Sudan who somehow managed to reach southern Italy, and a group of Palestinian girls describing the Gaza Strip as “a huge prison.”</p> \n<p>The cinematic visits to each camp seldom lasts more than several minutes, during which nameless refugees tell stories of survival, agony and boredom as they wait for the border to open or for a European country to provide them with shelter. To ease the cumulative sense of helplessness and despair, the film uses short interviews with experts who provide some context, and includes poems and short literary citations (such as the poem “In Jerusalem” by Mahmoud Darwish).</p> \n<p>True to his reputation as a provocateur, a human rights activist and an artist famous – among many other things – for giving the finger to historical sites such as the Eiffel Tower and Tiananmen Square, Ai provides comic relief. He takes selfies with refugees, barbecues food in the middle of an improvised camp, gets a haircut, and displays his penchant for mischievous behavior.</p> \n<p>But when I meet him in the New York office of Magnolia Pictures, which distributes the film in the United States, he seems to be in a much more solemn mood.</p> \n<p>“Following my detention and legal issues in China, I was forced to leave the country,” he says in his typical tone, something between a murmur and a whisper. “Berlin, where I am currently based, accepted me with open arms. However, I do not speak German and do not have a German passport. My only passport is Chinese, and I didn’t have it for quite some time. So I don’t have a home country.”</p> \n<p>When asked whether he describes himself as a refugee, Ai hesitates. He then replies: “I never saw myself as a refugee but I have so many qualities or characteristics identified with this term, which means you have been forcefully relocated from your home country. I did not choose to leave China.”</p> \n<p>Obsessed with walls</p> \n<p>Ai already raised the question of freedom of movement during Documenta 12 in 2007, when he laboriously organized the travel of 1,001 Chinese citizens to Kassel, Germany, to take part in that art event. He says that as an artist, he has always been fascinated by the question of why people like to divide their territory and surround themselves with walls.</p> \n<p>“Is it because they think those they call ‘others’ are inherently dangerous and might pose a threat to their survival? Why did it become such a powerful and prevalent political practice in the past two decades?” he asks.</p> \n<p>“When the Berlin Wall fell in 1998, 11 countries around the world were cut off by border fences and walls. By 2016, some 70 countries had built border fences and walls. The U.S. is now trying to build a new wall with Mexico and for me this is unthinkable. This solution has never worked, but it testifies to the notion that we have become less courageous.”</p> \n<p>As Ai explains, he made “Human Flow” first and foremost to educate himself and others about the scale of the current crisis. In 2016, when the film was shot, 22 million people – over half of them children – were registered as refugees (in comparison, in 2005 global refugee numbers had hit a 26-year low of 8.4 million). “The moment I decided to make this film came when I was standing on the shore of Lesbos and saw the first boat approaching us, carrying between 80 to 100 people. I saw an old man crying and parents desperately holding their babies,” Ai recounts.</p> \n<p>“These people do not speak my language so we could not communicate directly. At that moment I felt I knew very little about this crisis, which involves the lives of millions of people forced to relocate and who fled their homes in recent years due to war, famine and persecution.”</p> \n<p>While poetic, moving and impressive in scope, “Human Flow” jarringly moves between short poems, hand-held footage and interviews. The film therefore runs the risk of decontextualizing the various atrocities and hardships it aims to highlight. Despite the frequent use of intertitles, it’s sometimes hard to figure out where we are at any given moment.</p> \n<p>“Whatever you do will create an illusion. If you follow one person’s journey you risk missing the bigger picture of a worldwide crisis. We deliberately decided to document refugees escaping environmental crisis and famine alongside those who escaped wars. These are all extremely complicated stories, but all of these refugees were victimized by different conditions and forced to give up their homes,” Ai says.</p> \n<p>“Yes, it is highly confusing, but our current world is confusing and multilayered. We interviewed dozens of internationally renowned experts and even they could not offer a clear-cut explanation to many of these issues. The roots of the current crisis could be traced back, in some cases, to two or three generations ago. We wanted to document the reality of displacement, as confusing as it may be.”</p> \n<p>When asked why he chose to provide the names of the experts while most of the refugees he interviewed are nameless, Ai explains that “for the experts we needed credibility. Those people have some kind of knowledge and we need to know where it is coming from. The refugees tell personal stories and many of them did not want to include their names in the film since this exposure might endanger relatives who were left behind.”</p> \n<p>A personal journey</p> \n<p>The decision to include himself in the film should not surprise anyone who has been following Ai’s rise to fame. He is an avid social media user who posts selfies on Instagram and Twitter on a daily or weekly basis. Yet he does not fear that his stardom might draw attention from the very complex issues explored in “Human Flow.”</p> \n<p>“I think this is a very personal film documenting my personal journey,” he explains when asked about the decision to step in front of the camera. “It is not a scientific film made for the History Channel. It is about an artist and his approach to this crisis. We also wanted to pull people back into the film. And this is why we included a scene in which I get a haircut, or another scene where I make kebab.</p> \n<p>“We didn’t want the viewers to think, ‘this is something that has nothing to do with me since it happens far away.’ I think it was very important to include some jokes and humor to reflect the way I am being viewed by others. It is the kind of structure I like to highlight in my work.”</p> \n<p>Alongside Iraq, Bangladesh and Greece, Israel is also briefly featured in “Human Flow” – and not in a very flattering light. In a segment dedicated to the Gaza Strip, the camera documents the journey of a rare tiger as he is transported from Gaza to his new home in South Africa. An intertitle reminds the viewers that “4.7 Million Palestinian refugees live in the Gaza Strip.” Next, B’Tselem’s Hagai El-Ad tells the camera, “Gaza is an hour drive from Tel Aviv, but as far as Israelis are concerned it could have been located on Mars.”</p> \n<p>When asked why he chose to present his art in Israel while criticizing Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians in his new film, Ai replies that “I included the Gaza Strip [in the film] since it is a location in which people cannot move; they are being ‘pushed-in’ rather than ‘pushed out’ like other refugees. It is inhuman.”</p> \n<p>Ai criticizes Israel’s treatment of refugees, though he is not part of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel. While he recently canceled his exhibition in Denmark to protest its treatment of refugees, Ai decided to show his work in the Israel Museum for the 2017 exhibition “Maybe, Maybe Not.”</p> \n<p>“My decision to collaborate with the Israel Museum in Jerusalem was an attempt to make this reality more manifest,” he says. “I believe that the people and their government are not one and the same. I have a deep respect for Israelis. The work I chose to present in Jerusalem is deeply political: We showed a film about a tiger stuck in Gaza, for example.</p> \n<p>“As for Denmark, I was in Lesbos and drove to the shore to film, and I heard on the radio that the Danish authorities decided to confiscate the belongings of asylum seekers. I was so angry at that moment I decided to protest by canceling my exhibition, ‘Ruptures,’ at Denmark’s Faurschou Foundation Copenhagen. It is always difficult for an artist to make these decisions because sometimes they create contradictions. I personally know many artists who refuse to show their work in Israel,” he adds.</p> \n<p>“However, I believe in involvement. Almost every art piece that I’ve made was shown in places where human rights violations take place, whether it is China or other places. Only by being directly involved in these situations can one inflict a change of minds.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Sukkot is almost upon us, and as a people, we are reminded to give thanks for the harvest we receive. Sadly, however, this season may not be as thankful for many Jews.The internet is replete with posts from exasperated Yidden who simply can’t afford what has become a luxury. Although it is understandable that kosher food necessitates additional, costly supervision, and kosher businesses – like all businesses – seek to maximize process, the exorbitant price of kosher products has reached an inexcusable extreme.The cost of food is on the rise all over the world, and kosher food is no exception. Many Jews simply cannot afford a kosher celebration of the Feast of the Tabernacles.Controversies about kosher facilities, coupled with an overall economic downturn, have made keeping Jewish dietary laws a growing challenge, and action must be taken to enable Jews to keep kosher without breaking the bank.In most U.S. grocery stores, the kosher section is small, providing basic staples and traditional foods needed for Jewish holidays. But these items are often too pricey for many Diaspora Jews, who , like many other Americans, are struggling during these difficult economic times.The cost of food is rising at an alarming rate worldwide. Wholesale food prices have jumped by approximately 3.9%, and kosher food is even pricier; by Passover 2010, kosher meat cost some 20 percent more than non-kosher meat, according to Slate.The cost of maintaining a kosher facility is significant, and obtaining the Orthodox Union’s kosher certification is expensive as well, further inflating the price.Is there justification for soaring kosher food prices? How is it ethical to charge so much for kosher products, that many Jewish families simply cannot afford to keep the dietary laws?This above-and-beyond competitive pricing is a cheap way to gouge Jews committed to upholding Jewish traditions, while depriving many from doing so. It often seems like the price isn’t worth the product, and oftentimes, the quality is poorer than the less costly non-kosher equivalent.Why buy kosher if it is both more expensive and inferior?There may be hope yet for hard-on-their luck Jews who want to keep kosher. Hazon, a leading Jewish food organization, sponsors Community Supported Agriculture (CSAs) in the U.S., Canada, and Israel. These programs provide access to healthy, local produce, connecting recipients with their Jewish community. Jewish food banks provide sustenance for hungry families.Although these programs are a great start, more initiatives are needed to keep the kosher food movement alive. Community food banks that provide kosher products, kosher food stamps, or discount savings programs would make buying kosher food easier and more viable option for people who don’t have the means to purchase kosher foods at retail price.In addition to making kosher food more affordable, facilities must be made more sustainable, environmentally sound, and labor-friendly to ensure the quality of its products and its practices. Online programs can be used to promote healthy and budget-friendly kosher food.Sukkot is meant to be a celebration of bountiful harvest and health, and there is no reason for Jews to go without kosher food on this joyous holiday. We must take action to sustain not only ethical business practices and fair pricing, but our cultural heritage as well.</p> \n<p>Yael Miller is a graduate student at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.</p> \n<p>More articles that might interest you: What is Kosher and Jewish food?</p>",

The darling of the Tea Party is not shy about recalling her time on kibbutz in the Negev in the 1970s; she reminisced at an AIPAC meeting that, “I really learned a lot in Israel.” She also told the gathering, &quot;I am a Christian, but I consider my heritage Jewish, because it is the foundation, the roots of my faith as a Christian.&quot;</p> \n<p>This week she popped up at Agudah Yisrael in Manhattan, for a chinwag with local Jewish leaders, where she again reportedly trotted out her tales of youthful kibbutz experiences.</p> \n<p>In the race to the White House, almost everything has come to be considered fair game, and Bachmann is certainly a savvy enough political animal not to turn her nose up at an offer on a silver salver. Although she might want to brush up on her Yiddish.</p> \n<p></p>",

        "text":["<p>Until not long ago, Jewish Agency Chairman Natan Sharansky was the go-to guy for anyone seeking assurance that Israel did, indeed, value its relationship with&nbsp;American Jews.</p> \n<p>Every time it seemed the &quot;Western Wall deal” – that promise to provide Reform and Conservative Jews with an egalitarian place of their own for prayer at the Jewish holy site – was off, Sharansky could be counted on to argue otherwise. I know Prime Minister Benjamin well, he would tell the skeptics, and no other Israeli leader understands, as he does, the strategic importance of the American Jewish community for Israel.</p> \n<p>The former Soviet dissident is singing a different tune nowadays. That became profoundly evident during a special Knesset session held last week on the&nbsp;Western Wall controversy, attended by a delegation of world Jewish leaders.</p> \n<p>Noting that the Israeli government had shown no inclination whatsoever to mend the growing rift with American Jewry since the deal was officially suspended more than four months ago, Sharansky warned the participants: “It is inevitable that the crisis will continue.”</p> \n<p>Coming from the last of the true believers, his words reverberated loudly.</p> \n<p>In a sense, Sharansky was echoing what many observers of&nbsp;Israel-Diaspora relations&nbsp;have been saying, both out loud and behind closed doors, in recent months: that Israel has concluded it no longer needs American Jews. Or at least two-thirds of them, as Dan Shapiro, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, pointed out recently, referring to the majority who vote Democrat, hold progressive views and tend to identify as&nbsp;Reform&nbsp;or&nbsp;Conservative Jews.</p> \n<p>As Shapiro warned at a recent conference sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League: “There is an idea that has some currency in certain circles around the Israeli government that says, ‘You know what, we can write off that segment of American Jewry because in a couple of generations their children or grandchildren will assimilate. So let’s focus on the Orthodox who are an important constituency but smaller. Let’s focus on&nbsp;Evangelicals, and we can sustain our support from the American public by focusing on those populations and writing off and being dismissive of Jewish progressives.’”</p> \n<p>The evidence supporting this theory has been piling up, the most obvious example being the Israeli government’s&nbsp;suspension of the Western Wall deal. Following three-and-a-half years of negotiations, in&nbsp;January 2016&nbsp;the government approved the plan to expand and upgrade the temporary egalitarian prayer platform located at the southern side of the Western Wall.</p> \n<p>The plan stipulated that the new and improved space would be visible to all visitors entering the holy site, and would share an entryway with the existing, gender-segregated prayer platforms on the northern side of the Western Wall. It also envisioned the creation of a new public authority that would administer the egalitarian prayer area, which would include representatives of the Conservative and Reform movements.</p> \n<p>When the plan was approved, it was hailed as “historic” – the first time the Israeli government had ever provided official recognition to the non-Orthodox movements at the Western Wall. For close to a year and a half, though, the government refrained from implementing the plan, and in late June, under pressure from his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed through a vote to have it officially “frozen.”</p> \n<p>As if that weren’t a big enough affront, the Israeli government voted on the very same day to advance legislation that would&nbsp;deny recognition of any conversions performed in Israel outside the state-sanctioned Orthodox system. In other words, Jews of choice converted by Conservative and Reform rabbis – and in some cases, even by Orthodox-ordained ones – would not be eligible for Israeli citizenship. This decision clearly did not take into consideration the fact that the overwhelming majority of affiliated Jews in the United States belong to the Reform and Conservative movements.</p> \n<p>Diaspora Jews – particularly those in America – received another jolt just a few weeks later, when news broke that Israel maintains a&nbsp;blacklist of overseas rabbis. The list, compiled by the Chief Rabbinate, contained the names of 160 rabbis, most of them American, whose letters certifying the Jewishness of candidates for marriage in Israel have been rejected.</p> \n<p>Topping all this off are the constant insults and barbs being hurled at Reform and Conservative Jews by well-known Orthodox rabbis in Israel, not to mention members of Netanyahu’s own Likud party. More often than not, the prime minister has let them get away with this name-calling.</p> \n<p>Just as he isn’t standing up for America Jews in Israel, he isn’t standing up for them on their own turf either. Numerous incidents of anti-Semitism in the United States over the past year have left the American Jewish community feeling increasingly vulnerable. But they have drawn few, if any, responses from the Israeli prime minister.</p> \n<p>Evangelicals ascendant</p> \n<p>If Israel is, indeed, experiencing a change of heart about American Jews, the signs were already evident a few years back. Many observers trace the shift to&nbsp;March 2015&nbsp;when Netanyahu delivered his famous speech before the U.S. Congress against the&nbsp;Iranian nuclear deal, which was about to be finalized. Considering that 70 percent of American Jews had voted for Barack Obama, Netanyahu’s efforts to lead a revolt against him were seen by many in the Jewish community as unconscionable.</p> \n<p>The election of&nbsp;Donald Trump, with whom Netanyahu is on much better terms, has naturally emboldened those who believe Israel owes nothing to American Jews and can make do without them.</p> \n<p>With Netanyahu enjoying a direct line to the White House these days, there is much less dependency on the Jewish lobby in America. That is especially true considering the unconditional support he enjoys from Christian Evangelicals, a key base for the Trump administration. Indeed, on controversial issues like settlement expansion, Israel’s right-wing government gets much more support from Christian Evangelicals than it does from the largely progressive Jewish community in America.</p> \n<p>Michael Oren, the former Israeli ambassador to the United States and now a Knesset member from the center-right Kulanu party, believes it would be a strategic mistake for Israel to write off American Jews. Yet at the same time, if growing numbers of Israelis view American Jews as a “lost cause,” he says, American Jews are also partly to blame.</p> \n<p>“We went to American Jews and told them that the Iran deal endangers 6 million Jews in Israel, and that it’s not an American political issue, but rather, a matter of Jewish existence,” he recounts, “and I don’t need to tell you what happened.”</p> \n<p>Nachman Shai, a member of the opposition Zionist Union, also considers the Iran nuclear deal a key turning point, but for different reasons than Oren. “For Bibi (Netanyahu) to come out like that against a Democratic president who enjoyed such huge support among American Jews was like a smack on the head for them,” he says.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu will never declare out loud that he has written off American Jews, according to Shai, but his behavior seems to indicate otherwise. “Whether it’s the Iran deal or his lack of response to anti-Semitism in the United States, it’s clear that his top priority these days is to get Trump to reevaluate the Iran deal, so he doesn’t want to antagonize anyone in the administration,” says the lawmaker. “Everything Bibi does is motivated by what he believes to be in Israel’s best interests, which is not necessarily the best interests of the Jewish people.”</p> \n<p>Leaders of the non-Orthodox movements agree that the signs are all there.</p> \n<p>“What I can say is that the actions the government has been taking suggest very loudly and clearly to Jews in North America that we don’t matter and that we can be disrespected and delegitimized without serious consequence to strategic issues, whether it be security or some of the other many challenges Israel faces, and I think that’s incontrovertible,” says Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism.</p> \n<p>“Non-Orthodox Jews see this prime minister and his current decisions as either not finding our cause compelling or making a calculation that says, ‘You know what, we have enough support from other areas. It won’t be a disaster if we lose the overwhelming majority of American Jews.’”</p> \n<p>Rabbi Steven Wernick, CEO of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, blames basic ignorance in Israel about Jewish life in America.</p> \n<p>“Sure, we’re facing huge challenges like assimilation, acculturation and intermarriage,” he notes, “but at the same time, you’ve got 6 million Jews here, 94 percent of whom are proud to be Jewish and 4 million of whom are affiliated with a religious institution. To think that two-thirds of American Jews are going to disappear in the next 10 years is ridiculous. But astonishingly, many Israeli leaders seem to believe that to be the case and that somehow or other Israel’s strategic concerns can be carried by a very small Orthodox population, along with Evangelicals.”</p> \n<p>'Untenable situation'</p> \n<p>The Ruderman Family Foundation has taken up the challenge in recent years of educating Israelis about the Jewish American community, often through delegation visits to the United States. That is why founder Jay Ruderman finds recent actions of the Israeli government especially frustrating.</p> \n<p>“The current Israeli administration seems to be in the completely untenable situation of choosing between continuing to build strong ties to the American Jewish community or ensuring its political survival,” he notes, “and survival seems to be winning.”</p> \n<p>The best proof, Ruderman continues, is its about-face on the Western Wall deal. “This backtracking may ensure the Israeli government’s political survival but threatens the vital relationship Israel has with American Jews,” he warns.</p> \n<p>In July 2010, when Israel was considering yet another controversial conversion law, a group of Jewish American senators drafted a protest letter, warning that if passed, the legislation would harm the bilateral strategic relationship between the United States and Israel. “And guess what? The bill suddenly disappeared,” recalls Oren. “Compare that to what happened a couple of months ago when a group of Jewish senators sent a letter protesting the suspension of the Western Wall deal and the latest conversion law. It hardly made the news. And that, to me, is the entire story in a nutshell.”</p> \n<p>Not all Orthodox Jews in America are happy with what’s going on either. At a recent Knesset session that addressed the growing rift between Israel and American Jewry, Jerry Silverman, president of the Jewish Federations of North America and an Orthodox Jew himself, gave voice to their concerns about the Western Wall deal. “What many Orthodox rabbis have said to me is, ‘Listen, we may not have been in agreement about the solution, but once there’s an agreement, and once it’s signed off, it should be implemented,’” he said.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Ari Berman, the recently appointed president of Yeshiva University and a prominent figure in the Modern Orthodox world, stopped short of criticizing the Israeli government but suggested it could benefit by investing more in its relations with American Jewry.</p> \n<p>“It is critical for Israel to consider the fate and fortunes of all Jews, whether in Israel or the Diaspora, no matter their ideological proclivities,” he wrote in an email. “At the most basic level, this is a matter of utility. Jews both in Israel and the Diaspora need each other’s support. But in a more profound sense, the very nature of the State of Israel is that it aspires to serve as a home for all Jews and as such must factor in the concerns of the broader Jewish populace in its decision-making.”</p> \n<p>Avinoam Bar-Yosef, president of the Jerusalem-based Jewish People Policy Institute, is still willing to give Netanyahu the benefit of the doubt. To be sure, he says, there are factions in the government, specifically the&nbsp;ultra-Orthodox, who would be delighted to issue a metaphorical writ of divorce to large segments of American Jewry. “But I really don’t think this is the position of the prime minister,” he insists. “If anything, my impression is that he is much more interested than any of his predecessors in Diaspora Jews.”</p> \n<p>Jacobs, of the Reform movement, takes little comfort from these words and warns Israelis leaders not to downplay the crisis with American Jewry.</p> \n<p>“They keep saying there’s not a deep division. To the contrary – it’s very real,” he argues. “We hear it nonstop. It’s real, it’s deep and it needs to be addressed, and the next move has to come from the government of Israel. There need to be concrete deeds that show that we matter.”</p> \n<p>“Short of that,” he warns, “this division will grow stronger. “</p>",

        "text":["<p>“After the holidays” can summarize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s response to the protests by the disabled, which has been going on for two months now. “The prime minister said he will formulate, together with Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, additional measures of relief that will be presented for discussion and legislation right after the holidays,” according to a statement issued Sunday in Netanyahu’s name. The prime minister did not say what additional measures of relief he is planning.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s promise is a weak response to the protest, which has engendered empathy but has not been able to break down the public wall of indifference. The disabled are protesting the government’s refusal to raise their monthly benefit payment, now 2,342 shekels ($655), to the minimum wage (5,000 shekels a month) and link it to the minimum wage’s future increases. “We are not the Israel &nbsp;Electric Corporation that has a switch, or the Histadrut labor federation, and so our struggle is on the roads,” said Naomi Moravia, chairwoman of the protest campaign.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the determined campaign of the disabled has managed to produce only committees and recommendations. Netanyahu, as usual, appoints committee after committee, which only rejects or “updates” the conclusions of its predecessor, and mainly buys him more time. That’s what he did when he tasked Avi Simhon, chairman of the National Economic Council, with re-examining benefits to the disabled, a few months after a committee headed by Prof. Yaron Zelekha – who was appointed by Kahlon – published its recommendations, which Kahlon accepted.</p> \n<p>The Zelekha Committee recommended raising disability benefits to 4,000 shekels a month. In contrast, the Simhon plan, whose principles Netanyahu cited on Sunday, also recommended raising disability benefits, but differentially: Only the most severely disabled (90 percent at least) would receive 4,000 shekels a month. The others would receive benefits based on the percentage of their disability.</p> \n<p>The Netanyahu government presents itself as nationalistic and socially-minded. There are ministers serving in it who define themselves as socially-minded leaders, fighting for the rights of the “invisible” and strengthening the outlying areas at the expense of the “elites.” On more than one occasion the government has justified its policy based on the idea that “your own needy come first.” Now, when the government is required to translate its declared concern for the poor into a redistribution of the budget, it evades the task.</p> \n<p>Even a major addition is not enough to meet the demands of the disabled. For that, a government is needed that will change priorities from the ground up. The current government, instead of letting all disabled people live a dignified life, without having to block highways to be heard, prefers to transfer huge budgets to the settlements and inflate the defense budget. The disabled, who will have to wait until “after the holidays,” are the direct victims of this folly.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz's lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

The table decorations consisted of burned-down British flags and a large British-themed cake.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Britain downgrades the Balfour Declaration centennial&nbsp;| Analysis &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>The party kicked off with a drawing competition in which the children were asked to draw a painting by Banksy of a dove holding a burned-down olive branch.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A group of 70 British citizens attended the party after having marched from London to Bethlehem in a call on the British government to fulfill the second part of the Balfour Declaration – the promise to ensure the rights of non-Jewish minorities within the Jewish State.</p> \n<p>The declaration, which was issued on November 2, 1917 and paved the way for a United Nations resolution 30 years later to establish a Jewish state, announced support for a &quot;national home for the Jewish people&quot; while safeguarding &quot;the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Hotel Occupation: Banksy takes on Israel's West Bank barrier with hotel with 'worst view in the world' &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>Banksy’s message, which was read to the audience of locals, tourists and the children was centered around the ongoing impact of the declaration on the lives of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. The speech touched upon the fact that the declaration consisted of a mere 67 words and urged the children to do their homework so they, too, will be able to one day influence history in a similar manner.</p> \n<p>“The conflict has brought so much suffering to people on all sides, it didn’t feel appropriate to ‘celebrate’ the British role in it,” Banksy said in a statement that was handed out to reporters attending the event.</p> \n<p>The party peaked when a person dressed as Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II unveiled Banksy’s latest work of art on the separation barrier: gold letters reading “Er sorry,” a reference to requests made to the British government to apologize for the declaration.</p> \n<p>As well as being an apologetic expression, Er is a wordplay on the initials E.R., which stands for Elizabeth Regina, Latin for Queen Elizabeth. The initials E.R. appear under the British royal crest.</p> \n<p>The event drew to a close after a group of local activists burst into the party and stuck a Palestinian flag on the British-themed cake, while chanting “free Palestine.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Banksy is a long-time critic of the Israeli occupation and has in the past drawn works on the separation barrier in Bethlehem. After the 2014 Gaza war, the artist snuck into the Strip to make a &quot;tourist video&quot; showing squalid conditions there. A year later, Banksy's so-called bemusement park project, Dismaland, featured the works of Israeli and Palestinian artists side by side.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The artist's latest West Bank project is the Walled Off Hotel, a project described as hotel, protest and art in one, which, according to Banksy, has &quot;the worst view in the world.&quot; The facility, which consists of nine rooms and one suite, is meant to bring tourists and jobs to Bethlehem and foster dialogue between young Israelis who would stay there and the Palestinian residents of the city.</p>",

Borussia Dortmund is known to have a number of neo-Nazis in their hardcore fan base, which critics quote as further evidence that they were behind the stickers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Last week, hard-core fans of Lazio, a team in Italy’s capital Rome, plastered stickers of Anne Frank wearing the jersey of Lazio's rival club, Roma, in their shared stadium. Soccer fans in Germany now seem to have picked up the sick stickers from the Lazio supporters, adapting it to local rivalries in Germany.</p> \n<p>In Italy, the Anne Frank stickers sparked a strong reaction by the Italian federation of soccer, even though anti-Semitism is a long-standing problem among local “ultras”, or hard-core supporters. Passages of Anne Frank’s Diary were read before the games last week, and Lazio President Claudio Lotito promised to bring 200 fans a year on an educational trip to Auschwitz. His commitment to mending ties with the Jewish community were later questioned as a recording of him dismissing his visit to the synagogue as a “charade” surfaced on Wednesday. A number of members of the Jewish community of Rome told Haaretz at the time they were not satisfied with his efforts, nor did they expect the problem of anti-Semitism to get better after the wave of outrage for the Anne Frank stickers.</p> \n<p>While German police are still investigating the case of the Anne Frank stickers in Dusseldorf, Italian authorities have already banned 13 Lazio fans from the stadium. Lazio President Lotito is also facing a potential penalty for having been complicit with racist behavior on the part of his fans. At the beginning of the month, the Italian Football Federation decided to close down the northern terrace of the stadium in Rome, where Lazio’s hard-core supporters normally sit, because they booed black players from the Sassuolo club. Instead of letting them stay at home for Lazio's match against Cagliari, Lotito decided to open up the southern stands of the stadium, gifting the fans with tickets for 1 euro.&nbsp;</p>",

Yet despite this, Roger Waters infuriates a lot of people.</p> \n<p>The decision by the former Pink Floyd singer-bassist to become a political personality and exploit his fame and status to fight Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians drives ardent Zionists crazy – they see him as an enemy of Israel who is damaging the Jewish state’s reputation.</p> \n<p>Now, a Jewish-Canadian filmmaker has decided to take off the gloves and go head-to-head with the venerable musician, stating unequivocally that Roger Waters is an anti-Semite.</p> \n<p>Investigative journalist and documentary filmmaker Ian Halperin, 53, calls his new film “Wish You Weren’t Here,” riffing on one of Pink Floyd’s biggest hits while launching an unapologetic, all-out assault on a member of one of the most respected rock bands ever.</p> \n<p>In the documentary – which just toured select Canadian cinemas – Halperin conducts a long series of interviews with subjects who each explain why Waters isn’t a performing artist touring the world with a legitimate political agenda, but instead is an anti-Semite who uses the stage to spread hatred and lies about Israel, and about Jews in general.</p> \n<p>The documentary also tries to sketch a contemporary portrait of global anti-Semitism, which is raising its head in various countries, marking Waters as the undisputed leader spearheading this focused assault.</p> \n<p>One of the talking heads, David Renzer, says Waters must be taken seriously because he remains one of the most important performing artists in the world, and comes from a legendary band that still gives him an abundance of credibility.</p> \n<p>Renzer is the former head of Universal Music Publishing Group (the second largest music company in the world) and one of the founders of Creative Community for Peace, a group established by members of the U.S. entertainment industry to combat the cultural boycott of Israel.</p> \n<p>Renzer says he can’t judge Waters’ personal motives, but can relate to things he’s said and actions he’s taken. The music exec accuses Waters of saying “some extreme things,” like how Israel treats the Palestinians worse than the way the Nazis treated the Jews. Renzer adds that someone with such an extreme viewpoint is not a “credible person.”</p> \n<p>In recent years, Waters has become one of the art world’s central figures in the fight to persuade other artists to join the cultural boycott of Israel. Indeed, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement obtained Waters’ permission to use his name on letters they send out to various artists, according to Halperin.</p> \n<p>When the director asks former British Prime Minister Tony Blair whether the comparison Waters makes between Israel and Nazi Germany is an anti-Semitic act, Blair answers in the affirmative. Blair says the criticism Waters directs at Israel is so ridiculous, it reaches the point where it expresses a basic hostility to the idea of a homeland for the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>Halperin first rose to prominence in December 2008, when he was one of the first to claim Michael Jackson was suffering from a serious medical condition. He predicted that Jackson had only six months to live, and the singer indeed died in June 2009. Halperin’s biography, “Unmasked: The Final Years of Michael Jackson,” topped the New York Times bestseller list.</p> \n<p>Halperin also wrote “Hollywood Undercover,” in which he pretended to be a gay actor and also infiltrated the Church of Scientology (becoming one of the first journalists to do so). He also wrote two books examining the death of Kurt Cobain, exploring the theory that the Nirvana front man was murdered rather than committed suicide, as well as books about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Celine Dion and others.</p> \n<p>In recent years, he’s turned his eye toward making documentaries. In a phone interview with Haaretz, Halperin explains that the impetus for his film came after he heard Waters comparing Israel to the apartheid regime in South Africa.</p> \n<p>“When I first heard that Waters was singling out Israel and calling for boycotts,” Halperin says, “I was appalled – because I knew that Israel was by far the most democratic country in the Middle East; that it respects women’s rights, gay rights; there’s over 2 million Israeli Arabs and they all have votes, some sit in the Knesset.</p> \n<p>“I was just wondering why he is comparing the two countries when South Africa was a two-class system and Israel is not. Sure, the policies of Israel you can criticize, but to call for a boycott against the most democratic country in the Middle East to me is misleading – and he has to be held accountable for it.”</p> \n<p>Halperin admits he’s no expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but says he is an expert “about being the son of a Holocaust survivor. And my father hid in a hole in the ground for seven years [in Poland] when he was 6 years old. To have somebody like Roger Waters compare Israel to Nazi Germany was the biggest insult to the memory of 6 million innocent Jewish people who died. It really shows to me that he’s an anti-Semite and that he has an agenda not only against Israel, but against the Jewish people.”</p> \n<p>Propaganda techniques</p> \n<p>Halperin wouldn’t let Haaretz view the entire film and instead sent a video link showing the first 32 minutes; he claims this was an instruction from the producers (the complete documentary is 96-minutes). He also plans to screen the documentary in Israel and is set to visit these shores next month for a private screening. No date has been set for a public Israeli screening.</p> \n<p>The opening scene in “Wish You Weren’t Here” makes for uncomfortable viewing, being reminiscent of propaganda techniques that don’t shy away from using any means necessary to frighten viewers.</p> \n<p>“Global harassment of Jews has reached a seven-year high,” say captions that appear on the screen in blazing red, bloodlike colors, sprayed onto the screen, flashing the words “Paris,” “Hollywood,” “Iran” and “BDS” in rapid succession. It’s hard not to imagine that a certain prime minister who would have been only too happy to screen this during his speech at the UN General Assembly.</p> \n<p>This intro is followed by an array of news reports about anti-Semitic attacks worldwide, as captions present the numbers of anti-Semitic attacks in different countries in 2016: 1,309 in the United Kingdom; 1,266 incidents in the United States; 644 in Germany and 294 in France.</p> \n<p>“What is it about Roger? Why is he so bugged about Israel?” wonders the narrator. Then in a speech at an UN conference, the veteran rock star is seen talking about violations of international law that Israel is committing and how it prevents Palestinians from obtaining their rights. He calls for an end to the Israeli occupation in the territories and for granting the Palestinians the right to self-determination.</p> \n<p>Waters is clearly investing great efforts to promote a cultural boycott of Israel – but without much success, according to this documentary. As proof, we are offered a long list of artists who performed in Israel over the summer months, including Aerosmith, Justin Bieber, Tears for Fears and Guns N’ Roses. And in order to present arguments for and against the boycott, Halperin’s film dwells on this summer’s highly publicized spat between Radiohead’s Thom Yorke and Waters, who tried to dissuade the singer and his band from performing in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Flying pigs with Stars of David</p> \n<p>Halperin says that when he started researching Waters, “I found out that he had pigs floating around at his concert with the Star of David emblazoned upon them. If he’d been doing that at his concerts with a Muslim crescent, he wouldn’t get out of the arena alive.</p> \n<p>“But for some reason, this guy’s able to get away with it when it comes to the Jewish people. I’ll be honest, all kidding aside, I’m not a proctologist but I know an asshole and jerk when I see one – and Roger Waters is that.</p> \n<p>“He’s making a huge mistake, [and] he owes Israel and the Jewish people a huge apology. Because what he’s doing is bringing hatred and negative stereotypes of Israel and the Jewish people to masses. He’s the highest-grossing solo artist of all time on this tour – more than Madonna, Bruce Springsteen or Michael Jackson.”</p> \n<p>The flying pigs are in fact a motif that has accompanied Pink Floyd’s live shows since 1977: gigantic, pig-shaped inflatables that float above the stage and audience. After he left the band in 1985, following bitter arguments and prolonged legal disputes with the other members, Waters continued using the pigs in his solo shows.</p> \n<p>At a July 2013 concert in Belgium, the pigs were stamped with a Star of David – leading to a huge public outcry, with many people accusing Waters of anti-Semitism. On the other hand, the pigs have over the years also previously borne such diverse symbols as the hammer and sickle, the U.S. dollar sign, the McDonald’s logo and even the image of U.S. President Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>It’s OK for someone to have different political opinions than yours. Where do you draw the line between anti-Semitism and somebody who just sees Israel in a different light?</p> \n<p>“I’m a big proponent of the First Amendment. I’m the first person to say, ‘Hey, if you want to criticize Israel and its policies, no problem.’ But if you call for a boycott against Israel, which is by far the most democratic country in the Middle East, and if you have pigs flying around with the Jewish symbol, the Star of David, and if you make all these crazy statements that Israel has to be given back and stuff like that, I have a big problem with it. I think there are bigger human rights violators than Israel in the world – if [Waters] is so concerned about human rights, why doesn’t he target Iran, Syria, China, Russia?</p> \n<p>“The [other] problem I have is when he calls Israel an apartheid system – and that to me is completely false, because I am an expert on that subject. I was very instrumental in the campaign to free Nelson Mandela, and it is completely apples and oranges. South Africa was a two-class system; Israel is not. In Israel, everybody has a vote, everybody can run for office.”</p> \n<p>Except for the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>“There’s more than two million Israeli Arabs living in Israel. They all have votes, and some sit in parliament. That’s not what South Africa was about.”</p> \n<p>The good Arab</p> \n<p>The world premiere of “Wish You Weren’t Here” took place in Toronto on October 2, in association with B’nai B’rith Canada. Together with Halperin, the organization decided that the film’s critical content in itself wasn’t enough, so they turned the screenings themselves into acts of protest.</p> \n<p>Since Waters was in Canada on his latest world tour in October, the organizers decided to follow him and screen the documentary everywhere he was performing, showing it on the same evening, in the same city. Six such screenings have taken place, including in Quebec City, Ottawa and Montreal. Halperin says the crowds at these screenings have been “mixed,” with Jews, Palestinians and “some people who are curious about it.”</p> \n<p>The movie includes interviews with Pope Francis, the Jewish-American billionaire Ronald Lauder, the Jewish-American jurist Alan Dershowitz and many others. Some have thought-provoking things to say: Jewish Agency Chairman Natan Sharansky, for example, questions the decision to boycott Israel, of all countries, pointing to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq.</p> \n<p>By contrast, other parts of the film provoke discomfort and embarrassment. One cabdriver, supposedly representing a typical Palestinian, defends Israel, saying that it isn’t just killing Palestinians randomly, but is only doing so to defend Israeli homes.</p> \n<p>A psychologist is called upon to comment on the fact that Waters’ father was killed while serving as a British soldier in Italy during World War II, when Waters was only 5 months old. She offers a particularly excruciating psychological analysis: Apparently, this trauma makes Waters identify with victims, not wanting to believe that his father died in vain. This then leads him to conclude that the Nazis were right when they set out to kill the Jews. Come on, really?</p> \n<p>Waters himself is not interviewed in the film, but many minutes are devoted to excerpts from old recorded speeches. Halperin says he approached Waters for an interview or for comments, but that nobody from Waters’ camp responded. The director claims, though, that critics who’ve seen the film tell him it was very fair, since he also presents Waters’ side of the story – even interviewing people like Naomi Klein and Noam Chomsky who support Waters’ views. “It’s not a hatchet job at all,” says Halperin.</p> \n<p>The director insists that when Waters ends the Canadian leg of his tour this month, he won’t be pursuing him elsewhere with his documentary, noting that he’s already in production on two other films. “I’m not obsessed with Roger Waters,” he laughs.</p> \n<p>Halperin and B’nai B’rith’s protest against Waters over the past month joined the pro-Israel protest that has been accompanying the musician’s North American tour. In June, the Zionist Organization of America tried to arrange a counter-boycott – turning to several stadium-owning U.S. companies with a request not to allow Waters to perform in them. This failed.</p> \n<p>Subsequently, several attempts were also made through the courts to prevent Waters’ performing in Long Island, claiming this contravened a local law against the BDS movement. This attempt also failed, though, and the performance was held last month as scheduled.</p> \n<p>A few days later, pro-Israel demonstrators were stationed outside two Waters performances in Brooklyn and New Jersey. The protesters paraded 12-foot-high inflatable Pinocchio dolls, bearing signs paraphrasing a classic Pink Floyd song: “Roger Waters: We don’t need your lies about Israel.”</p> \n<p>Halperin says he has no link to these demonstrations. “I have no time to hold a picket sign against Roger Waters, who I do consider a good artist, I gotta be honest,” he says. “I like his show, except for his politics. I mean, I respect anybody who’s 74 years old who is jumping around on stage for three hours with a decent show. But no, I’m not in front of his house every day with picket signs.”</p> \n<p>What about your film’s funding? Did Jewish organizations help finance it?</p> \n<p>“I like when people mention the funding,” he laughs, “because I could be a prick and say, ‘Hey, who funds your life? Who buys your groceries?’ Look, fortunately I’ve sold millions of books; my films have been seen in 180 countries so most of it I funded myself. There isn’t one main Jewish organization or anything, I have no time for that.</p> \n<p>“I’m a person that puts my money where my mouth is, and usually when I get behind something, I’m not afraid to take a financial risk. Usually it pays off, because I’m respected in my business and people want to work with me, and I’ll recoup it.”</p> \n<p>Your film deals with Waters, but also attempts to paint a contemporary picture of anti-Semitism worldwide. Would you say anti-Semitism is growing or declining right now?</p> \n<p>“Unfortunately, it’s thriving, and that’s what concerns me the most. Face it, Waters is 74; he has his own platform, but he’s [probably] not going to be around too much longer. But with contemporary anti-Semitism, it’s extremely dangerous because in Europe there’s less than 2 million Jews left today. That is astounding and very concerning. Jews are leaving in droves, and [anti-Semitism] is spreading everywhere.</p> \n<p>“The U.K. last year had the most recorded number of anti-Semitic attacks; the U.S. number two,” he continues. “Incredibly, my research shows that in France, the government clamped down after the Charlie Hebdo, kosher market and Bataclan [attacks, in January and November 2015, respectively], so in 2016, recorded anti-Semitic incidents decreased 50 percent in France. The French government at least has made a concerted effort to combat it, and I think that’s a good sign. But in the U.K., the U.S. and Germany, it’s thriving.”</p> \n<p>Roger, I wish you were here /&nbsp;Gideon Levy</p> \n<p>After being involved with Roger Waters for many hours over the last two years, I’d like to state categorically that this man does not have a shred of anti-Semitism in him. Not one particle of his body carries that virus.</p> \n<p>If there is something called a non-anti-Semite, Roger Waters is one. If there is a warrior of justice, he’s the man.</p> \n<p>Who are these Jewish functionaries anyway – people who make a living from anti-Semitism – to determine that Waters is anti-Semitic? Do they have Geiger counters for measuring it? On what are they basing their diagnosis of anti-Semitism? On the basis of his statement that Israel is depriving another people of life? On the basis of his call to boycott it, as was done with its predecessor, South Africa? “Wish You Weren’t Here” has done a great service to the struggle against the occupation.</p> \n<p>If this is the propagandist response to Waters, we should all be Waters. With a Jewish psychologist from Harvard, with her pop-psychology analysis of Roger’s character leading her to the grotesque conclusion that he identifies with the Nazi aggressor because his father died when he was very young; with baseless accusations that Waters compared Israel to the Nazi extermination machine, and especially with the scandalous – there’s no other word for it – claim that Waters is anti-Semitic. This film is nothing but incitement.</p> \n<p>In recent years, the Israeli-Zionist-Jewish propaganda machine has become a one-trick pony: “Help! Anti-Semitism!” Any word of criticism against Israel is anti-Semitic. There are no justified words of criticism to be found in its vocabulary. There is no such thing. There is nothing, because there was nothing. There is no occupation, there never was one. No one is guilty, there are no crimes, only anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>“Wish You Weren’t Here” is a typical example of the genre. It deals only with the sullying of Roger Waters’ name and wallows in the constant self-victimization of the Jews.</p> \n<p>The documentary doesn’t include even one attempt to deal with the substance of Waters’ claims that the occupation is cruel and illegitimate, and that there is a moral imperative to boycott the occupier, not entertain it.</p> \n<p>The film is boring as only a propaganda film can be, vile and devious as only a self-promoting documentary can be. The first, short part of the film deals with Waters, then moves from him to the rest of the world – which is supposedly concerned only with hatred of the Jews. Conclusion: the whole world is against us. Subtext: Waters is to blame.</p> \n<p>The son of ambulance driver Second Lt. Eric Fletcher Waters, who was killed in Italy on February 18, 1944, Waters is a man who wrote on his Facebook page that he’s wanted to follow in his parents’ footsteps all his life. He is a man of conscience – perhaps the most impressive and lofty one I’ve ever met.</p> \n<p>He doesn’t hate Israel – he just physically suffers from what he hears and knows about its actions. “Not protesting is not an option for me,” he likes to say. What has become the preferred option for most Israelis, including the majority of its artists – to remain silent, to ignore, to avoid knowing or seeing, not hearing and obviously not protesting – is unacceptable to him. For that, this film wants to settle scores with him. Anyone who does not remain silent is an anti-Semite.</p> \n<p>I wish you were here, Roger. I wish Israel had one brave artist of your stature. If Israel were a conscientious country, it would thank Roger Waters for his moral voice. And even, believe it or not, for his call to boycott it – something that just might extricate it from its predicament. It might happen one day. You have to believe that day will come.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It began as a drizzle, but then came Rosh Hashanah and the drizzle became a downpour. Tel Aviv is full of tourists all of a sudden. Friends from Europe are asking to crash on the living room couch and conduct nighttime searches for cool apartments, with a preference for the area between Rothschild and the beach. They ask us to go with them to the Carmel Market and show them the secret alleyways, amazed at the rhythm&nbsp;– not to mention the excellent beer at every bar.</p> \n<p>There’s one common denominator: They want to get to know “Israeli cuisine.” While we argue over whether there really is such a thing, the tourists are very clear about it: anything that’s not the Far East, Italian or French, and no fusion or American either. They’re after recommendations for food stands, bars and restaurants, the ones that have this elusive Israeli X factor.</p> \n<p>So here’s a list of eight places to turn a Tel Aviv visit into a stream of culinary conquest. It’s the work of a hungry group of East Europeans and I as we embarked on a tasting trip. We came back with a list that includes food stands, regular old restaurants, shish kebab joints and foodie bars.</p> \n<p>Falafel Hakosem – Like it or not, your tourists will eat falafel, shawarma or hummus on their trip to Israel, so why not the best? Hakosem is a kind of shawarma/falafel joint but it’s much more, not least because the raw materials are of super-high quality. Owner Arik Rosenthal imports some of them himself. The menu offers excellent shawarma, wonderfully crispy falafel, hummus, tahini, great eggplants and fresh salads made on the spot every few hours (the sabich is great too). You’ll also find grilled chicken livers prepared on the griddle, and spicy fish in red sauce. Don’t forgo the surprising vegan malabi for dessert. About 50 shekels a person. Shlomo Hamelech 1</p> \n<p>Joz ve Loz – It’s true, the food here isn’t exactly Israeli, but it seems that Joz ve Loz, in its new iteration, offers a culinary experience that you’ll be proud to present to your foreign guests. You won’t find such raw materials in many places. The design is eclectic, the wine menu is now being created by the wine guru Shira Granot, and while we’ll be glad to see some Israeli wines, the imported selection is varied and a beautiful accompaniment to the food.</p> \n<p>On the menu, which is seasonal and frequently changes, you’ll find jibneh (Arab-style cheese) with sage fried in olive oil, kibbeh nayeh (Arabic-style meat tartare), okra with spinach from East Jerusalem, dehydrated yoghurt, Arab cabbage in seared butter, octopus with vegetables in purple sauce, fine fresh fish and short ribs in sweet and spicy glaze. The food here is fresh, brimming with vegetables and original. Don’t leave without trying the malabi with a twist. 150 shekels and up per person. Gvulot 5</p> \n<p>Basta – It’s near the Carmel Market and it’s certainly the first in a new wave. On the one hand, Basta is a shrine of decadent hedonism looking toward Europe in its grand wine menu and brandies. On the other hand, the menu features a good many innards and cooking “from the nose to the tail.” Either way, there’s an Arabic inspiration from Nazareth to Nablus. The menu constantly changes. Among Basta’s greatest hits are the half head of grouper, marrow on the griddle, lamb’s heart, lamb’s ribs, white tortellini and goat cheese. About 200 shekels per person, before you start drinking. Hashomer 4.</p> \n<p>Miznon – In Paris or Vienna, Melbourne or New York, Eyal Shani is the best ambassador of Israel’s latest cuisine. Each of his restaurants will introduce tourists to something of the Israeli character, but Miznon knows how to put it all together. The noise and chaos add to the atmosphere, while cheap Goldstar beer on tap completes the scene.</p> \n<p>And before you really start digging in, there are plum pita pieces, excellent white tahini, and green spicy sauce overflowing with herbs and fresh pickles. Vegan and vegetarian tourists will fall in love with the roasted cauliflower, but also with the lima bean masabacha, and if it’s available, green Jericho beans. Between courses, try the chicken liver, lamb kebab and minute steak, and you’ll sigh with satisfaction. 40 shekels and up per person. Ibn Gabirol 23</p> \n<p>Kitchen Market – It’s not only the best restaurant in the Tel Aviv Port, it’s among the best restaurants in the country, many people will tell you. Kitchen Market is also a beautiful place to take tourists. The western and southern sections reflect the waves. The service is excellent. The staff is knowledgeable, and the menu will surprise even experienced foodies.</p> \n<p>Try appetizers like colorful tomato salad with labaneh, mint, olives and buffalo mozzarella, or lamb sirloin carpaccio, herb salad, raisins, lamb and rose vinaigrette. Among the main dishes, try lamb grilled sweetbreads, chestnuts, cabbage cream and lettuce or slow-cooked lamb, pea cream, chestnuts and broccoli. There's also grilled veal fillet, dried onion crumble, beef stock and Dijon mustard. Don’t miss the original desserts, chief among them the cheese cake, and don’t forget the business lunches in the afternoon. About 200 shekels per person. Hangar 12, The Port Market</p> \n<p>Dalida – If you’re hosting a tourist who loves food, it’s worth dedicating time to the Levinsky Market and then finishing at Dalida. The restaurant’s happy hour is one of the best deals in the city, when the menu is half price from 5 P.M. to 7 P.M. The servings represent the new Israeli cuisine that clings to mama’s apron while being influenced by the world. Dalida’s hits include spicy feta brulee, cured mullet with garlic and chili paste on toast, as well as beef fillet kubbaniya on toasted bread with aioli yoghurt. Among the cocktails, try the arak in almond milk. For dessert, don’t pass up on the oum ali – semolina cake and hot malabi. About 150 shekels per person. Zvulun 7.</p> \n<p>Onza – This restaurant at the Jaffa flea market has transformed over the past year into a beautiful Turkish star. They serve Ottoman food, with the music really rocking on Sundays. Onza offers fried cauliflower salad, salad with sumac and whipped tahini, shawarma doner, and yogurt-marinated chicken with black tahini. There’s also leaf salad, onion and potato, pizza and a variety of Turkish-style starters. Spiced Oriental cocktails and desserts like sutlac (a rice pudding) and malabi make the atmosphere complete. About 150 shekels per person. Rav Hanina 3, Jaffa. </p> \n<p>Carmel Market – If there’s one surprise that works with every tourist it’s Israel’s markets. And if you’re going to the market, why not go to the most touristy of them all? Everything excites tourists at the Carmel Market, from the fruits and vegetables to the clothes and toys. The hustle and bustle, the noise and the colors do half the job themselves.</p> \n<p>A bonus: Yes, Basta is near the market, but also tiny cafes, cheap-but-good food joints and bars have opened in the tiny alleys next door. The most fun is simply getting lost there on a sunny day. Or taking a walk around the Yemenite quarter and the alleys extending from it, or stopping for a beer or hummus and fava beans. Those are experiences your tourist friends won’t stop thanking you for.</p>",

The site includes sections called “Jewish Problem” and “Race War.”</p> \n<p>Anglin, 32, created Daily Stormer - billed as “The World’s Most Genocidal Republican Website” - in 2013. Anglin is a central figure in the white nationalist movement in the United States and has been in hiding since a lawsuit was filed against him in April by the Southern Poverty Law Center.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Daily Stormer however doesn't have many fans among internet domain hosts - the servers need to keep a website on the internet. An Austrian company has revoked the domain name of the website was previously rejected by internet hosts in the United States.</p> \n<p>Monika Pink-Rank, a spokeswoman for Austrian domain registry nic.at, said The Daily Stormer's domain was removed on Monday after Austrian politicians reported the white supremacist platform's presence.</p> \n<p>The website has been looking for a home since its publisher mocked the counter-protester who was killed during the Confederate monument protests in Charlottesville, Virginia last month.</p> \n<p>Anglin in hiding</p> \n<p>In April, a Montana woman sued Anglin for orchestrating an anti-Semitic online trolling campaign against her family. Nearly three months later, her attorneys are still trying to find him.</p> \n<p>A court filing Friday by lawyers from the Southern Poverty Law Center claims The Daily Stormer’s founder, Andrew Anglin, is “actively concealing his whereabouts” and hasn’t been served with Tanya Gersh’s federal lawsuit. Gersh’s attorneys are asking for more time to find Anglin so the case won’t be temporarily dismissed.</p> \n<p>The suit claims anonymous internet trolls bombarded Gersh’s family with hateful and threatening messages after Anglin published their personal information in a post accusing her and other Jewish residents of Whitefish, Montana, of engaging in an “extortion racket” against the mother of white nationalist Richard Spencer.</p> \n<p>The Daily Stormer used a crowdfunding website, WeSearchr, to raise more than $152,000 in donations from nearly 2,000 contributors to help pay for Anglin’s legal expenses.</p> \n<p>Gersh’s lawsuit said she agreed to help Spencer’s mother sell commercial property she owns in Whitefish amid talk of a protest outside the building. Sherry Spencer, however, later accused Gersh of threatening and harassing her into agreeing to sell the property.</p> \n<p>Gersh’s lawyers from the Alabama-based law center say her suit must be dismissed on procedural grounds if Anglin isn’t served with a copy of it by July 17, but the court can extend that deadline.</p> \n<p>The law center’s lawyers said they have looked for him at four addresses in Franklin County, Ohio, for which he apparently has a connection. Gersh’s attorneys say they also tried in vain to contact Anglin’s Las Vegas-based attorney, Marc Randazza, and confirm that he is authorized to accept service of the lawsuit on Anglin’s behalf.</p> \n<p>Randazza questioned whether the lawyers’ request for a deadline extension is a “stunt.”</p> \n<p>“If they can’t serve him, I question whether they are actually trying,” Randazza told The Associated Press in July. “We’re going to defend (against) the case.”</p> \n<p>The suit accuses Anglin of invading Gersh’s privacy, intentionally inflicting “emotional distress” and violating a Montana anti-intimidation law. As of late August the suit against Anglin remains &quot;stuck&quot; as his disappearance has made the case impossible to litigate reports the New York Times.</p>",

        "text":["<p> ISTANBUL - For the last two days, Istanbul’s main center, Taksim, and its surrounding areas, have been under siege due to a massive peaceful protest. Thousands of canisters of tear gas have been fired at hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters throughout the city, together with water-cannons spraying tainted water that burns the skin, all while the protesters screamed in unison, &quot;Erdogan Resign!&quot; While protests, and other forms of dissent, have been met with force in the past, there is no doubt that during the last year there has been a proliferation of the use of teargas, especially following the election of Turkey’s Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for his third term, two years ago.</p> \n<p> While the current protest originally was sparked over an urban renewal project, which included destroying the Taksim’s main park, the only green area in the immediate vicinity, and reconstructing to its former glory an Ottoman armory that once stood there on the park's ruins, the truth must be told that the current protest was much more profound than the campaign to save the seventy-five year-old trees of the park.</p> \n<p> When the conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) first came to power in 2002, under the sole leadership of Erdogan, many hashed out exaggerated claims that his party was secretly promoting a radical Islamic agenda; however, the majority of Turkish people never believed this. Not to mention that many Turkish liberals embraced Erdogan as an agent of change, as the one that could challenge the secular military elite, as the one that could bring new freedoms to Turkey. In fact, during the first few years, Erdogan ushered in not only the building of a strong economy, but also a period where civil organizations multiplied, with a genuine sense of change in the air.</p> \n<p> Despite the bad record Turkey has had with jailing reporters, long detentions and trials for military officers arrested on suspicion of masterminding a coup d’&eacute;tat, and numerous students detained for years in prison for protesting, many liberals still placed hopes that Erdogan could shape a semi-liberal constitution for Turkey despite his very conservative views; something that in 2010 led Erdogan to a solid 58 percent victory in the referendum over Turkey’s new constitution (still in the works). Just a year later, in the 2011 parliamentary elections, he came very close to securing fifty-percent of the total Turkish electorate.</p> \n<p> It was in the 2011 elections campaign that Erdogan clarified his goal of changing the law in order to allow him to transfer new powers to the presidency, and then run for president himself, allowing him to continue to rule in one way or another until at least 2023, the 100th year anniversary of the Republic. In fact, his ambitions are not confined to the issue of state positions; during the last two years, it has become evident that Erdogan is only interested in a one-man show, with him in the center. And having centralized so much power he has made his aims clear: To transform younger Turks into a 'moral' generation, while transforming Turkey into a major regional and world economic powerhouse.</p> \n<p> From implementing policies encouraging women to have three children, to his goal to raise a 'moral' generation of youth that will sign up to his interpretation of what a good Muslim is, more and more Turks have become tired of a Prime Minister who promotes policies that interfere with their daily lives. Just before the protest began new laws were enacted aimed at curbing alcohol consumption in the public sphere. It should be clear it is not that so many Turks would be affected by the laws; even if drinking Raki (and beer to some extent) is considered by many as a Turkish pastime, actually a low percentage of them actually drink on a regular basis. Rather, it was in the very condescending way Erdogan related his disdain for those who do drink, inferring that they were all drunks.</p> \n<p> Parallel to this, Erdogan’s personal dictation of the policies of urban renewal and of massive infrastructure projects have taken their toll on the Turkish population. It seems that no power is strong enough to stop a project that the Prime Minister supports; whether it is the third Bosphorus bridge, the new mega-airport, or the numerous dams that are flooding cities throughout the Anatolian heartland. In fact, it was due to this very reason that the Erdogan’s obsession to replicate an Ottoman armory, even stressing his wish that it be used as a shopping mall, irked so many, regardless of political affiliation or social background. As high rises replace shanty towns, and shopping malls blossom at the speed of flowers in the spring, the 606 trees at Taksim Park turned into a real issue for many.</p> \n<p> Today’s massive protest in that sense were not a revolution; they were not set on overthrowing the government; the protestors' aim was to have their voices heard and to demonstrate that even if Turkey is a democracy according to the books, that a democratic system should ensure rights for all, as well as fostering a climate of debate. This point cannot be understated especially when it comes to the Turkish youth that - to a great extent - does not see eye-to-eye with the government’s conservative outlook. For so many people in their early twenties, the only Prime Minster they have ever known is Erdogan, and they long for a new reality where they can take part, contribute to their society, and not be considered hooligans for simply enjoying a beer. In fact, in the park protest, Turkey showed to what extent its youth want to be a part of making their home a better place.</p> \n<p> Lastly, with the protesters now in Taksim Square, once the police barricades were lifted, it has shown Prime Minister Erdogan, and all of his government ministers, that even if they have one of the biggest stockpiles of teargas in the world, it cannot be used to silence those who oppose them. The protests are a strong message to Erdogan that a significant part of his society is frustrated with his arrogance, and perhaps gives him a signal that his wish to become President might not be that easy a feat at all.</p> \n<p> Louis Fishman is an assistant professor at Brooklyn College, City University of New York.

        "text":["<p>While the world heaped on commentary, criticism and Internet memes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid blame for the extermination&nbsp;of European Jewry at the feet of the Palestinian mufti of Jerusalem, rather than at Hitler’s, American Holocaust-related organizations were curiously silent.</p> \n<p>All of the leading American Holocaust organizations and most of the mainstream Jewish groups had little to say on the record — with one exception — when asked for their response to Netanyahu’s alteration of history. None would respond to questions about what the impact may be and why they didn’t issue statements about it.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, tried to explain what he is certain Netanyahu meant to say. “The prime minister of Israel knows very well that Adolph Hitler was the person responsible” for the Holocaust, he told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>“Maybe he didn’t phrase it the right way, but what he was trying to say is that he had many assistants enthusiastic about this idea,” including Jerusalem Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini. “Maybe he should have phrased it more clearly, but his intention was to say that ‘let’s not forget that before there was a State of Israel, when there were no settlements, there was a grand mufti who thought they should get rid of the Jews.’&quot;</p> \n<p>“The Palestinians’ arguments [against Israel] begin with the settlements and with the occupation, but none of that applied” when Hitler met with the grand mufti of Jerusalem and the Muslim leader spoke of his interest in ridding the world of Jews,&quot; Hier said. “The Palestinians have to own that point. They must admit that point.”</p> \n<p>The Anti-Defamation League's new CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, chastised Netanyahu on Twitter Wednesday, writing: “even if unintended, the PM’s words trivialize Hitler’s rolewe must always be careful in talking about the Holocaustat a time when there is hateful incitement against Jews spreading across the Internet, it’s important to stay focused on the issues at hand today.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Representatives of other prominent Holocaust museums had little to say. Their leaders, like Holocaust historians around the world, just wanted to set the historical record straight.</p> \n<p>“I join the chorus of historians throughout the world in clarifying the facts,” wrote David Marwell, Director of New York’s Museum of Jewish Heritage — &nbsp;A Living Memorial to the Holocaust, in an email response to an interview request. “By the time the Grand Mufti met with Hitler at the end of November 1941, the Germans were already engaged in mass murder of the Jews.”</p> \n<p>The Museum declined to make him or anyone else available for additional questions.</p> \n<p>The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. issued this statement in response to Haaretz’s inquiry: &quot;Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, was an anti-Semite and willing Nazi collaborator. While actively supportive of Nazi Germany's efforts to annihilate world Jewry&nbsp;— he sought to inspire Muslim men to serve in Axis military and auxiliary units and advocated the murder of Jews —&nbsp;the 'Final Solution' would have occurred with or without his complicity.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A museum spokesman declined to make anyone available to answer questions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Most scholars of the Holocaust and smaller museums around the country did not respond at all to requests, made by phone and email, for interviews.</p> \n<p>“I’m not sure I can add anything new to the discussion,” wrote Elizabeth Gelman, executive director of The Florida Holocaust Museum, in St. Petersburg. “As my colleagues have been widely quoted, the statement that Prime Minister Netanyahu made was factually incorrect. Germany itself has reaffirmed its responsibility for the Holocaust.” Gelman did not reply to follow-up questions.</p> \n<p>Rafael Medoff, director of The David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies in Washington D.C., used the opportunity to write Haaretz that the entirety of the mufti’s role in the Holocaust, “aside from the many anti-Jewish speeches he broadcast to the Arab world from Germany, will not be known until the relevant Arab archives are opened.”</p> \n<p>Why the reluctance to say much directly about the impact of Netanyahu’s misstatement?</p> \n<p>“Israel has a lot of tsuris,” said Hier, of the Wiesenthal Center, using the Yiddish word for “problems.”</p> \n<p>Holocaust groups are “really upset and yet don’t want to criticize Netanyahu publicly — particularly at a moment when Israel needs support. Israel is under attack from terrorists and they want to stand together with Israel, not criticize, ” said the head of another major Jewish organization, who asked not to be named.</p> \n<p>“As the Germans put it, Netanyahu has instrumentalized the Holocaust for current political purposes. That’s a horrible thing to do,” he said.&nbsp;The prime minister “has now tried to use the Holocaust as another tool in his political quiver.”</p> \n<p>But one leading Holocaust scholar, Deborah Lipstadt, spoke more freely.</p> \n<p>The implications of Netanyahu’s statement “are very bad,” said Lipstadt, a professor of modern Jewish history and Holocaust studies at Emory University in Atlanta. “The situation [in Israel] is terrible,” but “you don’t have to revise history to make that point.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>His revision of long-accepted historical fact “certainly suggests that Jews play with the facts,” Lipstadt told Haaretz. “It was a big mistake on his part. He really went too far this time.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“You can’t handle the truth!”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The courtroom climax of the film &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; could be the new rallying cry of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Colbert-style ‘truthiness’ abounds: Just this week, in a blatant revision of Holocaust history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opined that wartime mufti, Hajj Amin al-Husayni, and not Adolph Hitler, was responsible for formulating the Final Solution.&nbsp;In another highly publicized act of misinformation (or disinformation), Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbbas condemned Israel for executing terrorist Ahmad Mansara,&nbsp;while the teenager was defying death eating hospital jello in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These recent cases only follow on months of conspiracy theories on both sides - from right-wing Israelis alleging&nbsp;that the arson-murder of the Dawabsheh family&nbsp;was perpetrated by Palestinians and not Jewish terrorists to insinuations that Israel intends to blow up Al-Aqsa and replace it with a third holy temple. As Hebrew University Professor Hillel Cohen suggested recently,&nbsp;“the way to understand people’s narratives is to add the words ‘I wish that’ before what they sayAt some point, they start believing themselves.”</p> \n<p>However, as a fellow historian, I believe that we aren’t in a war of narratives today. Nowadays a feud based on ‘facts’ seems to belong to a distant, irretrievable past, and narratives seem like a relic of a bygone era. No longer does the conflict dwell in the realm of differing interpretations of lived experience, rather it has passed into a new phase, in the words of Eric Hobsbawn and Terance Ranger, of “the invention of tradition.”&nbsp;Israelis and Palestinians are fighting a war of post-modern political fictions, where truth has been mortgaged to collective mobilization. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sadly, this reality is not new to struggles for indigenous rights and independence. In 1992, the Quiche-Maya activist Rigoberta Mench&uacute; won the Nobel Peace Prize for her campaign for Indians in Guatemala. In 1999, an inconvenient truth in the form of a revisionist biography by anthropologist David Stoll alleged that Mench&uacute; fabricated important details to serve her political agenda and that Western audiences acquiesced in these lies (or at very least, did not attempt to verify her story), ‘romanticizing the guerrilla’ in Guatemala and beyond.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While this case remains contested in historiographic controversy, the Mench&uacute; affair brought the debate on the dangers of extreme historical relativism into the public sphere. Moreover, it seemed to confirm that the left - and perhaps also the extreme right - saw fit to sacrifice nuance to the national struggle, evidence for empowerment, technicalities for territory, information for ideology, and veracity for a vision of the future across the globe.</p> \n<p>It is a tragic mistake in looking at Israel-Palestine to fight force with fabrication. There is more than enough real terror and tragedy in this region that Israelis and Palestinians do not need the “invention of tradition.” The horrors that have occurred on both sides do not need hasbara theatrics or “Pallywood” scripting. We may have become immune to the disaster of the everyday, the routinization of racism, the triviality of living with terror — but the mundanity and banality of evils and wrongs in Israel/Palestine don’t require special effects.</p> \n<p>The Israel-Palestine morass needs empathy and energetic resolution. If the turn towards uber post-modernist thinking has any use at all it would be for Israelis and Palestinians to walk a day in the other’s shoes and to understand their identity, circumstances, and needs. That is unlikely to happen when the post-modernist turn isolates each side ever more in their own self-righteousness. Moreover, as Hillel Cohen asserts, self-fulfilling prophecies have not only political, but moral implications, where acts of violence can be easily overlooked or even justified.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This third intifada poses not only an immediate danger to individuals, but to the possibility of any end to the conflict. While practical solutions to the political problems in Israel/Palestine have been on the table for years, there can never be a claims-ending agreement without a coinciding ‘truth and reconciliation’ process that aims to resolve underlying ideological tensions. &nbsp;If ‘truth’ has simply been replaced by convenient truths, those antiquated ideas historians used to call ‘facts’ and ‘authority’ replaced by stirring manipulations and powerful deceptions, and the past incessantly reinvented to suit contemporary agendas, how can there ever be peace? How can there ever be a final status agreement if the building blocks of a shared history are simply a constantly mutable fiction?</p> \n<p>We should keep near the warning by George Orwell in his 1943 essay on the Spanish Civil War:&nbsp;“The truth it is feltbecomes untruth when your enemy utters ithistory being written not in terms of what happened, but of what ought to have happened according to various party linesthe abandonment of the idea that history could be truthfully writtenThis prospect frightens me much more than bombs – and after our experiences of the last few years, this is not a frivolous statement.” &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Sara Yael Hirschhorn is University Research Lecturer and Sidney Brichto Fellow in Israel Studies at the University of Oxford.

        "text":["<p>Prof. Dina Porat, chief historian of Yad Vashem, called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s claim that Hitler did not seek to exterminate the Jews until his meeting with the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem at the time, Haj Amin al-Husseini “completely erroneous, on all counts.”</p> \n<p>Porat, a senior historian at Tel Aviv University who specializes in Holocaust studies, told Haaretz on Wednesday: “Hitler did not need anyone to encourage the final solution. In terms of the facts, there’s no debate ... all these actions, Hitler’s obsessions, have no link to the mufti.”</p> \n<p>In his speech to the 37th Zionist Congress in Jerusalem on Tuesday, Netanyahu ostensibly quoted from the conversation between Hitler and the mufti at their meeting in Berlin in November 1941: “And Haj Amin al-Husseini went to Hitler and said, ‘If you expel them, they’ll all come here.’” According to Netanyahu, Hitler asked Husseini, “So what should I do with them?,” to which the mufti replied, “Burn them.”</p> \n<p>When asked whether Netanyahu fabricated the dialogue that he quoted, Porat said that Netanyahu is very knowledgeable about Jewish history. “He grew up in a home full of Jewish history. But what he said is not in the minutes of the meeting. That should be clear.”</p> \n<p>The meeting between Hitler and Husseini was documented only with general statements and topic headings, and was not transcribed word for word. There is no record of Hitler asking Husseini what to do with Europe’s Jews.</p> \n<p>“The mufti did not speak to Hitler in terms of ‘you should do this,’ or ‘what do you think of a final solution?’ Nor is it recorded that the mufti told Hitler to ‘burn them.’ Hitler never asked anyone what to do with the Jews,” Porat said. She did say, however, that Hitler told the mufti that he would “’continue his plans,’ meaning that he had already begun, and certainly not because the mufti asked him to.”</p> \n<p>According to Porat, “all of the facts show that during Hitler and the mufti’s meeting, the ‘final solution’ was already under way.”</p> \n<p>Porat explained that Hitler’s plan to exterminate European Jewry dated back to years before his meeting with Husseini, noting references to it in “Mein Kampf,” which was published in 1925, as well as the 1933 Nazi party charter and remarks in the Reichstag in 1939, when Hitler threatened to “exterminate the Jewish people.”</p> \n<p>“And there’s no debating later on, with the invasion of Poland, the orders from Berlin to build ghettos, which were documented as a stage of the ‘final solution,’” Porat said. Later, mass killings of Jews began with the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. “The order to kill wasn’t signed by Hitler, but the first death camp, Chelmno, began operating in December 1941, a few weeks after the meeting with the mufti — and it’s something that had been worked on long before,” added Porat.</p> \n<p>Husseini asked Hitler to advance the final solution in the Middle East, but he certainly didn’t come up with the plan himself, Porat said. “Had Netanyahu added the words ‘in the Middle East’ to his speech, he wouldn’t be in this mess. But he didn’t add them,” Porat said: “That’s what the mufti wanted, and that’s why he went to Berlin.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Holocaust has become a political football. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the past few weeks we have seen politicians and activists of all stripes rely on the history of the Holocaust to score political points.&nbsp;Mike Huckabee, in expressing his opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement, argued that it was akin to taking “the Israelis and marching them to the door of the oven.”&nbsp; There were grounds to oppose the agreement and consider it misguided and even dangerous, but this kind of analogy distorts historical reality.</p> \n<p>Ben Carson proclaimed – wrongly, as historian Alan Steinweis demonstrated in the New York Times – that if Jews in Nazi Germany had guns, the Holocaust’s death toll would have been far lower. Let’s recall that the Soviets had guns, tanks and an array of other weapons; nonetheless they lost seven million soldiers in their efforts to defeat the Nazis.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But this reliance on the Holocaust to further one’s cause is not something new. At pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel protests, it is common to see participants carrying placards accusing&nbsp;Israelis of carrying out a Holocaust and describing the current prime minister as the equivalent of Hitler or even his “clone.” One might totally disagree with Israel’s policies vis-a-vis the Palestinians.&nbsp;But to speak of a Holocaust or Hitler bears no relation to historical or contemporary reality.</p> \n<p>It's possible to argue that since neither Huckabee nor Carson are well versed in the history of the annihilation of European Jewry, they should not be too roundly condemned for these cheap analogies.&nbsp;Similarly, one could say that anti-Israel protestors are so infused with hatred and anger that they too have lost sight of any historical reality. But what can one say when the leader of the Jewish state relies on this tactic?</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, Prime Minister Netanyahu told the World Zionist Congress that the idea for murdering the Jews was the brainchild of Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.&nbsp; According to Netanyahu, when Hitler and the mufti met in November 1941, Hitler had not yet thought of exterminating the Jews but simply wished to expel them. When Husseini complained that expelled Jews would all come to Palestine, according to Netanyahu, a perplexed Hitler asked, “So what should I do with them?” The mufti supposedly responded, “Burn them.” And so the Holocaust ensued.</p> \n<p>This claim doesn’t make sense. The murder of the Jews began in the summer of 1941, five months before this meeting. By the time Hitler and the mufti had their tete-a-tete, hundreds of thousands of Jewish men, women, and children had been shot. At Babi Yar alone, the Germans murdered 34,000 Jews in September 1941, over two months prior to the meeting, without any encouragement from the mufti. Gas wagons were already in use prior to this meeting.&nbsp;Someone who wishes to only expel a people does not rely on mass shootings and gas wagons.</p> \n<p>This is not the first time Netanyahu has made this assertion. In 2012 the prime minister claimed in the Knesset that the mufti “more than anyone else convinced [Hitler] to execute the Final Solution.” Some of the prime minister’s critics used this opportunity to brand him a Holocaust denier. He’s not – but he is a revisionist. And he is doing so to score political points.</p> \n<p>Let me be clear. The mufti was no innocent, and enthusiastically supported Hitler. As historian Jeffrey Herf records, it was this support that earned him a prominent seat in December 1941, when Hitler gave his speech declaring war on the United States.</p> \n<p>Al-Husseini unambiguously encouraged his audiences to murder Jews. In December 1942, at the opening of the Islamic Institute in Berlin, he declared that the war, which had been “engineered by the Jews,” gave Muslims a “unique” opportunity to “get rid of their enemies.” In a March 1944 radio address he exhorted Muslims to “kill the Jews wherever you find them.” He assisted the Nazis in organizing Bosnian Muslims into a unit of the Waffen-SS. While historians may differ on the degree of influence he wielded among Nazi leaders, they do not question his delight that Jews were being annihilated.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, however, did not paint him as a supporter of this genocide. He credited him with coming up with the idea. There is a vast difference between the two. Historians continue to debate who originated the idea of the Final Solution. No serious historian, however, has ever laid the decision at the feet of the mufti.</p> \n<p>These are scary days in Israel.&nbsp;Arabs, some of whom have been incited to act by religious and political leaders, have stabbed, hacked, and stoned Jews. Others have mowed them down with cars. This inexcusable barbarism does not, however, legitimate rewriting of the past.</p> \n<p>The Holocaust was a crucial moment in history.&nbsp;Forgetting would be a tragedy; twisting and revising what happened to fulfill ancillary goals, equally so.</p> \n<p>Deborah Lipstadt is the Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish History and Holocaust Studies at&nbsp;Emory University. She is the author of &quot;Denying the Holocaust,&quot; for which she was sued for libel by historian David Irving.

        "text":["<p>Israel’s environmental laws have begun to resemble those in the West, but the&nbsp; legal snafu in the West Bank leaves its inhabitants exposed to hazards. Burning trash, leaking sewage and illegal charcoal plants are only some of the problems.</p> \n<p>As things stand now, roughly half of Israel’s environmental laws do not apply in the West Bank. Against this backgdrop, environmental group Green Now, which settlers set up to test the state of green legislation, held a conference last week.</p> \n<p>“The Clean Air Law, which went into effect about three years ago, laid down stricter conditions for production facilities. But this law does not apply in the West Bank,” Nitsan Levy, executive director of the Municipal Association for Environmental Quality – Judea, told the conference. “This limits the ability to require factories to prevent air pollution.”</p> \n<p>There are 12 industrial zones with hundreds of plants over the Green Line.</p> \n<p>“We could require a metal factory in [Israeli town] Beit Shemesh, say, to obtain a special permit that limits the emission of pollutants,” said Shoni Goldberger, the Jerusalem district manager at the Environmental Protection Ministry. “By comparison, a similar facility in [settlement] Ma’aleh Adumim will not be required to obtain an emissions permit.”</p> \n<p>Levy, meanwhile, warns that West Bank industrial zones could become a paradise for polluters. He cites “unfair competition among factories that must invest in preventing pollution and those that don’t have to invest as much.” It’s not just the Clean Air Law that doesn’t apply over the Green Line, it’s also the Law for the Prevention of Hazards from Asbestos.</p> \n<p>“This law is particularly important because it concerns a real risk to public health,” said Yitzhak Meir, head of the municipal environment association in Samaria, the northern half of the West Bank. “We require that people use a certified professional company to remove asbestos refuse. We have no authority to make this requirement, but people don’t know that we don’t have this authority.”</p> \n<p>The Environmental Protection Ministry’s so-called green police once worked well in the West Bank, but after Israel’s environmental enforcement laws were not updated last year, this force had to halt operations.</p> \n<p>A recent attempt to enshrine in law enforcement powers in the region failed when the army demanded that these powers not include inspection or enforcement on its bases. As a result, at least seven criminal cases against settlements polluting the environment were halted.</p> \n<p>Sewage destroying crops</p> \n<p>One case concerns pollution of the Palestinian village Wadi Fukin. The source is the sewage-treatment plants in the settlement Betar Ilit. Although the settlement’s chiefs say the pollution was caused by problems now fixed, Yuval Arbel of Friends of the Earth Middle East says the sewage flows to fields and destroys crops. “Olive trees that rotted and died from the pollution can be seen,” he said.</p> \n<p>The lack of enforcement authority in the area has also hampered the fight against the dumping of construction debris from Israel into the West Bank. Considered one of the worst environmental problems in the region, illegal dumping can pollute groundwater. But without the proper authority, inspectors from the Civil Administration or the Environmental Protection Ministry are helpless.</p> \n<p>“It’s very easy and cheap to dump debris near a Palestinian village and pay the landowner 50 shekels instead of paying a proper dumping site,” said Meir of Samaria’s municipal environment association.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, most of the mountain aquifer, one of Israel’s most important groundwater sources, is in the West Bank, but Israel’s Water Law only applies partially over the Green Line.</p> \n<p>Thus, the Water Authority can’t use the so-called corrective action order to prevent the pollution of water sources. In Israel, this tool enables the Water Authority to clean up pollution; it can then charge the local authority responsible for the problem.</p> \n<p>The Non-Ionizing Radiation Law, which regulates licensing and planning for facilities that emit radiation like cellular antennas, doesn’t apply in the West Bank either, so it’s hard to inspect such facilities.</p> \n<p>Recently, environmental groups operating in the West Bank were stymied when they tried to help set up biogas facilities there. These facilities recycle organic waste and use the gas created from it to produce electricity. But the agreement laid down by the Israel Electric Corporation for selling power from these plants is not valid in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Investors at the ready</p> \n<p>“We have a site intended for a biogas facility in [settlement] Immanuel, and the local authorities signed an agreement to transport the waste there,” Meir said. “Investors are ready to build and operate the plant, but if the agreement set by the IEC isn’t valid, the investors will give up.”</p> \n<p>According to Benny Elbaz, head of the Civil Administration’s environment unit, despite the legal restrictions, action has been taken to address major hazards in the West Bank. This was done with the help of organizations like the World Bank and countries that donate to the Palestinian Authority like Germany and the United States.</p> \n<p>“A new trash-dumping site has been opened in Jenin, and 100 pirate dumping sites have been closed, with 90 percent of them rehabilitated,” Elbaz said, adding that Israel subsidizes the transport of trash from Palestinian villages near Ramallah to the site after a less-efficient one was shut down. But Green Now officials say many pirate dumping sites are still active.</p> \n<p>Elbaz adds that several large sewage-treatment plants in the West Bank are in the planning and construction stages, and a high-quality plant is in operation west of Nablus. He says the Civil Administration is trying to get area residents to start using a charcoal-production plant that emits less pollution.</p> \n<p>“The current situation is absurd,” said attorney Gidon Bromberg, the executive director of Friends of the Earth Middle East. “In regulatory terms, it’s the Wild West. It’s a paradise for environmental crime that affects life on both sides of the Green Line. To solve the problem, intense work is required to update the laws and environmental enforcement abilities in the settlements based on Israeli law.”</p> \n<p>Still, Bromberg says such work should not be linked to initiatives to enforce Israel’s laws in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>“We don’t believe that primary legislation should be changed to expand legal authority in environmental matters over the Green Line,” said Yael Yisrael, the founder and director of Green Now. “The intention is that via Defense (Emergency) Regulations, it's possible to use all environmental laws in effect inside the Green Line.”</p> \n<p>Bar-Ilan University’s Environmental Law Clinic and attorney Hila Cohen of Green Now recently completed a study examining environmental laws in the West Bank. They found that according to international law, Israel must enact legislation to protect the public and natural resources there.</p> \n<p>According to the study, this must be done in cooperation with the local Palestinians. The study recommends that the West Bank’s environmental laws be updated according to updates in Israel. If lawmakers oppose this, they must say why.</p> \n<p>Also, the Civil Administration is trying to update and expand the environmental-protection laws in the West Bank. According to Elbaz, Defense (Emergency) Regulations will soon be issued for the Packaging Law to apply in the West Bank. Meanwhile, enforcement powers will be returned to inspectors from the Civil Administration and the Environmental Protection Ministry. The Packaging Law requires Israeli manufacturers and importers to recycle packaging waste.</p> \n<p>There is also a plan to apply the agreement on biogas facilities in the West Bank, which would enable the large-scale recycling of waste.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the latest challenge to Israel’s supreme religious authority, several Orthodox rabbis have begun to perform weddings for converts who are not recognized by the Chief Rabbinate.</p> \n<p>In recent months, Haaretz has learned, these rabbis officiated at three such weddings involving Israelis converted by a new alternative rabbinical court. Their names cannot be published, however, as rabbis who perform weddings not registered with the Chief Rabbinate, under Israeli law, could face jail time.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, it was reported that a prominent group of religious Zionist rabbis had created this new religious court to help facilitate the conversion of Israelis not considered Jewish by halakha, or religious law. According to halakha, only an individual born to a Jewish mother is considered Jewish.</p> \n<p>Circumventing the Chief Rabbinate, which has grown increasingly stringent in its conversion demands, the alternative rabbinical court converted six minors on Monday in a highly publicized ceremony.</p> \n<p>About 20 religious Zionist rabbis are involved in the new initiative, which was launched about a year ago. Until this week, their activities were kept largely under wraps. Since last December, Haaretz has learned, these rabbis have converted close to 50 Israelis, about half of them adults. The converts are mainly Russian-speaking immigrants who were able to obtain citizenship under the Law of Return even though they are not considered Jews by Halakha. To qualify for citizenship under the Law of Return, an individual must have either a Jewish parent, a Jewish grandparent or a Jewish spouse.</p> \n<p>The Israeli Chief Rabbinate has the final say in who is considered a Jew for marriage purposes in the country. Hence, if it decides not to recognize the conversions undertaken by the new rabbinical court, those converted will not be able to marry in Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For that reason, all individuals undergoing these conversions are required to sign a waiver declaring that they are aware their conversions may not be recognized by the Chief Rabbinate, which is the supreme authority on marriage and divorce law in Israel (among Jews). The waiver form notes, however, that the new rabbinical court will do its utmost to ensure that its conversions are ultimately recognized.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Seth Farber, the founder and executive director of ITIM, an organization that advocates on behalf of individuals challenged by Israel’s religious bureaucracy, confirmed that several Orthodox rabbis had begun officiating at weddings of the new converts. “In the context of giyur k’halakha [halakhic conversion] and in order to maximize the halakhic legitimacy of these conversions, there were a small number of weddings that took place following the conversions,” he said. “Our hope is that these weddings will also be recognized by the Chief Rabbinate when it examines the individual situations.”</p> \n<p>He added that in all three cases, the couples had already undergone civil marriages outside of Israel.</p> \n<p>ITIM has been a driving force behind the establishment of the alternative rabbinical court. Farber said that the initiative began to take shape a year ago.</p> \n<p>The conversions on Monday were performed by a rabbinical court headed by Rabbi Nahum Rabinowitz, a prominent religious Zionist rabbi. Other well-known rabbis involved in the initiative are Rabbi Re’em Hacohen, head of the Otniel Yeshiva; Rabbi Ariel Holland from the West Bank settlement of Tekoa; Rabbi Yaakov Medan of the Har Etzion hesder yeshiva; Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of the West Bank settlement of Efrat; and Rabbi David Stav, chief rabbi of Shoham and chairman of Tzohar, an association of progressive-minded Orthodox rabbis.</p> \n<p>As a rule, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate does not convert minors whose mothers have not undergone conversion. In a sharp break with this policy, the heads of the new alternative court have agreed to convert minors even if their mothers are unwilling to go through the process, so long as they commit to raising the children in a religious environment. “That is a major difference here,” noted Farber. “The Chief Rabbinate insists that the father and mother be married, but if the mother is not already converted, she cannot marry here. We don’t require that.”</p>",

        "text":["<p> Thousands of men crowded into the Kehilat Bnei Torah synagogue, with hundreds spilling out into the street, to hear the eulogies for Rabbis Aryeh Kupinsky, Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, and Kalman Levine, three of the four rabbis murdered along with a policeman early Tuesday morning in that same place.</p> \n<p> “We are here, standing in front of these three holy men, the best of our community, Torah scholars whose blood flowed like water,” intoned Rabbi Yitzchak Mordechai Rubin, chief rabbi of the synagogue in Jerusalem’s Har Nof neighborhood.</p> \n<p> Only 10 hours earlier, as dozens of men were reciting their morning prayers, two Palestinian men from East Jerusalem had stormed into the synagogue, armed with a gun, a meat cleaver, and a gun. For long minutes they attacked the worshippers, killing four as well as policeman Zidan Siyif, who fought the attackers, and injured seven other people.</p> \n<p> The funeral for the prominent Rabbi Moshe Twersky had taken place earlier that afternoon. By the time of the funerals – Siyif died in the hospital late last night – signs of the massacre had been wiped away, leaving only the smashed windows as evidence.</p> \n<p> In accordance with Orthodox observance, the women, all dressed modestly in dark clothes, stood on the other side of the broad street, lining the long flights of stairs that connect the streets in this strictly religious neighborhood, built into hills on the outskirts of West Jerusalem. Others stood in a small playground, leaning on swings and slides. Many wept openly, as the rabbi said, his own voice nearly breaking, “When we count the widows and orphans that were added to the Israeli nation this morning, four widows, 24 orphans on one street.”</p> \n<p> As the ceremony ended, the cortege, including at least a dozen buses, moved slowly on to the nearby Har Hamenuchot cemetery, where the men would be buried. Most of the crowd dispersed quietly. Within the half hour, the street was empty and quiet. Men returned to their study halls to continue studying Torah. Women and children returned to their homes.</p> \n<p> Har Nof (in Hebrew, Mountain of Scenery), was established in the early 1980s. It is Jerusalem’s largest modern ultra-Orthodox neighborhood, with a population of some 22,000, a large portion of them immigrants from the United States and France. The wide, hilly streets are filled with synagogues, study houses, yeshivot, ritual baths, girls’ religious schools and other institutions to serve the community.</p> \n<p> Those interviewed emphasized their unwavering belief in God and trust in his will.</p> \n<p> Yerucham, a tall 17-year-old wearing a dark felt hat that distinguishes the sect of Orthodox Judaism to which he belongs, said he had just woken up and was getting ready for prayers when he heard the commotion, and then the gunfire.</p> \n<p> “I ran out and I saw the dead and the wounded – old and young men, wrapped in talitot [prayer shawls] and tfillin [phylacteries],” he said. “It reminded me of the most horrible times in Jewish history, of the Holocaust, of the Jews who throughout the centuries have died for the sanctification of God’s name.”</p> \n<p> “My prayer book is wet with my tears,” said a diminutive teenage girl wearing the long navy blue skirt and light blue buttoned blouse that is the uniform of the network of ultra-Orthodox Beit Yaakov girls’ schools.“They were murdered at the most holy moment of the service, the Amidah [a long collection of 18 prayers, recited silently]. I cry because it is so sad, but I know that this is God’s choice. We cannot know why He called these men to Him at that very moment. It is His will, and it is our role in life to fulfill His commandments.”</p> \n<p> An elderly woman joined the brief conversation. “Our community will take care of the families. Twenty four orphans, grandchildren, wives. The community will provide them with professional counseling, with financial support if they need it, with attention and love.”</p> \n<p> “We live our lives according to God’s commandments,” said an 18-year-old girl also wearing the Beit Ya’akov uniform. “That is why most of us have returned to our regular duties – because our regular day is a way of praising God. In other places when this happens, there are calls for revenge, but not here, not in our neighborhood.” Indeed, not far away, at the western entrance to the city, some right wing extremists were already beginning to demonstrate, calling for revenge. A group of policemen in a small courtyard near the synagogue, were picking up their riot gear and moving on. “They brought us here because usually, after a terror attack, there are extremists and violence. But not here. It’s quiet here, sad and quiet. Let’s just hope it stays that way.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“A Parallel Time,” about the life and writings of Walid Daka, who is serving a life sentence in an Israeli prison for his involvement in the murder of an Israeli soldier, raised a storm last summer. It was removed from the list of Education-Ministry-sanctioned plays and the Culture Ministry considered withdrawing state funding from Haifa’s Al-Midan Theater, which staged it.</p> \n<p>No such uproar greeted Boaz Gaon’s “Returning to Haifa” when it was produced by Tel Aviv’s Cameri Theater in 2008 and again in 2011, with over 80 performances, albeit it did have its detractors. I return to it now because its 2011 run at Theater J in Washington, D.C. (with different casting, directed by Sinai Peter) is the subject of “Return to Haifa: The Other’s Story,” a documentary by David Goldenberg that was shown at the recent Haifa International Film Festival.</p> \n<p>Gaon’s play was an adaptation of the novel by the same name, written by Ghassan Kanafani. A renowned Palestinian cultural figure, scholar and political activist, Kanafani was the spokesman of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.</p> \n<p>Kanafani, together with his 17-year-old niece, was killed by a car bomb in Beirut in July 1972. It is commonly accepted that the Mossad killed him on account of his ties to the PFLP and a recent photograph showing him with one of the Japanese terrorists responsible for the March 1972 massacre at Lod Airport (now Ben-Gurion International Airport).</p> \n<p>While “A Parallel Time” ignores the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to focus on Daka’s personal story, Kanafani’s 1969 novella juxtaposes the gaping wound on each side: the Holocaust, the justification for Israel’s existence; and the Nakba, in which Palestinians fled or were expelled in 1948, which is the basis of their demand for the right of return.</p> \n<p>In Kanafani’s story, a couple living in Ramallah return to Haifa after the 1967 Six-Day War — after the Green Line no longer posed an obstacle but before the settlements, the occupation and all the rest — to visit the home they fled in 1948. In all the confusion of that war, they left behind an infant son.</p> \n<p>In their former home they find two Holocaust survivors, whose own son had died in a concentration camp. They adopted the baby left behind, who is now a paratrooper in the Israeli army.</p> \n<p>Shades of Brecht and King Solomon</p> \n<p>The novella and the play resonate with the Judgment of King Solomon as well as Bertolt Brecht’s “The Caucasian Chalk Circle.” Both sides seize the abandoned Palestinian baby who was raised by the Holocaust survivors to be a soldier and each, in that house in Haifa, claim full ownership over both the land and the person — in the name of both justice and (perhaps chiefly), their suffering.</p> \n<p>That is the main problem that is the focus of the play, the film about its production in Washington and the fierce debate it stirred there and here.</p> \n<p>Playwright Boaz Gaon, who is interviewed in the film, turns our attention to a fact we tend to obscure: Kanafani, who carried the pain of being a refugee (he was born in Acre in 1936; his family fled to Beirut in 1948 and later reached Damascus), is considered the first writer to depict — in a novella intended for Palestinian readers — the story of people who are, to them, “the other”: the story of Holocaust survivors who lovingly raise an abandoned baby and display some empathy for the plight of the Palestinian couple.</p> \n<p>In 2008, Gaon, Peter, Cameri head Noam Semel and artistic director Omri Nitzan saw it as a right, even a duty, to bring to the attention of an Israeli-Jewish theater audience “the other’s story” of Palestinians — most of whom were then and are today human beings in distress, having lost their national and personal assets in 1948, whether they fled or were expelled.</p> \n<p>Goldenberg’s movie doesn’t deal directly with the Israeli production, only with the American one in 2011. This was in essence a transposition of the Cameri production, with Frida Shoham’s sand-toned set, Peter’s direction and Rozina Cambos in one of her greatest and last performances as the Jewish-Israeli mother. (The film is dedicated to her memory — she was nominated for the Helen Hayes Award for the role). Erez Kahana played the complex role of the soldier-son, the emotional focus of the conflict, as he did in Tel Aviv. Other actors were replaced: In Tel Aviv in 2008 the Palestinian couple was played by Norman Issa and Mira Awad. In Washington they were played by Suheil Haddad and Raida Adon, with their scenes played in Arabic. (The Cameri adopted this when it staged the play again in 2011 after its success in Washington.) The Israeli-Jewish father was played by Yossi Kantz in Tel Aviv and Nissim Zohar in Washington.</p> \n<p>Complex issues</p> \n<p>The movie follows the play’s plot. Between the scenes it incorporates interviews with the producers, who are all involved in the production as artists, as politically involved people, as Israelis and Palestinians. They address their complex attitudes to the content of the story, which took center stage in rehearsals and in shaping the performance.</p> \n<p>There are also interviews with people who knew Kanafani, with historians who shed light on the complexity of the issues (there are testimonies of deportations and of flight by Arabs despite requests by Israeli officials that they remain), and with Palestinian and Jewish officials in Washington who relate what this production evoked in them.</p> \n<p>The movie sides with the American producers of the play, and presents well the rationale for the theater’s approach, which deals with emotional-human aspects, confronting viewers with their own emotions with regard to complex issues that have no solution, even if they are explosive.</p> \n<p>The movie does not obscure the complexity of the problem in all its aspects and does not embellish. One can understand, even when disagreeing with, the arguments of opponents of its production.</p> \n<p>The play was staged in Israel in 2008 and in Washington in 2011, to great artistic success. It was chosen one of the 10 best plays in Washington that year and the skies didn’t come crashing down.</p> \n<p>Ironically, Ari Roth, who led J Theater at Washington’s Jewish Community Center starting in 1997, was fired in 2014 — despite protests by prominent figures in the U.S. theater world — apparently, for bringing “voices from a changing Middle East” in which Israel’s representation did not conform to the wishes of the Israeli and the conservative Jewish-American establishments. In the movie, Peter recalls being reprimanded, together with the play’s producers, by Israel’s then-ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren.</p> \n<p>It is doubtful that what was possible and almost self-evident in an Israeli repertory theater in 2008 could exist today.</p> \n<p>After Culture Minister Miri Regev declared her intention to invoke provisions in the budgetary legislation in order to withdraw state funding from institutions that ostensibly violate laws such as the so-called Nakba and boycott law — which did not exist in 2008, and leaving aside the question of whether they can be applied to staged works of fiction — I assume that no director would even consider putting on a play like “Returning to Haifa” today. I also fear somewhat that professional and amateur fomenters of protest would have more success today than in 2008.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, for 40 years there have been times when I was convinced that things are bleak and that freedom of expression is in clear and present danger. These include Hanoch Levin’s “The Queen of the Bathtub” in 1970, or the protests against Brecht’s “Mother Courage and her Children” in 1973, “The Patriot” in 1982, “A Jewish Soul,” “Ghetto,” “The Palestinian” and “Jerusalem Syndrome” in the 1980s. For some reason I think that the ‘90s and the 2000s were “freer,” while today one gets the impression of screws tightening on our muzzles. This is why it’s important to see this movie, which deals with the strength and weakness of theater.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Her cast is out of tune, and Frannie Goldstein is not pleased, to say the least.</p> \n<p>“Stop,” she shouts, standing on a chair to make her point. “I hear way too many notes. You’re not sitting up straight, and that’s why this is happening.”</p> \n<p>They give it another try. “Much, much better,” she says, as she waves her hands in time with the beat. “But let’s stop there while we still sound good.”</p> \n<p>It’s their weekly Tuesday afternoon rehearsal, and these 60 or so students at the Even Yehuda campus of the Walworth Barbour American International School in Israel, ranging in age from 8 to 18, are noticeably excited as they gear up for the big day. On April 2, they will kick off their first of six performances of Brundibar (Czech for “Bumblebee”), the children’s opera staged 55 times at Theresienstadt.</p> \n<p>At least one member of the audience will be able to compare the Israeli rendition with the original.</p> \n<p>Ela Weissberger, a member of the original cast, will be arriving from New York just to attend. The opera, written by the Jewish Czech composer Hans Krasa and librettist Adolf Hoffmeister, premiered in German-occupied Prague in 1938 at a Jewish orphanage. That was several years before the mass transports of Jews to Theresienstadt, the ghetto and “model” concentration camp set up by the Nazis in what is now the Czech Republic to con the world into thinking they were treating the Jews well.</p> \n<p>In 1943 the score was smuggled into Theresienstadt, which the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum describes as “a collection center for deportations to ghettos and killing centers in Nazi-occupied eastern Europe.” There, it was re-orchestrated by Krasa for the various instrumentalists who were available to play at the time. The Nazis arranged a special staging of “Brundibar” for a propaganda film and for the inspection of Theresienstadt by the International Red Cross in September 1944.</p> \n<p>Two weeks later, many of the artists at the camp, including most of the children who performed in the opera, were deported to Auschwitz.</p> \n<p>The opera tells the story of a brother and sister who, together with some animal friends and other village children, defeat an evil organ grinder named Brundibar. “What appealed to me is that it’s a story about the strength of the human spirit,” says Goldstein, who has served as music coordinator at the international school ever since it opened 22 years ago.</p> \n<p>The cast will stage six performances of the opera over three days in early April, as part of a weeklong Theresienstadt project co-sponsored by the embassies of the United States and the Czech Republic, along with Beit Theresienstadt, a memorial center based at Kibbutz Givat Chaim Ichud.</p> \n<p>More than 500 students hailing from 55 countries (many of them children of members of the diplomatic corps in Israel) attend the international school, which goes from prekindergarten through 12th grade and moved to this 19-acre campus near Netanya several years ago. Among the nationalities represented in the Brundibar cast are the United States, England, Ireland, Korea, India, South Africa, Slovenia, Guatemala, Mexico and Hungary, as well as Israel.</p> \n<p>Sayan Turpin-Aviram, a 12th-grader who is half-British and half-Israeli, makes a point of signing up for every performance she can at the school. “But when I read a bit about this one, I just knew it was going to be one of the most unique dramatic experiences I’ve ever had,” she says. For her senior project, Turpin-Aviram is writing a paper about how painful experiences can inspire creativity.</p> \n<p>“I’m definitely going to use this production in my paper,” she says.</p> \n<p>Courtney Mckee, a ninth grader from Ireland who plays the part of a sparrow, calls it a “once-in-a-lifetime” experience. “It makes me feel very connected to the kids who performed in Theresienstadt,” she says.</p> \n<p>In the leading role of Brundibar is Michael Matias, a 12th-grader from Israel, who has family roots in both Poland and Hungary.</p> \n<p>“I’ve always been intrigued by how children experienced the Holocaust,” he says. “For me, being part of this production has been an incredible and very emotional experience.”</p> \n<p>Goldstein, a former New Yorker who now lives in Modi’in, happened upon the opera several years ago, when she ordered a copy of the 2003 picture book based on it: “Brundibar,” by Maurice Sendak, the U.S. writer and illustrator of “Where the Wild Things Are” and other children’s books, and Pulitzer Prize-winning U.S. playwright Tony Kushner.</p> \n<p>“I read the book to the kids here, and there was this tremendous response,” recalls Goldstein, who studied music education at New York University after attending the Orthodox high school Ramaz in Manhattan. “I just knew then that we’d have to get the kids to perform this.”</p> \n<p>She contacted Weissberger, who is 83, and invited her to attend the performance.</p> \n<p>“I was thrilled when she said she’d come,” recounts Goldstein. “And then I met her in August, and we spent a day together in Prague.”</p> \n<p>As part of an effort to turn the performance into a school-wide project, each student here has been asked to prepare 30 handmade butterflies that will be hung at the entrance to the campus on the days of the performances.</p> \n<p>“The idea is that altogether there will be 15,000 butterflies – one for each of the 15,000 children that passed through Theresienstadt,” says Goldstein. This craft-making activity, she notes, was inspired by the poem “Butterfly,” written by Theresienstadt inmate Pavel Friedmann before he was transported to Auschwitz, where he died. “For seven weeks I’ve lived in here, / Penned up inside this ghetto,” the poem reads. “But I have found my people here. ... / Only I never saw another butterfly.”</p> \n<p>The Brundibar project also aims to educate Israelis who may not be so familiar with the historical details of the Holocaust: Students at Na’amat Technical School in Nazareth, a high school for Arab girls. The students will be attending one of the performances and participating in a workshop about Brundibar, to be taught by Goldstein right after the show.</p> \n<p>A Jewish school in the area is also getting involved; Tchernichovsky High School in Netanya will be providing the orchestra. “We thought it was important to involve a Jewish school as well in a project like this,” Goldstein explains.</p> \n<p>As the hour-long rehearsal draws to a close, Goldstein throws out a rather ambitious suggestion to her cast. “Let’s try doing the wave,” she says. After a few false starts, she gives up. “Okay, it’s never gonna work,” she laments. “Who are we kidding?”</p> \n<p>And with that, she bids them farewell until next time. “Don’t forget to memorize all your lines,” she reminds them as they head out the door.</p>",

        "text":["<p>This article was originally published on May 6, 2015.</p> \n<p>Lag Ba'omer is a minor Jewish holiday that traces back not to antiquity, but to the Middle Ages. Marked on the 18th day of the Jewish month of Iyar, the modern festivities include making a bonfire and roasting potatoes, franks, marshmallows and other fire-friendly foods on the flames. Few may realize it, but what we're celebrating is the cessation of a vicious plague that carried off tens of thousands of yeshiva students more than 1,000 years ago – maybe.</p> \n<p>Though the holiday is relatively new, this story starts in biblical times, when Jews were commanded to count the 49 harvest days from Passover to Shavuot. This was called Sefirat Ha'omer (“The counting of the Omer”). Lag Ba'omer is simply the 33rd day of this count, with “Lag” – lamed gimel – being the way Jews write the number 33.</p> \n<p>Back then, the 33rd day of the Omer had no special significance.</p> \n<p>However, since the 9th century, these 49 days became days of mourning over the deaths of the 24,000 students of Rabbi Akiva, who, according to the Talmud (Yevamot 62b), died between Passover and Shavuot of a plague. Thus, during the Omer, traditional Jews observed mourning rituals, which included a ban on shaving, getting haircuts or getting married. (When the Jewish communities in the Rhine Valley were decimated in 1096 and 1146 during the days of the Omer, these slaughters were added to the mourning observance.)</p> \n<p>Back to the plague: In 13th-century Spain, the Talmudist Menachem Meiri wrote in a commentary on the Tractate Yevamot that according to a Gaonic tradition, the plague ended on Lag Ba'omer. That, therefore, was reason to mark the day with a celebration.</p> \n<p>Mystical traditions</p> \n<p>We first hear of celebrations marking that 33rd day of the count in the 15th century, in the writings of the important German rabbi Yaakov ben Moshe Levi Moelin, though it is not exactly clear in what way the day was marked.</p> \n<p>In the 16th century, Rabbi Isaac Luria (“Ha'Ari”) decided that Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai, who according to (a false) tradition wrote the Kabbalistic book the Zohar, died on Lag Ba'omer, and on his deathbed he revealed to his disciples mystical traditions. From that time, Lag Ba'omer has been marked specially at Mount Meron, where bar Yochai is believed to be buried.</p> \n<p>The Meronite celebration includes giving 3-year-old boys their first haircuts, lighting bonfires, singing and dancing.</p> \n<p>Why the bonfire? It isn't about cooking; it's that fire symbolizes the light that is wisdom, spread by the great rabbi bar Yochai.</p> \n<p>Children were and still are given bows and arrows to play with. This is likely due to influence of non-Jewish neighbors, but is explained by a midrash, which claims that, during the lifetime of Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai, no rainbows appeared. Thus, since the Hebrew word for rainbow and bow are one and the same – keshet – playing with bow and arrows is seen as a way of celebrating the life of the great sage.</p> \n<p>This Meronite mode of celebrating Lag Ba'omer slowly spread from Safed to the rest of the Holy Land during the 17th century. In the 18th century it began to be practiced among Sephardi communities and later that century among Hasidic Jews in Eastern Europe. At some stage, Lag Ba'omer began to be celebrated as “Scholars’ Day,” with Jewish students getting the day off and going hiking and the like.</p> \n<p>The Zionist reinterpretation </p> \n<p>In the 19th century, Nachman Krochmal and other Jewish scholars began to hypothesize that the Talmudic verse concerning the death of the 24,000 students of Rabbi Akiva was a veiled reference to their death in battle, as part of the Bar Kochba revolt against the Romans (132–136 CE) and not a mysterious plague. An explanation that is not too dubious considering the fact that Rabbi Akiva and Bar Kochba were contemporaries and that the former supported the latter. This interpretation was adopted by the Zionist movement in the 20th century.</p> \n<p>The old religious rituals were reinterpreted to have secular historic meanings: Lag Ba'omer was celebrated because on that day Bar Kochba achieved a victory over the Romans, bonfires were lit because that is how this victory was signaled throughout the land, bow and arrows were used because that was one of the weapons Bar Kochba’s forces used to fight the Romans, and so on.</p> \n<p>Thus, in our times the holiday is celebrated in three distinct ways: Secular Jewish children hold bonfires supposedly celebrating Bar Kochba; religious Jews celebrate the life of Simeon bar Yochai, in a great celebration drawing hundreds of thousands atop Mount Meron, but also in lesser celebrations elsewhere in Israel and abroad; and thirdly, Israeli universities took the old tradition of Lag Ba'omer as “Scholars' Day,” creating student day celebrations on campuses.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The scientific establishment has found a cheap, efficient way to gather information about biological diversity and monitor the status of various life forms − the general public.</p> \n<p>Until a few years ago, scientists engaged in protecting nature didn’t view the general public as a resource capable of assisting their research; the most they hoped for from the public was that people would study their findings and internalize the message of preserving biological diversity. But in recent years, the general public has increasingly been helping researchers to collect and analyze data, an endeavor known as Citizen Science.</p> \n<p>Last week, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem announced a new program under which nature lovers will be invited to participate in identifying and defining new species of insects. Anyone who wants to can bring any insect he finds to the university’s national arachnological collection for study, and can even help determine its species. This program will enable scientists to monitor the status of various known species, and perhaps even to identify previously unknown ones.</p> \n<p>Recognition of the growing importance of public involvement in scientific research also resulted in a conference devoted to this issue. The conference, held at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya two months ago, was sponsored by HaMaarag, Israel’s National Ecosystem Assessment Program.</p> \n<p>In truth, ordinary citizens have long been helping scientists in Israel. A prime example is the participation of amateur birdwatchers in surveys and observations that have provided a wealth of information about Israel’s various bird species and how they are faring. This is the field in which scientists around the world have been cooperating with the public the longest − ever since America’s National Audubon Society launched its annual bird survey 110 years ago.</p> \n<p>Another prime example of such cooperation in Israel is the work of Agudat Hovevei Haparparim, the association of butterfly lovers. This group has played a key role in battles to protect open areas inhabited by rare species of butterflies. In one case, a construction plan near Hadera was even altered to protect such a species.</p> \n<p>Fisherman, yachtsmen and recreational boaters have given scientists numerous reports in recent years about jellyfish movements and the presence of marine mammals off Israel’s coastline. Inter alia, the first sightings of a gray whale and a monk seal near Israel’s shores were reported to the Israel Marine Mammal Research &amp; Assistance Center by volunteers.</p> \n<p>A program to fight invasive species launched by the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel two years ago has collected hundreds of reports of such species from the public. These reports were then analyzed by scientists to determine how each case should be dealt with. A great deal of information about various species of bats and reptiles has also been collected from the public in recent years via the Min Hasadeh website (http://wildisrael.com/drupal2/), which serves as a collaborative database on these species. The website’s information is supplemented by observations carried out by inspectors from the Israel Parks and Nature Authority.</p> \n<p>A survey of scientific involvement by the general public that was published less than a year ago in the journal “Biological Conservation” found that monitoring bird species continues to be the most common form of involvement by non-scientists. Birdwatchers participate in creating maps and atlases that show where different species of birds are found; in conducting nesting surveys that enable scientists to monitor the stability of a given species’ population in a particular area, and thereby determine whether that species is in danger of extinction; and in conducting counts of birds found around their own homes. The latter activity has been particularly successful in Britain and the United States, where every year, some 15,000 people report on the different kinds of species that visit their feeders.</p> \n<p>Israel also conducts counts of birds that visit home feeders, under the auspices of the Israeli Center for Yardbirds, founded by Shlomit Lifshitz and Doron Lahav. In this year’s count, the organization received more than 900 reports, which provide information about the situation of various bird species and the impact of invasive species.</p> \n<p>The accuracy and quality of information that comes from the public isn’t uniform. But researchers who have examined the information provided by birdwatchers are convinced that birders make a significant contribution to scientific research and protecting nature. Reports submitted by volunteers about various species also help compensate for the chronic shortage of funding for scientific research into these species’ situations.</p> \n<p>The scientific journal PLOS ONE recently published a paper that examined the accuracy of information about shark populations around the Pacific Ocean island of Palau that were monitored by more than 20 diving instructors over a period of five years. Australian researchers compared the data reported by these instructors, who received training from scientists, to the information obtained by attaching electronic transmitters to sharks − the standard scientific method, which is considered accurate and credible.</p> \n<p>The study found a high correlation between these two types of monitoring. Moreover, the diving instructors’ reports helped scientists determine that there is a strong connection between ocean temperatures and the strength of ocean currents, on one hand, and the frequency of shark sightings at various locations along the island’s coast, on the other. These instructors, who make a living by guiding tourists who want to see the sharks, have thereby helped to ensure the animals’ future.</p>",

        "text":["<p>At 7:30 A.M., dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei was sitting at a modest breakfast in the dining room of an East Jerusalem hotel, ready for filming another day’s journey on the lives of refugees. He arrived in Israel on Sunday evening May 8 on what was supposed to be a discreet visit – at least as discreet as an 11-person crew can be when every minute of their doings is filmed and uploaded to Instagram.</p> \n<p>Ai is one of the best-known and most controversial artists in the world, and his fame long spread well beyond the art world. He cultivates and enjoys this celebrity, so his visit was guaranteed not to pass quietly.</p> \n<p>This was Ai’s first visit to Israel, though he says he knows many Israelis from when he lived in the United States from 1981 to 1993. He came to film for a documentary on refugees around the world, an issue that has troubled him in recent years.</p> \n<p>Israeli company Highlight Films, which was hired to organize his trip to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, was initially unable to secure Ai a permit to enter the Strip. The army said the company had submitted its entry request on very short notice, and just before the Independence Day holiday. In any case, Ai received a permit to enter Gaza the next day.</p> \n<p>Ai publicized the delay; this may have been what got him into Gaza so quickly. The following Tuesday afternoon he entered the enclave through the Erez crossing to film through Friday. When Ai returned from the Strip, the NGO Breaking the Silence gave him a tour of Hebron and the South Hebron Hills. Before his flight out Saturday, he visited the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and met with the museum’s director, James Snyder.</p> \n<p>Ai spoke with Haaretz the morning before he went to Gaza. He was surprised by the speed with which he got the entry permit. In any case, he says he was always curious about Israel and the Palestinian territories.</p> \n<p>“I can see I am quite ignorant about this area; I know very little,” he says. “But this is a land of the earliest civilization and of a very colorful history of conflicts that have been continuous.</p> \n<p>Still, the refugees were the main reason for coming here. He and his team visited more than 20 refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. They interviewed not only refugees but also politicians, activists, doctors and priests – over 100 people.</p> \n<p>“And we are making a documentary film on the situation of refugees in Jordan and in Lebanon, [where] there are major camps from Palestine, and so this once again brought attention to this land, to this people,” he says.</p> \n<p>“As a director, as a documentary maker, I have no excuse not to come. Of course I have a strong curiosity about Israel, about the culture, about Palestine, this whole land.”</p> \n<p>Ai intended to come to Israel earlier and was supposed to show an exhibit alongside the work of photographer Miki Kratsman at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. The event was delayed a number of times and finally canceled.</p> \n<p>Kratsman said in February he suspected the cancelation stemmed from reservations in the museum’s board and management about pictures of Palestinians he planned to show. The museum strongly denied this and said it was strictly a problem of budgeting and scheduling.</p> \n<p>Either way, it’s a shame. Ai’s most recent exhibition at London's Royal Academy of Arts was described as 2015’s most popular art exhibition at art institutions that charge an entrance fee. Some 373,000 people showed up.</p> \n<p>So they said the cancellation wasn’t political. Do you believe that?</p> \n<p>“It depends what is meant by political .... I have no proof whether it is political or not. I think that from Miki’s point of view it is political; I didn’t have much [to say] about it.</p> \n<p>&quot;But I think that’s the only show among the 400 shows that I have done so far – the only show canceled by the museum,” he says, adding that the museum is once again eager to help with an exhibition.</p> \n<p>Was it difficult for you to consider exhibiting in Israel? Many artists don’t want to come here.</p> \n<p>“Well, it’s hard to answer really, I don’t know. They invited me, I accepted. Of course there are a lot of questions, arguments, but I still don’t know. First it depends on what you are showing. If you really have a message, I think it’s fine to show anywhere, because you’re an artist, you express through your work and every opportunity is a chance for you to express yourself.”</p> \n<p>In addition, he says, “this documentary could be an opportunity to fulfill my curiosity about not only here, about the whole area. It is the first time I have traveled to Turkey and other nations like Lebanon. So I have seen a lot.”</p> \n<p>All around Gaza</p> \n<p>Typical for Ai, from the moment he set foot in Israel he didn’t stop filming everything he saw and the people he met. He uploaded the pictures to Instagram so his visit could be followed on the fly.</p> \n<p>On the second day he met with MK Ayman Odeh, the chairman of the Joint Arab List, and Hagai Elad, the head of the B’Tselem rights group. He also visited two refugee camps in the West Bank near Bethlehem&nbsp;– Dheisheh and Aida.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday at 5 A.M. he uploaded to Instagram a picture of the sky at sunrise as seen from his hotel window. Later he met with Hanan Ashrawi in Ramallah and posted a picture of them on Instagram. He went to Gaza and visited the fish market and beach. He photographed young women near an UNRWA school and Hamas activists, not to mention animals at the Gaza zoo that had died of starvation.</p> \n<p>Ai says he wanted to meet Israeli politicians and officials, not just Palestinians and human rights activists, but there was no cooperation.</p> \n<p>“Of course we try to meet everybody. We had made requests to government officials; we made a lot of contact – but no answer,” he says.</p> \n<p>“I was kind of surprised because this film is for anybody to speak about anything and I was filled with regret because the view may be not balanced because I only heard from basically one side – Palestinians. They want to talk, but the Israelis don’t want to talk.</p> \n<p>“But maybe not wanting to talk is also a point of view; it is also a position, a conscious position . I very specially asked that we have to interview officials, politicians from the Israeli side, but maybe I’m kind of naive, I don’t know.</p> \n<p>I would say they are not even aware of the importance this film might have. It's probably more out of ignorance or neglect than a real decision that they don’t want to do it. And maybe arrogance.</p> \n<p>Maybe they thought “it’s a small thing, it’s just a film. It’s just artists making a film, it’s nothing big. From my side, I still need to be more accomplished,” he says with a laugh.</p> \n<p>At the end of the interview, Ai’s assistants come to tell him that MK Stav Shaffir (Zionist Union) is interested in meeting him, so at least someone on the Israeli side has woken up. But that meeting never came off.</p> \n<p>Ai’s film is not intended for museums; it’s a full-length documentary meant to be shown to the general public in movie theaters. Over 50 people are producing it, divided into eight teams that have been filming for months in various locations.</p> \n<p>The film is an attempt to give as broad a perspective as possible on what it is to be a refugee, Ai says. That’s why he didn’t just film Syrian refugees and the camps in Jordan and Lebanon, but also came to the Palestinian territories.</p> \n<p>“So we also plan to go to Africa, Asia. We have refugees in China also. I think Tibetans, they’re being pushed out, or by choice, I mean a long time ago in the 1950s, they went to India and still even today most Tibetans cannot get a passport to leave. I think if you’re being held somewhere, stuck somewhere and your condition is against your will, I think you’re a refugee. So that’s my understanding,” Ai says.</p> \n<p>“So my project, or my involvement, or rather my curiosity always brings me into difficult areas and I don’t want to make a judgment, but I always have to put myself into those kinds of conditions.”</p> \n<p>The conditions of the Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank are better than those in most refugee camps he has seen elsewhere.</p> \n<p>“If I can make a comparison, from my very limited contact, camps here are better than most camp conditions. The camps have been established in different locations; here it seems they still have a strong community here, but of course it’s under occupation, and of course the people here are very, very desperate,” he says.</p> \n<p>“I think I can sense it; this is a very strong feeling – the feeling is very clear and strong. There is this very high wall dividing; I mean so [symbolically]. I mean a nine meters high wall, almost three times as high as the Berlin wall; very symbolic.</p> \n<p>“Some young boys told me they grew up in there, they have no rights for travel, and they don’t know what’s on the other side. It is like modern mythology; it’s hard to imagine generations growing up like this.</p> \n<p>“But it is a reality. On the other side of the wall there is no more war, it’s like anywhere, it’s like Santa Fe or like Miami. Everything is super-civilized and comfortable. I think it’s very hard for both sides of the wall to exist in such a condition. But, of course, I can also realize that both sides take it as a normal condition.”</p> \n<p>They do? Because they’ve gotten used to it?</p> \n<p>“Yes .... This is understandable.” Ai says it’s as if someone tied your leg to a chair and you started to walk. After a while you’d feel as if the chair were part of your leg. The situation is possible because you have to walk and you still can.</p> \n<p>“So it’s just a little bit funny, you know,” he says. “And other people look at it very funny. If anybody came here or if anybody knows about it, they would say ‘what is that?’”</p> \n<p>What’s your impression so far from what you’ve seen here, from the meetings you’ve had?</p> \n<p>“I have been here for four days. This morning I opened my door; the sky is so beautiful, the landscape is so beautiful. I had no chance to go to the shore; I think the people here are very contemporary.”</p> \n<p>Making a living from gambling</p> \n<p>Ai was born in Beijing in 1957. His father was the Chinese poet Ai Qing. When he was 1 his family was sent to a labor camp and then to 16 years of exile in Xinjiang in 1961. This came after his father was denounced by the Communist Party during the Cultural Revolution for the family’s opposition to collectivism and support for capitalism. After Mao Zedong’s death and the end of the Cultural Revolution, they were allowed to return to Beijing in 1976.</p> \n<p>In 1978, Ai began studying animation at the Beijing Film Academy. In 1981 he went to New York and studied briefly at the Parsons School of Design, but he left and supported himself by drawing portraits of tourists and doing odd jobs.</p> \n<p>He began creating conceptual art from ready-made objects and later started with photography. He also played blackjack professionally and often visited Atlantic City casinos. Gambling became his main source of income.</p> \n<p>In 1993, after his father fell ill, Ai returned to China to be part of the capital’s contemporary art scene. In 1999 he built his own studio in Beijing, his first architectural project. In 2003 he and his wife, the artist Lu Qing, founded an architecture and design firm.</p> \n<p>In the early 2000s, he worked with the Swiss architecture firm Herzog &amp; de Meuron&nbsp;in planning Beijing National Stadium, also known as the Bird’s Nest, which was built for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. After that his relations with the Chinese authorities soured.</p> \n<p>You said you always try to put yourself in the place of the people you meet. Is that why you started doing art in the first place?</p> \n<p>“No. The motivation for me doing art is the opposite of what I’m doing today. I tried to escape in China. I grew up in a very political society, so I said okay, if I’m doing art I can be learning something which is different, and I can have another point of view which is different from political restrictions.</p> \n<p>“So I was trying to escape the political situation, but very ironically, I later became a political artist – as people called me. I don’t really want to accept that name. I think it’s too long – political artist. Artist is already too long. Now they call artists activists; you know it’s too long.</p> \n<p>“I also think all art is political because all art is about the definition of esthetics and moral conditions, so it’s political anyhow.”</p> \n<p>You said you started doing art as a way to escape reality, so what brought you back to reality? Today you’re dealing with reality in a very intense way.</p> \n<p>“I think two things. First, you recognize that you can help. Everything happened when I started to use the internet. Before, I used to be an architect and an artist and I wasn’t very interested in either. But I was very successful. As soon as I got on the internet I realized that I can easily give out my opinions and start to write.</p> \n<p>“I love writing; My father is a writer so I was always jealous about it. I wanted to see if I can write. I think everybody can write; it takes some time to get into that part of you, to own that feeling. It is a difficult task, but also it’s like the first time you use chopsticks; it’s difficult.”</p> \n<p>Ai gradually became famous on the internet.</p> \n<p>“I had a lot of people talking, following, and I started to do a lot of online activity, which scared the authorities. But I think I can help out young people, just give out my opinions daily,” he says.</p> \n<p>“I became one of the most popular bloggers in China before they shut my blog. So then I got involved in the judicial system to fight, and the more you fight the more you get into this kind of position, so I’m still struggling.”</p> \n<p>In conflict with his homeland</p> \n<p>In May 2009 the Chinese authorities closed Ai’s blog after he harshly criticized the regime. In April 2011 he was arrested on tax fraud allegations at the Beijing airport when he was about to fly to Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>Ai was in prison for 81 days, during which support for him sparked a diplomatic crisis. The United States and European Union filed protests with China, while artists all over the world held protest marches and rallies, and international museums launched petitions and signed up more than 90,000 people.</p> \n<p>That year, the magazine Art Review crowned Ai the most influential artist in the world. He was released after almost three months, but was forbidden to leave China and his passport was confiscated – the authorities said he was also suspected of bigamy and distributing pornography. In July 2015 he got his passport back and left China, where he still has family.</p> \n<p>Can you go to China today; are you allowed to visit?</p> \n<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p> \n<p>Do you miss China?</p> \n<p>“I don’t miss it that much actually. I try to keep myself very occupied, not to have so much sentimental feelings.”</p> \n<p>Is there a place you feel is your home today?</p> \n<p>“I have got used to hotels more and more.”</p> \n<p>Do you miss the sense of home?</p> \n<p>“I miss the sense of quietness or being alone. This I miss. But I have never had a sense of home in my life. Now I have a son and a girlfriend and we’re living together. I tried to pace it. It was a lot.”</p> \n<p>Ai now lives in Berlin; his son in 7.</p> \n<p>Will you take him to China at some point?</p> \n<p>“I decided not to because it was dangerous for him. We are followed, we are being pushed and we have been tagged and all those kind of things. So I said okay, if my life is dangerous, it’s not fair to put you here. You should be in a safe place.”</p> \n<p>Ai’s son and girlfriend left China before he got his passport back. “I said now I should bring you back to see your grandmother and he said, ‘no, I won’t go, this is not a place I want to go.’”</p> \n<p>No private life</p> \n<p>A few months ago, Ai caused an uproar when he was photographed lying face down on the shore of the Greek island Lesbos. The pose mimicked the famous picture of the Syrian refugee child Aylan Kurdi, who drowned after he fell out of a boat packed with refugees being smuggled from Turkey to Greece.</p> \n<p>Ai was accused of cynically using the tragedy. He says the picture was made as part of an interview with an Indian newspaper but was immediately considered one of his own works.</p> \n<p>As to the anger about the photo, Ai says: “I imagine people get angry when the work touches what they protect, their line, and their conditions. I’m not defending the work but I think only that kind of feeling makes that work valid. Any work, if it doesn’t receive some negative attention or feeling, I don’t think it’s a valid work.</p> \n<p>“Art is about new definition. I don’t think a human has an excuse for not breaching a certain area .... I can view form as a Jesus or as a beggar or as a dead body or whatever. You know, this is totally in the realm of freedom of speech, the realm of expression.</p> \n<p>“It all depends on what kind of message you’re carrying. To set up myself in the same condition is to try to reach a kind of consciousness every day that there are two children who drown in this ocean. It’s never just one child. Don’t try to become naive. Not only one child was drowning every day. Two children were drowning in this migrant situation. People pretend they don’t know it.”</p> \n<p>But why did you say you’re not defending the work?</p> \n<p>“The work isn’t my work. It really comes from a magazine, you put in a camera presence, they make a story, they want to take some photos, I said okay. I respond to their requirements.”</p> \n<p>So it wasn’t something you initiated?</p> \n<p>“No .... I think it should partly be my work because I acted on it, but they said no, it’s not your work. It’s an Indian magazine and I don’t know, Indians maybe have very different rules about those things, but we can’t accept it because if it’s my work or not my work, it becomes my work, because the argument is proving why I’m doing that.</p> \n<p>“Of course, all the newspapers don’t understand it or don’t know it. People are very superficial with these kinds of things, they don’t want to go to another level, but they always could go to another level .... There can be different meanings.”</p> \n<p>Do you feel comfortable with today’s money-oriented art world?</p> \n<p>“I don’t pay much attention. I am always very surprised – do you know this artist, do you know this show – and I don’t really know. But I do have a few friends in the art world. I think I can easily say that the art world has become as it is today because of two things. One is that in contemporary life we definitely need art.”</p> \n<p>Why?</p> \n<p>“Well, art today replaces philosophy; it directly reflects our feelings and our understanding of who we are and how we want to show the world. It shows our relationships, and even those positions are always in question. That makes art become more important to release those tensions, but at the same time art has become very, very commercial.</p> \n<p>“Any kind of mythology, any type of symbolic needs a very big price to support it and to free this kind of feeling. For museums, collectors and people think ‘oh so unique so special,’ which is not really true. Most works we see in museums a child can do it, but it’s just very different reasons so they very much appreciate this kind of symbolic gesture.</p> \n<p>“It’s like someone saying I just drew a line without anything else, which makes some statement in the humans’ struggle since a very early time. The caveman for instance used rock, made a line on the cliff, or put some color on it.”</p> \n<p>People would say that today, art for itself has no meaning, it’s only </p> \n<p>“I don’t think it has no meaning, I think it does have meaning .... I mean if you see all of the money, art has become too expensive, then that’s just numbers. Of course it’s not related to daily struggle.</p> \n<p>“But if you talk to people who buy art they will not think it’s expensive because their logic of money or numbers is very different from the everyday struggle. It’s an empty work. Everything is defined by how much it’s worth, who wants it, and that touches on very essential questions about value, judgment of value, real or fake, unique.</p> \n<p>“All those things relate to human nature. So if we argue about those things, there’s a very big pattern. A big pattern. It’s like why these actors are so expensive, why this sportsman is so expensive. It’s about the same kind of argument, I think; it doesn’t make that much sense but that’s part of reality.”</p> \n<p>And as a successful artist it’s something that allows you to do this refugee project. Who’s financing it?</p> \n<p>“Yes, it allows me to do many things which would be impossible to think about, such as the refugee situation. We have been spending a lot a lot of effort, resources and money on it – which is what we want to do.”</p> \n<p>But for you it’s like two sides of the same thing? You’re part of the market and part of the </p> \n<p>“It’s not the same thing. The market is always questionable; it’s not the same thing. It’s always questionable. But of course you can say, okay, I don’t like that, I don’t need money, I can donate my work to anybody, they would not even accept it. Even with my name in many museums, they will cancel it, right? Not many, just one.”</p> \n<p>Ai says this with a laugh. He’s hinting at the canceled show in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>“Yesterday I was thinking, if I was not [famous] today, I’m not going to be able to get into Gaza; you wouldn’t be talking to me.”</p> \n<p>Maybe I would, but probably not in Gaza.</p> \n<p>“Yes, maybe you don’t know, maybe we would spend the evening together, but not this kind of conversation. So we are living a strange world I think. And also if I did not get into trouble with the Chinese authorities, and they did not keep me in detention, the world would be very different.”</p> \n<p>A lot of art critics don’t like your work. Does that bother you?</p> \n<p>“I don’t know. I don’t really think they’re serious enough to be really paid attention to. I don’t think that today we have any very, very serious art critics out there. Most people are entertaining and their opinion comes too easily and it never goes to a deeper level.</p> \n<p>“Why bother even to pay attention or to argue, you know. I always like to have a serious discussion, but it’s not there. Even if you talk, let’s say for one or two hours, you don’t reach anywhere, it’s just very superficial. It seems people have no time to really be ready for conversation.”</p> \n<p>Are there any artists that you appreciate today?</p> \n<p>“Yes, myself. Every day I appreciate myself. I wake up, I feel like I follow my instinct into conditions. It may hurt me or it may bring me to a very strange area, but I like that. I think that’s why I’m an artist.”</p> \n<p>What do you think will be your next project after the refugees?</p> \n<p>“I don’t really know, maybe I will become a refugee after the project. It’s very possible.”</p> \n<p>Do you wish to change something about this situation?</p> \n<p>“I wish to change myself really.”</p> \n<p>How?</p> \n<p>“Well, I will learn and become exposed to so many emotions and I talk to so many people, so I share their feelings. So many people refuse me so I cannot get into their world.”</p> \n<p>But you’ve gotten to a point where you have no personal life anymore, so you only deal with other people all the time.</p> \n<p>“Andy Warhol once said he wanted to be a machine.”</p> \n<p>A machine?</p> \n<p>“Yes, I understand that.”</p> \n<p>How do you understand that?</p> \n<p>“I think my personal life may be what I think the other people’s life is about. I will never think I have a personal life. I don’t know, maybe Jesus had a personal life? .or, I don’t know, Mohammed or [Buddha]? ... Do they have a personal life? I think they don’t have a personal life.”</p> \n<p>But real people have personal lives.</p> \n<p>“So I’m not a real person .... I don’t have much personal life. My assistant knows how much personal life I have.”</p> \n<p>Does he have a personal life?</p> \n<p>“Not much,” says Ai’s assistant.</p> \n<p>Ai says: “Today we are going to visit the zoo. The zoo has hungry animals there. That’s my personal life. In Gaza they have hungry animals or dead animals there. I think it very much will become a personal life.</p> \n<p>“It is very hard to understand. I think it will be all what we see, what we experience, that’s our life. Of course if you don’t see anything, you don’t experience anything, maybe you have a better personal life. But once you see it, it has become part of you; you can never get rid of it. We all know that.”</p> \n<p>Now you’re going to Gaza and you’re going to see things that will probably be very difficult from a human point of view. It’s a hard place you’re dealing with.</p> \n<p>“Have you been to Gaza?”</p> \n<p>No, but I imagine that it’s horrible.</p> \n<p>“I don’t really know. I think many places we think are horrible; when we are there it is not so horrible because we are all humans. We all have little need. A child would run and say, ‘Oh, what kind of camera is that? How does that work?’ .... Or if you offer a candy she will say: ‘Oh, I don’t want that.’ Even if she’s hungry she will say ‘I don’t want that.’</p> \n<p>“There you sense what kind of parents, education she has. Those things are very touching to me. I think I understand those things better than I understand myself. I understand why I pay attention to that.</p> \n<p>“People say it’s dangerous. I don’t think it’s dangerous, I think the only danger in life is when we shut ourselves off. We start not to look at the others. There is no other danger.”</p> \n<p>It seems Ai’s optimistic viewpoint was a bit dimmed after returning from Gaza. Kratsman met with him a few hours before he left the region and the two went to the Qalandiyah crossing between northern Jerusalem and the West Bank.</p> \n<p>As Kratsman put it, “He was particularly affected by the visit to Hebron, where he saw settlers who shouted at him and his crew. He told me that in Hebron he managed to identify the DNA of the entire conflict. He came back shocked from the way we relate to the Palestinians, and Gaza he described as a horror.”</p> \n<p>This interview has been edited and condensed.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Folkert Wijmenga, 61, and Ina Wijmenga, 60; live in Toldijk, Holland; flying to Amsterdam</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask how you spent your time in Israel?</p> \n<p>Folkert: Sure. We are volunteer tour guides. We were actually supposed to be in Nepal now, but because of the earthquake, no one wanted to go and the trip was canceled. We’d already scheduled the time and we needed a vacation.</p> \n<p>Ina: We traveled with good friends, who have been here 11 times; we saw all the biblical sites. We are Christians and our friends are clergymen, so it was nice to travel with them – they told us stories along the way. After two weeks, we went to Jordan.</p> \n<p>Folkert: That’s the 53rd country she’s visited. We were in Aqaba, Wadi Rum, Petra. We slept in an organized campsite in the desert, with food and a tent.</p> \n<p>So you were backpacking?</p> \n<p>Folkert: We like to travel, to sleep in hostels, to meet other backpackers. We’re usually the oldest. But why not?</p> \n<p>Ina: We had a harrowing experience in Jordan. We met a brother and sister from Germany, traveled with them to Wadi Rum and told them we’d wanted to go to Nepal. They said they lost their sister in the Nepal earthquake. It took them two months to find her body. We asked them if it wasn’t hard for them to go on trips now, and how their parents were taking it. They said that everyone understands rationally that it’s important not to stop living.</p> \n<p>Did you start traveling at an early age?</p> \n<p>Folkert: We didn’t have the money when we were young; at most we went on short camping vacations. Around 1989 we started to volunteer at construction projects, and guided groups of young people. We helped build schools and hospitals in Africa, India, Ecuador and Bolivia. We worked in Uganda for six years – all through an organization called World Servants. After many years, we said now it was time for sightseeing.</p> \n<p>Ina: And then we started to work as tour guides. We don’t pay for the trip, but we also don’t get paid. It’s in addition to our regular jobs.</p> \n<p>What do you do?</p> \n<p>Ina: We work only three days a week. I am a quality manager in a hospital for the elderly, and Folkert works in computers, in IT.</p> \n<p>Folkert: We like to work, but not too much.</p> \n<p>Can you enjoy a trip when you’re guiding?</p> \n<p>Folkert: We enjoy taking care of the group. When people are happy we are happy. You don’t have to worry, I’ll worry for you. Though there have been moments...</p> \n<p>Such as?</p> \n<p>Folkert: In 1979, we were in Ecuador with a group of 35 people. We went out for a one-hour hike in the jungle with a local guide, and two hours later I said to him, “What’s happening? When do we get to the bus?” He replied, “I have no idea. I’ve never been here before.” There were no mobile phones then, or GPS.</p> \n<p>So what did you do?</p> \n<p>Folkert: We just decided to go where we thought it was logical to go. We went on for seven hours, without food, and it started to get dark. Fortunately, the group was young and they saw it as an adventure.</p> \n<p>Do you know already what your next vacation will be?</p> \n<p>Folkert: We don’t usually plan, but we want to go on a family holiday in the Canary Islands with the children to mark our 40th wedding anniversary.</p> \n<p>Ina: Israel was actually a trip to mark my 60th birthday. We celebrated opposite the illuminated fountains in Eilat.</p> \n<p>Congratulations! Have you drawn any conclusions?</p> \n<p>Ina: I looked back and thought about what I have done this year. I’ve already been to Argentina, Chile, Tunisia, China, Mongolia, Russia and Israel – just this year.</p> \n<p>Is that enough?</p> \n<p>Ina: Never.</p> \n<p>Folkert: We paid a surprise visit to the hospital we built in Bolivia, and we were told that before, only 10 percent of the local children were vaccinated, but now it’s 75 percent. The villagers saw that we came all the way from Holland for them. For us to come to Bolivia is a long way, but for the people there, for someone to come from Holland is like coming from the moon. They told us, “If you came all that way, it must be important.” Our son is now building a school in Bolivia in exactly the same place.</p> \n<p>Ina: If you want to improve the world, you will always be disappointed, but you can improve life.</p> \n<p>Eitan Cohen, 60, and Betti Cohen Kowalski, 47; live on Kibbutz Harel; Eitan is arriving from New York</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask where you were?</p> \n<p>Eitan: I was on a trip to America.</p> \n<p>Betti: I let him go in honor of his 60th birthday.</p> \n<p>Eitan: I went with my son and visited my daughter, who lives there, and my sister in New Jersey. I was in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and New Orleans. I went to all kinds of places and heard music all over.</p> \n<p>Betti: I suggested the trip. I asked his daughter and it worked out, and then I went on a 10-day Vipassana retreat. In the meantime, they were so enthusiastic and arranged everything, and decided that it would be a three-week trip. When I got back I said, “This isn’t exactly what I had in mind, but I’ll get by.”</p> \n<p>And how did you manage?</p> \n<p>Eitan: She didn’t – she’ll give me a thrashing at home now. [They both laugh]</p> \n<p>Didn’t you talk while he was there?</p> \n<p>Eitan: Of course, on WhatsApp.</p> \n<p>Betti: But only once every few days. &nbsp; Eitan: I don’t like going on short trips. I like to stay, to get involved.</p> \n<p>I see you have instruments here – did you play, too?</p> \n<p>Eitan: This is a saxophone, and there’s also a trumpet that I bought – I found it in a furniture store – for $100. I tried to play, but it was a lost cause. Especially in New York, where there are a lot of excellent Israeli jazz musicians. In New Orleans, there was live music at the airport, so I joined them. That was funny.</p> \n<p>Are you a musician?</p> \n<p>Eitan: I am a gardener by profession and a musician by frustration. On the one hand, of course, you want to accomplish things, but on the other hand, a musician’s life isn’t easy.</p> \n<p>So the choices about visits to the cities were made according to the music?</p> \n<p>Betti: And the children. They needed to show him where they grew up.</p> \n<p>Eitan: They were born on a kibbutz and grew up in Philadelphia. My son lived his adult life in Manhattan, and now he’s here. My daughter stayed there; she’s a banker.</p> \n<p>You seem to miss it.</p> \n<p>Eitan: Her being there is hard for me, but everyone has to do what’s appropriate for him.</p> \n<p>What was the highlight of the trip?</p> \n<p>Eitan: New Orleans. I could have stayed there. An absolutely crazy place. There’s live street music everywhere, especially rock, and guys playing wind instruments outside as part of an old-time tradition. Punks with trombones and trumpets. America’s stuck on the blues, and that’s nice, too. I also had to go into a church at least one time, to hear gospel. It was terrific. There was a real show there, musicians and saxophones, a chorus and soul singers, all professional and all in a church. I also got to hear the Philharmonic in New York. That was an unplanned experience and it was something special. It’s not something I do generally, classical music, but we were in a hall in Lincoln Center and the sound was absolutely amazing. They played Mozart, and Beethoven’s Fifth.</p> \n<p>How would you sum up your 60th birthday?</p> \n<p>Eitan: All in all, it’s a good life.</p> \n<p>What did you do on the day itself?</p> \n<p>Eitan: It was lovely. We celebrated at the Sacred Music Festival at the Tower of David in Jerusalem. Look, I generally don’t celebrate birthdays, she’s the only one who makes a big deal out of it. Maybe because I didn’t celebrate them so much as a kid, until I met Betti in 1998.</p> \n<p>Betti: It was 1996, you left out two years.</p> \n<p>Eitan: Sorry. Oy, that’s right! Aviv was already born in 1998! Anyway, I only learned how to celebrate after I met her.</p> \n<p>How did you meet?</p> \n<p>Betti: I came from Germany to volunteer on kibbutz. I met him and I stayed.</p> \n<p>Was it hard for you to leave Germany?</p> \n<p>Betti: Not exactly. The timing was good. I’d just finished my studies in the humanities and realized that it wasn’t what I wanted. Also, I wasn’t on good terms with my parents. It’s true that I didn’t exactly plan to switch countries, but it was easy for me to stay. There was some regret, of course, but I didn’t feel I’d left a lot of things behind. I also learned how to let go, from him. Everyone teaches the other person something.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Modern Hebrew has two different words for the common rat - akh-bar-ROSH and khul-DA. </p> \n<p>This is perhaps surprising, since just a hundred years ago, there were none - and neither mean rat anyway. At least, they didn't originally.</p> \n<p>Until the advent of the duo for the despised rodent, Hebrew made do with a single word - akhbar – for both mice and rats. That's because either nobody noticed, or cared, that they are different species. It took the migration of a scientifically trained zoologist to Palestine, in the early 20th century, to rectify the oversight.</p> \n<p>Israel Aharoni was born in the Russian Empire, in an area which is today Lithuania. He was a son of a rabbi, who died before his birth; his mother died soon after. The rest of his short childhood he spent at his grandmother’s house, where he received a religious education at a heder. He ran away from home at age 13, to Prague, he graduated from school there, and went to university, where he studied Zoology and Semitic Philology.</p> \n<p>This is where he began to become involved in Zionism, and murine nomenclature. Upon graduating at the turn of the 20th century, he immigrated to Palestine, then under Ottoman control, where he started his career collecting butterflies for a local sultan.</p> \n<p>The coming of the mole rat</p> \n<p>In addition to teaching in Hebrew schools and seeking out unknown species (he discovered 30 in his lifetime), Aharoni tried to figure out which animal names appearing in the Bible, Mishnah and Talmud corresponded to which animals living in his new home and apply the correct original name to them. His efforts left a lasting mark on Hebrew to this day, including on the name of the rat.</p> \n<p>Looking to differentiate between the common mouse and the larger rat, he looked in the Bible and found: ״These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind” (Leviticus 11:29).</p> \n<p>The first animal on this list, that which the King James Bible rendered “weasel,” is a kholed in the original Hebrew. In an article published in 1944, Aharoni argued that the kholed was the Palestine mole rat (the Biblical Zoo in Jerusalem has an exhibit of the naked mole rat, if you're curious).</p> \n<p>It seems Aharoni had it wrong – the evidence points to kholed being a collective name for small carnivorous mammals, including weasels, martens, polecats,&nbsp; mongooses, and possibly cats too. But his designation was accepted by the Hebrew Academy.</p> \n<p>This brings us to Hulda, the biblical prophetess, whose name is pronouncedkhul-DA. Her name likely also referred to these smart, quick animals. Even so, in 1923 Aharoni suggested that khulda be used to refer to the common rats that he found in Palestine. Thus the name entered common use and was made official by the academy in 1964, leading subsequent generations of schoolchildren to fruitlessly wonder why this lady prophet was named for a rat.</p> \n<p>Anyway, Hebrew now has two names for the rat, of which we've discussed one. Khulda found itself competing with the synonym akhbarosh. This word arose as a loan from Yiddish, which itself borrowed from the German word Mausekopf, literally &quot;mouse head&quot; – but meaning scam artist.</p> \n<p>And indeed, this is how the word was used in Hebrew in the early 20th century. But by the 1930s, the brown rat spread throughout Israel (after its accidental introduction to the environment in the late 18th century; Israel was already blessed with the common rat). People had forgotten the original meaning of the word akhbarosh, and applied it to the enormous new rats infesting their homes. Though colloquial, this word is widely used to this day.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p> Until recently, Yehezkel Dror believed the State of Israel could live with a nuclear Iran. The veteran Israeli political scientist thought the right answer to the potential nuclearization of the Shiite republic was an ultimate deterrent. If the ayatollahs knew Israel's destruction in a nuclear attack would guarantee the same fate for their country, the Middle East would remain stable, he reasoned.</p> \n<p> Over the last year, Dror has changed his mind.  I met with him to try to understand why he wrote the dramatic analysis published last month by the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies.</p> \n<p> “I understood that the nuclearization of Iran would create a real risk of a nuclear war in the Middle East,” he says. “Therefore, if there is no other way to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, it is imperative that Israel attack their nuclear facilities while it is still able to do so.”  Even at 84, Yehezkel Dror evinces a captivating sort of childishness. His thick Viennese accent and professorial black horn-rimmed glasses are belied by the boyish spark in his eyes.</p> \n<p> But sitting with me over a cup of espresso and a plate of chocolate cookies at his Givat Ram office, Dror says some very frightening things. This Israeli, who has been dealing with matters of nuclear strategy since the 1960s and 1970s, is discussing, in an unusually direct and explicit way, matters that are never spoken about openly.</p> \n<p> He is thinking aloud, in my presence, the unthinkable. In fact, this cautious professor from Jerusalem is pushing the limits of the public debate on the nuclear threat faced by the Jewish state.  Dror’s argument is simple, clear and multilayered.</p> \n<p> “Iran is not developing nuclear weapons against Israel,” he says. “Iran is also well aware of the fact that a nuclear attack on Israel would result in a deadly Israeli counterstrike. And despite this, under unusual circumstances, Iran is liable to attack Israel with a nuclear weapon. There is a risk of an error being make, a risk of the loss of control, a risk of escalation.</p> \n<p> &quot;But above all there is the risk that if the rulers of Iran encounter a regime crisis, they will choose the Sampson Option: to die alongside the Israelis. The probability of such an event is not high but it is not necessarily low. It is unknown. During the missile crisis in 1962 [Cuban leader] Fidel Castro gave [Soviet Premier] Nikita Khrushchev the option of starting an apocalyptic war. He knew that it would mean suicide for his country but thought that the supreme goal of destroying capitalism would justify the price of Cuba’s destruction.</p> \n<p> ”Very fortunately, Moscow treated the revolutionary from Havana like a madman and ignored his offer. But in Iran’s case we are likely to find ourselves up against a revolutionary Cuba that is not restrained by a more mature Soviet Union. We don't know well enough who will be those making these decisions and according to what values they will be made. Therefore, there is no escaping the conclusion that, under certain circumstances that cannot be recognized ahead of time, Iran is likely to attack Israel with a nuclear weapon.”  The first cookie  I take a deep breath, sip my espresso and devour a chocolate cookie that I had resolved not to touch. But the man who helped shape Israel's most critical strategies does not flinch. He strides forwards with his own unique logic.</p> \n<p> “The scenario I just described to you is not the main scenario that worries me,&quot; says Dror. &quot;What led to the change in my views regarding Iran is the understanding that if it acquires a nuclear weapon, Turkey, Syria and other Arab nations will also do so. In such a case there will be – for the first time in history – a multinational nuclear network in an unstable area.</p> \n<p> &quot;Such a model has no solution, even in theoretical models and professional literature. It doesn't even meet the basic requirement that I know you're level-headed, you know I’m level-headed and I know you know I'm level-headed.</p> \n<p> &quot;For this reason, whoever makes a comparison between a Middle East, where there could be any number of nuclear powers, and the Cold War is just spouting nonsense. Anyone who thinks that after nuclearization, the relationship between us and our neighbors will be similar to the one that existed between the United States and the USSR is thinking baselessly. There are grounds for the very serious concern that a nuclear weapon in the hands of Iran will usher in a nuclear Middle East where the probability of a nuclear attack on Israel will be multiplied.&quot;  Through the window is a view of the old pine trees and green lawns of the Givat Ram campus. On the table is a plate of chocolate cookies whose contents are gradually dwindling.</p> \n<p> I must challenge Dror. I must subvert the logical structure he presents, which only leads towards the abyss. So I tell my learned companion that the international community must understand all these risks and that they will take action to curb Iran's actions. Certain sanctions have already been imposed and others will be imposed. And so the disaster will be avoided.  Dror doesn’t think twice, or even hesitate.</p> \n<p> “The international community does have a strong interest. The world would be horrified to see an Armageddon in the Middle East,&quot; he says. &quot;But the decision makers in the West are suffering from a severe bias. They prefer to view reality in a way that doesn't require them to take actions they don't want to take.</p> \n<p> &quot;Because they don’t want to get tangled up in military action against Iran, they adhere faithfully to the art of diplomacy and sanctions. But the truth is that it's difficult to find an historical example of a country that forsook a national strategic initiative because of sanctions. We wouldn’t do so either.</p> \n<p> &quot;The one exception is Libya. But today Libya’s example actually encourages the Iranians to try and obtain nuclear weapons quickly and with determination. It's entirely obvious that if in 2003 Gadhafi didn’t succumb to American and British pressures and give up on his nuclear project he'd be alive and well today, living a happy life surrounded by dozens of female bodyguards.</p> \n<p> &quot;This doesn't mean that we shouldn't try the diplomatic approach, but if diplomacy and sanctions don’t produce results within a short time, we must not let them come at us from an aggressive position while Iran’s nuclear facilities are still vulnerable to attack.”  I don't give up. If not sanctions, then America – at the last minute the Americans are the ones that will save us from a nuclear Iran. And because the operational capability of the United States is vastly superior to Israel’s operational capability, we must let them lead.  Dror is more skeptical.</p> \n<p> “It’s obvious that an American attack on Iran is preferable to an Israeli attack. But the U.S. isn’t what it once was,” he says. “After the traumas of Afghanistan and Iraq I’m not convinced that the American public will support another war. It’s also unclear how the Russians and Chinese will react.</p> \n<p> &quot;There's a difference between us and the United States. Iran won’t attack America, whereas it is liable to attack Israel. Therefore, there is a significant gap between the risks perceived by the Americans and the risks posed to us. From the United States' point of view, an Iranian nuclear weapon isn’t an existential threat. So there's no way to predict the decision the American president will take, one way or the other.</p> \n<p> &quot;There's a real danger that he will prefer to put up with Iran’s transformation into a superpower by providing Israel with certain types of support and guarantees. But since it's impossible to maintain Israel's security against a nuclear Iran, there is a clear conclusion. Israel cannot leave the final decision to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons in the hands of the U.S. If there is no other choice, if time runs out, and if Iran stands on the verge of entering the zone of immunity, we must do all that can be done, including an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Israel must attack while there is a very high probability of a successful outcome.”  Don’t listen to the people  &quot;What you are proposing is a preventative war,&quot; I say to Dror. &quot;And a preventative war is a war of choice that the Israeli public will oppose, just as it opposed the first Lebanon war and the Second Lebanon War.&quot;  “I am not talking about a war of choice, but a preventative strike. The argument that a preventative strike is morally unacceptable is a primitive one,” says the senior strategist of the Winograd Commission, which had been established in 2006 to investigate the causes of the Second Lebanon War.</p> \n<p> “It ignores the future and the important need to prevent future victims. It also contradicts the logic of supporting peace treaties, because every peace treaty involves definite security risks that are taken for the sake of future, uncertain chances. Therefore, the government's decision making should be guided by the need to prevent grave dangers in the future. In fact, representative democracy requires the elected government to act according to the overall best interests of the state – not to pander to public opinion. In the type of case we're up against, public opinion is of absolutely no importance. There is no room to consider public opinion with regard to the question of military action against Iranian nuclear facilities.”  &quot;You’re sending shivers down my spine,&quot; I tell Dror. &quot;Your logic leads to the unavoidable conclusion that an Israeli leader who knows tomorrow they are liable to lose their ability to attack Iran, must attack that day. But such an extreme action could have disastrous consequences.&quot;</p> \n<p> The professor lets out a gentle sigh, removes his glasses and looks at me closely.</p> \n<p> “True,” he says. “The stakes are high. But the gamble involved in abstaining from such an attack is liable to be much higher. You must understand that in this case the decision not to act is no less critical than to the decision to do so. In both cases the outlook is gloomy, but thorough analysis shows that the more dangerous option is not to attack and the right option is to act. This is because the cost of an Iranian counterattack is infinitely smaller when compared to the costs of a future nuclear attack against Israel. Therefore, the Israeli leader who knows he has the ability to carry out a good attack on Iran – because he may soon lose his chance – must act. If he doesn’t attack, he is acting irresponsibly.”  But what if Israel attacks and after some time Iran still reaches nuclearization despite this?</p> \n<p> Now even the calm and collected Dror sounds worried.</p> \n<p> &quot;I estimate that the current Iranian ability to harm us is limited,” he says. “Even the dangers that are likely to be caused to Israel’s political standing are reversible. They can't be compared at all to the dangers inherent in a nuclear Iran. But the worrying scenario is one where following an attack by Israel Iran recovers and becomes a vengeful nuclear power. This scenario is a grave one. If I knew it would happen, I wouldn’t recommend an attack. But the way to prevent the danger of a nuclear Iran is to ensure that after an attack on its nuclear facilities, the United States and the international community monitor it closely and prevent it from going nuclear. In order for the U.S. and the international community to do this, Israel must complete the attack on Iran through a regional peace initiative.</p> \n<p> &quot;uch an initiative must be based on the Arab Peace Initiative and lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state, the partition of Jerusalem and an agreed solution regarding the problem of [Palestinian] refugees. This way, through the double actions of a military attack and a state initiative we can deal with the unprecedented challenge facing us.</p> \n<p> &quot;My recommendation to our leaders is a two-pronged one. If it becomes apparent that there is no other way to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, Israel must attack its nuclear facilities in combinations with the introduction of a serious Israeli initiative for comprehensive Middle-East peace.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>To many Israelis, Lebanon is a gaping wound. Years of rocket attacks, incursions and more than 1,000 Israeli soldiers and civilians killed have left their mark. Yet it wasn’t always like this, and some academics and residents of Israeli border towns remember more cordial times.</p> \n<p>During the 1920 battle of Tel Hai, in which Israeli commander Joseph Trumpeldor was killed, 10 Arabs were also killed. According to Prof. Mustafa Abbasi of Tel-Hai Academic College, the Jews feared revenge. But the leader of the Lebanese Shi’ites, Kamal Asaad, sent his men to gather the Jewish residents of the “Galilee Panhandle” into his village of Taiba to protect them.</p> \n<p>“They entered the Asaad palace compound and other homes in Taiba and some went to Sidon,” said Abbasi, who has studied the ties between the residents of Metula and their Arab neighbors from 1896 until the War of Independence in 1948. “Even at that difficult stage, when one Arab party was attacking Tel Hai, we see that a different Arab party provided assistance, took the evacuees into his village’s homes and gave them all the help they needed to return them safely to the Land of Israel.”</p> \n<p>The battle of Tel Hai was on March 1. By March 4, 65 Jewish men had returned to the northern kibbutz of Ayelet Hashahar. According to the late researcher Nakdimon Rogel, they returned on mules lent to them by Kamal Asaad.</p> \n<p>Asaad, who died in 1924, had no sons and the leadership passed to his nephew, Ahmad Bey Asaad, who maintained the tradition of good relations with the Jews. Documents in Kfar Giladi’s archives quote Tova Portugali – a member of Hashomer who visited the Asaad family during the Arab revolts of the 1930s. “He told us that when the mufti arrived in Beirut, he invited him and demanded that his men join the gangs. Asaad refused,” she wrote.</p> \n<p>But in May 1948, Palmach fighters (the elite strike force of the Haganah, the underground Jewish militia) invaded Taiba and torched the Asaad family palace, along with seven other homes in the village. Residents of Kfar Giladi and Metula had opposed the Palmach operation.</p> \n<p>“There were a lot of arguments about who would prevail – the central force or the locals,” says Guy Maayan, a doctoral student in Middle Eastern Studies at Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan. “Yigal Allon decided that the Palmach had to determine policy.”</p> \n<p>The attack on Taiba on May 23 led many Lebanese village residents to flee deeper into Lebanon, and they only returned months later.</p> \n<p>Yet despite the attack on Taiba, relations remained good, Maayan said. “In November 1948, Ahmad Bey Asaad even ordered cooperation with the Israeli army after it took control of 15 Shi’ite villages in south Lebanon, including Taiba. He sent his brother-in-law, Sabri Hamada – the speaker of the Lebanese parliament who in the 1930s sent Lebanese laborers to work for [Jewish construction firm] Solel Boneh – to meet with the Israeli representatives.” Maayan says the area’s elders claim that Asaad made sure Lebanese forces didn’t attack Kfar Giladi because of the alliance between them.</p> \n<p>Ehud Neistein, a farmer and fourth-generation resident of Metula, built vacation cottages in the village 20 years ago and says visitors started “asking for stories.” He purchased a video camera and starting filming testimonies from Metula residents. Since the town doesn’t have an archive, these historic testimonies about the warm relations between residents on either side of the border are stuffed into drawers in his home.</p> \n<p>“There were instances where Jewish women didn’t have milk to give and Lebanese women would nurse the children,” he recounts. Neistein and his six sisters had Lebanese caregivers, and before Metula had a doctor, residents were treated by Dr. Majle, a Lebanese physician from Marjayoun “who arrived on a donkey.”</p> \n<p>But all these ties were severed by the War of Independence. “We had relations with [the Lebanese], the War of Independence was imposed on us,” says Neistein. “Suddenly they closed the border and there was no help.”</p> \n<p>According to Abbasi, the subsequent rise of the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1970 led to a weakening of the Asaad family’s position, and this signaled the end of good neighborly relations. But Neistein says that when Israel operated the so-called “Good Fence” along the border during the Lebanese civil war in the late 1970s, some ties were restored. He clearly recalls “there were some Lebanese who spoke Yiddish.”</p> \n<p>Neistein also, after 30 years, met one of his old babysitters, Lila, when she came to his house crying one day. “She told us about her two children being held in Al-Khiam Prison [controlled by the South Lebanon Army] and asked us to help free them.”</p> \n<p>During the 1980s, Neistein had Lebanese laborers working in his orchards. “We would eat our morning snack under a tree,” he recalls. “I would say to them, ‘See how we get along – Jews, Druze, Arabs.’”</p> \n<p>But in 2000, after Israel withdrew from Lebanon, the era of neighborly relations ended for good. “The descendents of the Shi’ites who helped us then are our enemies today,” says Neistein. “Both sides made mistakes, but I think we want peace more.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the long and fascinating list of indignities that can befall the human spirit (such as crippling anxiety and depression, addiction, sadism), the most bewildering is also the one that seems the most harmless: denial.</p> \n<p>Denial is the mind’s capacity to block out, forget, push aside and minimize information that is uncomfortable or painful to the self. Psychoanalysis was the first to pay systematic attention to denial and viewed it as a fundamental strategy to cope with the world when it threatens the self. Sigmund Freud called it a “defense mechanism”: A memory that, for example, undermines the love for a parent will often be erased from our consciousness. Psychoanalysis, then, views denial with a kind of intellectual benevolence: if it is involuntary and unconscious, and if it is a form of self-protection, it is not morally reprehensible.</p> \n<p>But denial is not only the unconscious and harmless mechanism of self-defense against threats to the self. Denial is also the semi-conscious, semi-deliberate strategy to ignore what we do not want to see about ourselves and the world. It is a relationship we have with ourselves, in which we hide information through strategies that are at once deliberate and nonconscious. In this sense, denial is a moral action.</p> \n<p>Take the example of the man who smokes and knows that “smoking kills” because he reads this every day on the pack of cigarettes he buys. This man has no particular desire to die. In fact, he lives a good life and values his life. He enjoys cigarettes because he enjoys life. He knows cigarettes kill, and yet does not know it. Every day, he renews with himself a pact of ignorance and persists in ignoring, forgetting, pushing aside what he knows. How does he do this? By telling himself different stories: he will stop smoking soon; cigarettes kill only some people and not others; he smokes less cigarettes and for less time than his friends; his life has always been a lucky one; he does a lot of sport and eats healthy food; his parents have great genes. If we could hear the silent voices of people who live with the denial of uncomfortable truths, we would hear a constant hum and buzz of self-told stories. Denial is, therefore, not a lack of knowledge, but a complex form of knowledge. This complex form of knowledge takes three forms.</p> \n<p>One is the one psychoanalysis has discussed: an erasure of memories: “It never happened” is the proposition taken by this (non)-knowledge. It is a blank where there should have been a word.</p> \n<p>The second form taken by denial-as-knowledge ignores the consequences of our actions, for ourselves and others. It takes the form of “X is true, but it will not happen to me.” For example, the man who ignores the fact that smoking may harm his own health and that of his children. This denial ignores the future.</p> \n<p>And then there is a third form of denial that involves a very particular gaze and consciousness of the present, which sees something and yet fails to register its meaning and significance, fails to register its proper name, minimizes it and says to itself, “I did not see anything; I don’t know anything.” Seeing without registering or naming what they see is the strategy of eyes that see evil without seeing it. This is, for example, the woman who is the daily witness of her husband’s sexual abuse of their daughter, and yet turns away her eyes, shuts her ears, continues to provide her husband with routine services of cooking, cleaning and sex. This woman is not a witness to abuse in the same way as the witness to a crime is; she witnesses a crime, but participates in it because she pushes it outside her consciousness, teaches herself to become oblivious to it, to the suffering of the child, to the criminality of her husband, and to her own failure as a human being. In the same way, myriad Polish and Ukrainian peasants who lived near concentration camps trained their eyes and minds to see nothing, smell nothing, hear nothing.</p> \n<p>Denial is thus not only about pushing aside some traumatic memory that has been inflicted on us by a harsh world; it is a choice to actively ignore the truth in front of our eyes. Denial is the art of “fudging” reality, of turning hard facts into vague, hazy images. As in voodoo mythology, where a zombie is at once alive and dead, denial is a zombie form of knowledge, dead and alive, something we know and don’t know.</p> \n<p>Denial is not only the property of individuals. It can be, and in fact often is, a property of groups such as families and nations. Many families can build mutual loyalty only by denying their own emotional pathology and violence. Nations similarly and typically build for themselves glorious pasts and impeccable identities through denial of the violence they perpetrated. Using Nietzsche’s words, we may say that politics is the art of determining “the boundary at which the past has to be forgotten if it is not to become the gravedigger of the present.” What to remember and what to forget is crucial to modern polities. Not by chance is Winston Smith, the hero of George Orwell’s “1984,” in charge of rewriting history and newspaper articles: the belief in a regime of power depends on believing in its past. Such belief can be maintained only if the collective past is believed. We may say that how open, just and moral nations and countries are can be evaluated based on the degree to which, and the ways in which, they deny or acknowledge their past wrongdoings.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Some nations practice denial as a systematic policy, but we usually do not think of them as open societies. Yet I do not believe there is another way to characterize Israeli policy vis-&agrave;-vis the occupied territories. The mind-boggling, jaw-dropping claim that the State of Israel can quietly annex these territories, control the lives of 2.6 million Palestinians and still remain Jewish and democratic is denial on an uncanny scale – denial turned into grand political strategy (Palestinians and Israeli Arabs together would make up 4.3 million of the total population of Israel, a fact that would compel Jewish Israel to exercise an inhumane and unsustainable control over other human beings). The originality of the politics of the messianic right, which has been in power for more than a decade, can be defined as a politics of denial, and politics as denial on a scale rarely seen in the democratic world. However, contrary to common perceptions, I suggest that the denial that characterizes the politics of the territories could become a policy because the politics and policy inside the Green Line had already long been a politics of denial, perhaps since the inception of Zionism.</p> \n<p>1: Denial as a blank – it never happened</p> \n<p>How could a state so stubbornly deny the screamingly just claim of independence by Palestinians? It was easy to ignore because Israel consistently denied there were even people on the land, let alone people who were expelled from their lands. The slogan of Zionism – “A land without a people for a people without a land” – was either a conscious, cynical lie or a denial that the victims of abject European anti-Semitism could also be the perpetrators of violence, expulsion, expropriation. This denial was considerably facilitated by the initial refusal of Arab states to share Palestine and to abide by the 1947 UN vote, and made it far, far easier for early Zionists to deny their actions and to shift the burden of responsibility onto Arab nations.</p> \n<p>Denial No. 1 – denial as suppression – takes the form of erasure, a blank. But the supreme irony of that blank is that it must be incessantly produced and reproduced by the state.</p> \n<p>Take the so-called “Nakba Law” that passed in 2011. This law determined that any organization that receives government funding may be subject to sanctions if it funds an event that refers to Independence Day as a day of mourning (Nakba, meaning “catastrophe” in Arabic, is the Palestinians’ term for the formation of Israel in 1948). According to the Israel Democracy Institute, this law was aimed specifically at preventing financing of Nakba Day “events” by Arab organizations that received funding from the state. Last March, Maariv journalist Kalman Libeskind strongly condemned the argument that the Nakba should be taught in the Israeli education system, because giving it a place in the Israeli classroom would amount to claiming that Jewish existence on Israeli land is theft. Even worse, to teach the Nakba narrative alongside the Zionist narrative would be to claim there is no distinction between good and evil, truth and falsehood.</p> \n<p>Another example: Journalist Erel Segal wrote in the right-wing, religious-Zionist newspaper Makor Rishon last April: “In the name of multiculturalism and the attempt to undermine the Jewish state from within, people want to teach here in the narrative of the aggressor. This is arrogance redoubled with outrageous nerve.”</p> \n<p>A poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute before Independence Day last year found that 58 percent of the Jewish public supports the Nakba Law, with only a third against it. In other words, what is unique about the Israeli case is that it not only denies the violence of the initial colonization of the land, but views the natives – those who inhabited the land – as the aggressors. This inversion of victim and perpetrator is a clear, classic example of denial, which at once erases one’s wrongdoing and projects it onto the other side.</p> \n<p>In erasing its violent beginning, most notably its expropriation of Arab lands and the creation of Palestinian refugees, Israel was probably no worse than most other peoples. But the difference between Israel and other nations is that, while most Western nations gradually opened up about their pasts and agreed to display contested memories, or even to adopt wholesale the version of the minority (Jews in Germany; Native Americans in the United States, Indigenous Australians, etc.), Israel has gone in the opposite direction and increasingly made the erasure of the Arabs’ own version of their history into an official policy of the Jewish state, in order to increase the legitimacy of Zionism. The control and erasure of the past was caused by the increasing involvement of settlers in Israeli politics, where the legitimacy of Israel and the legitimacy of the territories became one single cause.</p> \n<p>The result of this tactic, however, is not without irony: The persistent denial of the Nakba makes Zionism less, rather than more, legitimate in the eyes of its Arab minority and in the eyes of most of the enlightened world. Acknowledging officially that some Arabs were forced out of their lands, and enabling a minority group to express its own historical experience, would strengthen rather than weaken the moral and political authority of Zionism (this writer believes that the great catastrophe that befell the Arab natives of the land does not undermine the legitimacy of early Jewish nationalism).</p> \n<p>To further illustrate my point: Germany and Turkey both committed atrocious genocides, and yet what enabled Germany to become a moral world leader is that it acknowledged its crimes. Turkey will never attain this moral status not because it committed worse crimes, but because it will not acknowledge its past.</p> \n<p>Commenting on the shocking recent behavior of Eastern European countries in the face of the humanitarian crisis of refugees at the door of Europe, the Princeton historian and sociologist Jan T. Gross remarked, “Eastern Europe, by contrast [to Germany], has yet to come to terms with its murderous past. Only when it does will its people be able to recognize their obligation to save those fleeing in the face of evil.” Opening up one’s collective memory to contested narratives increases rather than decreases the moral status of a state. Commenting on a poem by concentration camp survivor Dan Pagis, literary critic James Wood put it well: Worse than suffering itself “is to have the reality of one’s suffering erased.”</p> \n<p>2: Denial as a hijacking of the future</p> \n<p>The second form of denial is not one that erases the past, but that hijacks the future for the sake of preserving both the comfort and the ideology of certain groups in Israeli society.</p> \n<p>Strategies to ignore the consequences of one’s actions in the future are like those of the smoker who persists in not defining his heavy smoking as a gamble on his and his children’s health. The messianic politics of the territories is a spectacular gamble on the future of all Israel, with stakes as high as the collapse of the Zionist project in the space of a few short decades.</p> \n<p>In an article published in TheMarker last June, which dealt with an economic boycott of Israel, it was argued that the boycott has actually existed for a long time and operates on many levels, far from the spotlight. It keeps expanding all the time and will, if it maintains this level of expansion, bring serious damage to the Israeli economy.</p> \n<p>An internal report by the Finance Ministry’s chief economist two years ago stated that in the extreme case of a European Union ban on Israel, which would include 100 percent damage to Israeli exports to Europe and the cessation of European investment in the country, the annual loss for Israeli exports would be $88.1 billion, GDP would suffer a $40 billion shortfall, 36,500 jobs would be lost and investment would fall $10.9 billion.</p> \n<p>These dire economic consequences would be only the beginning: Soon, Israel would turn into a rogue state that would develop as an isolated military fortress, living off sales of arms and security equipment to the rest of the world; internally, it would be characterized by rampant poverty, inequalities, religious fanaticism and lack of education.</p> \n<p>Last September, Haaretz editor Aluf Benn wrote an article laying out what is in store for Israel. The core secular part of Israeli society is shrinking, with minority groups – Haredim, religious Zionist and Arabs – expanding around it, weakening the secular classes. Based on figures in the Statistical Abstract of Israel, the trends are clear: a generation ago, 60 percent of Israeli children learned in secular state schools. Two years ago, only 41.5 percent of the first grade attended those same schools. The data estimate that, by 2019, only 37.2 percent of first-graders will go to secular state schools. Deliberate state policies triggered this demographic revolution since Ben-Gurion. Israel is already sharply split between hostile tribal groups and will continue splitting further; because it is becoming a religious country, we can expect that its legal, moral and cultural core will, in fact, be mostly inspired and shaped by halakha (Jewish religious law), and will see a large proportion of its population suffer from under-education and chronic unemployment. Such demographic policy characterized different governments and was based on denial that this social model is unsustainable.</p> \n<p>Economists have a particularly accurate way of describing the mechanism at work in such hijackings of the future: optimism bias – defined as a cognitive flaw in the judgment of one’s actions, which tends to under-evaluate the risks of one’s decisions and the likelihood of losses or damages entailed by such decisions. In other words, an optimistic bias is the error that makes the gambler who has a few wins at the beginning of the evening develop the belief that he will continue to win until the wee hours.</p> \n<p>Settlers and the religious-Zionist camp have many good reasons to entertain the gambler’s optimism bias with regard to Israel’s future. They are convinced that God’s hand itself wrote the history of Israel for the last 70 years and that this history was written just for them (the birth of Israel against all odds; the Six-Day War as a divine miracle; Yitzhak Rabin’s murder as an unfortunate but positive historical accident; the collapse of the Israeli left as proof of its moral weakness, etc.).</p> \n<p>Optimism bias is likely to be particularly delusional among settlers, since in Jewish theology Jews are the only people God engages with seriously for his grand plans. Israeli nationalism was interpreted in this theological frame: As the manifestation of an intimate, privileged and exclusive relationship between the Jews and God. The denial of the future by settlers has theological reasons, but the same theological strain was present in secular Zionism and easily penetrated the Green Line.</p> \n<p>In 2015 OECD research that compared well-being in 36 countries, Israel ranked at the bottom of almost all the objective measures of well-being: personal security, work-life balance, civic engagement and governance, environmental quality, housing, etc. And yet, miraculously, Israel ranked in fifth position with regard to subjective well-being – certainly testimony to Israelis’ happy temperament, as well as their inability to understand the low quality of their institutions, a symptom of the optimism bias that makes this country endearing to some, unbearable to others.</p> \n<p>The optimism bias of a nation sure that God (or history) will always be on its side resembles that of the heavy smoker who takes everyday good health as the irrefutable and tangible proof that God has personally written eternity insurance to him. But, as we all know, the fact that a smoker is healthy now doesn’t mean cancer won’t start tomorrow.</p> \n<p>3: Denial as seeing, yet not seeing</p> \n<p>A large proportion of the Israeli population is increasingly numb and indifferent to the humanitarian disaster that plagues Palestinians. These Israelis are in the same position as the woman who sees her husband sexually abusing his daughter and yet fails to register it. We witness an astounding numbers of house demolitions, killings of children, expropriations of land, administrative detentions, torture, violations of international rights, daily crimes of theft, vandalism, attacks by settlers against Palestinians, with the deliberate denial of the army which often stands near, and stands idly by. What fogs our vision is the fact that the lawlessness of the occupied territories is protected by the army itself – the most moral army in the world.</p> \n<p>The reason why the government of settlers has undermined the moral authority and work of human rights organizations like Yesh Din, B’Tselem or the Public Committee Against Torture is due to the fact that these organizations compel us to look at what our gaze is trying to avoid. They force us to call what Israel is doing by its proper name. They oppose the denial,</p> \n<p>They are the eyes that see. For example, a report by Yesh Din has addressed Israeli soldiers’ practice of standing idly by in the face of crimes committed by Israeli civilians against Palestinians and their property in the territories – a practice that is almost as old as the occupation itself. The term “standing idly by” refers to incidents in which Israel Defense Forces soldiers witness attacks on Palestinians or their property and do nothing to prevent or stop them, or to immediately detain and arrest the offenders. Such passive protection of the violence, and violation of law and human rights, is the same as the passive gaze of the mother who looks at her husband abusing their daughter, a denial of the crime, and ultimately a denial of her own humanity.</p> \n<p>From the early days of the occupation, the IDF’s “command ethos” has evaded its responsibility, defined by the Supreme Court as one of the major, fundamental obligations of a military commander in an occupied territory. The military’s refusal to uphold its obligations allows the practice of standing idly by to proliferate, and expresses yet another aspect of the policy of denial toward illegal activity by Israeli civilians.</p> \n<p>The soldiers’ practice of standing idly by has been documented for decades by both government agencies and human rights organizations. Yet the army and Israeli society continue to see without seeing, to have their consciousness numbed by fuzzy slogans about “military defense” and “military security.”</p> \n<p>Here, too, the state’s denial of lawlessness in the territories can take place only because of processes within Green Line Israel. As has often been said, Israel is not a state with an army, but an army with a state. The state budget for 2015 stipulates that the Defense Ministry receive 57 billion shekels ($14.7 billion). This is in addition to another 7 billion shekels allocated to the ministry for 2014. Defense expenditure is the single biggest item in the state budget, accounting for some 16 percent of it.</p> \n<p>The Defense Ministry budget is different from other government departments, in that it enjoys special budget rights, is completely controlled by the Defense Ministry, is usually classified, and spending changes do not require the prior approval of Knesset members.</p> \n<p>In other words, the Defense Ministry and security establishment function like a bureaucracy independent from the rest of the country, a bureaucracy that expands with no regard for other collective needs, such as health, education or culture. “Military security” has replaced all foreign and domestic policy. Life inside the Green Line has become the life of a military trench: we request only to survive, and the demands of survival have hijacked any and all political considerations, thus depriving Israelis of the capacity to see and to grasp the evils that are committed in their name.</p> \n<p>Denial is not simply a flaw of our consciousness, as psychoanalysis sometimes naively suggests. Denial is a pact of ignorance we make with ourselves, a choice to know and not to know, and is thus a particularly disturbing moral deficiency. A gambler who stakes the house of his children because he is thoroughly convinced he will beat the casino is less likely to be cured of his compulsion than the nervous gambler who remains aware of the risks. A woman who bullies her colleague, but thinks herself cute and witty, is more laughable than an ordinary bully.</p> \n<p>Blindness to oneself is the stuff of comedies, but in politics denial is not funny. Adam Smith, one of the founders of modern economics, put it perfectly: “The overweening conceit which the greater part of men have of their own abilities is an ancient evil remarked by the philosophers and moralists of all ages.”</p> \n<p>The tragedy of this comical flaw is that it only becomes aware of itself when it contemplates the havoc and damage it has wreaked.</p> \n<p>Denial on a grand scale, as exists in Israel, not only fogs consciousness and numbs moral intuition, it also makes possible Netanyahu’s claim that Hitler never intended to destroy the Jews, while remaining at his post without being forced to resign. We can hear this and resume our daily routine because Israel is now built around a gigantic lie. In V&aacute;clav Havel’s stunning words: we have become accustomed to “living in the lie.”</p> \n<p>Prof. Eva Illouz is a sociologist and author of nine books.</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry deserves praise for his efforts to advance Israeli-Palestinian peace. But the results on the ground proved that he made serious errors. The principle of “anti-fragility,” which involves efforts to transform failures into opportunities, demands that lessons be drawn as to how to advance Arab-Israeli peace in the future.</p> \n<p>The first error was putting too much trust in personal diplomacy. The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stuck for a long time. Therefore, it should have been clear that there was no hope that a repetition of the “more of the same” attempts of personal diplomacy – however energetic – could drag the negotiations out of the morass.</p> \n<p>The problem is not one of too much self-confidence that “I will succeed where others failed,” but what is today a widely accepted, erroneous practice of expecting that the personal involvement of senior politicians can transform situations of stalemate. When substantive interests and fundamental values are at stake, discourse as well as “moderate pressure” achieve nothing.</p> \n<p>Much more serious an error is clinging to “doctrines” which have been proven wrong. The dominant paradigm regards relations between Israel and the Palestinians as standing largely on their own, and assumes that they can mainly be dealt with in relative isolation from the Arab-Israeli conflict as a whole. This view has been refuted by the constant failures of Israeli-Palestinian talks, as well as the disappointments stemming from the Oslo Accords and the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005.</p> \n<p>In-depth examination shows clearly that the accepted doctrine is fundamentally misleading and no less dangerous than the doctrines which resulted in Israel’s failures in the Yom Kippur War of 1973. The accepted paradigm ignores that fact that the Palestinians cannot provide Israel with assets that would justify the requisite Israeli withdrawals; moreover, it ignores the whole Gaza issue which in reality is an integral part of the entire problem.</p> \n<p>Clearly it is impossible to arrive at any meaningful agreement without an Israeli withdrawal close to the 1968 borders and a special arrangement as regards Jerusalem. But a realpolitik-based assessment leads to the conclusion that the Palestinians have nothing to offer that would justify such radical Israeli concessions. Furthermore, contradictory historical narratives, different notions of “justice,” and conflicting values cannot provide a basis for agreements in the absence of realpolitik quid pro quos.</p> \n<p>It is necessary to take into account, among other things, the fact that the Palestinians do not constitute a strategic danger to Israel; that a peace agreement with them by itself is unsustainable within an all-encompassing regional conflict; and that the notion that an Israeli agreement with the Palestinians will lead to a broad Middle East peace settlement does not hold water.</p> \n<p>For instance, let us assume that the Palestinians recognize Israel as “the state of the Jewish people.” Such a declaration has the historic weight of a feather in comparison to the depth of the Arab Islamic-Israeli Jewish conflict. On the other hand, Israeli embassies in Riyadh and Tehran could achieve the critical mass necessary for ending the conflict as a whole, in stages. And, however unrealistic such an image is in terms of the narrow-mindedness that characterizes the status quo – such embassies are within the realm of the possible in a broad Middle East agreement.</p> \n<p>Therefore, the United States should have engaged in creative thinking vis-a-vis the conflict, uninhibited by accepted views, before the secretary of state wasted his time and diminished the credibility of his country by engaging in doomed shuttle diplomacy. And along with the secretary, a special representative with a creative, “open mind” should have been appointed, who is not captive to obsolete paradigms because of years of acting on their basis. (This applies also to the Israelis handling the negotiations).</p> \n<p>Coping with the strong momentum of the conflict demands that a new paradigm – such as proceeding toward a comprehensive Middle East agreement, of which establishment of a Palestinian state in one component.</p> \n<p>Also essential is exercise of significant power. The president of the United States had to decide if he personally, with the backing of his powerful country, should be committed to advancing a phased, comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, by presenting a new and grand design, together with many positive and negative incentives, or give priority to other issues, such as the geostrategic situation of Asia. Leaving the burden of the Palestinian issue mainly to a secretary of states assures failure in advance.</p> \n<p>The special relations that exist with the United States are essential for the security of Israel. Therefore, we should be very worried by the inadequacies of grand American strategic thinking, as expressed, among other things, by John Kerry's mission.</p> \n<p>Talk in Israel of “finding a substitute” for the United States because of apprehensions about its declining influence and erosion of its support are no more than dangerous delusions. The only way to compensate for the American errors is to launch a credible Israeli peace initiative for the entire region, in coordination with the United States, based on outstanding statecraft and creativity. But, as yet, there are no signs of this.</p> \n<p>The dire situation of the peace process has all the more ominous significance in light of the comprehensive processes of change the world is undergoing at present. These processes contain serious dangers – but golden opportunities as well – also for Israel and the Jewish people. But that demands a separate discussion.</p> \n<p>The latest book by the author, Avant-Garde Politician: Leaders for a New Epoch, was published in April 2014.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Again they are talking about a “shake-up,” an “earthquake,” and soul-searching. Again the foundations are trembling. The rabbi was convicted of forcible indecent assault. More than what the case of Rabbi Mordechai Elon shows about him, his flock, or religious Zionism as a whole, it shows about Israel’s secular majority. The secular public seems suitably horrified at the fact that a rabbi – would you believe? – could be a sex offender. Woe to us! How the mighty have fallen!</p> \n<p>Let’s just imagine that Rabbi Moti was Moti the principal: the principal of a state secular high school in the center of the country who had sexually harassed pupils. Would the case have become front page news? Would it have generated such rhetoric? Would countless teachers and activists have been called to the broadcast studios to talk about the “great crisis” and the “rift?”</p> \n<p>But Elon was not the principal of a secular high school; he’s a rabbi who headed two leading yeshivas, and a rabbi is already a different kettle of fish, even for the secular. It’s true that Elon is a member of a prominent family, but even this fact cannot explain the grotesque festival that has been going on for three-and-a-half years.</p> \n<p>It emerges -- not for the first time, of course -- that it’s very doubtful whether secular Israelis really are secular. The worship of rabbis is not just the province of the religious, and the shock that one of them has been revealed to be a mere mortal who sometimes gravely errs extends far beyond the boundaries of the religious camp. The massive evidence that Israeli Jewish society is nationalist religious at its essence is further substantiated by the excessive shock from the Elon case.</p> \n<p>The secular look with longing eyes at the “spiritual world” of the national religious community. They are “religious Zionism.” No one refers to secular people as “secular Zionism” or speaks about their spiritual world. The secular don’t have “spiritual leaders.” Only the religious have them. This isn’t just a secular inferiority complex, but a covert admiration that has no explanation, such that even the most ideological socialists like Yisrael Galili and Yaakov Hazan saw the nationalist religious as modern-day pioneers. We love to hate the Haredim because they are very different from us, but the national religious? They’re the leaders of the pack, their kippot on their floppy forelocks -- ethical, moral and superior.</p> \n<p>A state whose very establishment in its current location is based on a religious tome and on theological and messianic beliefs can’t help but be an essentially religious and nationalist society. Our right to this land, as any good-for-nothing secular person will tell you, was given to us by God – just read the Bible. A society in which nearly every home has not just a balcony, but a mezuzah; in which there is almost no public transportation on Shabbat and no civil marriage on any day of the week; in which most people fast on Yom Kippur and read the Haggadah on Passover; in which everyone is convinced that the Western Wall is holy – is a religious society. Let’s just face it. In such a society, a rabbi’s sexual exploits generate far more outrage than the stunts of any teacher or principal.</p> \n<p>Even the self-righteous and sanctimonious language of religious Zionism is accepted by the secular as understood. Only they have “values,” the secular have none. They also have the Takana (Amendment) Forum, an institution with a poetic and self-righteous name, that comes to replace law enforcement agencies, and the secular see nothing wrong with this. Among the secular, sexual harassment complaints must be filed with the police, but the religious have Takana as a way station, or even as the final stop. There they will “clarify” the allegations before they reach the police or may even do so instead of the police. They are entitled to this because in their community every act of sexual harassment is a huge crisis, far greater than in the licentious secular world, which is hollow and blasphemous anyway.</p> \n<p>This surfeit of values among the national religious is reserved for them alone. They will sexually harass pupils, use criminal violence in the territories, steal land and torch orchards, but they are ethical (and we’re not).</p>",

        "text":["<p>Nobody knows why - and no one knows how long it will last - but those who were angry and upset that a convicted sex offender rabbi was permitted to continue to teach in one of Israel’s most prestigious yeshivas are now celebrating his absence.</p> \n<p>For the past six weeks, Rabbi Moti Elon has not been present at the Or Etzion Yeshiva for his weekly lecture. It is a lecture he has delivered each week for the past several years - even after he was convicted on two counts of forcible sexual assault against a minor. The yeshiva refused to officially confirm to the Hebrew language site Walla, which reported the story, whether or not his weekly lesson had been permanently terminated. The director general of the yeshiva refused to respond when asked why Elon was not lecturing and whether or not it was a temporary move.</p> \n<p>The fact that Elon was permitted to continue teaching after his conviction was the focus of intense controversy in the Orthodox community over the winter. The head of the yeshiva, Rabbi Haim Druckman, a prominent figure in the national religious world, publicly stood by Elon, declaring in December in a radio interview that the court’s conviction of Elon was a “mistake.”</p> \n<p>Defending Elon, Druckman said he is “a warm person who hugs people and for sure people who have problems; he brings them close. Maybe people will say this is okay or not okay, but it is nothing more than this.”</p> \n<p>He therefore stood by his assertion that: “I don’t believe there is anything in his Torah lessons that is not kosher. There is no reason not to learn from him or listen to Torah lessons from him.”</p> \n<p>But Elon’s victims and their supporters believed the rabbi’s history and conviction in court was a very good reason to distance him from young students.</p> \n<p>Since Druckman, in addition to heading Or Etzion, also serves as chairman of the Bnei Akiva schools network, Israelis affiliated with Bnei Akiva turned to the American Friends of Yeshiva Bnei Akiva to protest his continued employment. They also asked for support in pressuring Druckman to reverse the decision to retain Elon and continue to champion his cause and declare his innocence.</p> \n<p>At the time, Beit Shemesh resident Miriam Zussman distributed a letter to Bnei Akiva supporters abroad, asking them to alert members of the board of American Friends of Yeshiva Bnei Akiva to the issue. In the letter, she describes Elon as a “dangerous, habitual sexual predator.” She said the decision to allow him to continue teaching “reflects very badly on Rabbi Druckman's judgment and calls into question whether he should be entrusted with the welfare of the 24,000 students in the school network.”</p> \n<p>When none of these efforts seemed to move Druckman and Elon’s lectures continued, but a determined group refused to watch Elon return to yeshiva life as if nothing had happened. The group, primarily made up of women and young people, led by Emunah Klein, began holding a weekly protest vigil outside the yeshiva each time Elon gave a lesson.</p> \n<p>Even if there has been no official word on why Elon had stopped teaching, Zussman – who distributed the Bnei Akiva protest letter – credited the vigils for putting the yeshiva under pressure.</p> \n<p>“Finally, thanks to a small group of dedicated kids, led by Emunah Klein, justice has prevailed and the protection that Rabbi Druckman afforded to Moti Elon – an unapologetic, convicted child abuser – has hopefully come to an end,” she said. “I would prefer to hear an official apology, but I am not sure that will happen. I certainly hope that Rabbi Druckman does not change his mind and allow this convicted sex offender to teach youth again.”</p>",

        "text":["<p> As part of the events this week to mark the 30th anniversary of the first Lebanon War, the film &quot;Shtei Etzba'ot Metzidon&quot; (titled &quot;Ricochets&quot; in English ) was screened at the Jerusalem Cinematheque. The 1986 feature film, which was produced by the Israel Defense Forces, faithfully reflects Israel's embroilment in Lebanon. I was pleased that my teenage son agreed to join me for the screening, and to learn a chapter in the contemporary history of Israel and its conflict with the Palestinians. At the end of the film and an accompanying lecture that clearly brought home the Lebanese quagmire and the high price Israel paid, my somewhat shocked son asked me if he could ask a stupid question: I know who the minister of defense is - or the minister of war - but who is the minister of peace?</p> \n<p> Well, son, we don't exactly have a minister of peace (though for war, strategic affairs and intelligence we have three ). We do have a minister of foreign affairs, Avigdor Lieberman, who is supposed to foster ties with other countries by peaceful means, but peace does not interest him all that much. However, the person who is really responsible in Israel for working toward peace is the prime minister. According to a tradition that has been honored since the day the state was founded, at his inauguration in the Knesset the incoming prime minister states that he or she will act for peace and extend a hand to our Arab neighbors.</p> \n<p> Marking the anniversary of the painful war that aimed to expel the Palestine Liberation Organization from Lebanon and establish a pro-Israeli government in Beirut, a conflict that dragged on for 18 years at the cost of 1,217 dead Israeli soldiers, is a reminder from history to examine who has made good on the solemn statement at the swearing-in ceremony at the Knesset.</p> \n<p> So which of our prime ministers has tried - even if unsuccessfully - to reach a peace agreement with the Arabs and which of them did not make it a high priority, thus proving that his statement in the Knesset was nothing more than lip service? Obviously Israel's strategic situation and the other side's position have been different at different times and not everything has depended upon what the prime minister has or has not done. However, a student of the history of the conflict is able to cite many cases in which an Israeli prime minister has played a pivotal role in advancing or stalling peace in the region.</p> \n<p> The current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who according to public opinion polls has a good chance of being elected for a third term in 2013, could well go down in history as the prime minister who served for the most years, even exceeding the first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion. However, with respect to his diplomatic achievements toward resolving the conflict with the Palestinians, Netanyahu now appears to be filling the shoes of another of his predecessors, Golda Meir, with a policy of &quot;sit and do nothing&quot; that is liable to culminate in a war with many casualties on both sides.</p> \n<p> Strategically, Israel's situation today is excellent, despite the daily warnings concerning the Iranian threat. The Arab world is tattered and torn by internal conflicts, and the Palestinians have again been left to their fate. President Bashar Assad's regime in Syria is on the brink of collapse and in the midst of a civil war; Iraq is outside the Israeli-Arab conflict thanks to the United States; Egypt is mired in its own internal struggles; Hezbollah in Lebanon has gone on the defensive in the wake of its weakening Syrian and Iranian patrons ; and the Iranian nuclear threat is being handled with some measure of success by the United States and Europe.</p> \n<p> With respect to the Palestinians, it is doubtful Israel will ever have a more convenient moment to reach an agreement with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad in the West Bank and a weakened Hamas in the Gaza Strip. In terms of internal politics, Netanyahu enjoys a wall-to-wall coalition - every prime minister's dream. Had he wanted to, he could have crossed the Rubicon and attempted to achieve a historic agreement with the Palestinians of a two-state solution and still remain in office.</p> \n<p> In light of these circumstances, the question arises as to whether this isn't the time, from Israel's perspective, to sit down at the negotiating table with the Palestinians in the spirit of Netanyahu's 2009 Bar-Ilan speech, on the basis of the Clinton outline, and/or a continuation of the talks that then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni conducted with the leadership in Ramallah in 2008.</p> \n<p> Apropos Iran: In a position paper published recently at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, Prof. Yehezkel Dror recommends a combined strategy for Israel: an attack on Iran in conjunction with a regional peace initiative. The idea is that the existence of an active peace process with the Palestinians will enable us to confront the Iranian nuclear threat from a stronger strategic position.</p> \n<p> &quot;Our situation has never been better&quot; was the phrase that reflected the diplomatic and strategic conception of the government headed by Golda Meir and Defense Minister Moshe Dayan - a conception that collapsed in October of 1973. Spending year after year in the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem without initiating a solution to the conflict with our neighbors is the kind of leadership that led us to the Yom Kippur War. The only question that remains open is the price we and our children will pay for those years.</p> \n<p> Dan Sagir is a Jerusalem businessman.</p>",

        "text":["<p> A little known collection of more than 100 clay tablets in Cuneiform script, dating back to the Babylon Exile some 2,500 years ago, was unveiled this week, allowing a glimpse into the everyday life of one of the most ancient exile communities in the world.</p> \n<p> Prof. Wayne Horowitz, one of the archaeologists who studied the tablets, says this is the most important ancient Jewish archive since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p> \n<p> The tablets are on display in an exhibition entitled “By the Rivers of Babylon” that opened this week in the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p> The collection consists mainly of administrative certificates – sales bonds, contracts and addresses, engraved in Akkadian Cuneiform script on clay tablets, some of which were fired in kilns.</p> \n<p> Thanks to the Babylonian custom of inscribing each document with the date, according to the monarch’s years in power, the archaeologists could date the tablets to 572-477 B.C.E. The earliest tablet in the collection was written some 15 years after the First Temple’s destruction by Nebuchadnezzar, the Chaldean king of the neo-Babylonian era, who deported the Jews to Babylon. The latest was written some 60 years after the return of some of the exiles to Zion, which was enabled by Persia’s King Cyrus in 538 B.C.E.</p> \n<p> Little is known of how the collection was discovered. Archaeologists assume it was dug up in the 1970s in southern Iraq and surfaced in the international antiquities market. It was divided into three parts. Collector David Sofer bought 110 tablets, about half of the collection, which pertains mainly to the Jewish community. Sofer lent the tablets to the Bible Lands Museum.</p> \n<p> Two books about the collection were recently published – “Documents of Judean Exiles and West Semites in Babylonia in the Collection of David Sofer” by Prof. Laurie Pearce (CDL Press), who also translated the tablets into English, and “By the Rivers of Babylon,” by Horowitz, Yehoshua Greenberg and Peter Zilberg, published by the Bible Lands Museum and the Israel Exploration Society.</p> \n<p> The documents reflect a settlement bloc of several villages between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. One of the villages is named in the tablets as Al-Yahudu, a term Babylonian sources use to describe Jerusalem.</p> \n<p> “This is ‘Babylon’s Jerusalem,’ just as New York is the new York,” says Horowitz. Al-Yahudu’s residents are Jews, as their names indicate – Gedalyahu, Hanan, Dana, Shaltiel and Netanyahu. Some of the names appear to be inspired by Cyrus’ declaration allowing the return to Zion, like Yashuv Zadik or Ya’aliyahu, he says.</p> \n<p> Until now very little had been known about the life of the Judean community that had been uprooted from Jerusalem and deported to Babylon. The collection also corresponds with the Biblical text in which the prophet Ezekiel writes “as I was among the captives by the river Chebar” (chapter 1, verse 1). The “river Chebar” or “river Chebar village” appear several times on the tablets.&nbsp;</p> \n<p> The tablets reflect trade transactions, leasing houses and fields, addresses, inheritances, etc. Certificate 31, for example, is of a deal between Yirpa Ben Dohah and Ahikam Ben Refa’iyahu, in which the former trades a “trained, five-year-old bull” for “one gray jennet.” In certificate 52 a man called Ikisha sold his female slave for “three pieces of silver.” In another document, Neriayu Ben Ahikam rents a house for “10 silver shekels ... half given at the beginning of the year and the rest in the middle of the year.” The tenant undertook in the agreement to pay for damages, if any, from the foundations to the roof.</p> \n<p> On some tablets, ancient Hebraic letters appear beside the Akkadian details. The researchers assume these were intended for cataloging and tracing. On tablet 10, for example, which deals with a bond for barley, the name Shalemiyahu appears in Hebraic. “These are the most ancient Hebraic letters from the Babylonian exile,” says Horowitz.</p> \n<p> The estimated 80,000 Jews who remained in Babylon – Iraq – after the return to Zion formed what was to become one of the most ancient exile communities in the world, existing for some 2,500 years continuously until 1948.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Ivan Andreyevich Krylov, Russia’s fabulous fabulist (i.e. one who writes fables) authored “The Inquisitive Man” in the 19th century. It tells of a man who returns from a visit at a museum of natural history and recounts all the wonderful small animals he encountered, from butterflies to mosquitoes.&nbsp; “And what did you think of the elephant?” his listener prompts. “Elephant?,” our observer asks. “Are you sure they have an elephant?”</p> \n<p>From Russia, the proverbial “elephant in the room” journeyed to England and from there to America where, in the past half century, it has evolved to its contemporary meaning which Urban Dictionary describes as&nbsp; “A very large issue that everyone is acutely aware of, but nobody wants to talk about.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The lingering ill feelings from this summer’s heated confrontation over the Iran deal could have been mistaken at times for an elephant in the Oval Office and at the Washington Hilton ballroom where the General Assembly was held, but it wasn’t. Though most of the participants on both sides preferred to downplay its after-shocks, no one ignored the recent diplomatic melee altogether. Instead, the elephant in the room was actually Netanyahu himself, or, to put it more precisely, the words that come out of his mouth.</p> \n<p>It’s true that Netanyahu was greeted as a conquering Caesar in the grandiose ballroom of the National Building Museum, where he was lauded and feted by the conservative American Enterprise Institute: the audience hung on his every word. But in the White House, in Congress, in the media and even in the General Assembly, mostly the opposite was true: there Netanyahu’s statements were being greeted not with a grain but with mountains of salt, though everyone did their best to pretend otherwise.</p> \n<p>After all, no one seemed taken aback by the fact that just as the White House announced it was no longer on the agenda, Netanyahu suddenly turned into the two-state solution’s prime promoter. By the same token, hardly anyone raised an eyebrow when Netanyahu announced 48 hours later that there is no solution to the issues of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, without which, as everyone knows, the two-state solution is dead in the water anyway. And with the exception of a few Israeli journalists and Habayit Hayehudi leader, Minister Naftali Bennett, no one bothered to get excited about Netanyahu’s sudden floating of a unilateralist option on the West Bank at his appearance at the Center for American Progress, which is just as well because within a few hours he made clear that he wasn’t referring to anything serious anyway.</p> \n<p>And even as he was bobbing and weaving his way through these new zig zags and flip-flops, Netanyahu was still trying to make jaw-dropping corrections to some of his previous controversial statements. He was remorseful about his “Arab coming in droves” election-day drivel, which wasn’t meant to insult and was wrong “in the way it was said” or something, whatever. And even this clarification came only days, mind you, after Netanyahu insisted that he had no intention of exonerating Hitler from conceiving the extermination of European Jewry and blaming the mufti instead, even though this is exactly what he said, clear as day, from a written text, no ifs or buts about it.</p> \n<p>“I said it?” Netanyahu seems to be taunting. “Hub ich gezugt, as they say in Yiddish, so I said it. Now I’m saying the opposite.”</p> \n<p>The wide but unmentioned acceptance of Netanyahu’s ability to sound utterly convincing about something in the morning and then just as persuasive about the complete opposite in the evening explains the curt smiles with which administration officials reacted to his claims about a wonderful meeting and a stupendous conversation with the president. It even allowed them to square his decision to appoint a man who had called Obama an anti-Semite as his new PR manager with his declaration of a new dawn in relations with the White House. And it also helped participants in the General Assembly to quietly absorb calls for renewed Jewish unity after the Iran deal from the man who did more than anyone else to break it in the first place. &nbsp;“All politicians have a certain lack of self-awareness, it’s a prerequisite for the profession“ one delegate told me. “But Netanyahu is greatest of all.”</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, his disciples don’t call Netanyahu “the magician” for nothing: it is the creeping devaluation in the value of his words that actually proved essential to all-round efforts to bury the past, albeit close to the surface, and to pretend that everything was all behind us now. Under cover of his &quot;I didn’t intend this and I never meant that&quot; approach, Netanyahu diluted the memory of his apocalyptic warnings of the Iran deal as a clear and present existential danger, his comparisons to Munich and Chamberlain, his insistence that the Obama and the administration, as Republicans would put it, are throwing Israel under the bus. Yesterday’s sensational and provocative headlines, it seems, had turned into archaic slogans, empty words, traces of a time long gone and best forgotten, at least till the next confrontation erupts.</p> \n<p>Besides the GOP, which stuck to the mantra that Obama was treating Netanyahu “worse than an ayatollah in Iran,” as Marco Rubio described it in the party’s debate, Netanyahu’s newly cheerful outlook was also convenient for everyone involved. The Jewish community, still shell-shocked by the unprecedented internal strife that wracked it this summer, latched onto Netanyahu’s reassurances of a rapprochement with Obama to start its own internal healing; Netanyahu himself was able to claim resounding success, to gloat “I told you so” and to sick his dedicated followers on the defeatist leftist media that had promised fire and brimstone; and it allowed administration officials to finish the visit, which some had looked forward to like the plague, without any major flare-ups or incidents. “We’ll make do with Netanyahu’s statement that everything was hunky dory,” one of them said, drily.</p> \n<p>Still, it’s hard to dismiss conspiracy theorists that feel that this year’s eulogies for the late Yitzhak Rabin were pointedly replete with praise for his forthright honesty and complete credibility, unlike you know whom. Nor was it a coincidence that White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough chose the General Assembly podium, from which he spoke right after Netanyahu, to announce the upcoming official visit of President Reuven Rivlin. Unlike Netanyahu, whose sojourn was all business, Obama is likely to roll out a red carpet for Rivlin, who will likely be guest of honor at the traditional White House Hanukkah party.</p> \n<p>No one is ignoring the basic differences between Obama and Rivlin concerning the peace process, but that is not Rivlin’s brief anyway. The Israeli president’s ceremonial position will allow Obama to express his deep attachment to Israel without Netanyahu serving as the direct recipient or immediate beneficiary. Obama appreciates Rivlin’s stalwart stand on behalf of democracy and minority rights in Israel, admires his willingness to stand up for his values in the face of staunch criticism and esteems the fact that Rivlin is a man of his word. Oh, and he probably can’t resist the opportunity to get his sweet revenge on Netanyahu, in a dish best served just a little bit cold, as required.</p>",

Two smaller real estate companies are considering selling bonds in Tel Aviv. Property Markets Group, which is controlled by Kevin Maloney, is seeking a rating ahead of a planned bond issue with Rosario Capital managing the offering. And Yehezkel Strulowitz’s CS Real Estate Group is planning a sale based on its 2014 result, with Poalim-IBI managing. All told seven U.S. property companies are trying to sell bonds in Tel Aviv, taking advantage of very low interest rates.

Check Point had been forecast to earn $1.05 a share on revenue of $416 million, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Steinmetz was offering to buy some 500 million shekels ($127 million) of shares but on the condition that the bank take a haircut on the 1.7 billion shekels of loans the bank made to Fishman. That would have meant Leumi writing off hundreds of millions of shekels on the Fishman debt. And that’s because about 40% of JEC shares are serving as collateral for the Fishman loans. Fishman, who has been struggling with the drop in the ruble and its effect on his big Russian real-estate portfolio, is Leumi’s biggest problem borrower.

        "text":["<p>Abraham Lincoln delivered in 1858 his “A house divided against itself cannot stand” speech, the main theme of which was that only a crisis can lead to resolution. This is our situation, which poses the hard choice between bringing about a domestic crisis leading to a novel statecraft posture which is likely to succeed, or dithering, which preserves temporary political tranquility but is very likely to result in national decline, overcoming which will involve high costs.</p> \n<p>Some cleavages in a house divided against itself can be left for repair by historic processes, such as most of the integration of the ultra-Orthodox into Israeli society. But when facing cleavages which result in procrastination that endangers the future, then a crisis leading to decisive choice is required.</p> \n<p>This was the case in respect to slavery in the U.S. and French withdrawal from Algeria. Similarly, a domestic crisis, however severe, is clearly required for crystallizing Israel’s posture on permanent borders, which is essential for a serious peace process.</p> \n<p>The dallying negotiations with the Palestinians and the various “conflict management” proposals, while creating “facts” in the territories, are a clear symptom of lack of willingness by Israel’s political leadership to face the crises sure to be caused by serious efforts to settle in stages the Arab-Islamic Israeli-Jewish multidimensional conflict, including the Palestinian issue. But this can easily result in the decline of Israel until it reveres its statecraft.</p> \n<p>This lack of required statecraft has a number of causes, such as a misunderstanding of the regional momentum of the conflict, which cannot be redirected by an agreement with the Palestinians as such; thinking in terms of specific sub-issues instead of systems; concentration on “justice” and “historical rights” instead of real-political possibilities which are the key to the future; reliance on the United States, however in fact eroding; trust in Israel’s military strength, which is indeed impressive but by its very nature cannot cope with political and novel types of lethal attacks; baseless assessments that time works in favor of Israel; and a mystical element which I will present by a historic case: Philip II, King of Spain and Portugal, was warned before sending the Armada against England that bad weather was expected, but he responded that God will assure the success of an attack against the infidels.</p> \n<p>To all these the reverse of belief in an assured future must be added, namely fears − which have a strong basis in history that the very existence of Israel is endangered, that one cannot rely on others, and therefore one must not endanger national security by “gambling” with various peace agreements.</p> \n<p>But these conceptions underrate the importance of agreements as crucial components of the national security package, as illustrated by the peace with Egypt. Even more serious is the lack of awareness of the likelihood that Israel’s national security will be undermined by the absence of a substantive peace process. Therefore, first of all, realistic assessment of likely alternative futures is essential, with all their uncertainties, as is designing a radically innovative statecraft based on it.</p> \n<p>The assessment at which I arrived, after many years of study and involvement, is that without rapid progress in stages toward a regional agreement, the political-security situation of Israel will worsen, forcing us − after major national security crises − to agree to a bad agreement.</p> \n<p>However, if Israel will propose a credible regional peace plan then phased progress is likely toward normalization of relations with main Arab and Islamic states, together with reliable security arrangements and high global standing. The necessary Israeli “payment” (which is in any case nearly unavoidable in the longer run) includes withdrawal near to the 1967 border with exchange of territories, establishment of a quasi-sovereign Palestinian state and a novel regime for parts of Jerusalem (for instance, the standing of the Vatican does not diminish Italian overall rule over Rome).</p> \n<p>However, required is political courage to labor for a Middle East peace policy, including confronting domestic crises. Also needed is concentration of the political power essential for advancing in the proposed direction. This can be achieved by changing the Israeli political system into a kind of presidential one. But in the present regime too, a determined prime minister, who is willing to accept political risks as necessary for the future of the state, can mobilize the necessary support by a carefully prepared appeal to the public − perhaps setting up a new party (as done by Ariel Sharon) and, if necessary, utilizing a suitably designed referendum. Much can be learned on such possibilities from de Gaulle.</p> \n<p>Israel has another option supported by many, namely dithering. But, however convenient in the short term, this is sure to be counterproductive in the longer run, leading to national security crises and then to a settlement with much worse conditions for Israel than achievable by an Israeli peace initiative, as proposed.</p> \n<p>The choice is ours, between the short-term conveniences of domestic tranquility built on statecraft blindness, and between statecraft innovations essential for assuring our future but causing difficult domestic crises. The choice depends largely on the historic understanding, foresight, statecraft creativity and political nerve of the present prime minister or his successor.</p>",

She had written a series of articles for The New Yorker on the Eichmann trial, published in 1963 as a short book called “Eichmann in Jerusalem.”</p> \n<p>In what turned out to be one of the most famous reports of any trial, Arendt indicted the Jews who had aided the Nazis, the Judenr&auml;te, claiming there would have been fewer dead people had the Jewish leaders not been accomplices to the demands of the Nazis. She also indicted the State of Israel for turning the event into a show trial and missing the new legal category that Eichmann’s crime represented. Mostly, though, she seemed to let Eichmann off the hook of “radical evil” too easily, viewing his actions as the somewhat benign consequence of an inability to think for himself and understand the nature of his words and actions. (Her famous expression “the banality of evil” suggested that evil could be of an invisible and pervasive variety, coming not from diabolical psychological makeup, but from ordinary failures of thought, from the incapacity to think independently about what a moral action is, and from the habit of following orders.) In other words, instead of displaying what we would have expected from a Jew on such an occasion – undiluted horror at Eichmann’s deeds; unreserved compassion for the moral dilemmas of the Jewish leaders who dealt with the Nazis; solidarity with the State of Israel – Arendt analyzed each one with a cold sense of truth and justice, and blurred the moral terms in which these had been hitherto judged by the public.</p> \n<p>This, Scholem claimed, in a letter he wrote to Arendt on June 23, 1963, made Arendt’s intellectual position point to a lack of love for Israel. “So why does your book then leave behind such a feeling of bitterness and shame, and not with respect to that which is reported, but with respect to the reporter?” he wrote. “Why does your report cover over to such a large extent that which is brought forward in that book, which you rightly wanted to recommend for reflection? The answer, insofar as I have one, and which I cannot suppress, precisely because I esteem you so highly … [is] what stands between us in this matter … is the heartless, the downright malicious tone you employ in dealing with the topic that so profoundly concerns the center of our life [the Holocaust]. There is something in the Jewish language that is completely indefinable, yet fully concrete – what the Jews call ahavat Israel, love for the Jews. With you, my dear Hannah, as with so many intellectuals coming from the German left, there is no trace of it. I don’t have sympathy for the style of lightheartedness, I mean the English ‘flippancy,’ which you muster all too often … in your book. It is unimaginably unbefitting for the matter of which you speak … Was there really no place, at such an occasion, for what one might name with the modest German word Herzenstakt? [‘duty of the heart’].”</p> \n<p>Scholem’s response goes to the heart of what we may call the problem of the Jewish critique today. Scholem, like Arendt, had supported the idea of a binational state, yet here he reacted like other Zionist Jews, with dismay and anger. Scholem interpreted Arendt’s indictment of the Judenr&auml;te and of Israel as the expression of inappropriate, infuriating distance, and even, in his own words, “malice” and “heartlessness” (he could hardly have found worse accusations). Tone, then, is not a matter of opinion (they shared the same opinions); rather, it is what we pay attention to in those from whom we expect love and commitment.</p> \n<p>Arendt’s tone, Scholem suggested, lacked a priori closeness to the Jewish people, and such a tone is inappropriate in occasions in which the right thing is to refrain from telling all the truth, because there are moments when telling the truth should be subsumed under a duty of the heart. Scholem did not call for self-censorship, only for the same sense of appropriateness that makes us not talk about the defects of someone during his or her funeral. When so many are still mourning, stubborn truthfulness amounts to a sneer.</p> \n<p>Arendt was not intimidated and did not spare him in her answer: “How right you are that I have no such love, and for two reasons: First, I have never in my life ‘loved’ some nation or collective – not the German, French or American nation, or the working class, or whatever else might exist. The fact is that I love only my friends and am quite incapable of any other sort of love. Second, this kind of love for the Jews would seem suspect to me, since I am Jewish myself. I don’t love myself or anything I know that belongs to the substance of my being … [T]he magnificence of this people once lay in its belief in God – that is, in the way its trust and love of God far outweighed its fear of God. And now this people believes only in itself? In this sense I don’t love the Jews, nor do I ‘believe’ in them.”</p> \n<p>To Arendt’s ears, Scholem’s love of the Jewish people sounded like a call to collective narcissism. We now know she erred on many important facts central to her thesis; but facts would not have altered her basic and deep suspicion of “the nonreflexive, self-celebratory nature of group affiliations,” as historian Steven E. Aschheim put it. Thus, even if Scholem and Arendt had both supported Brit Shalom (a group which, in the 1920s and ’30s, favored Arab-Jewish coexistence in Palestine), here they parted company, precisely on the question of how close to the Jewish people Arendt’s tone of speech should be.</p> \n<p>To better grasp what should strike us here, let me refer to another debate, one that had taken place just a few years earlier in France, where another intellectual’s position had also generated a storm. Upon receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature in Stockholm in 1957, Albert Camus was interviewed by an Arab student about his positions on the Algerian war. He famously answered, “People are now planting bombs in the tramways of Algiers. My mother might be on one of those tramways. If that is justice, then I prefer my mother.”</p> \n<p>Camus’ statement provoked a ruckus in French intellectual circles. As Norman Podhoretz wrote, “When he declared that he chose his mother above justice, he was, as [Conor Cruise] O’Brien puts it, choosing ‘his own tribe’ against an abstract ideal of universal justice. A greater heresy against the dogmas of the left is hard to imagine.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, since the Dreyfus affair, at the end of the 19th century, intellectuals’ intervention in the public sphere had been defined by their claim to universality, a position that remained unchanged throughout the 20th century. Another commentator, Andrew Hussey, emphasized the point in a Literary Review article: “[Camus’] impassioned statement [about choosing his mother over justice] has been held up by generations of anti-colonialists and academic post-colonialist theorists – including the likes of Edward Said – as proof of Camus’s weak-mindedness and vacillating nature and, by extension, colonial arrogance toward Algeria.”</p> \n<p>I evoke here Camus’ example only to better highlight how the position of the contemporary Jewish intellectual differs from what we may call the position of the intellectual in Europe. What was anathema to the European intellectual – to defend one’s group and family against competing universal claims – is, in fact, what is routinely expected from the Jewish intellectual – by which I mean not only the intellectual of Jewish origins, but the one who engages in a dialogue with his/her community.</p> \n<p>I am, of course, perfectly aware there is a wide range of positions in the Jewish intellectual world – from the Zionist to the anti-Zionist via the religious Zionist and the liberal-secular. And yet within this diversity, there are structural constraints, push-and-pull forces that make the position of the Jewish intellectual somewhat unique. In trying to reflect on this position and its constraints, I will adopt Julien Benda’s definition of an intellectual. His 1927 treatise “The Betrayal of the Intellectuals” argued that intellectuals ought to remain above the fray of ordinary politics, and that detachment from one’s national, religious or ethnic group was the condition for the intellectual’s capacity to keep his moral integrity. That is because moral integrity, for Benda, is defined by universal values, which one can represent only by detachment from a particularist, national membership to a group.</p> \n<p>Arendt’s dismissal of ahavat Israel runs even deeper than her distaste for collective narcissism. It threatened what Arendt, and many other thinkers before her, defined as the very essence of thinking: namely, independence of mind. In the same letter to Scholem, without even trying to hide her sense of superiority, she averred: “What confuses you is that my arguments and my approach are different from what you are used to; in other words, the trouble is that I am independent. By this I mean, on the one hand, that I do not belong to any organization and always speak only for myself. And on the other hand, that I have great confidence in [Gotthold] Lessing’s selbstdenken [thinking for oneself] for which, I think, no ideology, no public opinion, and no ‘convictions’ can ever be a substitute. Whatever objections you may have to the results, you won’t understand them unless you realize that they are really my own and nobody else’s.”</p> \n<p>For Arendt, as for many other Enlightenment thinkers, the possibility of knowing the truth depended on the possibility of thinking on one’s own, unimpeded by prejudices and traditions. This independence gave her a crucial right: not to address the special historical situation of the Jewish people. If true thinking is defined by its independence, it must disregard the needs of her audience or group of reference. That is because remaining within the compass of a group’s own preoccupations would threaten the thinker’s capacity to withdraw from the world in a disinterested way. Arendt coined a striking expression to speak about such activity of thinking: “disinterested intelligence” – the capacity to detach oneself from one’s self-determinations and identity, to understand and judge the world from numerous perspectives, from outside oneself.</p> \n<p>Scholem was right: Arendt adopted the position that was most familiar to European Jewish intellectuals who had been, by and large, opposed to nationalism and for whom universalism and Lessing’s selbstdenken were almost synonymous: to think for oneself was to be a universalist, because it presupposed the capacity to see and understand humanity at large rather than to espouse the point of view of a specific group. Groups had narrow interests, and could only blunt the sharpness of disinterested intelligence.</p> \n<p>Even more than non-Jews, Jews had a fraught relationship with patriotism and nationalism, whose histories had run on parallel tracks to the history of racism. Moreover, the extension of universal rights had been the quickest road for the Jews to achieve equality in their national contexts. As the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman wrote, “Universality is the war-cry of the underprivileged ... [and] Jews were underprivileged.”</p> \n<p>But as Arendt would experience firsthand, the question of group solidarity came to haunt the Jewish intellectual with a new insistence, because of the two most important events of Jewish history of the last millennium: the Holocaust and the creation of the Jewish state. As an imagined community, the Jews reorganized themselves around a new geographical and political center – Israel – and around a new temporal axis – the memory of the Shoah – making the universalist position that the Jewish intellectual had hitherto taken far more difficult to hold.</p> \n<p>Even if some Jews remained universalists, from the 1960s onward, that universalism faced the two highly particularist demands of the State of Israel and the memorialization of the Shoah, and both renewed and even intensified the claims of ahavat Israel. As historian Pierre Birnbaum wrote, “[A] long history is probably coming to an end: that of the encounter of the Jews and the Enlightenment, conceived strictly on the universalist mode.”</p> \n<p>Arendt’s refusal to respond to the needs of her group and the fury her positions generated is only one of the many occurrences in a long list of hostile reactions by the organized Jewish community to critique, defined here as a sustained questioning of a group’s beliefs and practices. (For a superb discussion of these issues, see Idith Zertal’s 2005 book “Israel’s Holocaust and the Politics of Nationhood.”) In fact, over the last 30 years, one of the favorite exercises of various representatives of Jewish and Israeli communities has been to unmask the hidden anti-Zionist or anti-Jewish tenets of critique. I am not saying some of the critiques of Israel may not be motivated by anti-Semitism.I simply note that the suspicion of critique has become an elaborate cultural and intellectual genre in the Jewish world.</p> \n<p>Given that many of the members of that Jewish community do not profess strict religious dogma (and are thus dissimilar from the Muslims who issue fatwas against their intellectuals), this raises a puzzle. Why have moderately religious Jewish communities become so reluctant to perform what has characterized the ordinary task of intellectuals since Socrates: namely, to criticize and question the assumptions of their group in the name of universals? Why has it become so palpably difficult to criticize Israel or Jewish communities, even when Israel engages in blatant “marches of folly”? Scholem’s anger offers a hint: To be admissible, critique (of the Jewish people) must produce a code of love and solidarity.</p> \n<p>The politics of solidarity</p> \n<p>For sociologists, solidarity is an ordinary feature of any group, it is situated in the many rituals through which people act as members of a group, be it a tribe, a large country, or a university (public holidays, anthems, distinctive food or clothing style all mark group membership and solidarity). Ahavat Israel is a form of solidarity, but slightly differs from it. For one, it is an explicitly formulated injunction to love one’s group, whereas ordinary solidarity is invisibly embedded in social relations. The Talmudic sage Rabbi Akiva made the injunction of loving one’s neighbor into a rule, and his interpreters (Hazal, the sages) interpreted that rule as a commandment to love the close neighbor, the Jew. That interpretation became institutionalized in the 12th century by Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah.</p> \n<p>There is another difference between solidarity and ahavat Israel: the historical context of Rabbi Akiva’s injunction was the destruction of the Temple and the growing conflict between different Jewish sects, the persecution of Jews, the Second Diaspora, and the rise of Christianity. In that sense, ahavat Israel was more than solidarity. It was a self-conscious attempt to overcome divisiveness through the imperative of loving a threatened metaphysical, transhistorical and trans-geographical entity called the Jewish people. I would call ahavat Israel a form of hyper-solidarity, an imperative that was all the more moral in that it invited one to consciously, actively love one’s group and to protect it from self-destructive divisiveness and the threats of others.</p> \n<p>Cultural values can perpetuate themselves when they are institutionalized and reproduced in organizations. In becoming institutionalized, values become also ways of generating feelings (think, for example, of the “love of one’s country,” which remains abstract until it is institutionalized in concrete practices). Counterintuitively, I would argue that the imperative of ahavat Israel intensified in the period after World War II by way of three major institutions: the structure of American politics; the memorialization of the Holocaust; and Zionism.</p> \n<p>1.</p> \n<p>What is conventionally called the Israel Lobby – arguably the strongest one in American politics, along with the National Rifle Association – was the result of the encounter of the powerful cultural value of ahavat Israel with two key institutional features of American society: the fact that American politics is organized into interest groups; and the fact that immigrant minorities could legitimately hyphenate their citizenship (these two conditions are, for example, absent in France).</p> \n<p>The Israel Lobby started exercising its power on American politics with the Truman administration (see Jerome Slater’s blog for an in-depth discussion of John Judis’ book “Genesis: Truman, American Jews, and the Origins of the Arab/Israeli Conflict”), and basically went from strength to strength with the following administrations, enforcing everywhere the idea that American Jews had a natural bond of solidarity with Israel, and creating a powerful politics of solidarity through organizations like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and myriad other networks, both philanthropic and Zionist (e.g., one-year study programs at Israeli universities, Taglit-Birthright trips, the Hadassah organization, the Hillel organization on American campuses, and many others). John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt’s widely derided book “The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy” (2007) has exposed what it views as the detrimental effects of such lobbying on American foreign interests.</p> \n<p>But my point here is different: The Israel lobby institutionalized ahavat Israel in the space of American politics. Once it became institutionalized, it became a powerful, invisible, unspoken assumption of organized American-Jewish politics. In Mearsheimer and Walt’s original essay, published in the London Review of Books in March 2006, they quote an activist from a major Jewish organization: “It is routine for us [Jews] to say, ‘This is our policy on a certain issue, but we must check what the Israelis think.’ We as a community do it all the time.” Mearsheimer and Walt reported that when Edgar Bronfman – then president of the World Jewish Congress – wrote a letter to President George W. Bush in mid-2003, urging him to intervenewith Israel’s project to build a “security fence,” his move was deemed “obscene” by members of the Jewish community. In the eyes of many, the only function that the president of the World Jewish Congress should have is to lobby the president of the United States to support policies of the Israeli government.</p> \n<p>Clearly, then, the organized American-Jewish community translated ahavat Israel into the prime form of political expression. Such imperative of solidarity brings with it the injunction to not oppose or express publicly disagreement with official Jewish bodies. Rabbi Dr. David Luchins – who had been a Senate staff member for three decades – said it was “devastating” for American Jews to criticize Israeli policies “in front of U.S. politicians” or in ads in The New York Times. (Haaretz, August 2, 2004). The expression “in front of” reveals an unconscious and deep division between an in-group back stage, and a front-stage of non-Jews, a high “in-group” awareness, an inner injunction that the inside should be protected from the outside, an imperative of solidarity, and a belief that public critique fissures the strength of a vulnerable group. This basic in-group/out-group division in turn creates transnational bonds of solidarity and extends to world Jewry at large.</p> \n<p>2.</p> \n<p>The second element that played an enormous role in the consolidation of Jewish solidarity in conditions of modernity was the institutionalization of the memory of the Holocaust. Sometime during the 1970s and ’80s, liberal societies became increasingly uncomfortable with their colonial past and of the pan-European persecution of the Jews. They engaged in a politics of memorialization, recognizing through public apologies and rituals of memory the suffering that European powers had inflicted on their colonial minorities and on the Jews. Such political recognition of liberal societies resonated with changes within Jewish communities after World War II, who reorganized their identity around non-religious values.</p> \n<p>The memory of the Shoah became a source of secular identity for Jews, and was accentuated by the universalization of the Holocaust by liberal societies (non-Jews started appropriating the memory of the Shoah to promote their own universal values). The centrality of the Shoah for Jewish identity is largely confirmed by an October 2013 Pew Research Center survey, which asked young American Jews to define their Jewish identity. A staggering 73 percent answered that remembering the Holocaust was an essential part of their Jewish identity. Thus, the collective memory of the Shoah generated solidarity by becoming a form of, or a part of, Jewish identity.</p> \n<p>More than that, memory quickly became a devoir de memoire – a moral duty to remember, commemorate, identify with Jewish history. This memory in turn connected Jews to a central element of the moral vocabulary of modern societies: the victim.</p> \n<p>Victims (of political regimes, massacres, traumas, disasters) have become the central and uncontested moral figure of the post-1960s political culture, ironically helping Jews find the moral status they had lacked in a European culture that had, for centuries, demonized them. The exercise of memory had further and more subtle implications on Jewish solidarity. Through a displacement that is frequent in the collective unconscious of peoples and nations, Arab countries – which did not initially recognize the State of Israel and launched their own aggressive wars against it – would slowly replace the Germans’ threat to annihilate the Jews.</p> \n<p>Germany had become one of the most liberal countries in the world, had done a considerable amount of symbolic memorialization of the genocide they undertook, as well as taking financial responsibility for it, and was thus no longer a target of Jewish fear and mistrust. Arabs, however – who cultivated their own brand of anti-Semitism inside and outside Arab nations (see, for example, the virulent species of Muslim anti-Semitism currently in vogue in France) – could become the New Germans: the entity that for Jews now threatened to annihilate them. Drawing a straight historical line between the Nazis and the Arabs, fear constituted a strong axis of solidarity for Jews around the world.</p> \n<p>3.</p> \n<p>The third and final element that turned solidarity into the prime emotional and political motif of world Jewish communities was Zionism itself. As a nationalist ideology, Zionism became somewhat anomalous: Instead of ending with the creation of the state, it only gained in strength and scope. In fact, it became an ongoing project of identification, membership and belonging for Jews around the world, both inside and outside Israel. Through the wide-ranging and far-reaching activities of the Jewish Agency and myriad youth movements deployed in the Diaspora, Zionism extended its activities far beyond the borders of Israel, long after the creation of the state in 1948.</p> \n<p>Zionism became a permanent and transnational nationalist practice, creating and incessantly activating the conditions for identification with Israel among Jews. In that sense, it made belonging into a permanent condition of being Jewish, produced and reproduced by a large amount of Jewish institutions, events and organizations (the Jewish Agency, gala events, support for the Israel Defense Forces, philanthropic events, the very concept of aliyah and “return,” etc.). As Faisal Devji argues in “Muslim Zion,” his 2013 book about the making of Pakistan, “Zion is a political form rather than a holy land, one that rejects hereditary linkages between ethnicity and soil in favor of membership based on nothing but an idea of belonging.”</p> \n<p>My point is this: Beyond the real plurality of positions and interests that make up the Jewish community, the imperative of hyper-solidarity has been the dominant political ethos and pathos of contemporary organized Jewry. To paraphrase Carl von Clausewitz’s famous words, for the Jews, hyper-solidarity has been politics by other means.</p> \n<p>This is in sharp contrast to traditional forms of politics, which preoccupy themselves with questions of representation, limitations of power, the relationship between rulers and ruled, etc. The politics of hyper-solidarity, and hyper-solidarity as politics, are so deeply entrenched in Jewish liturgy, in philanthropic networks, in collective memory, in institutions linking Israel and the Diaspora communities, it has come to define and even overwhelm the moral, existential and epistemic reality of Jews, the filter through which questions of morality and truth are thought of and decided.</p> \n<p>What obstructs the realization that solidarity and belonging have been political strategies and a source of political strength is that solidarity is always a work of love, a moral enterprise and, by and large, we do not have a political vocabulary to criticize love. This double characteristic of solidarity – it is a source of both power and moral identity – explains why it is more difficult for the Jewish critic to find an institutional niche inside organized Jewish communities, why critique cannot be proffered. Rather, what is audible inside the organized Jewish community is only a critique that affirms its basic identification with, and love of, the Jews and Israel.</p> \n<p>A few examples come to mind. Ari Shavit’s recent book, evocatively titled “My Promised Land,” discusses the Nakba (“catastrophe” – what the Palestinians call their expulsion by the Jews when Israel was created), but still vehemently affirms and reaffirms throughout its unwavering commitment and love for the State of Israel. Or think of the efforts by American-Jewish liberals to show that their liberalism is an emanation of (presumably universalist) Jewish values rooted in the Bible, as if humanist and liberal values unconnected to Jewishness would disqualify their legitimacy. Or J Street, a liberal organization that defines itself as a political alternative to AIPAC. Jeremy Ben-Ami, the founder and chair of J Street, declared on the inauguration of the organization: “The party and the viewpoint that we’re closest to in Israeli politics is actually Kadima.”</p> \n<p>In other words, if an organization calling itself an alternative to the mainstream Jewish networks of solidarity defines its views on foreign policy as being closest to a party founded by members of Likud, such an organization clearly aims to consciously remain within the orbit and compass of Israeli conventional politics.</p> \n<p>These examples help us ask the following question: Why is it so difficult to criticize Israel from a greater distance? Why is critical detachment so difficult?</p> \n<p>Solidarity vs. Truth</p> \n<p>In his 1983 lectures on “Discourse and Truth,” French philosopher Michel Foucault became interested in an astonishing form of speech, which he called “parrhetic.” Parrhesia is that quality of speech whose impulse is to say the truth (and not, for example, to conceal, or to persuade or to want power). How do we know its impulse is to say the truth? Because telling the truth endangers the speaker, puts him/her at risk of being banished by his/her community or the sovereign. Parrhesia is the fearless speech one utters to someone who in turn has the possibility of punishing him/her for telling the truth (punishment can be real or symbolic).</p> \n<p>Because of this danger, Foucault argues that between the sovereign and the truth-speaker, a “parrhesiastic contract” is forged. This contract, he explained, “became relatively important in the political life of rulers in the Greco-Roman world” and consisted of the following: “The sovereign, the one who has power but lacks the truth, addresses himself to the one who has the truth but lacks power, and tells him: ‘If you tell me the truth, no matter what this truth turns out to be, you won’t be punished; and those who are responsible for any injustices will be punished, but not those who speak the truth about such injustices.’”</p> \n<p>Parrhetic speech appeared to be an important element of Athenian democracy, both for the rulers and citizens. It later became the mark of the wise sovereign, the one who was able to listen to the hard truths told by his adviser (as opposed to the foolish rulers who do not listen to difficult truths).</p> \n<p>Let me offer what can be nothing more than a speculation here: For most of their long history, Jews have not enjoyed political sovereignty, and thus did not develop cultural and political models for parrhetic contracts – by which the sovereign forgoes his power and listens to the truth (in other words, hears the critique of his power). While the image of the biblical prophet could have provided a model of parrhetic speech, its possible legacy was never exploited in the context of a politics of critique.</p> \n<p>On the contrary: Because exclusion and the halakha (Jewish religious law) forced on Jews a communal life contained within well-drawn ethnic and religious boundaries, preoccupied with the purity of Jewish blood, manifestations of solidarity were of paramount importance and substituted for politics. Moreover, after the 17th century fiasco of the false messianism of Shabbetai Zvi, Jewish communities became far more preoccupied with the false speech that pretends to say the truth, rather than with the question of the conditions for true speech. Let me offer the hypothesis that these two elements made cultural models of parrhetic contracts far less dominant in Jewish culture than in the non-Jewish one.</p> \n<p>Parrhesia is a speech that claims to say the truth, but changes its object according to the domain in which it is exercised. Sometimes it can be opposed to, say, Apollo’s silence; sometimes to the will of the people itself (as when one opposes demagoguery, or the flattery of the majority); and sometimes, as with Socrates, parrhesia is, as Foucault explains, “opposed to self-ignorance and the false teachings of the sophists.” Parrhetic speech does not always speak the same truth, but it speaks the truth that a specific community or sovereign does not want to hear.</p> \n<p>Following Foucault’s concepts, we may say then that the parrhetic speech of the Jewish intellectual is directed not to self-ignorance (as in Socrates) or to silence (Apollo), but to group solidarity, because, as Arendt rightly claimed, parrhetic speech is independent. If an intellectual is the one “who has the right, the duty and the courage to speak the truth,” then he is the one who takes the risk to breach solidarity with the group.</p> \n<p>The Jewish intellectual‘s dilemma is even more acute than that of the non-Jewish intellectual, because s/he is divided between two equally powerful and explicit moral imperatives: truth and solidarity. To put oneself in the position of speaking the truth is to undermine the solidarity of the group, found not only in the affirmation of love to the group, but also in the participation of its collective myths and stories.</p> \n<p>Finally, by definition, parrhetic contracts – those which legitimize critique – enable the critic to remain within the group. But in conditions of hyper-solidarity, to criticize is to forgo that solidarity, because critique always assumes a position of exteriority. When Arendt wrote to Scholem, “The injustice committed by my own people naturally provokes me more than injustice done by others,” she only defined the normal situation of parrhetic speech. But she was not granted the right to occupy the parrhetic position – that is, remaining inside the group while critiquing it. Indeed, “Eichmann in Jerusalem” was virtually banned in Israel until 2000, when it was finally translated into Hebrew.</p> \n<p>Critique in the Jewish world must either constantly provide proofs of love or must face accusations of anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, various forms of ostracism, black lists, media watch agencies, organizations such as Im Tirtzu monitoring course curricula and universities, philanthropic blackmail, etc.</p> \n<p>One could retort that critique of Israel is far more present in Israel than among Jewish communities in the Diaspora. This is correct. Here, too, Foucault is enlightening. In his analysis of Euripides’ “The Phoenician Women,” Jocasta – Oedipus’ mother – asks her son Polyneices what it feels like to be exiled.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Jocasta: This above all I long to know: What is an exile’s life? Is it great misery?</p> \n<p>Polyneices: The greatest; worse in reality than in report.</p> \n<p>Jocasta: Worse in what way? What chiefly galls an exile’s heart?</p> \n<p>Polyneices: The worst is this: right of free speech does not exist.</p> \n<p>Jocasta: That’s a slave’s life – to be forbidden to speak one’s mind.</p> \n<p>Polyneices: One has to endure the idiocy of those who rule.</p> \n<p>Jocasta: To join fools in their foolishness – that makes one sick.</p> \n<p>Polyneices: One finds it pays to deny nature and be a slave.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Exile, says Polyneices, prevents you from speaking the truth fearlessly. Only being at home provides the conditions for fearless speech, perhaps precisely because only political homes and sovereigns create parrhetic contracts and enable critics to remain inside the group while looking at it from the outside. We are then compelled to conclude that while most of the liberal nations in which Jews live are far more liberal than Israel, their Jewish communities are far less liberal in their toleration of dissent than Israel.</p> \n<p>Some, like U.S. philosopher Michael Walzer, would argue that it is the responsibility of the critic to be heard in such a way as to remain inside the group. The best critics, Walzer claims, are those who speak in a tone that feels close and familiar to the group he criticizes; the best critics rebuke their fellows in the name of the values their group holds dear, and does not speak from radical detachment (like Arendt, for example). But Walzer does not ask if some communities make it easier to remain inside their compass while critiquing them. He does not ask which contracts must exist for a critic’s voice to feel close and familiar to the members of the community s/he addresses. He does not ask if some communities do not make more demands of closeness than others. Surely, not only critics but also their communities must be scrutinized for the extent to which they enable or deny the right to criticize them.</p> \n<p>Before I conclude, let me confess this: I am moved by Scholem’s anguish. Like him, I believe there are such things as duties of the heart (herzenstakt). These duties are the informal codes that regulate our sense of appropriateness, how we mark our respect and care in delicate and painful circumstances.</p> \n<p>Should the intellectual care about tact and taste? As Scholem suggested, the Jewish people aches and we request from you that you suspend your cold examination and participate with us in this pain. One does not criticize a person at their funeral. Scholem invokes a tacit code of honor in which one should not attack someone who is weak or add pain to a long-standing history of suffering.</p> \n<p>A striking example of such tact can be found in Raymond Aron, the great Jewish-French intellectual. A few years after Arendt wrote with restrained passion about Israel, on June 7, 1967 – after the onset of the Six-Day War – Aron wrote in Le Figaro: “Statecide, of course, is not genocide. The French Jews who gave their soul to all the black, brown or yellow Revolutionaries now feel great pain when their friends scream their fear of death. I suffer like them not because we have become Zionists or Israelis, but because an irresistible movement of solidarity rises in us. And it does not matter where such movement comes from [emphasis added]. If the great powers, according to their own cold and interested calculations, let that small state that is not mine get destroyed, this crime, which will be small in regard to the world, would take away from me any desire to live and I believe that millions and millions of men would be ashamed of their humanity.”</p> \n<p>Aron makes clear that Israel is not his country; he remains French. And yet he says in heartrending terms that if Israel ceased to exist, he would not have the strength to keep living. Solidarity here is not a principled or systematic position, but an instinct activated by a unique historical event. It is not politics, not an institution, but a movement of the heart, the trace of a noninstitutional memory, a supreme form of tact, knowing what to do and say in the right circumstances – not because of an a priori ideological position, but because in extreme circumstances, one simply knows for whom one’s heart beats faster.</p> \n<p>In the public sphere, herzenstakt is that ineffable capacity to balance the urge to speak the truth with the recognition of someone else’s actual or potential distress. In that sense, Arendt lacked tact, and infuriatingly so. But she and Scholem’s exchange opened a much-needed debate on the brutal demands of love that the politics of solidarity makes. Jewish intellectuals must resist these demands. When distress becomes institutionalized and memory routinized, the duties of the heart become the handmaidens of ordinary politics. When solidarity becomes a form of politics, it should be treated as politics: we should look for its interests and strategies, for the myths it builds, for the people it excludes and for the injustices it creates. Solidarity can never be demanded a priori by institutions, nations or communities; it should never be the default mode of a group. It can be only the end point of citizens’ relations to just nations and just institutions.</p> \n<p>If the contemporary Jewish intellectual has an urgent task, then, it is to unveil the conditions under which Jewish solidarity should or should not be accepted, debunked or embraced. In the face of the ongoing, unrelenting injustices toward Palestinians and Arabs living in Israel, his/her moral duty is to let go, achingly, of that solidarity.</p> \n<p>This essay was originally a 2014 Andrea and Charles Bronfman Lecture in Israeli Studies, at the University of Toronto.</p>",

        "text":["<p> Perhaps the boldest image in Yael Bartana’s bracing new exhibit at the Friedrich&nbsp;Petzel Gallery in New York (also showing concurrently in Berlin) is a self-portrait of the artist as Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstal.</p> \n<p> It’s a startling picture, and not because it’s sweeping and grand, like her cinematic videos or her floor-to-ceiling neon sculpture beaming, “Black stars shed no light” as you enter.</p> \n<p> This subdued self-portrait, dimly lit and monochromatic save for a shock of hot-red lipstick, makes a statement mostly because it is dark and seductive – and displayed at a time like this, marked by solemn Holocaust commemorations, and on the heels of the Charlie Hebdo massacre and the killings at a kosher market in Paris, unity rallies, and heated debate over the fine line between political correctness and freedom of expression, bigotry and genocide, satire and censorship.</p> \n<p> Of course, Bartana didn’t know any of this was going to happen when she began to create this work, much as she didn’t know the media would be declaring a Polish Jewish renaissance after the recent opening of the Museum of the History of the Polish Jews when, as that Warsaw museum was just breaking ground, she embarked on the filming of her video trilogy “And Europe Will Be Stunned.”</p> \n<p> But that’s what makes Bartana arguably one of the most profound Jewish artists of her day: She has an uncanny ability to tap into the zeitgeist, exploring and manipulating pictures, words and symbols to question issues that are fundamental to these troubling times and to her – an Israeli artist living in the Diaspora, dealing with issues of Jewish identity versus assimilation, wondering where national pride ends and xenophobic hatred begins, and trying to make sense of the fervor of religious and political youth movements that have shaped modern Jewish existence, both positively and negatively.</p> \n<p> In a sense, all those issues come to the fore in her self-portrait.</p> \n<p> “My friends call me Yaeli Riefenstahl,” she says in her dry, self-deprecating way, on a recent trip to New York. “Can I say that? I guess I’m forming a new message by taking apart the propaganda.” And by that, she’s not just referring to her self-portrait.</p> \n<p> Her new exhibit, on through February 14 in New York (and two weeks later in Berlin), features two videos – “Inferno,” a film shot in the grand cinematic style of biblical epics, about a Brazilian Pentecostal sect that’s attempting to rebuild the Temple of Solomon in Sao Paolo, and “True Finn,” a reality-TV type project, in which a group of ethnically diverse Finnish citizens attempt to forge a new, national identity – is all about reframing sociocultural and geopolitical dialogues.</p> \n<p> As a result of her endeavors, Bartana is frequently misunderstood and often hailed by the very people of whom she is critical. Her video trilogy “And Europe Will Be Stunned,” for example, crashed together Polish and Zionist symbols, reimagined early kibbutz utopianism within the confines of a stark barbed-wire compound in Poland, and pictured the leader of her fictionalized Polish Jewish renaissance movement holding rallies in a vacant stadium, urging three million Jews to return to Poland.</p> \n<p> Bartana also cast real-life activist Sawomir Sierakowski, founder and chief editor of&nbsp;Krytyka Polityczna magazine, in the lead, and invited Israeli media personality/journalist Yaron London and children’s book writer and illustrator Alona Frankel, a Krakow-born Holocaust survivor, to deliver speeches in the film, further blurring the line between truth and fiction, the real and the surreal, propaganda and truth.</p> \n<p> The sum total was a far more pessimistic view of the possibility of a Jewish revival in Poland than the current media hoopla would have you think. Ironically, Israel’s cultural minister shunned the work when it was shown at the Polish pavilion at the 2011 Venice Biennale.</p> \n<p> Last summer, Bartana found herself on the opposite side of the fence, targeted by activists supporting BDS (the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement) and who demanded that the Israeli government withdraw its sponsorship when she participated in an exhibit at a gallery in Scotland. Such is the plight of the Israeli artist who dares to show abroad and examine her status as “the other.”</p> \n<p> “When I was exploring Poland before I made ‘And Europe Will Be Stunned,’ I went along on the annual pilgrimage to [the icon of the Virgin Mary] ‘The Black Madonna of Czestochowa,’” Bartana says. “There I was, in the midst of this Catholic procession, the very embodiment of everything these people bearing crosses and statues of Mary were against: a Jew, a lesbian, an Israeli. I thought, if they only knew.”</p> \n<p> That same feeling of estrangement informs her current exhibit.</p> \n<p> ‘You can’t escape guilt’</p> \n<p> “Being a Jew living in Germany, you can’t escape the Holocaust and the national guilt over it,” says Bartana, 44, who’s raising a son in Berlin with her German partner, and who has no direct connection to the Shoah (her family emigrated from Poland, Belarus and Lithuania in the 1920s). “The use of Nazi symbols is strictly forbidden in Germany. So for me, wearing the taboo is like returning to the crime scene, trying to find closure.”</p> \n<p> But resolution is the very antithesis of what she accomplishes. Like a true post-modernist – and a good Jew – Bartana answers her query with more questions than she asks, leaving her work open-ended.</p> \n<p> Unlike the famous Riefenstahl self-portrait on which hers is based, Bartana isn’t crouching down, gazing into the lens of a Leica that’s directed somewhere else. She’s pointing the camera and one eye at you – shattering the illusion of the photograph, rejecting her role as the passive subject, shaking you out of your voyeuristic complacency. Do you look away? Do you stare back? Do you look within?</p> \n<p> “I’m also wearing an Israeli military cap,” she adds. “So I’m including a piece of my past, too. I was an Israeli soldier for two years.” Does the Zionist symbol negate the impact of the Nazi uniform, or are they deadlocked into an absurdist dialogue? Is her pose an act of futility, self-sabotage or a victory over past demons?</p> \n<p> Regardless of the outcome, this is not the first time an Israeli has ventured into the taboo turf of SS role-play. “I call this portrait ‘Stalag’,” says Bartana, referring to the Nazi-exploitation genre of comics that sprung up in Israel during the 1950s and ‘60s.</p> \n<p> These comics were popular among teenage boys of survivors, who found them to be an outlet for the pent-up angst they developed from growing up in homes where the silence surrounding their parents’ horrifically violent pasts loomed large. They found a strange solace in these graphic revenge fantasies. (The Israeli government banned these pornographic page-turners as soon as the Eichmann trial got underway.)</p> \n<p> Bartana isn’t so much following in the Stalag footsteps as she is trying to wrestle with the confounding reality of being an Israeli living in Germany, where the brutal past is ever-present, but where an unspoken guilt casts a tragic pall over daily life.</p> \n<p> “The clash of the beauty and the atrocity is something we still cannot grasp, looking at the Nazi propaganda machine,” says Bartana. “The power of manipulation and the seduction.”</p> \n<p> However earnest her attempt to understand the mechanism of propaganda, she also pokes fun at the salacious Stalag genre.</p> \n<p> “Humor is a big part of my work,” she says, “though I don’t know if people see it.”</p> \n<p> If they don’t detect irony in her self-portrait, they’d be blind not to see it in her video work and its accompanying signage in the exhibitions in New York and Berlin.</p> \n<p> 'Who is a Finn?'</p> \n<p> “True Finn,” a hybrid of MTV’s “The Real World” and Finland’s “Extreme Escapades,” is a parody of sorts, and seems thoroughly Scandinavian until you realize that Bartana borrowed the famous discourse of &quot;Who is a Jew?&quot; to &quot;Who is a Finn?&quot;</p> \n<p> In so doing, the film addresses weighty issues such as genocide, at its core, in between the cackles and the folkloric kitsch. (Think peasant costumes and even someone dressed up as a bear.) Bartana was commissioned to create a work of art that would explore Finnish national identity. She chose to do so by creating an experiment in communal living among eight ethnically diverse participants, examining whether sublimating their cultural identities was a prerequisite to forging a new national one.</p> \n<p> While researching the location where her contestants would reside, she discovered the remote spot had once been home to a Roma population, leading her to source old footage of the Gypsy population in her 2013 film. She also had her contestants create a new Finnish anthem — thus the line “Black stars shed no light,” pictured in neon signage at the gallery entrance. It’s the sort of tragi-comic sensibility only a Diaspora Jew like Bartana might bring.</p> \n<p> For “Inferno,” she literally decamped to Sao Paolo to film a facsimile of the Temple of Solomon being built by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of Christ, employing helicopters to shoot from various angles. She relied on computer generated images to complete her film because the Pentecostal sect hadn't finished erected its temple yet.</p> \n<p> Like most of her work, Bartana used a real-life occurrence as a springboard for her hyper-real musings on religion and cultural identity. In this case, she cast Brazilian actors to play the parts of the sect’s high priests and worshippers, writing a script that examines the consequences of exporting sacred ground and religious artifact to a place, people and time that are a total departure from the original. Can you retrofit the Bible for one’s own purposes or does it lead to a corruption of meaning? Spoiler alert: This temple gets destroyed a third time.</p> \n<p> It's easy to see the parallel between this Sao Paolo cult and Israel's far-right zealots, who adhere to a literal interpretation of the Bible. But in her wry manner, Bartana wrestles with these predicaments with a nod and a wink, this time to Cecil B. DeMille’s “The Ten Commandments,” never pushing any particular agenda other than her desire to examine the consequences of taking religious fervor out of context.</p> \n<p> “We tend to disregard other narratives to justify our own actions and our own set of beliefs,” Bartana says. “But we must look at other narratives. If there’s one message behind all my anti-propaganda, it is: Don’t take anything as fact.”</p> \n<p> Tellingly, she ends “Inferno” with a scene shot in front of a replica of the Western Wall. A devout man suddenly casts off his prayer shawl, revealing giant wings, the symbol of the Israeli Air Force, tattooed on his back, as an ethnically diverse group of young men and women who look plucked from a United Colors of Benetton commercial mix, and mingle with a Christ-like figure in a priestly robe and a crown of thorns on his head, sipping from coconuts with menorah logos. In the background, a vendor hawks T-shirts of the holy temple, as a donkey strides among the crowds.</p> \n<p> Such a scene could never occur in modern-day Israel. Men and women are segregated at the Wall. Modesty laws are strictly enforced. One can’t traipse about with drink in hand as if at a cocktail party, chitchatting with biblical figures sprung back to life – but wouldn’t that be fun?</p> \n<p> “It’s part Utopian, part ridiculous,” says Bartana with a chuckle.</p> \n<p> But perhaps it’s no more ludicrous than what she discovered as she was having a fictional map of Jerusalem drawn to accompany “Inferno” at the gallery. The map, hung in the entrance area, is a playful sendup of the classic map of Jerusalem, which Bartana discovered was rendered by Heinrich Bunting, a 16th-century cartographer and protestant pastor from Hannover, Germany, not far from where she currently resides.</p> \n<p> “He had never been to Jerusalem and based the map of the Old City on a flower of Hannover, a clover, with three petals that symbolize the holy Trinity,” she explains. “Jerusalem is the center, and three continents are pictured like flower petals.”</p> \n<p> In other words, Bunting’s map is no more valid a representation of Jerusalem than the fake temple in Sao Paolo. Bartana's map riffs on Bunting’s, but includes three more continents — Australia and North America, where many Holocaust survivors wound up, and Sao Paulo, aka “New Jerusalem” — as well as a fishing vessel used to illegally transport Jewish refugees to Palestine after the Holocaust, World War II fighter jets with dollar-sign logos, helicopters airlifting the menorah and temple to Brazil, and other symbols and images borrowed from her film, like the Brazilian high priest using the telltale hand signs of the cohanim, the biblical high priests.</p> \n<p> “It’s the most Jewish work I’ve ever done,” says Bartana. “It’s been a real journey for me because I’m really quite secular. I speak Hebrew to my son and spend a lot of time there with family and make sure he knows Israel’s his home, but...”</p> \n<p> Does Bartana even consider herself Jewish?</p> \n<p> She pauses. “Yes, but I guess I’m still trying to find the Jewish in me. I certainly feel closer to it than I ever did,” she says. “I don’t think Finnish people wake up everyday and wonder, am I a Finn? But identity is something all Jews grapple with, whether we want to or not. “</p> \n<p> Especially now.</p>",

        "text":["<p> Psychologists say that times of grave crisis can be times of great growth. Unless, of course, we simply learn to live with the dismal, the maddening, the abusive.</p> \n<p> Unless we find ways to rationalize or deny or armor ourselves off from a dying of spirit, the deadening of hope, the death of love.</p> \n<p> Which brings us to the state of Israel. And the state of the Jewish heart. I used to hear that phrase, a yiddishe hehrtz, a lot when I was small. It meant something specific and at the same time, enormously inclusive and human in nature. It had nothing to do with looking down on other people, people different from us. Nor did it have anything to do with the Yiddish of Europe as opposed to, say, Ladino or Judeo-Moroccan, or Hebrew, or other languages spoken by Jews who lived other places.</p> \n<p> In fact, the Jewish heart, in this sense, was meant to be the very opposite of the idea that we were better than / nothing like / legitimately and permanently targets for, and thus enemies of, the people who were different from us.</p> \n<p> Here in the Holy Land, there are many people - some of them Jews, some of them not, some of them Israelis, some of them not - who have just that yiddishe hehrtz. We deported some of them this week.</p> \n<p> On a decision made in a back room of the Prime Minister's Office we have also denied some of them the right to convert to Judaism, despite their express request and desire.</p> \n<p> Others - people who are so publicly lacking in a yiddishe hehrtz that you wonder if they have a heart at all - we have not only kept here in Israel, we let them run the country. No matter what they say. No matter what they do. No matter how they act.</p> \n<p> No matter whom they injure, slander, neglect or - without just cause - jail. No matter how incompetent, arrogant, unfeeling, relentlessly demagogic and mercenary we all know they are.</p> \n<p> No matter if their actions cause needless deaths to our neighbors the Palestinians and our family the Israelis. No matter. They stay. And they decide who needs to go.</p> \n<p> Eli Yishai decides.</p> \n<p> This is the man at whose urging, Israel is building the largest detention camp in the world. This is a man who has consistently undermined and denigrated and acted to counter, any chance of a negotiated peace with the Palestinians.</p> \n<p> Eli Yishai’s not going anywhere. Nor is MK Anastasia Michaeli, whose execrable remarks against gays and lesbians border on the insane. Nor is MK Miri Regev, nor MK Danny Dannon, nor MK Michael Ben-Ari, nor other public servants who serve nothing so much as the cause of racism.</p> \n<p> All of them demand that Palestinians recognize Israel as a specifically Jewish country. And all of them, in the heartlessness of their words and actions, suggest that at heart, in respects of crucial matter, this country no longer is.</p> \n<p> Israel may slant rights to favor Jews, and slant Judaism to favor the Orthodox, American-Israeli writer and activist Moriel Rothman wrote this week. However, he wrote, the Israel of today “is not a Jewish state in any value-based - or valuable -way.”</p> \n<p> “The Torah, the backbone of the Jewish people and religion, has a wide range of commandments and imperatives, some chauvinistic and some universalistic, some peaceful and some violent, some which contradict others. However, the most repeated commandment in the Torah, appearing in different forms 37 times, is the imperative to ‘love the stranger,’ for we were strangers in the land of Egypt.”</p> \n<p> How did we reach this point? By making a choice. By deciding that the Jewish state – the state that runs on tank treads and blindness to occupation and acceptance of monopolistic, corrupt, klal yisrael-hating Orthodoxy – takes precedence over the Jewish heart.</p> \n<p> In 2008, Yehezkel Dror, founder of the Jewish People Policy Institute think tank, pointed a way to this doctrine in a Forward newspaper opinion piece, titled, “When Survival of the Jewish People Is at Stake, There’s No Place for Morals.”</p> \n<p> The thesis has since been vastly expanded, notably by radical and some mainstream Orthodox rabbis, each excising the Jewish heart from Israel, edict by racist edict. “Show the goyim no mercy,” the then-chief rabbi of the IDF instructed soldiers sent to fight in Gaza. “Don’t rent to the goyim,” other state-salaried rabbis instructed their parishoners. “Don’t let your daughters talk to the goyim.” All in the service of a Judaism that Jews around the world find increasingly alien, mean-spirited, exclusionist. Un-Jewish.</p> \n<p> On Thursday, ultra-Orthodox men in Bet Shemesh, enforcing an extreme code of what they call “modesty,” threw rocks at a woman and her seven-month-old infant. At Judaism’s holiest site, police detained a woman for wearing a prayer shawl and praying “out loud” by the Western Wall.</p> \n<p> I look at this country and I see an old love. A love truly as old as Judaism itself. I know that things get warped in love. Hearts, as well. And who am I to say what’s Jewish about things like justice for non-Jews?</p> \n<p> Just a Jew. Nothing more, but unwilling to be seen as less.</p> \n<p> Just a Jew who’s had his fill of talk of Jewish survival through deportation, occupation, and belligerence. Not a pacifist. But a strong believer in true self-defense. We’re beginning to see that there’s a limit to the extent that this country can survive its own survival mechanisms.</p> \n<p> Of late, a petition has been going round the internet, to tell the prime minister to fire the inciters in his midst and deal justly with the African refugees. It’s worth a look. There’s something about it that suggests a yiddishe hehrtz.</p> \n<p> It’s time that Just Jews used their outside voices.</p> \n<p> No one in Israel, or in the world Jewish community, should be forced to make a choice between a Jewish heart and a Jewish state.</p> \n<p> In the end, though, if we don’t make a choice for the Jewish heart, we stand to lose both.</p>",

        "text":["<p> The photographs of Roi Kuper would seem to be the most solid of the “6 Artists – Six Projects” exhibition by contemporary Israeli artists at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, marking the institution’s jubilee. All six projects (three of which were reviewed last week) revel in the aberrant and the grotesque. Most of them deal with the tense relationship between the economy and nationalism, between regime and private sentiment. Constraints and limitations, integral to the works’ content, are overt, and so too are creative inventions and bypasses intended to overcome them. This is especially the case in Kuper’s exhibition.</p> \n<p> Under the title “Gaza Dream,” Kuper set out last spring to photograph the Gaza Strip from the four points of the compass. “The resulting landscapes show fields, the sky, and occasionally a barely perceptible line of houses,” the curator, Noam Gal, observes on the museum’s website (in English). Indeed, the photographs have the simplicity of a child’s painting, showing the line of the earth and the line of the sky, and in between, life. In the multiplicity of squares, built-up areas, barely visible, shimmer as a narrow strip, a mirage, a mysterious Rothko-like blur. “A city perched beyond the horizon,” in Kuper’s words.</p> \n<p> Kuper set up his tripod a few kilometers from the fence, at places allowed by the Israeli army. What we see, through his eyes, is our maximum geographic – and mental – proximity to Gaza. Every frame visually reconstructs the degree of authorization, meaning the degree of security restrictions. It’s counted in meters and converted into a landscape image. In fact, Kuper’s project lacks the western perspective: the army wouldn’t allow him to photograph Gaza from the sea. So the circle is incomplete, broken.</p> \n<p> Nostalgic and lyrical</p> \n<p> Uri Gershuni, too, turns his gaze on the unobservable, but in a different sense, as he continues his journey in the wake of the English scientist William Henry Fox Talbot. His previous exhibition, in a Tel Aviv gallery (Haaretz, February 20, 2015), followed his visit to Talbot’s home in England and was a reconstruction of Talbot’s first photographs. This time it’s a virtual visit, undertaken through Google Street View. Gershuni turns the village scenes shot from the computer screen into cyanotypes – photographs printed via a technique that tints them blue.</p> \n<p> In the previous set of photographs, time appeared to stop. Here, though, there are cars, tourists, street signs, all bearing a contemporary character.</p> \n<p> The title of the exhibition, “Apollo and the Chimney-Sweeper,” derives from something Talbot wrote about the instrument he invented, the camera, as he contemplated a cityscape he had photographed in Paris in the early 1840s: “A whole forest of chimneys borders the horizon: for, the instrument [the camera] chronicles whatever it sees, and certainly would delineate a chimney-pot or a chimney-sweeper with the same impartiality as it would the Apollo of Belvedere” – referring to a Roman sculpture of the god of the sun.</p> \n<p> Talbot grasped photography’s cold nature, its inbuilt non-judgmental and amoral character, its disinterested democratic potential. Gershuni’s photographs possess a nostalgic, lyrical dimension. They are blurred poetically, atmospherically, as though bent on recapturing an innocence that never existed.</p> \n<p> Income game</p> \n<p> The disappointing exhibit in the “6 Artists” project is Tamir Lichtenberg’s “Package Deal.” As he has done before, Lichtenberg exteriorizes the deal that’s usually made behind the scenes and turns it into the work of art itself. After opening and managing a kind of art store in one Tel Aviv gallery, and then selling the contents of his late grandmother’s home in another gallery, he invited 12 art collectors to pay him the average monthly salary in Israel, in return for which they would get a “pig in a poke” (as Lichtenberg put it) – a box containing everything the artist collected and created that month. The items included junk found in the street, video clips, sketches and notes, photographs, parts of furniture, Word files and discarded accessories. It’s an “income game,” in the words of the curator, Aya Miron.</p> \n<p> The packages are displayed in a jumble within a chaotic labyrinth. “Lichtenberg resurrects these disregarded objects, drawing attention to the layers of meaning they have accumulated,” Miron writes. “Seeking to cast doubt, raise questions, and change reality, he trawls the Internet and his physical surroundings for signs from the past as well as contemporary messages.” This time, though, the magic doesn’t work. The junk doesn’t morph into a heap of principle, and the areas in the exhibition space don’t take on varying degrees of quality, climate, frame of mind.</p> \n<p> Above all, the work appears to be an homage to Kurt Schwitters’ “Merzbau” – which takes its name from a torn fragment from an ad for a big German bank, the Commerzbank – a compilation of scraps of paper, wood, train tickets, nails, newspapers, cigarettes, string, stamps and other objects, which he piled up in his home in Hanover as invasive elements for 14 years (1923-1937). He then repeated this in Norway. And again in England. It’s interesting to draw a comparison between the work process, philosophy and way of life that are embodied in Schwitters’ work and Lichtenberg’s proposal to the collectors, not least in regard to the ways in which an artist buys himself “freedom.” In this case, though, the artist seems to have relied overmuch on magic that would be created of itself, as well as on the Duchamp heritage, according to which any junk the artist picks up is thereby elevated.</p> \n<p> There is something of a gimmick quality about the project – because, if the joke’s on the greedy collectors who are willing to pay sight unseen, why did Lichtenberg take the trouble to prepare attractive packages for them? And if the packages aren’t attractive, if Lichtenberg sold them junk, why does he present them as delightful archival objects?</p> \n<p> An additional problem with Lichtenberg’s exhibition is that it is suffused with the artist’s spirit, but contains nothing about the other participants. They are only mentioned by name laconically at the entrance to the space. But it’s the purchasers who arouse one’s curiosity. Why did they agree to take part? Do they feel an obligation to ensure the livelihood of artists by dint of their status as collectors? What do they think about the implicit idea that collectors should pay artists steady wages, turn them into salaried employees and provide them with job stability (instead of buying objects from them)?</p> \n<p> Is this a work relationship? Are the collectors pleased with the packages they received? Would they admit it to the artist and to us if they were not satisfied? Are they envious of other packages? Do they think the project enhances their reputation as risk-takers and sporting types?</p> \n<p> Lichtenberg brought his collectors into the Israel Museum through the front door, but left them to languish as quiescent wallets. As the exhibition deals directly with the question of financing art and artists, the question arises whether the result is worth the budget. It’s not a question of yielding to the creative spirit, but of a yield on an investment.</p>",

        "text":["<p>&quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; is not an instruction guide for killing your father and sleeping with your mother. It does not come with a consumer warning. Nor is &quot;Medea&quot; a manual for killing your offspring – no &quot;don’t try this at home&quot; label&nbsp;necessary with the shipment from Amazon.</p> \n<p>But according to Israel's minister of education Naftali Bennett, novels merely serve an ideological function, and young readers are just passive recipients of their literal messages. Bennett has upheld the decision&nbsp;of the Education Ministry to take Dorit Rabinyan’s 2014 novel &quot;Borderlife,&quot; off the reading list&nbsp;of high schools in Israel. The ministry has ruled that &quot;young people of adolescent age tend to romanticize and don’t, in many cases, have the systemic vision that includes considerations involving maintaining the national-ethnic identity of the people and the significance of assimilation.&quot;&nbsp;The Orwellian shorthand for the ministerial doublespeak: if you read this, you’ll marry out.&nbsp;And: Big Brother knows better.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bennett may realize that he’s just scoring cynical political points, but there are troubling conceptions of both literature and the process of reading at the root of the ban, as well as an insidious attempt to close the Israeli mind. The ministry is not wrong for pointing out the relationship between literature and ethics, but when literature becomes just a vehicle for morality – systemic visions&nbsp;– it becomes bad literature, or the opposite of literature, just polemic, political dogma.</p> \n<p>To paraphrase the poet John Ashberry, the worse the literature, the easier it is to simplify, and then moralize, the step right before indoctrination. When the Renaissance poet, Phillip Sidney, wrote about poetry providing a golden world,&nbsp;he did not mean a romanticized ideal in the vulgar sense of the education ministry (whose spokesperson would benefit from re-taking freshman composition), but that poetic worlds give an opportunity for reflection, for the appreciation of different perspectives through recourse to imaginative alternatives.</p> \n<p>I have not yet read Rabinyan’s &quot;Borderlife,&quot;&nbsp;but I gather that the romantic relationship between Liat and Hilmi, the Israeli and Palestinian protagonists, is complicated, even vexed, not a cartoon rendering, but a literary one – requiring the judgement of the reader. As John Stuart Mill wrote in &quot;On Liberty,&quot; &quot;Judgement is given to men that they may use it.&quot;&nbsp;Mill understood the connection between critical judgment – exercised through reading – and liberty.</p> \n<p>Our politicians, however, prefer singular meanings and easily digestible and singular truths, with books that match their cynically impoverished view of their reading electorate, the kind of political subjects who don’t exercise their judgement or liberty. Education – a risky business to be sure – should not inculcate messages,&nbsp;but rather cultivate a sensitivity to complexity, the possibility of different worlds than the ones we daily inhabit.</p> \n<p>Indeed, participating in a world of the novelist’s creation – the fantastic gift of the imagination – does not mean just imitating it. If it did, I would have to grab the copy of &quot;Matilda&quot; from my 10 year old for fear that he might follow Roald Dahl’s protagonist, and disrespect his parents in unspeakable ways. But literature requires the ability to straddle worlds, to move between that prosaic realm we call reality and fiction, to understand, accordingly, that within every experience, there are others possible.</p> \n<p>Demagogues, however – and they are not good candidates for Education Minister (an Orwellian Minister of Truth, maybe) – are stuck forever in a closed world without imaginative possibility, a literalist ghetto in which they want to keep their constituencies as well. Indeed, with the ministerial condescension towards young Israelis (who are now pushing up Rabinyan’s sales) and the paternalist desire to preserve ethnic identity, why stop with &quot;Borderlife?&quot; Maybe &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; – miscegenation! – should be next?</p> \n<p>To be sure, serving as Minister of Education of that paradoxical (if not impossible) entity, a Jewish Democracy, is no simple task. Bennett prides himself on knowledge of Jewish values (though there are few books of the Bible that meet up to his puritanical standards, and the rabbinic lessons of diversity and interpretive freedom seem lost to him). To fill in the obvious gaps of the reading list of liberal democracy, he might want to start by coming to a class in the English Department at Bar Ilan where we – Jews and Arabs, secular and religious – are studying &quot;Areopagitica,&quot; the 1644 tract against censorship by the author of &quot;Paradise Lost.&quot;</p> \n<p>John Milton, like Bennett, sought to establish a religious commonwealth, in a comparable age of multiplying perspectives and diversity. But Milton’s imagined ‘Christian Home’ was built on different principles from Bennett’s Jewish parallel. To be sure, Milton had more closed-minded contemporaries, including a 17th century Bennett, who titled his work about heresy, with a long list of books to keep off the reading list, &quot;Gangrena.&quot; Diverse opinions, from the perspective of &quot;Gangrena,&quot; are a disease to the nation, to be dealt with accordingly, that is, disregarded, banned, infected limbs to be chopped off.</p> \n<p>Milton, by contrast, trusted his readers, their ability to distinguish and choose, and saw the conversation and criticism that comes from reading as integral to nationhood. For him, faith and knowledge and national identity, thrive ‘by exercise’ – ‘I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue,’ he proclaimed. Milton’s commonwealth, modeled (incidentally) on ancient Israel, requires ‘much arguing, much writing, many opinions.’ For diverse ‘opinion in good men,’ Milton writes, ‘is but knowledge in the making.’</p> \n<p>Literary judgement for Milton is bad for authoritarian rulers, those kings and demagogues whose passive subjects hang on to the literal truths they disseminate, but it’s good for democracies. For democracy takes the risk of conversation, cultivating critical minds. Those who read, as Milton writes, ‘diversely,’ make good political subjects, and even – perhaps – better politicians. So a proposition for the minister: Study Milton and Shakespeare, and Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Equip yourself to lead a national conversation – though perhaps my imagination is getting the better of me here – about the tensions between liberal democracy and a Jewish State.</p> \n<p>The rumors of the closing of the Israeli mind, to paraphrase Mark Twain, have been greatly exaggerated. Naftali, come see (and read) for yourself; you are invited.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>William Kolbrener is Professor of English Literature&nbsp;at Bar Ilan University, author of Milton’s Warring Angels (Cambridge 1996), and most recently Open Minded Torah: Of Irony, Fundamentalism and Love (Continuum 2011); his The Last Rabbi: Joseph Soloveitchik and Talmudic Tradition is forthcoming from Indiana in the fall.

        "text":["<p>Sometimes, during difficult periods, I try to ignore what is said on the radio and printed in the newspapers. But somehow, the news in this country is transmitted through the air. Even though I blocked my ears and shut my eyes, I still know that MK Haneen Zoabi kidnapped three settler teenagers. And even though I made a point of listening only to music and of following the games in Brazil – I know that the army is setting up roadblocks, imposing closures, invading homes, embittering lives. And even though I tried to read only the culture news online, I feel that the country’s Arab citizens have been taken hostage again and are being used as a convenient punching bag to vent national nerves.</p> \n<p>In such volatile days, when fates are being sealed, it’s very hard to write a column on Wednesday for publication on Friday, but there’s no choice: The Haaretz Hebrew magazine is printed on Wednesday and I’m late. I’ve already received messages from the paper reminding me that I’m late in sending my column, and soon the phone will ring and I’ll get yelled at politely and told in effect that the paper is about to go to press and the illustrator is sitting in his office, waiting only for me to deign to send him something to illustrate.</p> \n<p>It’s my fervent hope that by the time this column is published the boys will be back home, safe and sound. Home? I write that and immediately feel a stabbing in the chest. Does the hope that they will return home imply some sort of declaration that the settlements can be considered legitimate?</p> \n<p>Okay, I’ll try to reformulate: It’s my fervent hope that by the time this article is published the boys will be back with their families, in the hope that they will not go back to being part of the suppression, plunder and trampling of the freedom of other nations. It’s my fervent hope that the suffering being endured by their parents will end, and that the fathers and mothers will be able to embrace their loved ones.</p> \n<p>I would be lying if I say that immediately upon hearing the grim news about the kids, I didn’t think about the parents and wonder what they are feeling now. And whether – somewhere, some place, when no one is listening, and when God, who issued precepts and promised lands, isn’t looking – they feel a bit guilty.</p> \n<p>No, not because of the hitchhiking. The problem isn’t the hitchhiking. The problem is a lot more serious, and I know you know that. Or maybe you don’t know? Now, when I play back in my mind what I heard from politicians, army personnel and the media this week, I wonder whether you understand at all.</p> \n<p>It’s true, after all, that the prime minister said immediately that the kidnapping isn’t necessarily connected or related to anything in particular: Instead he attributed it to an element of the laws of nature, to an innate trait of a different nation.</p> \n<p>The prime minister said that this was simply a bloodthirsty enemy that does not balk at killing children, women and old people. Our prime minister did not say who exactly that enemy is, but I understood what he meant when I heard him on the radio.</p> \n<p>My children were in the car, too, and they heard the prime minister and were scared, and my little boy asked, “Daddy, who are ‘they’?” Turning my head to the back seat for a second, I almost said, “Us, you, he’s talking about you, too.” But I didn’t tell the kids the truth – I said nothing.</p> \n<p>So, could it be that he really doesn’t understand? Doesn’t he visit the territories and see how the state continues to seize Arabs’ land? How it’s arresting, suffocating, trampling – in a word, occupying? Could it be that he really thinks the Palestinians enjoy freedom just like the settlers?</p> \n<p>No, it’s absolutely not because of the hitchhiking. And no, what goes for Hebron does not go for Tel Aviv. Not yet. It depends on you. And by the way, it always depends on you. You are strong, you dictate the rules of behavior and the laws.</p> \n<p>Kidnapping is a terrible thing, and if, heaven forbid, it should turn out that something happened to those kids, it will be an unmitigated tragedy. Sorry for the generalization (you started it ...), but you really don’t understand what Arabs feel when they see images of children who were killed and a uniformed army that is whitewashing, setting up commissions, maybe even holding trials – and in the best case saying it’s a mistake, or sometimes, when it’s really serious, apologizing. Apologizing? I don’t remember that anymore.</p> \n<p>Sometimes I wonder whether, if the Palestinians were capable of invading homes in Israel, of sending in soldiers to wrest people out of their beds in front of their families; if they had intelligence that was able to come up with the names of perpetrators, planners, instigators and simply people with the potential to be dangerous one day – what would things look like then? If the Palestinians possessed military capability like the Israelis have – sophisticated planes, smart missiles and the ability to strike only at military infrastructure – who would behave a little more humanely in that case?</p> \n<p>This kidnapping is a terrible thing, and my heart goes out to the parents, whether they feel a bit guilty or whether they are certain of the rightness of their actions.</p> \n<p>I don’t believe I still have to write this, but I no longer know what you believe and what you don’t. So here it is: Harming these children will be a terrible calamity and has no justification whatsoever. Not the occupation, not the settlements, not the condition of the Palestinian prisoners.</p> \n<p>What I am trying to say, perhaps, is that I know the Arabs can be terrible and cruel, and, as the prime minister said, maybe they sometimes balk at nothing. I only ask you not to think for a second that you are any loftier than they are.</p>",

        "text":["<p>One day in 1933, as he was cleaning his office, an idea came to Charlie Gaines: He would publish a magazine that would put together all the comic strips that had been published earlier in the dailies. A year later Gaines – a Jew who was born Maxwell Ginsburg – published the first-ever comic book, called “Famous Funnies.” Success was instant.</p> \n<p>Within a few years Gaines’ initiative spawned a flourishing industry, and by the mid-1930s there were increasingly growing numbers of comic book publishers. The undisputed kings of the genre were a few superheroes who fought to rid the world of evil. Behind them stood mainly Jewish immigrants – not only the publishers but also the creative artists, the writers and illustrators who were in charge of the creative aspects of this industry. They were responsible for the fact that Jewish content seeped – consciously or otherwise – into the characters, plots and illustrated worlds on display.</p> \n<p>In fact, nearly all the great superheroes were created by Jews: Jerry Siegel and Joe (Joseph) Shuster created Superman, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby (Jacob Kurtzberg) created Captain America, Bob Kane (Robert Kahn) and Bill Finger invented Batman, while Kirby, together with Stan Lee (Stanley Martin Lieber) produced a particularly impressive line of heroes such as Spider-Man, The Hulk, the Fantastic Four, Ironman, the X-men, Thor and the Avengers.</p> \n<p>What was it that led Jews to take such a prominent role in the movie and comics industries?</p> \n<p>“I don’t think that the central role played by Jews in film and comics from the outset was due to special abilities or talents in these areas,” says Dr. Ben Baruch Blich, a senior lecturer in the department of history and theory at the Bezalel Academy of Arts. “What caused it was the open and latent anti-Semitism that prevailed in the United States at the time. Since daily newspapers [in the U.S.] refused to accept illustrations or comic books made by Jews, they had no other choice. For example, Siegel and Shuster, who were only youths then, could not find jobs at mainstream comic book networks, so they joined Gaines. The same was true for cinema. This was a restriction that forced Jews to develop a new approach.”</p> \n<p>The comic book writer Arie Kaplan, who wrote the book “From Krakow to Krypton: Jews and comic books,” explains that in contrast to the advertising industry, the comic book industry was free of anti-Semitism since many of the publishers were Jews, and no expensive academic degrees were required.</p> \n<p>Danny Fingeroth, an American writer of comics and a former editor at Marvel Comics, who wrote the book “Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics and the creation of the Superhero,” further explains the central role Jews played in the early decades of the film and comic book industries: “Many factors went into Jews being prominent in storytelling media. It has to do with, it seems to me, Jews’ connection to a tradition of storytelling, as well as Talmudic analysis, plus the status of the children of Jewish immigrants – like all immigrants – having an outsider status in America. This led some of them to analyze what history and myths fueled the American imagination, and how to reflect that self-image back at Americans in stories that had universal appeal.</p> \n<p>“What comics and film have in common is they were considered schlock, not-respectable media that were looked down upon, and hence there was an opportunity for Jews to get into these fields – in the creative and business ends – which were open to them, whereas other fields, like most mainstream publishing and advertising, were not.”</p> \n<p>Superman in a basket</p> \n<p>Shuster and Siegel’s Superman was launched in 1938, published by Gaines. Over the last decade comic book aficionados have argued and debated whether Superman himself was also Jewish, and whether he and subsequent superheroes were created in order to fulfill a hidden Jewish desire to deliver a decisive victory over Nazi Germany. Surprisingly, upon reading the veteran superhero’s life story one encounters several elements that derive from traditional Jewish culture. The first of these is the name Kal-El he receives from his parents. Kaplan says that there is a lively ongoing debate around the question of whether Siegel and Shuster planted these Jewish signs in Superman deliberately or not. He notes the name Kal-El as an example, which sounds like a Hebrew name that could mean “all of God” or “God’s voice.” He adds that Siegel and Shuster received a Jewish education.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Simcha Weinstein, author of “Up Up and Oy Vey,” which also deals with Jews and comic books in America, concurs in the belief that the Jewish elements in Superman’s story derive from the Jewish identity of his creators. “These are all creators who themselves had bar mitzvahs, spent time at the synagogue. I think about how natural it is that Superman has this parallel with Moses. The creators probably had a Passover Seder, and we write about what we know about. It makes sense that Superman would be so close to Moses. Moses had this double life – he was raised in a foreign culture, a foreign land, and as a child was put in a basket and sent away. He also had a double identity. And Moses was the voice of God, like ‘Kal-El’; it’s the Moses story,” explains Weinstein in a telephone interview.</p> \n<p>Blich mentions a possible source of inspiration – the 16th century Jewish legend of the Golem of Prague. The Golem, who was a superhero before the term was coined, was created, according to the legend, by the Maharal of Prague, Rabbi Yehuda Levai (Loew). He sent the Golem out to terrorize those who spread blood libels against Jews.</p> \n<p>“Will Eisner [one of America’s greatest comic book cartoonists, who was also Jewish] wrote that the Golem was perceived in the 1930s as a mythological character, an early superhero,” says Blich. “The comic book creators were obviously secular, but the story of the Golem was imprinted in ‘Jewish genes’ searching for salvation. There are numerous conceptions of Superman as a mythological hero, a modern embodiment of ancient mythology, a hero with supernatural powers who can save civilization from the forces of nature or the evils of human society.”</p> \n<p>The amusing debate around Superman’s Jewishness was never settled, since many others saw in his character elements taken from Christianity and a likeness to Jesus. It’s interesting to note, however, that someone who skipped over all the lengthy arguments around this issue was none other than the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, who declared in 1940 that Superman was Jewish. This happened after one of the comic books that came out that year included a story in which the superhero destroys the military defense line put up by Germany on its border with France, whereupon he captures the surprised Fuhrer. “Superman is Jewish” declared Goebbels after the comic book came his way. He then instructed that Shuster and Siegel’s popular comic book be removed from all bookshelves.</p> \n<p>Captain America – created by Jews as well – also set out to fight Nazis. He did so in the very first issue that was published in March 1941, completing what Superman didn’t finish the year before. The front page of the first issue of Captain America, published six months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, shows him punching Hitler in the face and knocking him down.</p> \n<p>Is it by chance that Jews were the ones who created these superheroes? Is there something Jewish about the whole concept?</p> \n<p>Fingeroth: “I think the idea of a being who wields great power wisely and justly would be very appealing to people whose history involves frequently being the victim of power wielded brutally and unjustly. In retrospect, we can see coded, disguised content that could be interpreted as Jewish in the stories of the superheroes. For instance, Superman, Batman and Spider-Man’s origins are about sudden, traumatic, violent loss – which could be seen to echo the loss of stability that eastern European Jews had regularly experienced.</p> \n<p>“The superhero stories were about power wielded wisely and about dealing with traumatic loss. These are major themes, as is the secret (or dual) identity – also of interest to all immigrants, but especially attractive to Jews who, in that era, felt that they could succeed in America only if they disguised their identities as Jews. One might speak Yiddish at home, but that was the language of your embarrassing immigrant parents and grandparents. You speak English in public so you can fit in with your friends at school. But which is the real you? So just as Superman would disguise himself as Clark Kent in order to fit in with non-super people, so would Jews change their names or ‘fix’ their noses to assimilate.” &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Jews break out of the confines of comic books</p> \n<p>After World War II, when the comic book industry started dealing with new content, appealing to a new readership, Jews still retained key roles. Mad Magazine, founded in 1952 but to this day the most famous and influential comic magazine, was created by two Jews, publisher William Gaines (the son of Charlie Gaines) and editor Harvey Kurtzman.</p> \n<p>Comic book writer Arie Kaplan says that while researching his book on Jews and comic books he discovered that Mad Magazine had been using Yiddish phrases for years. In fact, the very first story in its first issue, written by Kurtzman and illustrated by Will Elder – both of whom are Jewish – was about two Jewish thieves. The story is called “Ganefs” (thieves in Yiddish).</p> \n<p>“Most of the people in the audience, most of the readers who were kids probably thought it’s a silly nonsense word, they probably thought there was no significance to it. And again you get the question: Are they writing code for the Jewish readers? In that case they actually might have been, because it’s not a science fiction story. ‘Ganefs’ is a humorous story about two bank robbers, about two criminals,” says Kaplan.</p> \n<p>Eisner is considered to this day one of the most respected artists in the medium and one of the greatest contributors to its advancement. The American comics industry has an Eisner Award, similar to the Oscar award in the film industry. Eisner is considered by many people to be the “father of the illustrated novel” due to the novels he published from the late 1970s, in a genre he made popular.</p> \n<p>In contrast to the superhero comic book, Eisner’s illustrated novels, like that first story in Mad Magazine, no longer hide their Jewish aspects. Writers no longer feel it necessary to demonstrate their patriotism in a manner that squelches and conceals their Jewish identity. In all the stories that make up Eisner’s first illustrated novel “A Contract with God” (1978), there are Jewish protagonists. This is true for his other works as well. In his last book, called “The Plot: The Secret Story of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” Eisner used a comic book style to investigate the twisted history of that infamous anti-Semitic tract.</p> \n<p>Over time other Jewish characters started emerging from the closet in the mainstream comic book industry. Benjamin “Ben” Grimm, known as “The Thing,” was one of the Fantastic Four, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1961. These two Jewish artists decided up front that this protagonist would be Jewish, giving him a name that revealed him as such. The unwritten law that forbade mentioning the religion of comic book characters (as in other entertainment media) prevented them from expressly mentioning this fact. Only after four decades was the Jewish identity of The Thing exposed unambiguously.</p> \n<p>Other prominent Jewish characters in American comics were Kitty Pryde, a Jewish mutant with supernatural powers, who appeared in 1980 in the X-Men series. A year later it turned out that Magento, a mutant with supernatural powers and who is the main enemy of the X-Men, is a Jewish Holocaust survivor. Batwoman Kathy Kane has also joined the list of Jewish superheroes over the last decade. Besides being a lesbian she takes care to celebrate Jewish holidays.</p> \n<p>Later Jewish artists include Daniel Clowes who wrote “Ghost World,” an illustrated novel that was turned into a well-received movie in 2001, as well as Harvey Pekar, a filing clerk at a hospital who transformed his daily routine into an acclaimed autobiographic comic book called “American Splendor” (also turned into a successful movie). He continued writing original comic books until his death in 2010.</p> \n<p>Michael Chabon is a novelist, not a comic book writer, but he too takes a place of honor on this list due to his novel “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay,” which tells the story of two Jewish youngsters who arrive in the United States penniless from Europe and manage to become leading artists in the American comic book industry. The novel revealed to millions of readers the Jewish element that was common to many artists in this industry during its early stages.</p> \n<p>Art Spiegelman wrote the illustrated novel “Maus” 30 years ago. Many people see it as one of the crowning achievements in the world of comics. “Maus” proved that a comic book-style story can weave a personal story into difficult and sensitive historical topics such as the Holocaust, and do so in a manner that is not only unique, effective, impressive and excellent, but also amazingly communicative.</p> \n<p>In 1992, “Maus” became the first comic strip to win the prestigious Pulitzer Prize. In light of the central role played by Jews at the outset of the American comic book industry, it was symbolic that a work by a Jewish writer that deals with Jewish identity and the heavy price those holding this identity paid in the 1930s and 1940s in Europe – the years in which the American comic book industry was taking its first steps – was the work that managed to break through the medium’s confines, garnering sweeping admiration outside the industry.</p>",

They’re served for breakfast, lunch and dinner, at homes and restaurants from the most lowly falafel stand to some of the country’s finest gourmet establishments. Variations are abundant, but the base of this salad is consistent – finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This dish goes by several names – Israeli salad, Arab salad, and often simply chopped salad.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Israeli salad isn’t particularly unique to Israel, and the practice of declaring it the national salad isn’t unique to Israel, either.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Diced salads in one form or another have been popular throughout the Middle East for millennia, and date back to the time of the pharaohs, as food historian Gil Marks wrote in his book “Olive Trees and Honey.”</p> \n<p>Sign up to our weekly Food newsletter to get the latest recipes and food news directly to your inbox.</p> \n<p>These salads have been warmly embraced in countries throughout the region. The evolution of the dish was influenced by the import of new world vegetables, such as bell peppers but namely tomatoes, which likely made their way to the region as recently as the late 19th century.</p> \n<p>In many places, the citizens make their own variation of this basic cucumber and tomato salad and name it after their country. In Syria such salads are called “salatat al-khudra” – vegetable market salad. Various Greek names for a similar dish translate as vegetable market salad, country salad and Greek salad, as Gil Marks explains. The Iranian version is called Persian salad or Shirazi salad. The salad is ubiquitous among Palestinians as well, who call it “salatat al-bandura” – tomato salad.</p> \n<p>In Israel, this salad was originally adopted by kibbutzim, where it became a staple of breakfasts alongside eggs, bread and cheese, before the days of boxed cereal. It has a fine, uniform dice. Cucumbers and tomatoes are always the base, while other additions can include finely chopped red peppers, radish, onion, herbs including parsley, mint and green onion, and even root vegetables such as carrot or kohlrabi.

        "text":["<p> Despite her many aches, Zahira Dandees – she has no idea how old she really is – smiles at us. Her face lights up, because so few people visit her in her home on Hebron’s main street, Shuhada.</p> \n<p> “They’re afraid to come,” she says. In any case, it’s complicated. Some 120 roadblocks and 18 manned checkpoints cut off the streets, and Palestinians are forbidden to drive cars in the entire Israeli-controlled area and forbidden to walk on most of this main street.</p> \n<p> February 25 marks the 21st anniversary of the Goldstein massacre in Hebron, when Dr. Baruch Goldstein entered the Tomb of the Patriarchs and gunned down and murdered 29 Muslims kneeling in prayer at the Ibrahimi mosque. This is a chance to examine the routine established since then.</p> \n<p> About a month ago, on January 19, Israel Defense Forces soldiers welded shut the entrance to the small apartment which Dandees had moved into when she was married dozens of years ago. Her late husband had a carpentry workshop under the apartment, which was set alongside a barbershop and a row of other workshops and small businesses. All of them are shut today.</p> \n<p> Dandees recalls how the road was always full of people; neighbors visiting each other, voices, colors, activity, cars stopping outside the door. Beit Hadassah, a settlers’ compound – protected, fortified and surrounded by military outposts – is situated about 100 meters from her home.</p> \n<p> The preparations for the welding were attended by several kippa-wearing Israelis, who smiled and took a lot of photographs. Dandees had long since moved out of the tiny apartment with her husband and children, to a larger one across the road, but the small one above the workshop gets the sun. This is where her washing machine is, where she hangs out the laundry to dry on the roof. She sits on the roof every day, to catch a bit of sun and warmth. Once one of her sons lived here, too, but he “fled,” she says, because of all the restrictions, and the settlers’ harassment of the children. Most of the neighbors also fled.</p> \n<p> Why did they weld the door shut? “They told me someone threw stones,” explained Dandees, “but I didn’t throw stones.” She doesn’t think they showed her a military order to weld the door shut.</p> \n<p> The IDF spokesman did not answer Haaretz’s query about whether the door had been welded shut by order, who signed the order, and until when it was valid. He said instead, “The street has been closed for 20 years by a commander's order. After two firebombs were thrown on Shuhada Street, several openings were found between the structures [shops – AH], which enabled Palestinians to enter the Jewish community, bypassing the checkpoint – contrary to the military order. One of the firebombs caught fire in a building, forcing IDF troops to break into the sealed structure and put out the fire. On January 19, 2015, on the basis of the existing order, IDF soldiers sealed the structure, which is not inhabited by families.”</p> \n<p> The spokesman did not explain how the firebomb got into the sealed structure.</p> \n<p> Easier for settlers to work</p> \n<p> Social activists from the Youth Against Settlements group in Hebron confirmed that a fire had broken out in a sealed Palestinian store – the one closest to Beit Hadassah. The fire broke out because someone – the activists say an Israeli – had illicitly tried to connect to the power grid.</p> \n<p> To put out the flames, the store door was opened and the activists found that large openings had been made in the walls, connecting the stores to each other. These were the kind of holes IDF soldiers had made in West Bank refugee camp homes back in 2002, to facilitate their advancement.</p> \n<p> The activists are certain this is how the people who made the holes plan to take over the closed stores and turn them into another Jewish settlement compound, for housing, businesses or leisure. They say the welding makes it easier for the settlers to continue their work.</p> \n<p> The IDF spokesman did not respond to these allegations, but said, “The IDF will continue to enforce law and order in Judea and Samaria.”</p> \n<p> Though she lives on that small part of Shuhada where the IDF allows Palestinians to walk through, Zahira Dandees does not stay in the emptied street by choice. “If I had another apartment, if I had money, I’d leave this place,” she says.</p> \n<p> The Abu Aisha family in Hebron’s Tel Rumeida neighborhood, however, remains at home by choice and determination. To their east lies a small military camp. Opposite them is a settlement, whose residents live in trailers and a large house. Israelis have offered them a large amount of money to move out several times, and each time they refused. They make sure one adult is always in the house.</p> \n<p> “If we all leave, even for a few hours, the settlers will take over,” a family member says. The IDF’s laws forbid them from receiving any Palestinian guests. This is why the women and children received us with such warm smiles here, too.</p> \n<p> Neighbors aren’t permitted to visit the Abu Aisha family, either – not even the brides’ families. A soldier posted on the street corner checks the identity card of anyone who isn’t Israeli or Jewish. The Abu Aisha sons are tall and look older than their age: By a special arrangement with the Palestinian Interior Ministry, they received identity cards early, at age 15, so the soldiers wouldn’t suspect them of being strangers and prevent them from returning home. After 10 years of submitting requests to the Civil Administration, the family was finally permitted to bring laborers to make some repairs in the house.</p> \n<p> Known as the Cage House, their home is covered from the front and sides with iron mesh. “That’s from Arafat’s time [1996],” says Rima Abu Aisha. “He heard settlers were throwing stones at the house and made sure we got the money to put up the mesh. Before that, we couldn’t put furniture on the balcony, all the window panes were broken, the floor was covered with rocks. We couldn’t sit here like we do now,” she says.</p> \n<p> But Israelis kept attacking them – either throwing stones, breaking into the house through another door or shooting at them (and killing their songbirds). About six years ago, they installed closed-circuit TV cameras, with the help of B’Tselem. Unknown people once smashed the camera and the family installed a new one (they also have two smaller video cameras). Thanks to the three cameras, the attacks became less frequent.</p> \n<p> The family used to have a small copper and iron factory from before 1967. Buyers from Tel Aviv used to come and order copper utensils, says Taysir Abu Aisha. Then the army ordered the family to shut down the factory. The father and son opened two clothes stores outside the encaged and emptied city center, to make a living.</p> \n<p> The Abi Aisha residence and adjacent settlers' houses are on the top of a hill. This is a common sight: Israeli cars drive, masterly, on the steep rise, while a couple of elderly, panting Palestinians struggle on foot up the road.</p> \n<p> Until three months ago, adults were still allowed to ride a donkey and pass through the Shuhada checkpoint to the other side of the universe – Hebron under Palestinian rule. But then the army closed the checkpoint for three weeks, after two fire bombs had been thrown at it. When it reopened, donkeys were no longer allowed to pass through. Now, people must carry gas tanks and food products in a wheelbarrow or on their back.</p> \n<p> Youth Against Settlements is planning a campaign for reopening Shuhada Street. Rima Abu Aisha smiles. “Inshallah, good luck to them. But I don’t believe anything will change for the better,” she says.</p> \n<p> Amira Hass tweets at @Hass_Haaretz.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the heart of Fatih, one of Istanbul’s oldest and most conservative neighborhoods that has become a hub for Syrian refugees, we meet Feyral. She is sitting in a quiet, glossy new community center: the many colorful donor logos adorning the walls attest to the fact that the building was paid for exclusively by international donors. Feryal’s eyes flicker uneasily while large bulging tears form. “I don’t understand why the Turks do not love the Syrian people; we are part of the same family,” she says.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Her prayers may have been answered. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has just laid out a blueprint of a plan to offer citizenship to the 2.75 million registered Syrian refugees like Feyral who have fled to Turkey to escape the Syrian civil war.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Seemingly speaking straight to refugees like her, Erdogan announced last week, “Tonight, I want to give some good news to my brothers and sisters.” He continued, “I believe there are those who would like to obtain citizenship,” adding “our Interior Ministry is taking steps in that regard.” His speech concluded, “Turkey is your home, too.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“This is something Erdogan’s critics have long feared he would do,” explains Turkey analyst Hugh Pope from the International Crisis Group. The majority of the Syrian refugees in Turkey can aptly be described as being from the “same family” - “Sunni Muslims of conservative political leanings, very much like Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) traditional support base.” To many in the Turkish opposition, the decision was a pragmatic and opportunistic move rather than one based on humanitarian concern for the fate of the Syrians in Turkey, more and more of whom are living below the poverty line, according to a recent report by the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“The president has always used the refugees as a political asset, notably blackmailing the European Union into conceding large funds to Turkey to manage the crisis, and this is no different,” Hisyah Ozsoy, the vice-chair of the Peoples’ Democratic Party, (HDP) the Kurdish opposition party, tells Haaretz. For Ozsoy, Erdogan is planning a “careful demographic engineering” with the potential to change the ethnic make-up of the southeast regions bordering Syria, Turkey’s Kurdish regions. He views the temporary refugee camps with suspicion, as they are clearly “turning permanent.” Kilis, the city where Erdogan's speech was made, is a symbol of the changing demographic outlook of the southeast, as one of the many towns where the local population is now dwarfed by the number of Syrian refugees.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After the 2015 general elections, talks between the government and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) – a movement calling for “democratic autonomy” in the provinces of the southeast – collapsed, eventually escalating into armed conflict. The war displaced more than 350,000 people and destroyed more than 6,000 buildings, as well as claiming a huge number of casualties. The latest installment of this military and political tug-of-war with the Kurds saw HDP members of Parliament stripped of their immunity and legal proceedings unleashed over their alleged connections to the PKK. This has put the HDP on hyper alert to any demographic changes that could prevent the party from maintaining the 13% threshold needed to be in the parliament or to any boost in support for the AKP, which has waged war on the Kurds.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, offering citizenship to Syrians is “ultimately the right thing to do,” comments Pope. While Turkey doesn’t offer conventional refugee status due to the geographic limitations of the Geneva Convention, it does offer Syrians “temporary protection.” In doing so, Turkey already covers the cost of hosting these refugees, as their status under the temporary protection legislation gives them access to all the benefits that conventional refugee status would, including education, health care benefits and now also access to the labor market. In the long run, offering them citizenship avoids creating a two-tier society and will ease current tension by enabling full integration. Above all, it legalizes their status and moves them away from society’s periphery by offering them a framework and future.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Turkish daily Hurriyet, moreover, highlighted how citizenship would be granted selectively, prioritizing professionals who can help refugees as well as bring Turkey the skills it lacks. The astonishing growth Erdogan delivered after the turn of the century has always been key to his popularity – annual GDP per capita has increased from less than $9,000 to almost $20.000 under Erdogan, according to data from the OECD – and his targeting of “elite refugees” shows this decision is in turn not bereft of economic reckoning. “It just makes economic sense to move this labor force from the informal to the formal sector,” says Pope “In terms of demographics, I doubt this will radically rebalance anything beyond cities such as Mersin.” &nbsp; Members of the HDP who spoke to Haaretz disagreed, pointing out how fiscal and other incentives “could be enough to orientate where people live,” said Hisyah Ozsoy. For sure, concludes Pope, “these people will be grateful and will ultimately vote for him.”</p> \n<p>This statement hints at the extent to which Erdogan is counting every single vote that brings him closer to ensuring he has a parliamentary majority to create an executive presidency. By no means can Erdogan deliver this promise instantly, but he is working to ensure he will still be in charge when the Turkish Republic celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2023. By the looks of it, the Syrian refugees are not going anywhere anytime soon.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Edith White is a freelance journalist, researcher and translator.

        "text":["<p> On November 18, 1939, the German governor-general of newly conquered Poland, Hans Frank, ordered all Jewish communities under occupation to organize Judenraete (“Jewish councils”) to act as middlemen between themselves and the occupying forces. The idea of Jewish self-rule, and of mediators representing individual communities vis-&agrave;-vis the local nobility or central government, goes back to Medieval times, which is also where the term “Judenraete” has its origins.</p> \n<p> In theory, a Judenrat, whose size depended on the overall size of the ghetto it served, was democratically elected by the community members it represented. But the Germans reserved the right to approve the councils’ composition, and they saw to it that their leaders would be figures of recognized authority within the communities.</p> \n<p> Inevitably, the Judenraete became one of the most controversial Jewish institutions to emerge from the Holocaust: Wishing to ameliorate the suffering of their people, even playing for time in the desperate hope that the Germans would be defeated, in practice, the council representatives were forced to carry out the Nazis’ dirty work for them. Initially, this meant setting up the ghettos where Jews were forced to move in every town or village in Poland, the Soviet Union, and parts of Western Europe that were conquered by the Third Reich. Later, it included distributing the meager rations provided for ghetto residents, gathering fines levied by the occupiers, supplying teams of forced laborers on demand, or eventually choosing candidates for deportation.</p> \n<p> There were inevitably those who used their relatively privileged positions for the material benefit of their families and colleagues. But even the most well-intended of Judenrat officials were dependent on the occupiers for information (and everything else), and their powers did not extend beyond what served the purposes of the Germans at any given time. More than that, the councils also were responsible for organizing internal police forces to carry out the enforcement work imposed on the communities. Resisting or refusing the orders of the occupiers was generally not an option.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p> At the same time, the Jewish councils organized welfare and educational services within the ghettos – schools, hospitals, orphanages, old-age homes – with the minimal resources at their disposal. They also provided the more mundane services of a local government, such as transportation or fuel distribution. When resistance organizations began to come into existence, their relationships with the councils varied from one community to another. In some cities, the Judenrat heads saw armed underground activity as risking the safety of the entire community, which led to violent clashes between the two groups of Jews. In such places as Kovno and Minsk, on the other hand, the council cooperated and even participated with the resistance. Attitudes toward resistance often softened as it became clearer that a community faced imminent deportation or destruction.</p> \n<p> A study by historian Isaiah Trunk concluded that 80 percent of Judenrat members in Eastern Europe died either before or during the deportations; 12 percent survived the Holocaust.</p>",

        "text":["<p> Two weeks ago, while Israelis were debating which party's program was more likely to solve the housing crisis, in Egypt, the government was unveiling a plan that makes Yair Lapid’s &quot;zero-VAT&quot; plan and Moshe Kahlon’s designs of wresting control over the Israel Lands Authority look like the work of munchkin apparatchiks with little vision and even less daring.</p> \n<p> The plan, unveiled by Egyptian Housing Minister Mostafa Madbouly at the Egypt Economic Development Conference, is to build a new capital in the desert east of Cairo, no less. And not just a capital, but one of superlatives. In 10 or so years, if the plans keep to schedule, the as yet unnamed city will house between five and seven million people on a 700-square kilometer site.</p> \n<p> Building the new city will probably come to about $80 billion. Just moving the government to its new home will cost $45 billion.</p> \n<p> Just to put those numbers in perspective, the city will be about the size of the entire country of Singapore, have a population equal to 90% of Israel’s right now and cost close to a third of Egypt’s gross domestic product to build. Apart from housing the main government departments and ministries, parliament and foreign embassies, it will have a green space twice the size of New York’s Central Park, an amusement park four times the size of Disneyland, a downtown filled with skyscrapers and what The Economist described as a monumental structure that borrows elements of the Washington Monument and the Eiffel Tower.</p> \n<p> Making it even more attractive to Western ears, the new city is being billed as a green project, with solar energy firms and efficient public transportation</p> \n<p> The glitz model</p> \n<p> The gigantism and bravado of the plan all sound like Las Vegas. But Egyptian leader Abdul Fattah al-Sissi’s real inspiration is quite obviously the Gulf city-state of Dubai, which has transformed itself from a backward fishing village into a place whose strategy could be described in three words: over the top.</p> \n<p> Dubai is home to the world’s tallest skyscraper (the Burj Khalifa), the world's largest shopping mall based on floor space (Dubai Mall), plans for the world’s biggest Ferris wheel (Dubai Eye), islands shaped like palm trees and a map of the world, an indoor ski hill and the world’s only self-declared seven-star hotel (Burj Al Arab, caviar facials, hotel shuttle by Rolls Royce, etc.).</p> \n<p> In fact, a Dubai company (Emaar Properties) has been tapped as chief contractor for the new Egyptian capital and Gulf countries are expecting to provide most of the financing.</p> \n<p> Dubai is not just an empty fa&ccedil;ade of glitz. With no oil to speak of and few other assets, it now has a GDP per capita that is among the highest in the world. That is because it is also home to a thriving aviation industry, has become a major center for logistics and serves as a regional headquarters for many multinationals. And the city state isn’t stopping there: Dubai has ambitions to become a major center for media, financial services and technology.</p> \n<p> Even the glitz has its purpose: Together with beautiful beaches and (by Middle East standards) a tolerant environment that allows for bikinis and burkas to live side by side, Dubai has made itself a major tourist attraction. Glitz also serves as a lure for the hundreds of thousands of expats – everyone from European bankers to Pakistani construction workers – to make their home there. Emiratis make up only a small fraction of the population.</p> \n<p> Dubai on the Nile?</p> \n<p> The Dubai model is obviously tempting for Egypt, whose economy has been sputtering in the four years since Hosni Mubarak was pushed out.</p> \n<p> Tourists and investors have been deterred by political instability. Even with the help of $30 billion in aid from Gulf countries since al-Sissi came to power and some modest reforms, like devaluing the Egyptian pound, cutting fuel subsidies and reducing the budget deficit, the economy is not growing fast enough. Forecast growth this year of 4% won’t do anything to reduce Egypt’s estimated 13% unemployment rate.</p> \n<p> There’s a certain logic to embarking on humongous showcase construction projects. With its population of 20 million, Cairo is bursting at the seams.</p> \n<p> Building a new capital will employ lots of people, many of them with little or no skills, making it a perfect fit for the Egyptian labor force. Dubai has taught that dramatic projects make a country stand out from the crowd and act as a lure for foreign investment. Fixing potholes and leaky water pipes, easing investment laws and cutting taxes also attract investment, but they take longer to work their magic and they’re harder to implement.</p> \n<p> But can Egypt turn itself into a Dubai on the Nile?</p> \n<p> For al-Sissi, who needs to turn his country around quickly or risk the same fate as his two predecessors, Mubarak and Mohammed Morsi, this is a question left to economists and historians. “I’m in a hurry because I’m late, and anyone who’s late must either speed up or run,” he told investors at the economic conference where the new capital city project was announced.</p> \n<p> Egypt has some factors in its favor. Like Dubai, it is a centralized state with a government used to wielding unchallenged authority. But in Dubai, it’s basically five people who make all the decisions, and they make them quickly and efficiently. In Egypt, the state is a ponderous bureaucracy. The last time it got its act together to embark on major projects was 3,000 or more years ago with the pyramids. More recent efforts, like a host of empty desert cities, have been flops.</p> \n<p> Why Dubai isn't the right model</p> \n<p> Dubai has also been successful mainly because it is a small and open economy, which Egypt isn’t. The city state relies on foreigners freely coming and going to provide the skills and labor that make a economy run. Emiratis themselves have little to offer a modern service-based economy and suffer high unemployment. But since they constitute so little of the population, no one notices.</p> \n<p> With its 80 million population, Egypt couldn’t possibly invite enough foreign expertise in to make a difference; and lifting the skills set of Egyptians is an investments that will take years to bear fruit.</p> \n<p> If Egypt wants to look around the region for a model, it would do better to turn to Turkey.</p> \n<p> Turkey’s economic achievements over the last decade have often been overpraised, not the least by its prime minister himself.</p> \n<p> The country has enjoyed strong economic growth, though not as strong as the world’s fastest growing emerging economies, and its prosperity has been paid for by massive current account deficits. But Turkey did make the transition to a more-or-less competitive industrial economy and Turks are much better off than they were a decade or more ago. All in all, Turkey’s 70 million population and its lack of natural resources make it look a lot like Egypt, certainly a lot more than Dubai does.</p> \n<p> Turning to Turkey would be an unpleasant task for al-Sissi, who is barely on speaking terms with Recep Tayyip Erdogan and certainly doesn’t want to be taking advice from him. But it would be the wiser course. &nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p> The extent of the disconnect between Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer and the powers-that-be in Washington has been highlighted by new data released by the Obama administration.</p> \n<p> Examination of the registry that details the one million entry permits issued to the White House over the last 18 months shows that Dermer had precious few meetings with President Barack Obama’s advisers in 2014.</p> \n<p> The data do reveal other interesting Israeli visitors, however, such as Benjamin Netanyahu's son Yair, opposition leader Isaac Herzog, retired politician Ehud Barak, TV Channel 2 anchorwoman Yonit Levy, and others.</p> \n<p> The registry was published on March 27 by the White House, and included visits to the presidential compound and the adjacent building housing the National Security Council.</p> \n<p> The listings constitute a database meant to be used by the White House itself, but since 2012 they have been disclosed to the public following a petition by a nongovernment group of citizens who have resolved to safeguard the ethics of governance – particularly with regard to ties between business and politics.</p> \n<p> The registry is incomplete, however, inasmuch as it does not include secret meetings with administration officials that were held elsewhere. The list also excludes meetings removed from the registry due to their sensitive diplomatic or security nature. Furthermore, as in any government bureaucracy, in this case lack of organization and of adherence to procedures likely exist in the White House as well.</p> \n<p> Nevertheless, the registry provides an interesting perspective on Israel-U.S. relations, which became tenser than ever in the course of 2014.</p> \n<p> Miami-born Ron Dermer started serving as Israel's envoy to Washington in December 2013. For years prior to that, he had been a senior adviser to Netanyahu, eventually becoming one of his closest associates. Dermer immigrated to Israel at the age of 26.</p> \n<p> During his years in the Prime Minister’s Bureau, Dermer was a red flag, in the eyes of the administration, due to his close ties to senior Republican politicians. Recently, he became, de facto, persona non grata at the White House, for his part in organizing Netanyahu’s March 3 speech before the joint session of the Congress.</p> \n<p> Ever since he assumed his ambassadorial role, administration officials treated him according to the principle of treat your guest with respect, but be wary. In March 2014, Israeli journalist Chico Menashe reported on Israel Radio that National Security Advisor Susan Rice was refusing to meet the ambassador. Several similar reports appeared in the following months. For a long time, the administration and Netanyahu’s bureau attempted to deny or downplay the severity of this situation.</p> \n<p> However, looking at the new data concerning visits to the White House, one sees that Dermer has almost no ties with Obama’s senior advisers. From December 3, 2013, to the end of 2014, he visited the White House only 11 times. On only one of these occasions, on June 25, 2014, was there a business meeting with Obama’s senior Middle Eastern affairs adviser Philip Gordon.</p> \n<p> Four other visits by Dermer coincided with visits by Netanyahu to the White House, and the rest included the presentation of his credentials and attendance at functions or receptions that included multiple guests.</p> \n<p> The absence of an ongoing relationship between the ambassador and the president’s advisers stands out when compared to the number of visits held by his No. 2 man, Reuven Azar, deputy chief of mission to the Israeli Embassy, since assuming his job in the middle of last year. Between July and December of 2014, Azar entered the White House 10 times, eight times for business meetings with Obama's or Vice President Joe Biden's senior staffers. The purpose of two other meetings was unclear, based on the published information.</p> \n<p> Even though the deputy head of mission has held several meetings with senior National Security Council staff at the White House, the new data show that very few meetings took place between any official representative of the Israeli government and senior advisers belonging to Obama’s inner circle – such as National Security Adviser Rice; her deputy, Ben Rhodes; or chief-of-staff Denis McDonough.</p> \n<p> Left-wingers welcome</p> \n<p> Indeed, the registry information shows that the only senior Israeli official who met Rice during the whole of 2014 was her counterpart in Jerusalem, the prime minister’s national security adviser, Yossi Cohen. Apparently there were two such encounters, in addition to three visits as part of Netanyahu’s entourage during meetings with President Obama.</p> \n<p> Another senior Israeli who managed to meet a member of Obama’s inner circle during the period in question was opposition leader Isaac Herzog. On September 9, 2014, he met the White House chief-of-staff McDonough for just over an hour.</p> \n<p> The registry of entries records a few more Israelis who came to the White House during that year: On March 3, 2014 at 7:05 P.M., several hours after a meeting between Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu, his son Yair entered the White House. The stated objective of the visit was to tour the grounds. His guide was Zaid Hassan, from the White House’s public relations department. After two and a half hours, he left the premises.</p> \n<p> On May 7, 2014 at 3 P.M., former Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak entered the White House. No longer in office for some time, he met with Vice President Biden for almost an hour.</p> \n<p> On December 5, 2014 at 12:27 P.M., Israel TV Channel 2's anchorwoman Yonit Levy came to see one of Obama’s inner-circle members, deputy NSC director Rhodes. Their meeting lasted for just over an hour.</p> \n<p> Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman appears on the list only once: On December 5, 2013, he attended a reception given by President Obama and his wife Michelle, which was attended by many people. Lieberman was in Washington at the time while attending the Saban Forum conference.</p> \n<p> On November 25, 2014, Deputy Foreign Minister Tzachi Hanegbi came to the White House to meet senior Middle Eastern affairs adviser Philip Gordon.</p> \n<p> Another Israeli visitor to the White House was Israel Defense Forces Gen. (ret.) Amos Gilad, head of the political-defense wing of the Defense Ministry. In October 2014 he met with Vice President Biden’s National Security Adviser Colin Kahl, and with the senior director for the Levant, Israel and Egypt at the NSC, Yael Lampert.</p> \n<p> Moreover, the newly published records show that between May 2012 and August 2013, Gilad met with the president’s special assistant for Russia and Central Asian affairs at the White House, Alice Wells. It is unclear what the background for these meetings was.</p> \n<p> Looking into the records of the entry permits reveals that several heads of leftist Israeli not-for-profit groups also visited the White House during 2014. At the end of October there was a visit by the head of the Geneva Initiative group, Gadi Baltiansky, followed the next day by a visit by the head of Friends of the Earth Gidon Bromberg. They met separately with Maher Bitar, director of Israeli-Palestinian affairs at the White House.</p> \n<p> On December 2, left-wing activist Danny Zeidman, whose main interest is problems related to Jerusalem, met with adviser Gordon. On December 9, attorney Michael Sfard from the Yesh Din human rights group, met NSC Mideast adviser Lempert.</p>",

        "text":["<p>ISTANBUL – The caretaker and three other Jews came to Istanbul’s biggest synagogue on Friday. After a short discussion, they decided not to open Neve Shalom for Shabbat prayers, since there weren’t enough people present for a minyan.</p> \n<p>“Once we even had a minyan on weekdays,” says the beadle, who asked for his name not to be published. “On Saturdays there were always 30-40 Jews at prayer, and they’d be joined by Israeli tourists. But today it’s a museum.”</p> \n<p>The synagogue’s fate tells the story of Turkey’s dwindling Jewish community, which is dealing with rising displays of anti-Semitism and profound fears for its future.</p> \n<p>“We’re not afraid of Islamic State and Kurdish terror – that’s directed against all Turks,” says another community member, who also wished to remain anonymous. “The problem is with our neighbors and the neighbors’ children we grew up with. Today, they are fed with wild incitement and treat us and our children with hatred and anti-Semitism. Our problem is at school, nightclubs, the supermarket.”</p> \n<p>The synagogue is located in the heart of the city’s old Galata neighborhood, where Jews settled on first reaching Istanbul. Many of the Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492 settled in the Ottoman Empire and until World War I the Jewish-Turkish community numbered some 150,000.</p> \n<p>After the Great War it lost half of its population to Israel, Europe and the United States, and has been in constant decline ever since. By the time Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party rose to power in 2005, the community numbered 19,500. It fell to 17,000 over the following decade and has fallen by a further 1,000 in the past year.</p> \n<p>The people I spoke to in Istanbul hold the Turkish leadership responsible, for ignoring the rampant incitement against Jews in Turkey and enabling it, even if President Erdogan himself didn’t make any public anti-Semitic statements.</p> \n<p>Turkey’s Jews have suffered a number of terror attacks over the years. In 1986, two terrorists entered the Neve Shalom synagogue and murdered 22 worshippers. In 2003, Al-Qaida terrorists blew up a car outside the synagogue, killing 23 people, nine of them Jewish.</p> \n<p>With the government’s help, the community leaders fortified the synagogue until it resembled a fort. To enter, people had to go through three reinforced doors and a body scan, and provide a passport photo. The community center is guarded as closely as the Israeli embassy in Ankara.</p> \n<p>A Jewish businessman from Istanbul says community members receive frequent terror alerts in the form of text messages from the Israeli consulate. These messages have become more frequent as the threats increased, he says.</p> \n<p>Those who grew up in Turkey remember the lynching of Greeks carried out by Turks on the morning of September 6, 1955, he says. Turkish radio had reported that a bomb had exploded in the Turkish embassy in Salonica, also destroying the adjacent house where Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (the first Turkish president) had been born in 1881.</p> \n<p>“They grabbed everything they could and ran to the Greeks’ houses to kill them,” the businessman recalls. “They tore their doors open, pulled them out. We remember the Greeks pleading for their lives, they were dragged through the streets. Anyone who saw that cannot forget it, and can only think that if it happened once, it could happen again.”</p> \n<p>Community members have been instructed not to talk or give interviews to the media, says a worker in the Jewish community center. “Every word can be misinterpreted and could have serious repercussions for the Jews here.” The only person authorized to speak on behalf of the community is its president, Ishak Ibrahimzadeh, the worker says.</p> \n<p>According to a poll commissioned by the Anti-Defamation League in July 2013, 69 percent of Turks harbor anti-Semitic feelings. And the incitement has grown stronger since the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict.</p> \n<p>When Turkish pop-folk singer Yildiz Tilbe tweeted “May God bless Hitler” among other anti-Semitic tweets in early July 2014, Ankara Mayor Melih Gokcek supported her and responded, “I applaud you.”</p> \n<p>During the war in Gaza that summer, posters were put up saying, “No entry to Jewish dogs” and eggs were thrown at Jews on their way to synagogue. Fehmi Bulent Yildirim, president of the IHH organization that organized the flotilla to Gaza in 2010, threatened that Jews in Turkey would pay the price of the operation’s disastrous results.</p> \n<p>Erdogan objects to these anti-Semitic displays and denounces them, calling his country’s Jews “our Jewish citizens.” However, he does little beyond that, while those leading the incitement are the people closest to him, according to one of the people I spoke to.</p> \n<p>“In the past, the criticism was about Israel and its policy toward the Palestinians. In recent years, it’s directed against the Jews,” says a wealthy businessman who owns a large textile export company. “Anti-Semitism has returned to our lives.”</p> \n<p>He says he met his wife in an Israeli nightclub on a visit 35 years ago, and the two have been living in Turkey ever since. “People ask me a lot if I’m Jewish,” says his wife, originally from Romania. “I say I am.”</p> \n<p>“Why do you have to say that?” her husband asks.</p> \n<p>“If I can’t say I’m Jewish, I won’t stay here another minute,” she replies.</p> \n<p>But the couple’s two children have already left Turkey to study in the United States. One stayed there to work in high-tech, and the other traveled to Africa and works in farming.</p> \n<p>One of the man’s employees, a Jew who grew up in Turkey, says, “I’m 54, and by the time I’m 60 I’d like to move to Israel. As long as I feel I can live in Turkey, I’ll stay. At this stage, despite everything, we can maintain our routine and make a living. But my children have nothing to look for here. Nor can I guarantee their safety. There’s no future for them in Turkey.”</p> \n<p>The reconciliation agreement signed last week between Israel and Turkey has failed to lessen his fears. “The agreement is not between myself and my neighbor, or between my child and a gang of youngsters who attack him in a nightclub or at school,” he says.</p> \n<p>“It was always unacceptable to look like a Jew in Turkey, but we looked the other way because we made a good living,” he says. “A Jew in Turkey never wears a kippa – except for the chief rabbi, because the job obliges him to. In the past, we did it out of the understanding that we live in a Muslim state and there’s no need to create an uncomfortable situation. Today, it’s from the fear of being attacked.</p> \n<p>“A Jew can’t be a career officer in the Turkish army, no matter how many generations he’s lived in Turkey or how loyal he is to the state,” he adds. “A Jew can’t send his son to the military academy, or serve in intelligence or other sensitive posts.”</p> \n<p>Jewish youngsters in Turkey don’t necessarily want to go to Israel. “Most of them want to go to Canada or try to obtain a Spanish passport and live in Europe,” he says. “They know the economic situation in Israel isn’t easy, and their economic security is very important to them.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The manicured villas on the hills over the Lebanese border suggest that war never touched this place, certainly not in recent years. Beyond Israel’s border road it’s only pastoral landscape as far as the eye can see.</p> \n<p>“Everything has been rebuilt and life goes on,” says a member of the former South Lebanon Army, which helped Israel battle Hezbollah in the '80s and '90s. “Those enormous houses were built with money from abroad – the Gulf States and elsewhere,” he tells me on our excursion along the border.</p> \n<p>But the calm isn’t real, even if the current war between Beirut and Jerusalem is cold.</p> \n<p>“Many people in Lebanon believe that with the tacit understandings between Hezbollah and Israel, there won’t be another confrontation in the foreseeable future,” says A., a Lebanese political activist who opposes Hezbollah and requested that his name not be published.</p> \n<p>“After the war in Syria started with Hezbollah’s direct involvement there, the scenario of a 2006-model confrontation is more remote than ever,” he says, referring to Israel’s Second Lebanon War.</p> \n<p>Indeed, Syria’s bloody civil war, into which the Lebanese have been grudgingly dragged, is what occupies Israel’s neighbor to the north these days. After the 2006 war there was some optimism despite damage like south Beirut’s ruined Dahiyeh neighborhood, Hezbollah’s stronghold. Also blighted were dozens of Shi’ite towns and villages in south Lebanon.</p> \n<p>More than 1,200 Lebanese died in that war, including hundreds of Hezbollah fighters. Thousands were wounded and more than 1 million people abandoned their homes, 100,000 of whom left Lebanon entirely. The financial damage amounted to an estimated $2.8 billion. There was plenty of environmental damage as well, on the ground and in the sea, partly due to Israel’s use of cluster bombs. But there was still hope.</p> \n<p>“In Lebanese public opinion, as well as across the Arab world, Hezbollah and its leader Hassan Nasrallah were depicted as having achieved an impressive strategic and diplomatic victory,” says K., a journalist living in Beirut. “This was a guerilla movement that stood up to the strongest army in the Middle East for a whole month.”</p> \n<p>Funding pours in</p> \n<p>Two years later, when Israel released Lebanese terrorist Samir Kuntar in a prisoner exchange, Hezbollah became a byword for success. The Lebanese army established positions along the border and aided the civilian population, while Hezbollah, helped by Iran, restocked its arsenal.</p> \n<p>A major unresolved issue remained – the destruction. The government quickly repaired the Beirut airport and the communications networks. There wasn’t much cash left over for the Shi’ites, who are identified with Hezbollah and suffered the brunt of the war damage. No solution was found for the hundreds of thousands who had no roof over their heads.</p> \n<p>“The organization [Hezbollah] and the Lebanese government realized they couldn’t cover the reconstruction costs,” says A., a Lebanese journalist close to Hezbollah. The group therefore embarked on a fundraising campaign. Iran was also involved, compensating people who had lost their homes in the war.</p> \n<p>“I remember every family getting $10,000,” says A. “These were huge sums for Lebanon, and this gave some breathing room to people in distress.”</p> \n<p>With all due respect to Tehran, most of the rebuilding efforts were shouldered by wealthy Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which donated hundreds of millions of dollars. Qatar alone donated more than $300 million and took charge of rebuilding houses in the 30 hardest-hit communities.</p> \n<p>“One could say that most of it has been rebuilt,” says Hajj Yousef, a Beirut resident who says life in the area has returned to normal. “The houses that remain in ruins belong to people who took money and left for other places without rebuilding.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, Qatar became the darling of Lebanon because of its reconstruction efforts. “The Qatari prince at the time, Hamad bin Khalifa, and his wife Princess Moza were widely acclaimed across Lebanon, including by Hezbollah,” notes A. “The words ‘Thank You, Qatar’ appeared everywhere on billboards across the country.”</p> \n<p>But the Qatari romance didn’t last. With the Syrian war and Hezbollah’s entry on Assad’s side, Nasrallah was no longer smiled upon by the Gulf states, chiefly Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which found themselves on the other side. Whereas Hezbollah views the Gulf states as sponsors of the Islamic State and other Salafi groups, the Gulf states view Hezbollah as a terror group. A few months ago the Arab League also adopted this definition.</p> \n<p>Joblessness at 25 percent</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, as Iran, the Gulf states, the Islamic State, Hezbollah and Syria all play their role, things are getting harder for the Lebanese. For two years Lebanon has had no president and the social gaps are widening, as is the economic crisis.</p> \n<p>After the war the Lebanese economy slowed and unemployment reached 14 percent, especially among academics, leading thousands of families to emigrate, according to the Lebanese media. Ten years later, the unemployment rate has soared to 25 percent, mainly due to the Syrian war.</p> \n<p>The influx of Syrian refugees into Lebanon – estimated at 1 million – has buffeted the country’s economy and society. A Syrian laborer is paid some 40 percent less than his Lebanese counterpart.</p> \n<p>If you visited Beirut you wouldn’t feel the crisis immediately. The entire city has been renovated since the war and the tourists have returned. In fact, tourism today is the country’s economic mainstay; in May hotel occupancy was at 66 percent. But here too the threat from Syria casts a pall – in November more than 40 people were killed in two Islamic State terror attacks.</p> \n<p>“The tension is aggravated by the fact that plenty of guys have gone to fight in Syria,” says Yousef. “Today in south Lebanon people are looking east and north toward Syria and are less worried about the border with Israel.”</p> \n<p>According to the former member of the South Lebanon Army, the construction on the hills near the border means a quiet period is expected.</p> \n<p>He says an acquaintance told him that “all in all, people manage. Some young people have left for Beirut or abroad, many work for the state, and some still make a living from farming, mainly tobacco.”</p> \n<p>As the SLA man puts it, “After a decade you can say it’s quiet in south Lebanon. But is it because of an understanding or deterrence?”</p> \n<p>He has no doubt that today too it’s clear that the real sovereign in Lebanon is Hezbollah. All that remains is “to wait and see where the war in Syria leads and if it changes things in Lebanon.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>A year after its official launch, a bold plan meant to facilitate conversions performed outside Israel appears doomed.</p> \n<p>Spearheaded by Jewish Agency Chairman Natan Sharansky, the initiative called for establishing a special conversion court that would dispatch rabbis from Israel to communities overseas increasingly challenged by the stringent requirements and vetting powers of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate.</p> \n<p>A key condition for getting it off the ground was obtaining an agreement from the Ministry of Interior that individuals converted by this special “traveling” court would be eligible for automatic citizenship in Israel under the Law of Return. But to date, the Jewish Agency has failed to receive such a commitment.</p> \n<p>The Law of Return stipulates that anybody who converts abroad – regardless of the affiliation of the rabbis supervising the process – is eligible for citizenship, providing that the conversion is undertaken in a recognized Jewish community and by recognized local rabbis. In the past, the Ministry of Interior has challenged conversions undertaken by rabbis who were not local, but rather, flown in.</p> \n<p>Speaking with Haaretz, Sharansky said that two former interior ministers – Gideon Sa'ar and Silvan Shalom, both of the Likud party – had agreed in principle to recognize conversions performed by the new court for the purpose of immigration. Yet each resigned from their posts before any deal could be finalized.</p> \n<p>Aryeh Deri, the current interior minister, heads Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party very resistant to challenging &nbsp;the Chief Rabbinate.&nbsp; More than 15 years ago, Sharansky founded a political party that set as its goal wresting control of the Interior Ministry from Shas, which had been known to raise difficulties for Russian-speaking immigrants not considered Jewish under religious law. For this reason, relations between Sharansky and the ultra-Orthodox party have long been strained.</p> \n<p>Sharansky said he not yet met with Deri on the matter. “We have points of debate with Aryeh Deri on this issue,” he said.</p> \n<p>Asked to comment, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Interior said: “To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not been approved, and when it becomes relevant, we assume that the Ministry of Interior’s position will be made known.”</p> \n<p>Sharansky did not rule out the possibility of taking the matter to court if the ministry continued to drag its feet. As grounds for a legal suit, he cited a recent Supreme Court ruling that broke the monopoly of the Chief Rabbinate on conversions performed in Israel.</p> \n<p>In that ruling, the Supreme Court authorized conversions performed by private Orthodox rabbinical courts in Israel – in defiance of the Chief Rabbinate, which had held that only conversions performed by its own state-sanctioned rabbinical courts were valid. “That ruling makes our case very strong,” said Sharansky.</p> \n<p>A resolution to establish the special conversion court was passed by the Jewish Agency Board of Governors in late June 2015.&nbsp; The initiative was widely hailed around the Jewish world.</p> \n<p>In recent years, the Chief Rabbinate has been blacklisting certain Orthodox rabbis, both in the United States and in Europe, considered too progressive in their approach to Judaism, and has refused to recognize conversions performed by them. The most recent example was Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, a prominent Modern Orthodox rabbi.</p> \n<p>The spiritual leader of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun in Manhattan and the former principal of the Ramaz School, Lookstein has converted, among others, Ivanka Trump, the daughter of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican candidate for November's presidential election. The&nbsp;Supreme Rabbinical Court is now considering an appeal in the matter.</p> \n<p>Because of the increasingly stringent requirements of the Chief Rabbinate, many Orthodox rabbis abroad have stopped performing conversions, according to Seth Farber, founder and executive director of ITIM, an organization that advocates on behalf of converts.</p> \n<p>The new Jewish Agency-sponsored conversion court was meant to address this problem by filling in for those rabbis unwilling to set themselves up for disappointment and humiliation.</p> \n<p>In some communities, particularly in Europe and South America, the problem is also that there are not enough certified local rabbis to perform Orthodox conversions. Jewish law requires a conversion court to be comprised of three rabbis. In those communities where there are only one or two rabbis on the ground, the new conversion court could have filled in the gaps.</p>",

        "text":["<p> Some 10 months after the fact, last summer’s Operation Protective Edge in the Gaza Strip has been largely erased from Israeli public consciousness. The confrontation with Hamas – in which more Israelis were killed than in any war since 2006, which completely disrupted life in much of the southern part of the country, and during which rockets were fired at Tel Aviv and the country’s international airport was paralyzed for a day – was barely present on the agenda of the election campaign that ended on March 17. &nbsp; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu easily shook off whatever criticism was aimed at him over the war’s indecisive results, and promised to “be strong” against Hamas next time, too. The general repression of the subject was aided by the Israel Defense Forces’ insistence that the war was a success, if not a victory, because the army ostensibly fulfilled all the missions it was assigned by the political echelon. Actually, there was more criticism of the war – which the state stubbornly continues to term an “operation” – while it was happening than afterward.  The IDF has still not made public its lessons and conclusions from the 50-day campaign, in which Israel had difficulty establishing a military advantage over the weakest of adversaries.  Instead of a critical analysis, we have heard mostly self-praise from the IDF General Staff and words of admiration of the troops’ heroism. The government, of course, has fallen into step with this. True, the state comptroller is examining some of the key issues relating to the war, but it will be many months (during which we can only hope there’ll be no additional wars) before those reports are published.  What remains is the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. In September, shortly after the war ended, it announced that it would conduct a comprehensive examination of the events. Briefly, it seemed that a surprising consensus had emerged among the former security personnel and experienced civilian observers on the committee, from both coalition and opposition, who harbored many doubts after what they were told by senior ministers and officers during the fighting. Their work began in earnest, including hearings in which senior figures from the defense establishment testified – but all this ended abruptly when Netanyahu decided to call an early election.  As a result, says committee member MK Ofer Shelah (Yesh Atid), the body will not issue a report about the war.  “It was clear that Likud members of the committee would not be able to sign off on findings that criticized the government’s performance, even though there was relatively broad agreement about the war’s results,” Shelah says now.  A year ago, Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid tried to collect an old debt from Netanyahu and get Shelah appointed chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. The prime minister refused, and in retrospect, it’s clear why: Shelah’s analysis of the war, in the interview that follows, is the best-grounded and most thorough critique of the way it was handled by the military and political leaderships.  Every citizen should be concerned about what Shelah gleaned from the testimonies he heard in the committee and supplemented with information he gathered on his own: Israel’s political leadership is full of ambitious plans for dealing with the Iranian nuclear threat, but the IDF is bogged down in the quagmire of policing the West Bank. Decision makers see periodical rounds of fighting in the Gaza Strip almost as something decreed by fate, yet they do not prepare the country or the army for these rounds – and worse: Apparently, they are not drawing the necessary conclusions from past confrontations for a possibly more serious clash in the future with the Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  Operation Protective Edge’s most acute failure, according to Shelah, “lies in the absence of a complementary political process, without which a military operation always lacks a context and can make no real achievements. Netanyahu’s refusal to initiate a regional move to further Israel’s interest of curbing Hamas and demilitarizing Gaza – while rehabilitating it – has thrust us back to square one. Hamas is building up its strength again and remains in an Israeli and Egyptian stranglehold. If there’s no change, the next round is a matter of time, and it will be grimmer than Operation Protective Edge.”  Even though it was “a war foretold,” the Yesh Atid MK continues, “Israel and the IDF were not prepared for it, either politically or militarily. A prime minister who evades any concrete discussion, and defense ministers who were shaped by the army and cling to archaic paradigms, are directly responsible for the fact that the IDF was not prepared for this war and for Israel’s failure to achieve anything. Because everyone is burying his head in the sand, next time will be the same. Chief responsibility lies with Netanyahu. In his six years at the helm, along with his Iranian obsession and reckless handling of affairs of state – he didn’t articulate an appropriate policy for dealing with this challenge, and didn’t address the requisite changes in Israel’s security approach or the army’s preparedness.  “Responsibility is shared by Ehud Barak,” Shelah notes. “He was defense minister for five years, during a period of budgetary stability and relative quiet. But instead of taking advantage of the circumstances to make the necessary changes, he let the army become bloated, and didn’t prepare it for a war that was obviously on the cards. His successor, Moshe Ya’alon, faced a tougher situation, but he too was shaped by the defense establishment and is incapable of transforming the military. It’s not just them, though; there is a whole conception that has lost its meaning, a whole system that is incapable of self-correction.”  Unanswered questions  A reservist officer in the Paratroops, Shelah was seriously wounded in the Lebanon war of 1982. Before entering politics, he was a journalist who devoted much of his time to writing about the IDF, and in particular its inability to examine itself thoroughly and change accordingly. During the 2014 war, he advised his good friend Lapid, a member of the inner “security cabinet.” He also attended frequent briefings of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and collected information from an extensive network of friends and acquaintances. Shelah soon realized that the army’s conduct in the confrontation would unavoidably yield undesirable results. “I feel like someone in one of our books,” he told me then, deeply frustrated. (Shelah and I were the authors of competing books about the second intifada and afterward about the Second Lebanon War.)  After the war a fierce argument broke out between the Shin Bet and Military Intelligence regarding which of them had been the first to warn about such a confrontation. Could you determine out who was right?  “I don’t want to comment on what I heard in the committee. But both organizations, and in their wake the media, are dealing with the wrong issue. People always talk about whether there was a single piece of intelligence ‘gold.’ But in retrospect, everyone agrees that Hamas prepared itself for the confrontation, and it was understood that in a particular scenario it would be prepared for one in summer 2014, whether it wanted it or not.”  Shelah is referring mainly to the intelligence community’s understanding, in the wake of a Shin Bet warning last April that Hamas was deploying for a terrorist strike through an attack tunnel. In June, the IDF made intensive efforts to thwart such an attack.  “If you know about this danger,” Shelah notes, “the big question is how you prepare for the possibility that it will actualize and drag you into a war. For example, why wasn’t this considered in the debate about suspending training [of certain IDF units] in June 2014, during the defense budget crisis, when the IDF was demanding increased funding?”  On June 12, 2014, three Jewish yeshiva students were abducted in the West Bank by a Hamas cell from Hebron, which murdered them within minutes. Israel launched Operation Brother’s Keeper to find the boys and undermine the Islamic organization’s infrastructure in the West Bank. The operation ended June 30, when the three bodies were found.  “How can one explain Israel’s behavior during Operation Brother’s Keeper?” Shelah asks. “You know there’s a danger of a possible flare-up in Gaza, but is that taken into account when you escalate the offensive against Hamas in the West Bank? The IDF arrested hundreds of Hamas activists in the West Bank, including dozens of senior figures and more than 50 who had been freed in the Shalit deal [a reference to the prisoner swap that led to the return of captive soldier Gilad Shalit], and also struck at Hamas’ civilian networks across the West Bank. This was totally unrelated to the effort to find the three boys.  “Why does Israel announce, while the operation is still ongoing, that the goal is to dismantle the Hamas-Fatah conciliation government? Israel knows that this means it will be impossible to pay salaries in Gaza, thereby pushing Hamas even more strongly up against the wall, even as it’s deployed for an attack via a tunnel at Kerem Shalom.  “Strategically,” Shelah continues, “It’s clear that Hamas is escalating the situation on the border because of the siege of Gaza by Israel and Egypt. And why do you take all the infantry brigades and the army’s most elite units and for three weeks deploy all of them to search for the teens’ bodies and arrest Hamas figures, when you have a war to plan for in Gaza and you know that Hamas is completing its own plans for an attack – and you have serious intelligence gaps in that regard? And most serious of all, the Gaza context doesn’t even come up in the security cabinet’s meetings in June. The security cabinet considers the danger of the Gaza tunnels only in general terms, while the West Bank operation is going on.  “Only after the bodies are found is the security cabinet told about the warning of a tunnel attack. And even then the question of whether we want to bring about a confrontation isn’t raised. For example, do we want to launch our opening strike under better conditions? Most of the damage the IDF inflicted on Hamas in Operation Cast Lead [December 2008] and in Operation Pillar of Defense (November 2012) came in surprise opening strikes. If we’re headed for a deterioration in Gaza, willingly or not, why on the one hand do we let it roll along and on the other hand do nothing to prepare for it?”  One’s impression is that the security cabinet lacked influence and only approved IDF plans and Netanyahu’s approach.  Shelah: “This is ostensibly the body that manages the war, but in practice it’s void of content. That was true in the Second Lebanon War as well, but Netanyahu took it to new heights this time. It’s a deliberate posture by a suspicious prime minister who has no confidence in his ministers – and some members of the forum [Shelah is referring to Naftali Bennett and Avigdor Lieberman] did everything to justify his suspicions. Netanyahu followed procedure by convening the security cabinet every two-three days. The meetings were long and exhausting and dealt with the least relevant issues for a wartime security cabinet. The peak was the final cease-fire, declared on August 26: Netanyahu didn’t even convene the security cabinet to discuss it, and of course there was no discussion of what sort of diplomatic process would firm up the gains of the war.  “The problem starts with the composition of the security cabinet: the busiest ministers from the biggest ministries. Apart from the prime minister and the defense minister, none of them has a military secretary or outside adviser to help process and analyze intelligence material. They have no way to collect information independently and then to process it into insight, other than by intravenous nutrition from Military Intelligence. They get information but can’t convert it into knowledge to aid decision-making.”  The enemy within  Shelah: “Netanyahu does not view the security cabinet as a policy-making body. During the term of his last government, he did not initiate one serious discussion about Gaza in the security cabinet. There was one, very general, discussion. The MI reports about the tunnels, which were available to Netanyahu and Ya’alon from the beginning of 2013, were not made known to the security cabinet. The ministers came into Operation Protective Edge having almost no idea of the tunnels.”  The security cabinet is Israel’s supreme security body, but you would never know it from the way Netanyahu treats it. According to the state comptroller’s reports on the episode of the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara in the Gaza Freedom Flotilla (2010) and on the performance of the National Security Council (2012), in his second government Netanyahu convened the seven-member security cabinet – a body that had no operative powers – 57 times in 16 months to discuss a “strategic issue.” That is the comptroller’s cautious term for Israeli policy on Iran’s nuclear project. During that period, the security cabinet did not discuss a multi-year plan for the IDF (a concept that has been frozen for the past four years), and it neglected many of the country’s security issues. Discussions of critical issues were frequently postponed, according to the state comptroller, due to objections by the defense establishment.  Three members of the outgoing security cabinet, from different parties, corroborate Shelah’s take on this subject.  “Foreign journalists were taken on a tour of the tunnel whose opening on our side was discovered a year before the war, but not most of the security cabinet,” he explains. “Its members didn’t know about Hamas’ subterranean project. When the war broke out, they knew absolutely nothing about Hamas or about the IDF’s ability to cope with the organization. It’s the same in other sectors. The security cabinet meets to authorize specific operations. There’s no discussion of possible scenarios and of how to respond in case of a deterioration, even though it’s clear that in Gaza, at least, a war is in the cards.  “There were no surprises of the October 1973 kind [a reference to the Yom Kippur War]: Everyone knew there would be another confrontation in Gaza. We knew Hamas was preparing and that it was caught in a strategic trap that could induce it to act.”  In the case of Gaza, Shelah says, “the security cabinet ministers come into the room like virgins. That’s deliberate on Netanyahu’s part. So all a security cabinet member has, in the best case, is personal experience and common sense. The nasty thing is that this situation serves both sides. It allows Netanyahu and Ya’alon to manage an operation by themselves, and it allows the members of the security cabinet to say, irresponsibly, things that contradict what they themselves said in the cabinet room. I won’t comment on what came up in the discussions of the security cabinet, but it should be clear to you that no one said, in those closed meetings, ‘We have to conquer Gaza,’ as some had argued publicly. The result was great hostility between Netanyahu and the security cabinet during the war. He treated his security cabinet as an enemy.  “The situation is compounded by the National Security Council’s weakness,” Shelah adds. “The IDF simply ignores the council’s ideas. The army takes a completely unified stance, the prime minister and the defense minister fall into step and the security cabinet has no chance of intervening. It has no information about basic matters that underlie decision-making, such as the IDF’s preparedness.”  Did the security cabinet receive credible intelligence assessments about Hamas’ situation during the war?  “At quite an early stage, IDF intelligence assessed mistakenly that Hamas was close to the breaking point, and was looking for a way to end the fighting quickly. Moreover, it was said, when Hamas’ senior personnel emerge from their tunnels and bunkers – during a temporary cease-fire – and see the scale of the destruction Israel wrought in Gaza, they will rush to a final cease-fire, even at inconvenient terms. That’s the reason for the endless series of cease-fires, with the security cabinet being told, ‘Either a cease-fire or the conquest of Gaza.’ Other options were not discussed.  “In practice, Hamas kept breaking the cease-fire, because it wanted to achieve more, contrary to MI appraisals. MI did not excel in analyzing and predicting Hamas decisions, especially regarding the last few weeks of the operation. The assessment was conceptually biased, as it was based on an exaggerated view of the damage inflicted on Hamas and its impact on the organization’s will to keep fighting  “In the war itself, more than half the targets that were attacked from the air were either the homes of Hamas commanders – who were underground at the time – or rocket storerooms and launching pits. Those attacks achieved no effective goal and did not affect the rocket fire into Israel. Only toward the end of the war did information surface about the whereabouts of senior Hamas figures, which made it possible to assassinate them.”  In recent months, it became clear that the commander of Hamas’ military wing, Mohammed Deif, survived yet another Israeli attempt on his life – an August 19 missile attack.  Tunnel bungle  Shelah corroborates the findings of an Haaretz investigation (“Haaretz probe: IDF lacked training, equipment to tackle tunnels in Gaza war,” October 17, 2014) regarding the IDF’s preparedness for combat in the tunnels. When embarking on the war, the IDF had no operative plan to deal with the tunnels, no means to demolish them, no relevant combat doctrine, and nor had its infantry units undergone training to meet the challenge. Senior IDF officers maintain that the 32 offensive tunnels known to MI and the Shin Bet were destroyed, though they are not certain the destruction was total. Moreover, the operation took longer than originally estimated and entailed heavy losses.  “The intelligence information about the tunnels was not translated into the insight that a war that would involve them was imminent, that Hamas would exploit the tunnels for offensive strikes on Israel and that thorough preparedness was necessary,” Shelah says. “We had known that there were dozens of offensive routes [available to them], and we uncovered four tunnels in the 18 months before the war. We knew that this was Hamas’ flagship project.  “In 2008,” the MK continues, “the IDF drew up a first ‘road map’ for dealing with the tunnels, but most of the effort went into developing means to locate them. Practically, the IDF did not have even one serious facility for training the infantry in subterranean combat. My son [who serves in the Paratroops’ engineering company] told me that one time he descended by rope into a tunnel the IDF dug on an army base, in an exercise whose method was not utilized during the war. The IDF’s subterranean combat was one big improvisation.  “Not until July 17, after the army foiled the infiltration of 13 Hamas terrorists via a tunnel into Kibbutz Sufa, was an urgent meeting held and a decision made to mount an operation against the tunnels. Until then, there was no real discussion of the tunnels in the security cabinet. When questions were asked, Ya’alon and the army replied that dealing with the tunnels would involve a large-scale operation with multiple casualties. Ya’alon estimated that demolishing the tunnels would take 48 hours, but in practice the ground operation took two-and-a-half weeks – meaning that they had no idea how much force would be needed to deal with the tunnels or how to manage the operation. And this was something known in advance, just across the border. It’s not like we were sending troops to Entebbe.”  There was “a huge conceptual failure,” Shelah maintains, which was as much defensive as offensive. He elaborates: “The IDF had no method of observation to scan Israeli territory on our side of the border, to meet a surprise offensive via the tunnels. Eight years after Gilad Shalit’s abductors infiltrated Israel via a cross-border tunnel and took Shalit’s tank crew by surprise from behind, more than a third of the 67 IDF soldiers who were killed in the [Gaza] war were casualties of defense: attacks via the tunnels into our territory and mortar fire at bases close to the border.”  ‘Toying’ with security  Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert claimed that the Netanyahu-Barak government spent 11 billion shekels (currently $2.8 billion) on preparations for a possible attack on Iran. Shelah adds more data about that period: “Over a period of five years, salaries for IDF career personnel rose by more than 20 percent, and the number of career soldiers increased by 12.2 percent, until the budget-cutting decisions of 2013 and afterward. Most of that money was not spent on items that are relevant to any war we face.  “Another classic example,” he notes, “was the plan to buy from the United States, using American aid funds, six V-22 vertical-liftoff planes at a combined cost of $1 billion. The plan was frozen, because the funds were needed to purchase munitions for the air force and ground forces. Until then, the plan was to acquire six exotic platforms that would upgrade the IDF’s capability for very specific purposes. The expensive procurement plans focused on toys.”  As reported in Haaretz, the Gaza war made vast, sometimes exaggerated use of combat means and munitions. The full data are secret. Shelah offers a paraphrase.  “It’s an unfair comparison,” he says, “but it’s the best I have. In the first three weeks of the conquest of Iraq, in 2003, the U.S. armed forces captured cities and destroyed 1,600 armored vehicles of the Iraqi army, half of them tanks. In Gaza, the IDF fought against an enemy that had no armored vehicles, and Israeli soldiers probably saw no more than a few hundred armed Hamas militants. On average, an Israeli tank fired seven times as many shells a day as an American tank in Iraq. We fired more antitank missiles from the ground than the Americans, and twice as many Hellfire rockets from helicopters – Israel requested more of them during the war, but the Americans delayed their supply.  “With no economic management of the war, there is tremendous waste and inefficiency. The IDF is always talking about the need to shorten wars, but that’s unlikely to happen in the next confrontation.”  Even now, Shelah says, “The IDF does not have a full and appropriate doctrine for coming wars, in either the north or the south. We are facing a decentralized enemy with almost no control centers that, if silenced, would break him. Conquering territory is liable to turn out to be a problem rather than a solution, because of their ability to harass us and due to mounting civilian casualties.  “During Gabi Ashkenazi’s tenure as chief of staff, which ended in 2011, the view was that the IDF should prepare for an all-out war, because anything else will follow from that. But that is a conceptual blunder. The campaign against Hamas is unrelated to a 1973-style general war... so the officers invent all kinds of ideas about how wearing down a guerrilla organization is like vanquishing the enemy.”  In practice, Shelah notes, “The IDF did not suppress the firing at the Israeli civilian rear throughout the Gaza war. A completely different combat doctrine is needed. The IDF has made praiseworthy efforts to reduce the killing of civilians in aerial attacks. That was especially noticeable in Operation Protective Edge, and involved the use of means costing millions of shekels. But when you add that outlay to such a large number of targets that do little to achieve the war’s goals – the entire combat doctrine becomes dubious.  “At the same time, the ground maneuver, which was conducted with large forces, the lack of tactical surprise and the use of tremendous firepower to cover the movements of the troops – all this unavoidably causes vast property damage and civilian casualties [on the Palestinian side]. The only way to protect the soldiers during such a maneuver is with large-scale fire and smoke. As a result, the combat method is ineffective, and we’re also saddled with the consequences of unintended killing of innocent people and causing damage on a scale intolerable to the international community. Within a few days the supply of aerial targets runs out, but only then is the whole ground force massed for a broad maneuver. And then it becomes a public question of courage or cowardice: Are the security cabinet and the General Staff ready to send the ground troops in?”  Shelah notes the IDF’s use of the “roof knocking” technique – a telephone warning to the family of a Hamas commander, after which a warning rocket is fired at or close to the house, to signal the family to leave. When it’s ascertained that the family has left, the house is bombed and destroyed. The IDF boasted about the method as being humane and reducing casualties. Shelah calls it “a military practice on the brink of the absurd. A fighter plane circles in the air for a long period, and multiple means of photography and observation are implemented, all in order to level the house of a Hamas company commander whom you know is not there. You also rightly invest every effort to ascertain that his wives and children will not be hurt.  “After the war you have to rehabilitate the fleet of planes because of the wasted hours of flying time. The moral effort is praiseworthy, but the method is insane and entails a tremendous investment for meager results. While the planes are in the air, the pilots are not training. This reflects a combat doctrine that defies logic.”  No discussion of Gaza is complete without mentioning the detrimental effects of the IDF’s ongoing policing activity in the West Bank on its combat professionalism. As after every war, Shelah says, “The IDF complains about the harm done to training in the years before the war due to budget problems. The commanders, fearful of entering a political minefield, conveniently ignore the fact that the protracted service in the West Bank has a far more deleterious effect on the forces’ capability.  “After the Second Lebanon War, many field commanders admitted that they had a hard time transitioning from the mentality and methods of routine security in the territories to the type of combat called for in Lebanon. For the same reason, units sent into Gaza were also unprepared for the warfare they encountered. Commanders and troops have to learn as they go, with serious consequences, including casualties.”  On July 11, 2006, the day before the Second Lebanon War broke out, the then-new prime minister, Olmert, visited the General Staff forum. In the meeting, Maj. Gen. Yishai Bar warned that the ground forces’ level of capability was like a check that’s going to bounce – “at some point the bank will call.” The IDF, Bar told Olmert, is “an army with no training. That’s an invention of global proportions. Maybe we should patent it.” &nbsp; Much was fixed in the IDF after that war, but much also remains unchanged. According to Shelah, it’s essential to deal with the situation as it exists now, in the way that Bar’s warning should have been dealt with then, but for which there was no time: as a wake-up call ahead of the next war, even if no one knows for certain if and when it will erupt. Without a change, the personal report presented here by one MK will become largely the point of departure for a future commission of inquiry.  Clip and save for the next war.</p>",

Their lease expires in 2034.</p> \n<p>It now turns out that the lease for Gan Rehavia, which is on the other side of the Ratisbonne Monastery from Rosh Rehavia, has been sold to the same entrepreneur, Moshe Idan. But this time, Idan has partners in the venture, one of whom is Shlomo Dery.</p> \n<p>Over the coming decades, hundreds of families in central Jerusalem will face similar problems. The churches, mainly the Catholic and Greek Orthodox ones, own land in many Jerusalem neighborhoods, including Rehavia, Talbiyeh, Nayot and Rassco.</p> \n<p>In most cases, the 99-year leases on this land were signed in 1950 or 1951, so they will expire in another 33 or 34 years. But the land around the Ratisbonne Monastery was leased in the 1930s, so residents of this area are the first to face the problem.</p> \n<p>The churches don’t want to deal with the problem themselves, so they are instead selling the leases to private entrepreneurs, usually for another 200 years.</p> \n<p>For instance, most of the land in Talbiyeh and Nayot was sold to a group of investors headed by the Ben-David family. The leases for Givat Oranim were sold to a group of anonymous investors, and the Rosh Rehavia and Gan Rehavia leases were sold to Idan and his partners.</p> \n<p>Dery, an attorney who specializes in real estate, was recently questioned by the police under caution —meaning as someone who might be charged with a crime — about properties he bought from his brother, Interior Minister Arye Dery. Shlomo Dery owns 350 of the 1,185 shares in Idan’s Ezrat Halovim company, which bought the Gan Rehavia lease.</p> \n<p>According to the website of the Israel Tax Authority, the company paid 28 million shekels ($7.2 million) for the lease. The site in question, located at the corner of Narkiss and Shmuel Hanagid streets, holds three buildings that contain some 70 apartments.</p> \n<p>The residents are now being told they must either sell their apartments to the company for half their market value, or buy the lease from the company at a similar price. If they do neither, they will be forced to vacate with no compensation in another 19 years.</p> \n<p>“There’s approximately 20 years to go, which means that every year, the residents are losing about five percent of the value of their apartment,” said a source who is knowledgeable about the terms of the deal and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p> \n<p>“It would pay for the residents to sell and buy an apartment in Kiryat Yovel,” a much less pricey and less prestigious neighborhood than Rehavia.</p> \n<p>The residents, like those in similar situations elsewhere in the city, are hoping that either the state or the JNF, which was involved in many of the original leases, will ultimately do something to help them out of their fix. One possibility is a law that would give residents some property rights to their apartments.</p> \n<p>But everyone involved in the issue agrees that the more time passes, and the more private entrepreneurs take over the churches’ leases, the less likely it is that the state will do anything of the sort.</p> \n<p>“Nobody knows what will happen,” said one Gan Rehavia resident, who asked to remain anonymous. “I’m not optimistic, but maybe there’s a chance that toward the end of the lease, something will happen. Maybe the state will pass a law. The problem is that the entrepreneurs have property rights, and they’ll fight for them.”</p> \n<p>A woman who has lived in Gan Rehavia for decades, said all the families are in a panic. “Nobody imaged things would come to such a pass,” she said. “I’m less worried, because in another 20 years, who knows if I’ll still be here. But there are young people here, and they’re worried.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Amiram Ben-Uliel, who was charged Sunday with three counts of murder in connection with last July’s arson attack in Duma, was a familiar figure in the West Bank. Until now, though, he had never been arrested on suspicion of involvement in serious violent activities.</p> \n<p>Born in July 1994, he is originally from Karmei Zur, a settlement north of Hebron. He is the eldest son of Rabbi Reuven Ben-Uliel, who is identified with mainstream religious Zionism and also serves as the rabbi for Mechina Nokdim, a preparatory program for religious youths entering the army.</p> \n<p>The story of Amiram Ben-Uliel is similar to that of other young Jewish extremists in the West Bank (known in Israel as “hilltop youth”). Despite coming from a stable, functional family, he left school following academic difficulties and gravitated toward extremism. After experiencing a few minor scrapes with the law, his views became ever more radical and his connection with his family became more distant.</p> \n<p>At first, he frequented the small West Bank outpost of Ramat Migron, which was established by settler leader Daniella Weiss near the larger outpost of Migron. The outpost was built in protest at the intention of Migron residents to evacuate their outpost voluntarily.</p> \n<p>Ramat Migron attracted extremists, and it was here that Ben-Uliel met Meir Ettinger – grandson of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, the founder of the outlawed Kach movement.</p> \n<p>Ben-Uliel and Ettinger were also active in a group seeking to establish a Jewish presence in Nablus and Jericho. They were documented praying at Joseph’s Tomb outside Nablus, having reached the site in the dead of night without the necessary permission from the Israel Defense Forces.</p> \n<p>After Ramat Migron was dismantled a few years ago, Ben-Uliel frequented various other settlements and outposts, including Maoz Esther and Itamar, as well as Baladim and Geulat Tzion.</p> \n<p>Despite his long involvement with Jewish extremism, Ben-Uliel had never been investigated by the Shin Bet security service, and his criminal record remained relatively light compared with others previously implicated in the Duma case. However, one criminal file on Ben-Uliel gave a hint of the direction his views might take: He admitted he would not comply with limitations imposed on him by the court, since he did not recognize the legitimacy of the State of Israel.</p> \n<p>Two years ago, Ben-Uliel married Orian Nizri, who had also become associated with Jewish extremists. She was known for her radicalism – one Purim, she dressed up as Eden Natan-Zada, the Israeli who killed four Arabs during a shooting spree in Shfaram 10 years ago. At one point, she had no less than 10 indictments against her, some involving offenses allegedly committed against Palestinians, some against the police and others of allegedly spitting on Christian clergy in the Old City of Jerusalem. Only the couple’s parents attended their wedding.</p> \n<p>Prior to the firebombing of the Dawabsheh home in Duma – in which three members of the family, including 18-month-old Ali, were killed and the remaining child was badly burned – Ben-Uliel lived on a bus in the Adei Ad outpost, on a hilltop that overlooks Duma. After the murders, Ben-Uliel and his wife and 1-year-old daughter moved to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>They told friends they had embraced the Breslov strain of Hasidic ultra-Orthodoxy, and viewed themselves as followers of Rabbi Eliezer Berland, who had headed the Shuvu Bonim yeshiva in Jerusalem before fleeing to the Netherlands after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him.</p> \n<p>Orian Ben-Uliel began wrapping herself in shawls for reasons of modesty, as is the practice among groups of extremely ultra-Orthodox women. Amiram, meanwhile, began studying at a yeshiva for married students in Jerusalem, where he was arrested on December 1.</p> \n<p>Friends and acquaintances were surprised to hear that Ben-Uliel had broken under interrogation, and that he had confessed and performed a reenactment of the crime in Duma. “Amiram is strong-minded. The torture there must have been so severe that anyone would break,” one of his close friends told Haaretz, adding that Ben-Uliel’s unnamed juvenile codefendant – who faces an accessory to murder charge – had not been so strong.</p> \n<p>On Sunday morning, Ben-Uliel’s parents issued a statement saying they believed in their son’s innocence and that his confession had been extracted through torture. Rabbi Avichai Rontzki, the former chief rabbi of the Israel Defense Forces, also issued a statement. “I am the rabbi of ‘Ruvi’ Ben-Uliel, the father of Amiram,” he said. “I held the babies at the family’s circumcisions. The father is the salt of the earth, but sometimes rabbis’ sons kick in all directions, acting contrary to their fathers,” he added.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It happens every (weekday) evening across the entire land of Israel. Dates involving religiously observant Jews who have been brought together by a matchmaker take place in hotel lobbies, in certain approved cafes and pubs, and also in family homes. And if you’re a so-called hilltop youth in the West Bank, it could also happen at a secret spring in an obscure valley in Samaria. In the dark.</p> \n<p>A secret spring at night? Suddenly my secular dates sound so dull.</p> \n<p>“Yes, yes,” says Dr. Yaarit Bokek-Cohen, a sociologist at Bar-Ilan University. “Hilltop youth look for exotic locations. As a secular woman, I would find it quite frightening to go to a spring in the dark on a first date, but for them it lacks the connotations that we attribute to it. For them, it’s simply cool.”</p> \n<p>I’d always thought that matchmaking existed primarily in the Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox, communities, but according to Bokek-Cohen, who has recently studied the subject in the religious-Zionist movement, there are about 70 matchmakers among that population as well. Some of them, she discovered, work as husband-and-wife teams: a rabbi and head of the yeshiva, and his wife – the rabbanit (rebbetzin, in Yiddish). Young women from all over the country seeking attractive young men enrolled in a prestigious yeshiva will, for example, often turn to the rabbanit. She takes them to her husband, who is well acquainted with the students. He interviews the young woman and tries to find her a suitable match.</p> \n<p>Young people from the religious-Zionist public might start with the description offered by a matchmaker, but they soon find one another’s Facebook page with its plethora of posted photos with friends and from treks abroad. In the case of Haredim, however, even though the matchmakers often have photographs of their clients, they are less inclined to show them.</p> \n<p>“One time a young man came to me after he became engaged,” the Haredi matchmaker P. relates. She continues, “He wanted to see the picture his fianc&eacute;e had sent me. After looking at it, he said, ‘Thanks for not showing it to me earlier, because if I’d seen it before the meeting, I would never have met with her at all.’ Today they are married and have children, thank God.”</p> \n<p>P., who requested not to be identified by her full name, agreed to be described as “an ultra-Orthodox matchmaker with an open mind.” She works mainly with people she refers to as “modern Haredim,” some of them academics, who want to combine Torah with work. They prefer not to use religious dating websites, such as date4dos.co.il, but to find a spouse by means of a more traditional method. Enter P., who is attentive to them and acts as a supportive liaison in bringing the relationship to fruition.</p> \n<p>The Haredi matchmaking world is as complex and diverse as the Haredi world itself. In the Gerrer (Gur) Hasidic community, for example, the intended bride and groom meet once or at most twice, and if they like each other, a vort (Yiddish for “word”) ceremony is held in which the couple and their parents raise a toast and announce their engagement. In other Hasidic sects, the couple may meet three times before getting to that stage. In contrast, P.’s clients might meet quite a few times, though in some cases the young man will propose after five dates. That’s the minimum, she says.</p> \n<p>Before their first encounter, the two parties usually try to find out about each other by talking with relatives and friends. “They check out in advance religious and economic suitability and whether the families are compatible,” P. says.</p> \n<p>The dates take place at sites where there is no chance that the couple will be alone – in a hotel lobby, perhaps, or in a caf&eacute;, where they usually order something to drink. With the shyness of one who knows he’s about to embarrass himself, I asked P. what they order. “No chance of alcohol, eh?” She guffawed affably. “Of course not!” In any event, it’s the young man who pays.</p> \n<p>The routine of going to these meetings can be wearing on a young Haredi man looking for a wife – or vice versa. In some cases, the search can take years. That frustration, especially as it affects “older” Haredim – that is, in their late twenties and thirties – led one group of men and women in Jerusalem to establish a non-profit speed-dating system specifically oriented to the ultra-Orthodox community, which allows one to meet up to 30 candidates in a single evening.</p> \n<p>The format differs somewhat from regular, secular speed-dating. Once or twice a week a group of single Haredi young men and women meet – in a hall that’s been made available for the event – and each brings along something light to eat or drink. The organizers made a deliberate decision to allow divorced people to mingle with single ones, in order to shatter the stigma that attache to having been previously married.</p> \n<p>The evening begins with the men and the women sitting separately and listening to a talk by a rabbi on a subject related to love and relationships. Afterward, they divide into groups of five men and five women per table. Everyone introduces himself and/or herself briefly, before the 10 people at the table get into a conversation on a subject like “How would you feel if your ex wanted to meet your best friend?” After a short discussion, in which usually everyone participates, a gong sounds and the five men move to the next table, while the women remain seated and welcome another round of prospects. At the end of the evening, everyone notes the names of the people they liked. The sky’s the limit.</p> \n<p>One of the initiators of this project is Menachem, a Haredi bachelor of 32. After 12 years of searching for a spouse, he still hasn’t despaired of finding the love of his life.</p> \n<p>Like all those interviewed for this article, Menachem does not belong to the “hard core” of the Haredi community, but in his search for a potential mate, he too is subject to several strict limitations</p> \n<p>“There isn’t a lot of room for bachelors in Judaism, it’s a condition that’s neither here nor there,” he told me in a late-night telephone conversation. “The Torah – Genesis 2:24 – says, ‘Hence a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife.’ That is a sentence without a pause: When you leave your father and mother, you must immediately cling to a wife.”</p> \n<p>In the ‘home court’</p> \n<p>Despite the cultural gulf that divides us, Menachem and I understand each other well. Until not long ago, I too was part of the dating world, so I am familiar with the despair and the disappointment. Still, my ears perk up when he says that there are quite a few advantages to a first meeting with a young woman in her home, with her family.</p> \n<p>A first date with a girl and her parents together? Sounds like a total nightmare.</p> \n<p>Menachem: “I’ve never said no to that suggestion. In that way I gained both a meeting with the family members, which spared many future embarrassments, and visiting the home also reveals a great deal about their style. It’s also her home court, so she’s a lot more relaxed and goes with the flow. In addition, sometimes you see right off the bat that there’s no chance, so you can end the meeting early. You know, when you meet outside, it’s always hours until you order and then pay. In the girl’s house, it could end within 40 minutes. In really tough cases, I got up after exactly 40 minutes, said I was in a hurry and left.”</p> \n<p>With his rich experience, Menachem now gives advice to younger Haredi men ahead of their first dates – almost like P. She is making more and more matches that end in marriage, but wouldn’t tell me how many, saying only, “Thank God, quite a few.”</p> \n<p>Do you go to the weddings?</p> \n<p>P.: “If I’m invited I go, of course. That is the greatest joy there can be – to establish a faithful household in Israel. I remember that at one of the weddings, I saw the bride and groom coming out of the yichud room [where newlyweds spend a few moments in seclusion after the ceremony], holding hands. The groom spotted me in the large crowd, his eyes opened wide with happiness and his lips were saying, ‘Thank you.’ Tears came to my eyes. It’s a great deal of work, but it’s one of the biggest sources of satisfaction in the world.”</p> \n<p>‘Just looking for fun’</p> \n<p>While we secular types often tend not to talk about our intentions for the future in a very clear and unequivocal way when dating, we might do so before a first meeting, when one part of the pair – usually the woman – may ask the other if he or she is “serious” or is “just looking for some fun.” Otherwise, things generally progress very slowly. Any mention of kids, pregnancy, childbirth, raising a family, and so on is usually considered taboo before the relationship has passed the six-month mark, at the very least. Moving in together? Don’t bring that up either until plenty of time has gone by. We were in India, we did yoga, we took a dip in the Ganges, and we learned to live the present and believe in the power of the here-and-now.</p> \n<p>By contrast, a key aspect of meeting someone through a shiddukh (an arranged match) is that there are no games. As ultra-Orthodox Israelis have told me, when you decide to embark on this process, you’re talking business; it’s not about just going out with someone. It’s clear to both sides that the goal is to create a Jewish family.</p> \n<p>“This focus is both an advantage and a disadvantage,” explains Gil Barak, who grew up secular in Ramat Gan, became successful in public relations, and says he sampled “all the delights of Tel Aviv” before his quest for meaning led him to find spiritual succor in the Chabad movement. He became observant, married, had children and began counseling bridegrooms before the ceremony.</p> \n<p>Barak, who wrote a self-help book in Hebrew for couples entitled “Ledaber o Lishtok” (“To Speak or to Stay Silent”), says the focus on marriage spurs couples to move ahead in their relationships, but can also be very stressful: Inexperienced young, observant people feel they have to decide after just a few dates if they want to live with each other for the rest of their lives.</p> \n<p>How do they do this? First, it’s important to remember that before the dating even begins, it’s customary to speak with friends and relatives of the prospective match, to learn about their personality and intellectual and religious character from those who know them. People who are asked for their opinion are also subject to conflicting pressures: On the one hand, they don’t want to commit the sin of lashon hara (gossiping) and certainly don’t want to speak badly about a friend or relative. At the same time, Judaism obligates them to tell the truth. The result ends up being somewhere in the middle, and it’s with this information that one begins dating.</p> \n<p>Sarah Fichter, a former journalist who belongs to the Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox stream and is now a shadkhanit (matchmaker), has brought a good number of couples together under the wedding canopy. Now, two of her own daughters have started the process of seeking a match. She stresses that checking off a “laundry list” isn’t enough.</p> \n<p>“On paper,” she explains, “the young man or woman could be wonderful, very pious and virtuous. But if they leave your heart cold, then it’s a no-go. I like to see what happens by the third or fourth date. If there’s no emotional spark by then, the match should be called off. Of course, you could have strong feelings for someone, but also discover that they have qualities that don’t suit you. You have to ask yourself: Can I live with this person for the next 70 years? Still, if your heart isn’t excited at all, if you’re not waiting impatiently to see her, if you don’t miss her – then say goodbye. I always say, with shiddukhim, you have to be merciless if you feel that ‘this is not it’ – even if you’ve gone out seven times already.”</p> \n<p>The going rate for a matchmaker in the Haredi world is $1,000, from each side. Which is one reason many Haredim try to act as amateur matchmakers: You do a mitzvah and get paid, what could be bad?</p> \n<p>“The Gemara says this is the most ‘kosher money,’ the holiest money. I very happily receive it and also pay it out,” says Fichter. Sometimes, in lieu of money, the shadkhan is given an expensive gift as a token of thanks.</p> \n<p>Although it’s generally expected for brides to receive marital tips before the wedding, I was surprised, and pleased, to hear about the guidance that many grooms are offered. Most of the information relates to the concept of marriage according to halakha (traditional Jewish law), with its emphasis on the subject of niddah (relating to the woman’s menstrual period, a time when the couple must abstain from sexual relations). However, there are also counselors who talk about various ways to sustain a healthy relationship – offering the sort of prenuptial advice that secular men could benefit from as well.</p> \n<p>For his part, Barak says that he tells grooms about the importance of maintaining “pleasure in a relationship” by various means, stressing that they shouldn’t think of time spent together as a waste of time or as a sin: Even just going out to eat ice cream as a couple is “holy” if it strengthens their bond and their love for each other. He also tells them that during niddah, the husband mustn’t allow his wife to feel unwanted, but rather should use this time when physical contact of any kind is prohibited to strengthen their emotional bond. He also advises his clients about being considerate of their wife’s needs, including in the bedroom, once niddah is over.</p> \n<p>Barak: “You have to provide for her pleasure, not yours. In bed you are performing a mitzvah, this is the highest connection to the Creator, but it is also her time. You are connecting properly to Hashem if you are going at your wife’s pace, if you prepare her properly [for intimate relations], take her desires into account and give to her out of love. The husband has to make the wife happy, give her pleasure – and his pleasure is not the goal here, it is incidental.”</p> \n<p>He also debunks the popular notion that Haredim are only supposed to have sexual relations through a hole in a white sheet. “That’s forbidden by halakha,” he asserts. “Flesh must touch flesh, there can be no barrier. You have to be completely naked, otherwise you aren’t fulfilling the mitzvah.”</p> \n<p>In comparison, the conversation I had with Orly, who counsels brides, was less pleasant to my ears. Bridal counselors too apparently spend much time talking about the laws of niddah, ranging from the dry legal standpoint, to the deeper reasons for observing this mitzvah, such as “its holiness, and how it imparts healthfulness and fulfillment to married life.”</p> \n<p>Orly, who also belongs to the Chabad community, explains to brides that Judaism does not denigrate the female body, and that sexual relations in the marital framework are a good thing if properly conducted. The part that left my mouth gaping was when she explained how she also advises that, “the wife should be available to her husband, she should make an effort, and if the man wants it [i.e., intimate relations] she should encourage him, she should respond to him when he wants it. It’s a holy thing, and we encourage women as much as possible not to say no. If the woman is tired and doesn’t have the energy, then it’s best for the husband to be told this by means of open communication. But yes – sometimes, even if the woman doesn’t feel like it, she must make the effort and not act as if she’s doing him a favor. Yes, women must make the effort so their husbands will desire them. They say that in Judaism the man is rewarded for striving to please, to satisfy his wife, and she is rewarded for showing the man that she wants him.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Since their wedding in May 2012, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan have become the unofficial representatives of Jewish- and Asian-American couples in the United States. Earlier this month they were prominently featured around the world hugging their firstborn daughter Max. Previous stories revolved around Hannukah celebrations at the couple’s home and around the fact that Zuckerberg was studying Chinese.</p> \n<p>The phenomenon of mixed Jewish- and Asian-American couples has become more common over the past two decades, bringing with it media attention to the identity crisis facing their offspring. Even within the intellectual and multicultural greenhouse of the West Coast, these children are not always welcomed by the Jewish community.</p> \n<p>There are no updated official statistics on the incidence of such marriages. News of relationships between Jewish and Asian celebrities provokes opinion editorials on assimilation in Jewish media, with claims even made that Jewish males have developed a “deviant penchant” for Asian women.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, a dating app called “coffee and bagel,” popular among young educated people in New York, lets users state the preferred race of a potential partner. It recently published data provided by app users which ostensibly belies the claim that Jewish men look for Asian women.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, American media continue to cover the phenomenon. When a book by Amy Chua, who wrote the bestseller “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,” raised a furor in the U.S., the New York Times defined Chua and her husband Jed Rubenfeld as “the kind of Asian-Jewish academic power couple that populates many university towns.”</p> \n<p>Helen Kim and her husband Noah Leavitt from the Sociology Department at Whitman College are leading researchers of relations between Jews and Asian Americans. Ahead of the publication of their new book, called “JewAsian – Race, Religion and Identity for America’s Newest Jews,” Kim told Haaretz that the children of such mixed couples aren’t always welcomed by their communities of origin, even in major cities.</p> \n<p>“When we talk about our work, the response is that the Jewish community is becoming a racially more diverse community, and very welcoming. But I think the kids that we have interviewed would really challenge that. Even those little comments, like, ‘ha, funny, you don’t look Jewish,’ that some people might take as minor, over time they add up and become a challenge to identity. Just because it’s seemingly a diverse population doesn’t mean that the Jewish American population has fully grappled with what it means, and that the kids will feel totally accepted. I think there is still the assumption that Jews are from Poland.”</p> \n<p>Since 2010, Kim and Leavitt have held in-depth interviews with 68 couples with children and with 39 people aged 18-25 from families of Jews who married Asians (mostly Japanese- and Chinese-Americans). From testimonies collected by the researchers it appears that when they grow older the children embrace both identities, showing pride in their mixed origins.</p> \n<p>One interviewee, a son to a Filipina mother and Jewish father, said he was exposed to comments such as Judaism is transmitted through the mother, but he didn’t mind. “People just say that I’m not Jewish, it doesn’t count if it’s on my father’s side, it’s only valid through the mother, or if I really wanted to be Jewish I’d have to go through the Orthodox conversion ceremony – that sort of thing I still identify strongly with [Jewish identity], that half my family is Jewish and it doesn’t really matter which half, that it’s considered a part of myself and that it’s a part of me.”</p> \n<p>The external appearance of children with racially mixed parents had no bearing on their self-definition. All respondents in the survey said that they feel that their identity is multi-racial, defining themselves as both Jewish and Asian, rather than “half-Jewish” and “half-Asian.” The respondents were active in Jewish communities and familiar with and observed American Jewish customs. Many said that they wanted to raise their children as Jews. Some of the respondents are meticulous about attending synagogue and observing religious law, mainly as part of the Reform movement in the U.S.</p> \n<p>Last year, Angela Warnick Buchdahl, whose background is similar to that of other participants in the survey, became the leading rabbi at the Reform Central Synagogue in New York.</p> \n<p>“You know, the first time I told my parents I wanted to be a rabbi, I think it really blew their minds a little,” she says. “My mother, obviously, as a Korean Buddhist, I think it was outside her world. And for my father, who was not a particularly religious Reform Jew, they found it both surprising. But they’ve come around and feel extremely proud. And I think that I do earn the name ‘pioneer’ for being the first Asian-American rabbi or cantor.”</p> \n<p>While younger survey participants define themselves as both Jewish and Asian, the interviews exposed a gap in the depth of their identities. Adolescents had a deeper Jewish background and took greater care to observe Jewish rituals than those coming from the Asian side of the family. “Even for the kids who grew up in the Bay Area, it was much more typical to say, ‘we are doing Shabbat at home’ than to do something on the Asian holidays. But they had Jewish and Asian friends, on a personal level,” Kim says.</p> \n<p>Sense of pride</p> \n<p>Kim and Leavitt also discovered that young Asian Jews are less familiar with Asian culture – which may be surprising given that they grew up in the San Francisco area with its large community of immigrants from the Far East. The parents of those interviewed explained the difficulty of imparting an Asian heritage by saying that they themselves were second- or third-generation Americans.</p> \n<p>“The grandparents may speak Chinese, but as second-generation Asian Americans they might not be as confident or know what to do in terms of transmitting that identity to a kid. They might eat kimchi and dim sum, and it’s easy to go to an Asian restaurant, but they may not know what to do in terms of language transmission or other types of cultural transmission. It is consistent with other research with other biracial couples. Even for Asian Americans marring other Asian Americans, there is a whole range of what is done for cultural transmission,” they say.</p> \n<p>Kim has her own hypothesis for the difficulty of imparting an Asian heritage in the U.S. “It’s something that I struggled with personally. I grew up as a somewhat typical second-generation Korean American – my parents didn’t teach me Korean, I didn’t grew up in an ethnic enclave and I didn’t really know what to do, even though I wanted to. For me it’s much easier to transmit the Jewish part. One day I told my mother about it, and she said that Jews have a text that no matter where they are they can always go to, but there is no text about how to transmit a Korean identity.”</p> \n<p>A further element studied in the survey was whether expressions of anti-Semitism around the world made young people who don’t look Jewish hide their Jewishness in order to adapt to various social situations. Interviews held by Kim and Leavitt showed that this was not the case.</p> \n<p>“What was interesting is that they really felt that they have an insider’s perspective on the inner dynamic of social situations, and when someone would say something racist, or anti-Semitic, they felt compelled to speak up against these instances, even if they were passing,” says Kim.</p> \n<p>One of the major recommendations that children of these mixed marriages have for couples who wonder how to raise their offspring is not to give priority to any one identity. “Their advice was always expose their kids to all aspects of who they are. Don’t preference one identity, make sure that you expose them to everything: being Jewish, being Korean, being Asian. Make sure to do the hard work even in times when they might want to shy away from these identities. In the long run there will be a payoff, because it not only gives them a sense of where they came from, but a sense of pride,” summarizes Kim.</p>",

        "text":["<p>There is a wonderful Hebrew expression that doesn’t translate directly to English: “leshanot diskette.” The literal translation is to “switch the hard drive” on a computer, but the actual meaning is to completely reboot one’s thinking.</p> \n<p>We, the progressive movement in Israel and its supporters, need to change our hard-drive about what has happened these last weeks. It is not business as usual, and we must reboot in two key ways.</p> \n<p>First: while we recognize that the violent video&nbsp;produced by senior adviser to the Habayit Hayehudi&nbsp;party, Moshe Klughaft,&nbsp;and released by proto-fascist organization Im Tirtzu against Israeli human rights defenders, is an escalation of an ongoing campaign, we must see clearly that it represents a real threat. Like an avalanche that begins with a snowball and ends in a lethal mass that threatens lives, so is the incitement campaign targeting individual human rights defenders.</p> \n<p>Second: we have to get past the unpleasantness of our friends and allies being targeted and see that this vicious campaign is fueled by the fear and failure of the right – not by strength. And that like other attempts, it will not succeed. Without changing our own hard drives – our longstanding assumptions about winners and losers – the progressive movement could miss the real threat but also lose the opportunity it presents.</p> \n<p>The de-legitimization campaign carried out by all parts of Israel’s right-wing ecosystem is nothing new. But the video is. Over the past 10 years we at NIF, our donors in the U.S. and the organizations we support in Israel have been the target of legislative attacks aimed at shutting down NGOs with dissenting points of view from the government’s party line. We’ve worn the horns attributed to us in smear campaigns. We’ve watched the media report misinformation about us. But this week’s video is an escalation that raises the stakes by personalizing the message and essentially drawing a bullseye on the backs of four activists.</p> \n<p>After being personally targeted in Im Tirtzu’s video, the director of Israel’s most prominent human rights organization, B’Tselem, wrote in Haaretz:&nbsp;“I’m not afraid of Im Tirtzu. I’m afraid of the occupation, of indifference to injustice, sanctimoniousness and passing shock.”</p> \n<p>Personally, I am scared of both. This video should not be just another link in a chain of attacks, it should remind us of the pre-Rabin era and frighten us with its echoes.</p> \n<p>It is a warning sign for what desperation, failure and fear look like when they combine with right-wing ultra-nationalism and extremism. As Knesset Member Michal Rozin said on Israeli television to Im Tirtzu’s director, the next political murder in Israel will be in their name unless they stop this campaign.</p> \n<p>But these attacks are and always have been desperate attempts to silence human rights defenders, organizations whose work relates directly to the fact that Israel’s present and its future is defined by the almost-50 year occupation. They will not go away until that reality ends. No spin campaign in the world can hide this from the Israeli public or from the world’s view – when soldier after soldier is drafted into the IDF to continue to implement these harsh policies of occupation. This week saw a spontaneous peak in regular Israeli citizens breaking their silence online. People simply posting photographs of themselves in their IDF uniform along with their stories of serving in the occupied territories.</p> \n<p>Despite the brutal attempts to stop them, apparently groups like Breaking the Silence are still needed. And growing.</p> \n<p>In fact, this week we also saw just how much the years-long attack campaign has failed to harm the NIF. Last Sunday was the HaaretzQ&nbsp;with New Israel Fund conference in New York. President Reuven Rivlin&nbsp;spoke on our stage about freedom of speech as a cornerstone of Israeli democracy. President Barack Obama’s welcome video&nbsp;ended with a statement that we will always have an ally and friend in him and in the United States.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Less than 24 hours after President Rivlin&nbsp;stood on a stage with the NIF logo behind him, moments after Board President Talia Sasson and CEO Daniel Sokatch stepped down from that stage, Im Tirtzu launched their video. The video was timed to disrupt the outcome of the conference.</p> \n<p>But they overshot. Rather than fan the flames of their campaign, their attempt at strategic escalation caused an unexpected backlash.</p> \n<p>Israel’s mainstream media have savaged the video. Even Im Tirtzu’s former allies in the media turned on them. The hawkish Ben Caspit, who originally broke the first Im Tirtzu report against the New Israel Fund as an exclusive in 2010, wrote that “now and forever, Im Tirtzu has become a wild mutant, extremist, inciting and instigating. Really vile. Including the ultimate demand to tag all those who receive funding from foreign governments (in Europe, not in Afghanistan), but to hide the identity of their own anonymous donors, whose level of craziness competes with ISIS.”</p> \n<p>Our progressive movement requires that we understand where our adversaries are coming from, that we stop playing defense, and that we reboot our own mental maps so that we can channel our actions. We need to focus on protecting the individuals and organizations targeted by the radical right. We do not want to wake up too late to that real threat.</p> \n<p>But we also need to unite our American progressives with their Israeli counterparts as we did in New York. We need to continue to create broad platforms for the important work of ending the occupation and promoting a democratic Israel – particularly in continuing to link this movement with progressives worldwide. And we must continue to find ways to challenge Im Tirtzu and the ecosystem it is a part of to ensure our personal, political and national safety.</p> \n<p>Libby Lenkinski is Vice President of Strategy for the New Israel Fund.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In December 2015, a mobile messaging app that lets you send texts, photos and other media to anyone on your contacts list — anonymously — was launched. As you might guess, Blindspot main target audience was young users.</p> \n<p>An aggressive advertising campaign included a giant billboard over Tel Aviv’s main traffic artery, the Ayalon Freeway, but the primary marketing channel was actually Dor Refaeli, the company’s business development manager (and the brother of model Bar Refaeli).</p> \n<p>Blindspot took full advantage of her brother being on their payroll, presenting him in ads as one of the app’s creators and a partner in the company (though in later publications the company, Shellanoo Group, admitted that Dor is just an employee). The company tried to position itself as cool and antiestablishment, writing in a media statement, “There’s so much fake comment on social media — it can be like an airbrushed version of life. We want people to have fun, and most of all we want people to be real with one another.”</p> \n<p>The media loved the story: Anonymous messaging combined with the opportunity to mention Bar Refaeli resulted in wide coverage and massive downloads of Blindspot.</p> \n<p>But the pushback was just as swift.</p> \n<p>Guy Lehrer, anchor of the Channel 10 current-events show “Hazinor,” began a campaign against the app which he called “Dor, close it down” (it rhymes in Hebrew). The app is dangerous and can only boost teenage violence and shaming, Lehrer said. The Knesset even discussed Blindspot, and at some point, a class action motion was filed. Shellanoo has not filed its response.</p> \n<p>Dor Refaeli took most of the heat, even though he was not the developer of the controversial app. That would be a different boldface name: Oded David “O.D.” Kobo, 41, son of the real-estate magnate Eliezer “Bebo” Kobo, who is married to model Miri Bohadana.</p> \n<p>Oded Kobo’s involvement was only revealed later, when he began to try to protect the app from the fierce criticism. In February, in an interview with Yedioth Ahronoth, he argued that in the 1960s, parents and Knesset members united to stop the Beatles from performing in Israel, claiming its music corrupted the youth.</p> \n<p>“In my opinion, Blindspot is fun and safe for children just as the Beatles were,” Kobo said.</p> \n<p>A source in the know argues that the noise generated around the application was over the top. “It does not purport to be a serious project,” he says. “It all started as a joke among the employees, ‘Let’s make a cool app, so we don’t know who is sending those messages.’ Then it turned into something bigger.”</p> \n<p>‘He has principles’</p> \n<p>Why didn’t Kobo retreat when he saw the criticism?</p> \n<p>“Because he felt he was right,” says the source, who asked not to be identified. “He has principles. He really believes what he said about the Beatles. The ‘anti’ campaign simply defied logic.”</p> \n<p>Half a year after the ruckus, Israelis seem to have forgotten that the app exists. Blindspot for Android devices (data are unavailable for iOS) has between 500,000 and a million downloads worldwide, which isn’t much.</p> \n<p>“Downloads fell sharply after the launch in December,” says Roi Shlomi, an adviser to startups. “In January the app was top of the most popular downloads list in Israel, but in February it went into free-fall and now it’s below 400. In May, worldwide downloads were just 40,000, which is a negligible number. My impression is that it was a sort of gimmick that simply didn’t take.”</p> \n<p>Last week Oded Kobo made headlines again, when Channel 2 News revealed that he’s thinking of buying Golan Telecom, a mobile carrier that touts its low prices.</p> \n<p>His potential partner in the deal, Channel 2 revealed, is the oligarch Roman Abramovich, who has invested in other Kobo internet ventures in recent years.</p> \n<p>To preserve competition among mobile operators, the Communications Ministry is trying to keep Golan Telecom from merging with Cellcom Israel, one of Israel’s three biggest mobile carriers. To this end, the ministry drew the attention of Golan Telecom founder Michael Golan to Kobo and Abramovich’s interest in his company and Communication Ministry Director General Shlomo Filber met with Kobo.</p> \n<p>Figures in the telecommunications sector were taken aback by Kobo’s latest idea. Abramovich is a billionaire who could buy Golan Telecom by himself if he wanted, and if he’d wanted to, he could have bought into the Israeli telecoms market years ago. Kobo, the man presented as being at the forefront of this move, has no experience in owning or managing a big company with hundreds of thousands of customers and thousands of employees and that faces regulatory challenges and the need to deploy cellular transponders throughout Israel. His investment record consists of “all sorts of applications and internet ventures, some of which were nice ideas, but nothing grew into a big business of significant scope that was stable over time,” and he made no investments in substantial operating companies.</p> \n<p>It’s difficult to gauge Kobo as a businessman. He has lived in the world’s culture and finance centers, including Hong Kong, London, New York and Los Angeles, and rubbed shoulders with the global jetset. He’s been mentioned in news stories with Alibaba founder Jack Ma, the leader of Qatar and British real estate tycoons.</p> \n<p>Reading the newspaper clippings, one sees that the number of references to Kobo in the gossip columns is almost references in the business sections, partly because of his well-publicized affairs with celebs such as Bar Refaeli, Esti Ginzburg, Or Grossman and Katya Gaydamak, daughter of tycoon Arcadi Gaydamak. Six years ago he and Katya lived together and there was talk of marriage.</p> \n<p>Kobo and his wife, Etty Ovadia, who is pregnant, live in a spacious apartment in the upmarket Herzliya Marina.</p> \n<p>People who have worked with Kobo say he’s a born entrepreneur and has good ideas. But not only has he never built a big business, he also missed some superb investments, which could attest to his business acumen.</p> \n<p>As he told Yedioth, he turned down proposals to invest in Waze and Snapchat, which are now worth billions of dollars. In another case, in the mid-’90s, he owned the domain Lottery.com, but sold the company owning the domain quite quickly for $300,000. He could have held on and gotten more.</p> \n<p>Where Kobo excels, his colleagues say, is in recruiting investors. “He’s a colorful character, no question,” says a man who’s done business with him. In a room of entrepreneurs, he dominates. “He may be dressed differently or speak differently, but that does not mean he does not know how to conduct himself in the business world.”</p> \n<p>Zeev Holtzman, chairman of the Giza venture capital fund, met Kobo when he invested in a Chinese internet venture that flopped. “He’s an entrepreneur in body and soul, a man with the highest abilities,” Holtzman attests. “In our case, unfortunately, it didn’t work out, but that’s part of the DNA of venture capital. We described him as somebody riding a motorcycle at 350 kilometers an hour — he would either reach his destination or crash. Unfortunately, he didn’t reach the destination, but he had great potential.”</p> \n<p>Self-made man</p> \n<p>Cracking the riddle that is Oded Kobo requires knowing about his father complex.</p> \n<p>Eliezer “Bebo” Kobo made his fortune in the 1970s in Hong Kong, manufacturing and marketing clothes in the Far East together with the owner of the Israeli fashion brand Jump, Richard Caring. In the ‘80s and ‘90s he expanded into Florida and for a while partnered with the Nakash brothers in Jordache Jeans.</p> \n<p>His big move came in the ‘90s, when he and Caring teamed with Elliott Bernerd, head of the British property company Chelsfield, to acquire London’s Camden Market commercial center. Then a run-down mess, the partners turned it around. in 2014, the partners sold Camden to another Israeli, the gambling magnate Teddy Sagi, for 2.4 million shekels ($625,000).</p> \n<p>Bebo Kobo is also famous for having married Bohadana. A man who has worked with Oded Kobo and who asked not to be identified says that Kobo is highly uncomfortable with people immediately associating him with his father and Bohadana. Still, being Bebo’s son is a terrific starting point, the source points out.</p> \n<p>Father and son are very different, says another source who’s known Oded for some years. “Bebo is an old-school businessman, more interested in property and media-shy. Oded is more a man of the world. He went to school abroad and his mother tongue is English. He’s more interested in high-tech. He’s also more open to the media, likes the spotlight and has a thing about name-dropping — making sure big, famous names are mentioned with his.”</p> \n<p>Being Bebo’s son means having contacts, mainly among London’s wealthy, though how the contact with Abramovich arose isn’t clear. In any case, Oded Kobo stresses in interviews that he started out on his own: He wanted to succeed with his own two hands, Holtzman says.</p> \n<p>According to some media reports, Shellanoo Group is worth between $250 million and $300 million, although others believe these estimates are based on overly optimistic forecasts. In any case these will remain guesstimates until the company is either sold or listed for trading.</p> \n<p>According to the Registrar of Companies, Kobo is registered as Shellanoo’s only director and owns 59% of its ordinary shares, which are held in trust by a law firm. Kobo’s personal worth is unknown.</p> \n<p>Nicki Minaj, David Guetta on board</p> \n<p>Born in Israel, Kobo moved with his father to Hong Kong at the age of 2, remaining there until age 16, when he moved to London by himself. He studied business administration for a year but dropped out at age 19 and embarked on his entrepreneurial career. One of his first businesses was a one-time deal exporting cigarettes to Bulgaria; he made tens of thousands of pounds.</p> \n<p>Come the dot.com craze, he moved to New York and invested in domains and other internet things, but never stayed focused and neither developed the ventures into big companies nor sold them for great profit, as he admitted himself in the 2010 interview. He envied people like Teddy Sagi who set up empires, he confessed.</p> \n<p>He set up Koolanoo in 2006, closed it four years later and in 2014 founded tech firm Shellanoo, which has 60 employees in Herzliya Pituah.</p> \n<p>His misses include Lottery.com and Snapchat, which is now worth about $18 billion. “There’s no formula for these things,” shrugs Shlomi, the startup adviser. A venture has to make noise to bring a wave of joiners, then more money is needed to maintain it. “It’s a chicken-and-egg thing. For an app to be popular, you need a lot of people to join and communicate with one another. The more users there are, the more advertisers come ... but few actually make it. Right now it doesn’t look like as if the applications by Kobo and his people are creating that kind of success.”</p> \n<p>Shellanoo’s other apps include Music Messenger. Launched a year ago, it allows users to create and send song playlists. Investment in the company has reached $30 million, it says; Android data put downloads at about 5 million worldwide. Abramovich invested $15 million, the company says, the most he’s put into an Israeli startup. Other investors include American musicians Nicki Minaj and David Guetta and the Dutch DJ Tijs Michiel Verwest, better known as Tiesto.</p> \n<p>Oded spent most of the last decade doing business in China, through Koolanoo, which began with high hopes but fizzled after four years.</p> \n<p>In 2008, investors in Koolanoo included Bernerd, who brought in the ruler of Qatar at the time, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. Koolanoo had holdings in 18 internet sites, including 360 Chuan, a social media site for young people in China. It also had shares in a browser designed to be used in public places.</p> \n<p>But failure, around the time the global economic crisis began, came fast. Koolanoo discovered that competition with the 12 other Chinese social media sites was too tough; a model for Jews, irrespective of China, also flopped.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It was a particularly boiling-hot day recently in Hebron. The small group – five visiting Americans and Britons who had come to observe life in the city firsthand – was led by Yehuda Shaul, from the anti-occupation Breaking the Silence organization. Their appearance was apparently enough of a provocation to attract a group of settlers from the city, too. Anger and tension hung palpably in the air. The settlers were accompanied by soldiers to protect them from potential local assailants. At one point, the soldiers made the visitors’ Palestinian guide, Issa Amro, detach himself from the group and stand off to the side, alone. The restiveness and irritability reached a breaking point.</p> \n<p>Two of the visitors, writers from America – Michael Chabon and his Israeli-born wife, Ayelet Waldman – decided to cool things down. Waldman went over to the soldiers to apologize, in Hebrew, in her and her husband’s name. “It was clear to me that our visit was a pain in their butt,” she says in her very blunt, very Israeli style. She had managed to say, “My husband and I are sorry about the mess,” when one of the soldiers approached her and whispered, “Tell him that I like his books.”</p> \n<p>Surrealistic moments were not lacking in the couple’s visit to Israel a few weeks ago. Indeed, in all their visits here, they say, they have oscillated between unmitigated depression and soaring spirits, producing a somewhat bewildering effect from their perspective. But this latest visit, amid the project they have initiated in conjunction with Breaking the Silence, was a singular event. As part of the initiative, seven delegations of world-famous writers are being brought to Israel and the territories over the course of a year. Among the authors are the Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, from Peru; the Pulitzer Prize-winner Geraldine Brooks; Irish writer Colm Toibin; and the American writer and publisher Dave Eggers – in addition to Chabon himself, one of the leading American writers of his generation, and Waldman, who is also an acclaimed author and an American media personage. Local representatives are also taking part, among them the Israeli writer Nir Baram and the Palestinian author and lawyer Raja Shehadeh.</p> \n<p>Each participating writer is taken on a tour of a few days in the territories – to East Jerusalem, Susya in the south Hebron hills, and the cities of Hebron and Ramallah – and afterward chooses a subject or a person to focus on. The resulting essays will be edited by Chabon and Waldman and will be published exactly one year from now – to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Six-Day War and the occupation it spawned. The collection is already slated for publication in Israel, the United States, Germany, Sweden, France, Brazil and elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Even before one page of a single essay has been written, the reactions to it are a foregone conclusion, certainly in Israel. Dozens of comments appeared on the Haaretz website when the project was launched, most of them accusing the participating writers of biased prejudgment at best, or of anti-Semitism, or of being self-hating Jews of the sort who may one day contribute to sealing the country’s fate. The responses may be related in part to the involvement of Breaking the Silence – an organization that collects and publishes first-hand testimonies from Israel Defense Forces soldiers who have served in the territories – is frequently subjected to similar accusations in Israel. Maybe it’s just the declared intention to write about the occupation and those who live under it. In any event, Waldman and Chabon’s point of departure, certainly as they see it, is the exact opposite. From their point of view, their project constitutes an act of Zionism and is entirely committed to ensuring the future existence of Israel. And their external take on the state’s actions, on those who live here and do not act against the occupation, and on the country’s future if the occupation continues, is harrowing.</p> \n<p>Private road</p> \n<p>Waldman, 51, had been mulling the idea for the project in the two years since her last visit to Israel. Invited to take part in the biannual Jerusalem International Writers Festival, she had to think carefully about whether she wanted to go. She says she had never boycotted Israel but had avoided visiting, because of the occupation.</p> \n<p>Though born in Israel, she moved to North America with her family in 1967, and grew up in Montreal and New Jersey. Before becoming a full-time writer, she’d been a criminal defense lawyer dealing mainly with issues of social justice, human rights and prison reform. “I couldn’t justify coming to enjoy myself in Israel when my life in the United States has so much to do with social justice,” she says. “On the other hand, I was so flattered to be invited [to the 2014 writers conference].”</p> \n<p>To ease her conscience, she contacted Breaking the Silence and joined one of the NGO’s tours to Hebron. The delightful experience at the writers festival in Jerusalem – “I enjoyed every minute” – was suddenly overlaid with dark, intolerable hues.</p> \n<p>“I thought I’d see a few miserable people, a few settlers, some pressure between them and the Palestinians,” she recalls now (speaking Hebrew). “But when I got to Hebron, I went into shock. Literally. Totally. I couldn’t believe it. To see a road on which I was allowed to travel because I am a Jew and hold an Israeli passport, and opposite me a person who lives there and whose family has lived there for generations but who is forbidden to set foot on that road – that was a shock to me. I returned brokenhearted and furious. That evening I said that I would never come back here again, that I couldn’t understand how people can stand to live here.”</p> \n<p>Still, after the festival, Waldman went to Tel Aviv, as originally planned, and there her gut feeling became a genuine dilemma. At an hour’s distance, reality looked completely different. In other words, Waldman had herself a good time in Tel Aviv and felt completely at home.</p> \n<p>“I wanted to come back for another visit immediately,” she gushes. “I wanted to be part of this Israel, I felt I belonged. And then I told myself that if I feel I belong, that I’m connected, that it’s my place, too – then the problem is mine, too. I can’t just go home and not think about it anymore. If I feel part of this, I also have to assume responsibility for changing the situation there.”</p> \n<p>Burdened by thoughts (“What am I and who am I? I’m nothing. A 50-year-old woman from America. The ‘auntie’ from America. What can I do?”), she returned to her home in Berkeley, California. The idea began to jell. She and Chabon, a very well-known couple on the American literary scene, began to think about all the writers they know and about the cumulative reading public they could reach.</p> \n<p>“Many of the writers we recruited are our friends, and they are all coming without an agenda,” Waldman says. “They have no opinion, they are not people who have been writing for years about the conflict. We wanted people who would be able to tell a story and are used to making use of their eyes, ears and heart to do that.”</p> \n<p>Chabon: “Writers look around until something catches their interest, and they say, ‘Wait, I need to know more about that. How does that work?’ They would have the choice to focus on any aspect. Everyone gets the same four-day background tour, then you would say, ‘You know this is fascinating to me, I want to know more about this.’ Dave Eggers knew before he even got here that he wanted to go to Gaza, so they made that happen for him and he went to Gaza. Rachel Kushner already knew before she got here that she was interested in Shoafat, a refugee camp.”</p> \n<p>What made them want to take part?</p> \n<p>Chabon: “They wanted to know more. Many of them said, ‘I have been ignoring this and now this writer I know and respect is reaching out to me. This is the moment when I should say yes.’</p> \n<p>Waldman: “I said to them, ‘I will not tell you what to write. I will not tell you what to think. You write what you want. I’m not going to edit you – maybe only for length.’ You know, newspapers and articles come and go, but if you love the work of Colm Toibin, say, maybe if Colm Toibin tells you a story, you’ll stop and you’ll listen and read it. People see ‘Israel-Palestine’ in the newspaper and they turn the page. I wanted to give people a chance to see, and also my experience was so profound because I don’t turn the page, I read all the articles – and even so, I didn’t know what was happening in these places.”</p> \n<p>The problem is that Israelis themselves have no idea and don’t want to know what’s happening in their backyard.</p> \n<p>Waldman: “When I tell Israelis, my family, my friends, ‘This is what’s happening in Hebron, this is what’s happening in Susya, this is what’s happening in Shoafat,' they don’t believe me. Because it is impossible to imagine that your country, your democratic country, is doing things like this. Plus there is so much anger. Everyone knows someone who was on a bus, behind a bus, and the bus was exploded. The whole ideology of fear as a result of terrorism makes people not want to see the other side. The Palestinians have been their own worst enemies in many ways, because even if you’re predisposed to care about human rights, it takes a hero of epic proportions to lose a child and then reach a hand across.”</p> \n<p>The rest went more or less smoothly, notwithstanding the fact that it was, in Waldman’s words, a “logistical nightmare.” Recruiting the writers was the easy part, and it was even easier to sell the idea to American and Israeli publishers. Other publishing houses from around the world contacted the two organizers independently when the project was officially announced. But the next part is likely to be more difficult. What will happen to the book once it’s published? It’s clear from what Waldman and Chabon say that they have no illusions.</p> \n<p>Filling in the gaps</p> \n<p>The term “power couple” might well have been invented to describe Waldman and Chabon. Michael Chabon, 53, acquired instant literary fame when his M.A. supervisor in creative writing at the University of California, Irvine, sent his thesis – which was a novel, “The Mysteries of Pittsburgh” – to a literary agent without Chabon’s knowledge, resulting in an advance of $155,000, an unheard-of amount at the time for an unknown writer. The book, published in 1988, became Chabon’s first best seller. It was followed by literary benchmarks such as “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay,” for which Chabon was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2001, and a series of other successful works. They include “The Yiddish Policemen’s Union” (a detective novel set against the background of an alternative reality in which Israel did not survive the War of Independence and Jews were given a haven in Alaska); “The Final Solution” (a mystery novel in which an aged Sherlock Holmes solves a case during World War II); and “Gentlemen of the Road” (about two Jewish vagabonds in the Kingdom of the Khazars around the year 950). His next novel, “Moonglow,” which is scheduled for publication later this year, is also very much Jewish-oriented, Waldman says.</p> \n<p>Waldman is Chabon’s second wife; the couple have four children together. Over the years she has returned to Israel repeatedly, made a failed attempt at immigration, including living on a kibbutz and working in the cowshed. After leaving Israel for good, she studied law at Harvard (Barack Obama was a member of her graduating class). Among other things, she then spent five years working as a public defender in a federal court. Subsequently, she decided to leave the legal profession in favor of writing. She has published seven mystery novels revolving around Judith Appelbaum, a sleuth and mother, and several other novels, the most recent of which, “Love &amp; Treasure” (2014), is about the real-life Hungarian Gold Train, which was found by Allied troops after World War II, laden with property of Hungary’s Jews confiscated by the Nazis. She is currently working on a new novel and is also the author of numerous articles and essays.</p> \n<p>In fact, the publishing event most associated with Waldman is related to her 2009 nonfiction work, “Bad Mother: A Chronicle of Maternal Crimes, Minor Calamities, and Occasional Moments of Grace.” It grew out of a New York Times article in which she wrote that relations with one’s partner are more important than parent-child relationships. To which she added, drawing a tidal wave of outrage from self-righteous, appalled Americans, that she loves her husband more than her children.</p> \n<p>Without getting into the hierarchy of affection that prevails in the Chabon-Waldman household, the natural rapport between the two makes it instantly apparent that their relationship is rock-solid. In the past, they related that they write in the same space and read each other’s works but are not inclined to collaborate. Now, they say smilingly, they write in separate rooms and are collaborating. “We collaborate on our individual projects in the sense that we both read the other one’s work, get help, get editing,” Chabon explains.</p> \n<p>Two sides – or not</p> \n<p>We meet in the conference room of Breaking the Silence. The NGO’s office, situated in a rundown building in south Tel Aviv, is guarded at all times. There is no sign to indicate the office’s location. When I asked two young men in another office in the building for directions, the reply from one of them was, “Breaking the Silence? I hope they’re in hell.”</p> \n<p>Waldman and Chabon arrive, very tired, and take seats around the large table, on which every snack known to mankind seems to have been laid out for the guests. Waldman, whose unkempt mane of curls reflects her character and her gushing candor, is manifestly the chief speaker and in charge of the domestic humor. Chabon, more collected and less animated, tends to complete sentences and punch lines for her, such as have obviously become part of their standard repartee. The conversation itself fluctuates between rapid Hebrew and headlong English, punctuated with sweeping hand gestures, whether they’re talking about disheartening experiences at Susya or a pleasurable dinner with friends in Tel Aviv. That disparity between the two coexisting worlds demands clarification.</p> \n<p>Was it important for you to have the writers see the Israeli angle, too?</p> \n<p>Chabon: “They have seen the Israeli angle – that is the Israeli angle. We saw settlers,” he says sarcastically, “they were real nice. The checkpoints, where they arbitrarily stop people and get you out of your car for no particular reason – to me, that is the Israeli angle. You could talk to the settlers and they would say ‘God gave us this land,’ but that is not the other side of the story. The other side of the story is what’s happening at the checkpoints.”</p> \n<p>Waldman: “A war has two sides, but the occupation doesn’t have two sides. There is occupier and there are the occupied, and this book will be about the people who are occupied. We saw plenty of settlers, and we spoke to them, even when we didn’t want to. The ones in Hebron especially were very, very aggressive. They surrounded us and they attacked [Yehuda Shaul, from Breaking the Silence]. We didn’t talk to the settlers in Susya. Why? Because that’s a false dichotomy. There’s a village whose homes were stolen and there are the thieves. I’m not interested in the thieves.</p> \n<p>“Bibi Netanyahu has the biggest stage in the world. He spoke before a joint session of Congress in the United States – that is unheard of. You know who gets to do that? The president. Suddenly Bibi Netanyahu, the prime minister of this tiny country across the globe, gets to speak to a joint session of Congress. If the day comes when Bibi feels that his voice isn’t heard, like he doesn’t have enough of a spokesperson, he can come to me and I will write a book for him, an entire book. I promise to make his silenced words heard. But Nasser, the father of unfortunate children in Susya whose house has been demolished time and again – Nasser has no stage, he has no way to get people to listen to his story. So we will be his stage in the form of this book. We will tell his story.”</p> \n<p>You’re here in the headquarters of Breaking the Silence, an organization that draws the anger of many Israelis, many of whom feel that any criticism should not be aired internationally. Turning to the international community is widely perceived as treasonous here.</p> \n<p>Waldman: “You know, we always love to do that, as Jews.”</p> \n<p>Chabon: “To make a shanda [Yiddish for ‘disgrace’] in the face of the goyim.”</p> \n<p>Waldman: “You know what, at this point”</p> \n<p>Chabon: “ the shanda is the occupation.”</p> \n<p>Waldman: “My ideal reader is an Israeli in Tel Aviv who reads the book and says, ‘Okay, I will go to Hebron and see what this American is talking about.’ But I also think there is a place for international pressure – the Israeli government uses international pressure all the time. The Israeli government involves itself in the American elections, and a foreign government to try to influence the outcome of an American election is deeply problematic, and also bad for the Jews. You know, since we got here, we’ve been hearing that Breaking the Silence is a curse. What people don’t understand is that Breaking the Silence and B’Tselem [a local human rights group] are Israel’s best ambassadors in the international arena. Our weapon as Americans against anti-Semitism is these organizations. Why? Because they are proof of Israeli democracy.</p> \n<p>“Netanyahu is hated everywhere in the world. It’s so easy to be anti-Semitic when he is the representative of Jewishness, Israeliness. But when I speak with someone who just can’t understand what is happening in this country, who sees images of dead children in Gaza and of destroyed houses, and accuses Israel of being a fascist state, I can tell him about Breaking the Silence and B’Tselem. In the most cynical way in the world, I don’t understand why the Israeli government doesn’t use those organizations – because this is the proof of your democracy.”</p> \n<p>‘Shanda’ sickness</p> \n<p>Some will probably say that Waldman and Chabon really do suffer from the Jewish shanda sickness, only from the opposite direction, from being ashamed themselves at what the “goyim” will say about Jews in their country. What’s certain is that this is not the first time the two have spoken out in this spirit. In a past interview, Waldman explained that for Israel to go on being supported by American Jewry, it must be identified with civil and democratic values. The tone that already sounded determined has now become very blunt.</p> \n<p>“Bibi is a charlatan, he’s a con man,” she says. “He has convinced this country that the Jews of America are on his side. I will tell you who is on his side in America: the crazy evangelical Christians, the worst of the worst. Seventy-five percent of American Jews voted for Barack Obama. The American Jewish community is the single most liberal religious community in the United States. What just happened with AIPAC when Trump spoke and they stood on their feet – that I believe signals the death knell of AIPAC in the Jewish community. It might take five years, but they are finished. That’s why you saw them apologizing so fast, because the moment the Jews of America saw AIPAC standing on its feet and applauding Trump, that was the end. There’s this crazy dichotomy, where Israel takes $3.5 billion from the American government every year, and more money in donations, but it resists and resents the American influence. There’s a reason that every Jewish kid, no matter how rich his daddy is, gets a free trip to Israel ‘on the back’ of the Bronfman family. They’re worried that they are losing them, and the reason that is happening is the occupation.”</p> \n<p>The occupation embarrasses the Jews of America?</p> \n<p>Chabon: “It’s more than embarrassing: You’re ashamed.”</p> \n<p>So, what you are doing now is out of a commitment to the Jewish people?</p> \n<p>Chabon: “Yes, and to Israel.”</p> \n<p>Waldman: “We are doing it out of love of Israel. This is our Zionism. We believe that Israel will not be able to continue to exist with the occupation. The occupation will be the death knell of the State of Israel; if it doesn’t end, I believe there will be no Israel. So why do care? I live in America, in a nice house – in fact, we have two houses, one in Berkeley and one in Maine – and our children don’t want to hear about Israel. One cares, because she’s a social activist and she wants to go and work in the territories against the occupation. The other ones are like – don’t talk to me about it. There’s no other reason for our initiative. The moment when I realized that I had to do something was not the tour in Hebron with Breaking the Silence. That broke my heart, but what did it for me was the dinner and the good time in Tel Aviv afterward.”</p> \n<p>This is what possibly infuriates Israelis about Breaking the Silence. Most of us live in a reality where it’s easy to repress that &quot;minor&quot; issue. We work, we can go out with friends in the evening and just forget what’s happening half an hour’s drive away.</p> \n<p>Waldman: “That is our shame. Mississippi had the best barbecue in the world. In the 1950s, you could go down there with your friends and eat and drink and dance. The fact that all those black people have to live in shanties, they can’t drink from the water fountain, they can’t get jobs, they get thrown off their land – hey, let’s just not look at that.”</p> \n<p>The comparison with pre-civil rights Mississippi leads Waldman to talk about the role of Jews as leaders of social initiatives that promote equal rights. Both of their parents raised them on the Jewish concept of tikkun olam: “repairing” and reforming the world. In the decidedly Jewish home in which Chabon grew up, where Yiddish was spoken, the message was “Jews are smarter” and “Jews are more ethical.” In the Chabon-Waldman home, attending synagogue, celebrating bar and bat mitzvahs properly, and observing Passover and Yom Kippur are real, living ideas – certainly from Chabon’s viewpoint, even when they lead to controversial engagement with developments in the Jewish state.</p> \n<p>Waldman: “It’s really easy to fight for the rights of people when you’re not the one doing the oppressing. It’s very comfortable for me in the States to work on prisoners’ rights, to be an advocate, to be a criminal defense attorney, to write books about the terrible human rights violations in prisons. Because my hands are clean. I mean we can get complicated about how every white person in America to a certain extent has dirty hands, but that’s a very comfortable position. Here in Israel your hands are dirty, and if you are not actively fighting against the occupation, you are supporting the occupation. Period.”</p> \n<p>Chabon: “Which means you are hurting Israel.”</p> \n<p>Waldman: “To ignore the occupation is to participate in the demise of the State of Israel. It will not survive.”</p> \n<p>Chabon: “When your friend has been drinking too much and you see him getting into his car, you’re supposed to stop him and take his keys away because you care about him.”</p> \n<p>Do you really see a possible situation in which Israel ceases to exist?</p> \n<p>Chabon: “Of course there’s a possibility – nothing lasts forever. Where’s apartheid now? Where’s the Soviet Union now? Where’s the British Empire now? Let’s hope it takes a long time for Israel, and that in the meantime the Palestinians have been granted the rights they’re entitled to, because if not, it’s not going to be all that long.”</p> \n<p>Waldman: “As this generation of American Jews comes of age, Israel will lose the support of the American Jews, and when they lose the support of American Jews they’ll lose the support of the American government, because at some point it will be too costly – and then what?”</p> \n<p>Cowsheds and cages</p> \n<p>Waldman pauses for a moment and a conversation develops about experiences they had on the tour. Chabon mentions a Palestinian-American businessman from Ramallah, Sam Bahour, who is unable to live a normal life and develop various projects both because of Israeli-imposed restrictions on movement and because he suffers from diabetes. Waldman asks me if I’ve ever been to a checkpoint. I answer no. She continues: Have I ever worked in a cowshed? Again, no. She describes the very narrow cages, “almost like cattle chutes, barbed wire above and metal below,” that Palestinians have to go through at checkpoints while waiting for hours, which prevents access for a large person like the diabetic Ramallah businessman who would have to stand on his feet for hours and have no recourse if his blood sugar drops or if he has to use the restroom. She understands the reason for the security check, she says, and why it’s necessary to use metal detectors. What she doesn’t understand is why the checkpoints are structured as they are, on top of which anyone who wants to enter Israel illegally will find a way. “It’s the law-abiding citizens who are the ones being tortured at these checkpoints. That was one of the worst things I saw.”</p> \n<p>I’m afraid that the people who will want to read the book are those who already know about all this.</p> \n<p>Chabon: “Nobody knows. Nobody knows. Nobody knows. I didn’t know, and if I didn’t know – and I pay attention, I read the newspapers, I care about Israel, I’ve cared about Israel my whole life, but I didn’t know – nobody knows. Israelis don’t know.”</p> \n<p>But Israelis always say: Why don’t you look at what the Turks are doing to the Kurds, at what’s going on in Syria?</p> \n<p>Chabon: “You know what I say to that? That’s who you want to be compared to? Why aren’t we comparing you to Sweden, why aren’t we comparing you to Denmark? You yourself are creating this category, which includes North Korea, Syria, Sudan, Turkey, Congo and Israel. Is that the standard you aspire to?”</p> \n<p>Waldman: “If I were a North Korean, I would be writing a book about North Korea, but I’m a Jew and I was born in Israel.”</p> \n<p>Chabon: “And as Americans we are paying for this, not for North Korea. We are paying for this with our taxes to the tune of $3.5 billion a year, and that gives us the right.”</p> \n<p>Still, many Israelis treat criticism by Jews who live elsewhere as unacceptable. First come and live here and share our burdens, they say.</p> \n<p>Chabon: “But this is not about Israel and Palestine. It’s not about Zionism and the right of return. It’s not about the two-state solution or the one-state solution. It’s about human rights that are guaranteed. You know what that means, and you know what you would not accept for yourself in terms of treatment. And you know that means the right to decent housing, freedom of movement, access to water, the right to earn a livelihood for your family, education. You just need to say to yourself: Are Palestinians getting all these things? And the answer is obvious: They’re not getting any of them.</p> \n<p>“It’s pretty obvious what needs to be done, and it doesn’t have anything to do with whether you have a right be here, if they have a right to be here, how are we both going to be here at the same time? All those questions that everyone is always talking about and fighting over – they’re irrelevant to this. This is about human rights, freedom, civil rights, civil liberties, all of those things. That’s what has to happen first, before anything else.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>On September 16, 1666, Shabbetai Zvi, the Jewish false Messiah who shook European Jewry to its foundations in the 17th century, informed the Turkish sultan of his readiness to convert to Islam. Born in Smyrna (today Izmir) in 1626, Shabbetai had traditional rabbincal training, but distinguished himself as a non-conformist because of his interest in kabbalah and his sometimes outrageous behavior (for example, conducting a wedding ceremony in which he was the groom, and the Torah the bride). By 1648, he had announced that he was the Messiah, something that led to his being placed under herem (excommunication) by the rabbis of Smyrna, an act they followed up by banishing him from the city. But this didn't prevent him from gaining a following, which only grew as he moved around the eastern Mediterranean, including a period in Jerusalem that began in 1663.</p> \n<p>It was in Palestine that he met Nathan Benjamin Levi, a.k.a. Nathan of Gaza, who became his chief disciple and spokesman, in which capacity Nathan informed the world in 1665 that the Messianic age was but one year away. At this point, Shabbetai's influence began to spread geometrically across Europe. The continent's Jews were still reeling from the catastrophic period of the Khmelnytsky pogroms, which took tens of thousands of Jewish lives, and the message of the coming redemption fell on fertile ground across France, Germany, the Netherlands and other lands.</p> \n<p>Nathan announced as well that Shabbetai was destined to become sultan of the Ottoman Empire, which led to Shabbetai’s arrest when he arrived in Constantinople in 1666. He was given the choice of converting or being executed. He chose to live, and in the presence of Sultan Mehmed IV, Shabbetai put a Turkish turban on his head. Although many of his adherents were devastated by this capitulation, others were convinced that Shabbetai’s apostasy was part of a divine plan to expedite the Messianic age, and remained loyal to him. He, in turn, began to preach different messages to different audiences.</p> \n<p>Given permission by the sultan to convert other Jews to Islam, Shabbetai assembled a group of followers who ostensibly became Muslim, but continued to follow his own very peculiar form of Judaism. The new Islamic believers were called the donmeh (“converts,” in Turkish), and their rituals became increasingly bizarre. For his part, Shabbetai was eventually banished by the sultan, apparently in 1673, to the town of Ulcinj (today in Montenegro), where he probably died, or was executed, in 1676. The donmeh have always been a persecuted group in Turkey, so they carried out their activities in great secrecy, but there continue to be crypto-Jews in the country to this day.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p> Benzion Netanyahu, the late historian of Jewish history, would have probably been dismayed to hear his son, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, claim during a meeting with Pope Francis this week that Jesus’ native language was Hebrew.</p> \n<p> “Jesus was here, in this land. He spoke Hebrew,” Netanyahu told Francis at a meeting in Jerusalem on Monday.</p> \n<p> The pope was quick to correct the prime minister and tell him that Jesus in fact spoke Aramaic, as mainstream biblical scholars generally agree.</p> \n<p> There is compelling evidence for this: evidence from the Christian Bible itself, and historical evidence about the linguistic milieu Jesus was raised and lived in.</p> \n<p> The evidence is in the Bible</p> \n<p> The New Testament of the Bible was written entirely in Greek but is speckled with Aramaic words and phrases, many of them quotes from Jesus himself that were transliterated rather than translated. In other words, they were written in Aramaic but spelled out in Greek.</p> \n<p> For example: “She [Mary Magdalene] turned herself, and saith unto him [Jesus], Rabboni; which is to say, Master” (John 20:16). Had Mary been speaking Hebrew, she would have said ravi, the Hebrew equivalent of the Aramaic rabboni, both of which could be translated “my teacher.”</p> \n<p> But the most compelling argument from the Christian Bible is a quotation by Jesus on the cross, preserved in two separate gospels and in both cases written in Aramaic not Hebrew. “Around the ninth hour, Jesus shouted in a loud voice, saying ‘Eli Eli lema sabachthani?’ which is, ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’” (Matthew 27:46). The quote in Mark is almost identical with the Aramaic phrase, written as “Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani?” (15:34).</p> \n<p> Mainstream biblical scholars agree it is very likely that this quote by Jesus is authentic, not only because it appears in the two earliest extant gospels, but also because it is very unlikely to have been made up by early Christians, who would have surely preferred an account that does not depict Jesus as despairing and questioning God.</p> \n<p> Assuming this was in fact a quote by Jesus, he was quoting from Psalms: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (22:1) in which the Hebrew reads “Eli eli lama azavteni?” Had Jesus been quoting Psalms in Hebrew, the gospels would have used the Hebrew word azavteni, not the Aramaic sabachthani.</p> \n<p> But could Jesus have been bilingual?</p> \n<p> Sure, you may say, Jesus spoke Aramaic, but it’s possible he spoke Hebrew too. Well, to answer this we ought to look at the linguistic milieu Jesus would have lived in. At the time of Jesus that is, the first century C.E. the spoken language in the Holy Land was Aramaic. Already we can see in that the upper strata of Judeans spoke Aramaic, the lingua franca of the Near East, already at the close of the First Temple period. This can be learned from the episode in 2 Kings in which Sennacherib’s messenger comes to Jerusalem’s gates in the seventh century B.C.E. “Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language [Aramaic]; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews’ language in the ears of the people that are on the wall” (18:26).</p> \n<p> During the Babylonian exile in the sixth century B.C.E., the exiled Judeans picked up Aramaic. Indeed, parts of the later books of the Bible, Ezra and Daniel, are in that language, indicating that the Judeans were slowly shifting languages. This was a gradual process that took hundreds of years, but slowly Hebrew was dying out. In the Galilee, where Jesus lived, Aramaic had taken over by the time Jesus was born. In the south, in Judea, archaeological evidence shows that some pockets of Hebrew still remained during the first century C.E.</p> \n<p> In addition to these Hebrew-speaking settlements in Judea, the priests in the Temple were for the most part still speaking Hebrew, and Hebrew remained a language of the law spoken and studied by the rabbis. But this was only the upper class of Judean society. Most people couldn’t read in any language. Modern scholarship estimates that the literacy rate in Roman Palestine was 3 percent and probably much lower in a rural backwater town like Nazareth. It is extremely unlikely that a carpenter’s son from Nazareth would be literate in any language, let alone Hebrew, a language he and the people he preached to probably didn’t know at all.</p> \n<p> This may be shocking, especially since the gospels have accounts of Jesus reading from the Bible, but one must remember that the writers of these gospels never met Jesus and were writing their accounts based on an oral tradition. From what we can surmise, the law and the Bible most likely had to be interpreted and read by the rabbis for nearly all Jews, Jesus included. Even among the literate minority, Hebrew was becoming less common, as can be evidenced by the appearance of Aramaic translations of the Bible.</p> \n<p> After Jesus was crucified, the Temple was destroyed in 70 C.E. Hebrew lost its bastion in Jerusalem and was slipping away. During the Bar Kochba revolt in the second century C.E. an attempt was made to revive the Hebrew language, but this did not bear fruit as the revolt was crushed by the Romans. Hebrew died off as a spoken language by the end of the century, but continued to remain an important religious language for the Jews, though later religious texts most notably the Talmud would be written in Aramaic.</p> \n<p> Still, Hebrew remained as a literary language much like Latin remained throughout the Middle Ages. But it would only become a living language in the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century when, as a part of the Zionist Movement and under the leadership of Eliezer Ben Yehuda, Jews in Palestine took up their ancient tongue.</p> \n<p> Where did Aramaic come from? The Aramaeans lived in the area that is now the border region between Syria and Turkey. They began to settle in large numbers in Babylonia and Assyria, and Aramaic eventually became the main language in Mesopotamia. When the Persians took over the region, they made Aramaic the official language of their vast empire, spreading the language as far as Egypt. Even after the Persian Empire was taken over by the Alexander the Great, Aramaic remained the region’s main language, with Greek taking its place only as an administrative language used by government officials and the language of the elite.</p> \n<p> Aramaic’s dominance in the region declined rapidly with the rise of Islam in the seventh century C.E. Aramaic was being pushed out by Arabic in a gradual process which continues to this very day, with only small pockets of Aramaic remaining. There are still a couple towns in Syria that speak Aramaic, and it is spoken in some mountainous regions of Kurdistan, as well as some other small communities scattered throughout the Middle East. In addition, some pockets of immigrants from these communities still speak Aramaic, but this surely will not last forever. An estimated 400,000 people speak Aramaic today, though they speak various dialects and would find it difficult to communicate with one another.</p> \n<p> None, by the way, speak the Aramaic dialect spoken by Jesus.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A campaign for a Jewish conversion tribunal&nbsp;targeting Israelis from the former Soviet Union has raised a furor among its target audience, prominent members of which accused the campaign organizers of insulting and stereotyping their community.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The campaign, launched on Sunday on social media and removed on Tuesday, promoted the group Giyur Kahalakha (Conversion Based on Jewish Law), established by rabbis from the religious-Zionist sect, which offers an ostensibly easier alternative to conversion by the Chief Rabbinate.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The campaign’s home page stated: “If you’re not Russian, don’t click here.” Visitors to the program’s website were asked to fill out a questionnaire. Under every question were two pictures, one labeled “Israeli” and one “Russian.”</p> \n<p>For example, under the statement “At age 19 you wore,” one picture appeared of army boots and another of a person wearing sandals with socks. Near the statement “As a child you admired” were pictures of Santa Claus and a rabbi. Under the question “Tell the truth, what tastes better?” were pictures of a hamburger with a cola and a hamburger with a milkshake – milk and meat together are forbidden under Jewish law.</p> \n<p>At the end of the questionnaire, readers are invited to &quot;get to know Giyur Kahalalka – an independent conversion tribunal that for the first time offers individual paths suitable to every convert.” About 100 people have converted through the group since August, when it was established.</p> \n<p>The campaign was removed on Tuesday, two days&nbsp;after its initial launch, apparently due to the public backlash. “The campaign stirred feelings I have not felt for years of foreignness and alienation. It tries to turn people from the former Soviet Union into non-Israelis,” said Lena Rovsovsky, a social activist in the Russian-speaking community.</p> \n<p>MK Yoel Razvozov (Yesh Atid) has sent a letter asking the rabbis to drop their campaign, saying it insults immigrants. “Instead of forging a relationship between immigrants who are not Jewish and Jewish law, the campaign does the opposite and insults a group that serves in the army and pays taxes,” Razvozov wrote.</p> \n<p>“These photos and messages convey the opposite and distance the Soviet immigrants from the activity your organization proposes. The pictures and messages antagonize and give the immigrants the feeling that once again native Israelis are teasing and insulting them. The campaign is full of mistaken stereotypes.”</p> \n<p>The campaign is “stereotypical in the extreme,” said Boris Schindler of the Forum of Jewish and Israeli Identity, a group of around 30 organizations of Russian-speaking Israelis.</p> \n<p>For its part, Giyur Kahalakha said: “We are sorry some people were insulted by our campaign. The campaign was designed to shed a humorous light ... and not, heaven forefend, offend.” The rabbis said they would make changes to prevent furthering these misunderstandings.</p> \n<p>But according to Schindler, “The only thing that was missing in the campaign was a picture of vodka and arak to ride on every possible stereotype. This pushes us back 25 years,” he said.</p> \n<p>“These are stigmas that we have been trying to shake off for years. What are they trying to say? That people from the former Soviet Union don’t serve in the army? That they’re the only Israelis who don’t eat kosher?”</p>",

Azrieli, which built Tel Aviv’s Azrieli office and shopping complex, earned 672 million shekels ($174.5 million) in the first quarter, compared to 188 million shekels a year earlier. Excluding the valuation profits and the tax rate decrease, net profit totaled 244 million shekels. Net operating income, which reflects the group’s core business, rose 7%, to 319 million shekels, mainly due to a new mall in Israel, high occupancy rates and higher rents in Israeli office buildings. In the United States its NOI fell 23% due to a key tenant leaving a property in Houston.

        "text":["<p>This article was originally published May 22, 2014</p> \n<p>Catastrophes provide governments with an opportunity to present themselves as true leaders during a crisis. Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan missed this opportunity in handling Soma's coalmine disaster that led to more than 300 deaths. He downplayed the tragedy and insulted protesters, victims, and their families. And now a pro-Erdogan Islamist newspaper has directly accused the Jewish-controlled media and Israel of responsibility for the tragedy.</p> \n<p>One of his insults (“Why are you running away, spawn of Israel?”) against his fellow countrymen was a clear anti-Semitic slur. This was not a coincidental but rather symptomatic of Erdogan's views. Instead of tackling the problems, Jews or Israel are blamed. Despite some lip-service to international audiences the Erdoğan government not only tolerates but actively endorses anti-Semitism. A closer look shows that the anti-Semitic incidents of recent years are deeply rooted in the current AKP government and Erdoğan's personality; they also have increasing resonance in the wider Turkish society.</p> \n<p>Openly anti-Semitic hate propaganda is frequently published in the Turkish media, most prominently by the Islamist newspapers Yeni Akit and Mill Gazete. Journalists of both papers are part of Erdoğan's regular journalistic entourage. Instead of condemning their Holocaust denial and incitement to hatred of Jews, the Turkish PM has become known for his own anti-Semitism. Instead of fighting corruption, the Erdoğan government disseminates conspiracy theories and hatred against minorities.</p> \n<p>In 2013, he 'won' second place on the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of the year's top ten anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist slurs (Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khameini took first place). Following mass protests in cities around the country in June 2013, Turkey's financial markets were turbulent, and Erdoğan laid the blame on the “interest rate lobby”; his deputy, Beşir Atalay, specified: “There are some circles that are jealous of Turkey's growth. They are all uniting, and on one side is the Jewish Diaspora. You saw the foreign media's attitude during the Gezi Park incidents; they bought it and started broadcasting immediately.” These verbal attacks were followed by unprecedented demands against Istanbul traders to hand over all e-mail traffic with foreigners.</p> \n<p>The obsession with Jews obscures his foreign policy. Partners and enemies are chosen for ideological reasons instead of national interests. His close ties to Gaddafi were founded partly on their common hatred of Israel. Erdoğan received Gaddafi's Human Rights Awards of 2010 after deliberately provoking a crisis in Turkish-Israeli relations. When Muslim Brotherhood's Morsi was ousted, Erdoğan told party members: &quot;Israel is behind the coup in Egypt, we have evidence.&quot; What evidence did he have? A televised panel from 2011 in France with a &quot;French Jewish intellectual&quot; (later identified as Bernard-Henri Levy) who opined that even if the Brotherhood won at the ballot box, he would not personally regard this as democratic. In the mind of an anti-Semite the case is clear: In Erdogan’s words: “Who is behind this? Israel.“ In 2009, Erdoğan had insulted President Shimon Peres at Davos with a modernized blood libel, accusing Israelis of deliberately killing Palestinian children.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>His bias translated into action in 2010 when he agreed to the departure of the Mavi Marmara vessel to breach the military blockade of Gaza, part of a flotilla run by the Islamist NGO IHH that has links to Hamas and to the Turkish government. Apparently not entirely satisfied with media reports on the incident he added insult to injury: “When the word ‘media’ is pronounced, Israel and Israel’s administration comes to mind. They have the ability to manipulate it as they wish.” He subsequently made clear that he believes that not only the international press is run by Israel but also Turkish newspapers.</p> \n<p>Erdogan’s “criticism” of Israel is, in fact, demonization. He accuses Israel of what British philosopher Bernard Harrison terms &quot;utterly exceptional crimes&quot; - that is, hyperbolized criticism of Israel whose exaggerated content does not reflect reality and is fed by anti-Semitism. In a CNN interview in 2011 he said: “We know that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were killed” and accused “the Israeli people” of genocide.</p> \n<p>Erdoğan initially had some success among his Islamist followers in Turkey and abroad by presenting himself as a strongman against Jews and Israel. His foreign policy, however, has been a disaster: Most of his former allies are either ousted or now enemies (such as Syria’s Assad). In Turkey, he remains still popular, although opposition is growing.</p> \n<p>Erdogan's anti-Semitism is generated and fostered by three factors. Firstly, anti-Semitism is part and parcel of Turkish Islamist ideology, which found political expression in the parties founded from the late 1960s onwards by Necmettin Erbakan – a fierce anti-Semite. Prominent anti-Semitic themes among Turkish Islamists are conspiracy theories about:</p> \n<p>a) “D&ouml;nmes”, i.e. crypto-Jews and descendants of followers of Sabbatai Zevi, a 17th century Jewish kabbalist who claimed to be the Messiah and was then forced to convert to Islam; b) the abolishment of the caliphate and the creation of modern Turkey as a Jewish plot; and c) anti-Zionism and conspiracy theories about Israel.</p> \n<p>Whereas Erbakan’s assessment that the European Union was a Zionist ploy has been forgotten, accusations that Israel has expansionist intentions - including Turkish soil - have gained popularity. On the basis of a Biblical verse it is claimed that Israel wants to expand from the Euphrates to Nile and thus supports the PKK terrorist organization. Conspiracy theories about the “Israel lobby” instigating an alleged coup against the Islamist government and conspiring for the “Ergenokon complot” are also disseminated.</p> \n<p>Secondly, anti-Semitism is widespread in Turkey and opposition is low. According to the recent Anti-Defamation League survey, 69 percent of the population harbor anti-Semitic attitudes. This corresponds to a survey from 2008 when 68 percent had a “very unfavorable opinion of Jews,” up from 59 percent in 2006. Anti-Semitic books such as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (published in Turkish 114 times between 1946 and 2012, mostly by Islamists) and Mein Kampf (that sold more than 100,000 copies within two months in 2005) are popular and easily available. Anti-Semitic movies and TV series such as the Valley of the Wolves and Ayrilik are endorsed by state media.</p> \n<p>Most dispiriting of all, few individuals but a handful of intellectuals such as Rifat Bali and some human rights activists (Say Stop to Racism and Nationalism) seem to care. The small Jewish community who is directly targeted does not dare to speak up. However, even some Islamists such as Mehmet Şevket Eygi and Abdurrahaman Dilipak have noted that anti-Semitic ideas have corrupted thought in political Islam, and MP Aykan Erdemir from the opposition party CHP admitted earlier this year that 12 years of Erdoğan rule have significantly fostered anti-Semitism in Turkey.</p> \n<p>Lastly, and most importantly, Erdogan's worldview is profoundly anti-Semitic. Already back in 1974, he wrote, directed and played the lead role in the play “Mas-Kom-Ya”, which presented Freemasonry, Communism and Judaism as evil. To this day, Erdoğan’s muse is Necip Fazl Ksak&uuml;rek whose “B&uuml;y&uuml;k Doğu” (“Great East”) ideology was also the main inspiration for the foundation of the Islamist terror organization IBDA-C. Ksak&uuml;rek was an anti-Semite and fierce enemy of secular Turkey. His publications include the Turkish translation of “The Protocols” and praise for Henry Ford’s “The International Jew”. He also wrote a political program: “With this commandment every measure is to be taken in order to bring the Turkish homeland to a state in which its only inhabitants are Muslims and Turks and to cleanse it from head to toe of traitors and darker forces. Chief among these treacherous and insidious elements to be cleansed are the D&ouml;nmes and the Jews.” Today’s Turkish PM praises Ksak&uuml;rek as a guide for himself and future generations.</p> \n<p>In the interests of Turkey, its minorities, and neighbors, and of its allies more widely including the United States, we can only hope that Tayyip Erdoğan will not get the opportunity to disseminate his dangerous views even more widely as a future President of Turkey.</p> \n<p>Dr. G&uuml;nther Jikeli is a fellow at the Moses Mendelssohn Center for European-Jewish Studies, Potsdam University and at the Groupe Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s, Religions, Lacit&eacute;s / CNRS, Paris, and was previously the Justin M. Druck Family Visiting Scholar at Indiana University's Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism.</p> \n<p>Dr. Kemal Silay is Professor of Turkish Studies and Director of the Turkish Flagship Center at Indiana University, Bloomington, USA. </p> \n<p>The authors would like to thank Rifat Bali and Sean Singer for their consultations.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“Disgraced,” a Cameri Theater production of a play by Ayad Akhtar, an American writer of Pakistani origin, premiered in Chicago in 2012, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama the following year. It offers a vivid portrayal of the complex situation in which the West is threatened by extremist Islam, creating a feeling of “barbarians at the gates.” The play probes with intelligence and sensitivity the open wounds of Islam-West, Muslim-American, Jewish-American, artist-curator, male-female, Jews-Muslims, blacks-whites, religion-culture and master-slave relations in America.</p> \n<p>As Kfir Azulay the director of the Cameri version notes in the program, the play’s subject is less “the West and Islam,” focusing more on internal identity conflicts. These are conveyed primarily through the play’s central character, Amir Kapoor, a successful New York lawyer who hopes to be made a partner in the law firm for which he works. The son of Pakistan-born parents, he is a declared enemy of Islam and refuses to view it as a “culture” that has been perverted by extremists, because he knows deep down that what makes it fearful is its destructive totality.</p> \n<p>“Disgraced” is a work that is right – albeit not easy – for viewing here and now in Israel, because the pairs I listed above, each of which reflects a different stage in the eternal struggle between threatener and threatened, or between oppressor and oppressed, have local equivalents in the painful points of encounter between Mizrahi and Ashkenazi or between Jew and Arab.</p> \n<p>Amir, who is Middle Eastern in appearance, is a fierce and uncompromising critic of Islam, in the name of universal American values. He is married to Emily, a white-skinned American artist who lauds the artistic and cultural values of Islam, which the West discarded from the start of the Renaissance. She needs the recognition of a curator in a prestigious museum – Isaac, a Jew, who falls in love with her and accepts her Islam-influenced artistic approach. Isaac’s wife, a black-skinned lawyer named Jory, is Amir’s colleague and friend, but only one of them can become a partner in their Jewish-American law firm in New York.</p> \n<p>Into this world comes Amir’s nephew, who arrived in the United States from Pakistan as a boy; he changed his name from Hussein to Abe, but continued to frequent the mosque. He asks Amir, the successful lawyer, to come to the aid of his imam who has been arrested for the content of his preaching. Contrary to his worldview, Amir accedes to the request because of his love for his “enlightened” wife. As a result, he becomes an object of suspicion in the all-American milieu into which he wants to assimilate.</p> \n<p>Charged issues</p> \n<p>The play’s centerpiece is a dinner attended by the two couples in which Amir, who is threatened from the outside by his workplace environment, which is suspicious of all things Muslim, has too much to drink and confesses, rather naively, to the existence of dark areas (of a Muslim character) within him, against which he is trying to struggle. In this sense, even though he ends the play defeated, he is braver than the other characters: He is aware of and admits to his passions and destructive emotions, which are part genetics, part ideology, part religion, part blood and part politics – but refuses to yield to them. Nor is he prepared to adopt them (like his nephew Hussein-Abe) or “neutralize” them through the intellect (as his wife, Emily, the curator Isaac and his wife Jory do).</p> \n<p>The play demands concentration and attentiveness from both audience and cast, as the issues at stake are complex, highly charged, tricky and elusive. By the same token, the play demands of the director, the designers and the actors the ability to summon up and manipulate emotion, particularly when all the identity conflicts explode into interpersonal violence, fueled by gender relations, relations between friends and by the ethnic tangle of the characters.</p> \n<p>The Cameri Theater production is a searing emotional experience, thanks in part to the set and costume design by Polina Adamov. The characters’ clothes are splendidly designed and so is Amir and Emily’s apartment, with furnishings that include iconic objects (the McIntosh chairs reminiscent of the Twin Towers). The thoughtful directions given the actors make proper use of the characters’ powerful and destructive energies.</p> \n<p>But the viewer’s experience derives above all from the distinctive personality of the actors, whose private stories as people also enter into their praiseworthy performances. All of them are immigrants or the children of immigrants, not unusual in Israel, and each of them is singularly suited to the character he/she portrays. Eran Mor, as Hussein-Abe, creates a vivid episodic role as a kind of exemplification of the almost inevitable radicalization process of one who is both threatening and rejected. The German-born Sara von Schwarze, who arrived in Israel as a child, is Emily, the enlightened American artist who defends Islamic culture ardently; she is womanly, mature, hurting, confused, vulnerable, battered. Ruth Asrasai, of Ethiopian origin but an Israeli in every fiber of her highly energetic being, possesses terrific comic and dramatic timing and a self-confident presence as befits Jory, a woman who “sprang from the ghetto” and is capable of hurting and being hurt. Micha Selektar, as Isaac, covers the fragments of his identity with articulate intellectualization, not an easy task for this highly emotive actor. And Amos Tamam, who was born in Ramle, on the Israeli periphery, is riveting as Amir as he plunges into the dizzy depths of the conflicted and courageous consciousness of someone who is willing to look at the world from the darkness of his soul, and not deny the demons in it.</p> \n<p>The Cameri Theater’s Hall 3 allows the viewer to be very close to the events unfolding on the stage. One only hopes that the play’s ideological aspect – which is intended for those who are proficient in articulation, attentiveness and thoughtfulness – will not prevent viewers from taking one step back to see how the play directs them to gaze into the dark parts of their souls, too – not to deny them or yield to them (two easy temptations), but to struggle with them so that we can all live in a society worthy of being lived in.</p> \n<p>The next performances of “Disgraced” at the Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv will be on Jan. 21 and Jan. 25 at 21.00; Jan. 22 at 12.00, 21.00; Jan. 23 at 18.30, 21.00</p>",

Peter Beinart and Ari Shavit discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Israeli left</p> \n<p>Peter Beinart and Ari Shavit acknowledge that Odeh is a &quot;hard act to follow.&quot;</p> \n<p>Shavit asks Beinart: Don't we, the Israeli left, have some self-criticism? Shouldn't we move beyond blaming Bibi and settlers? Beinart says that &quot;liberal Zionists are unwilling to accept that Palestinians won't ever accept the legitimacy of the Zionist project.&quot;</p> \n<p>Shavit responds that &quot;Netanyahu isn't the sin - he is the punishment. The Israeli left hasn't brought a vision or leaders.&quot; He adds that &quot;until we recognize that regular Israelis have legitimate fears, we lose the battle. WASPs (White Ashkenazi Supporters of Peace) are detached from reality.&quot;</p> \n<p>Beinart tells Shavit that &quot;people who support the two-state solution shouldn't paint it as utopia.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;American-Jewish left is so angry over Palestinians that it doesn't participate in communal mourning and pain,&quot; Beinart adds.</p> \n<p>&quot;We are losing the hearts and minds of Israelis,&quot; Shavit says. &quot;The Israeli left evaporated. We are playing into the right's hands.&quot;&nbsp;Shavit credits Beinart for identifying the &quot;millenial problem&quot; of losing young American Jews.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Beinart says that in the last election, &quot;I didn't see Isaac Herzog standing up for the principles of the left.&quot;&nbsp;Beinart adds that &quot;we have a Jewishly illiterate generation. That's not Israel's fault, that's American Jews' fault.&quot;</p> \n<p>12:33 A.M. Joint Arab List MK Ayman Odeh: We must liberate Palestinians and Israelis from occupation</p> \n<p>Joint Arab List MK Ayman Odeh says that &quot;as an Israeli citizen, I know that Israel cannot be a true and just democracy as it occupies another people.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;I know that peace and justice are interests of both people,&quot; Odeh says. &quot;For so many, the occupation is all they've ever known.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;We have seen what managing the conflict looks like in recent weeks: a horrific and bloodstained reality,&quot; Odeh says.</p> \n<p>&quot;Occupation is the Palestinian people's tragedy, but also Israel's present. We must liberate both people from the occupation,&quot; Odeh says.</p> \n<p>Odeh praised his political party, saying that &quot;we in the Joint List are living proof that Arabs and Jews refuse to be enemies. They should struggle together against racism and for democracy.&quot;</p> \n<p>Odeh noted that 42% of the doctors at Rambam Hospital in Haifa are Arabs. &quot;If we can trust each other when we're most vulnerable, we can live together.&quot;</p> \n<p>Odeh said he was developing a 10-year plan to achieve social and economic equality between Israeli Arabs and Jews.</p> \n<p>&quot;Our beautiful homeland is enough for us, Arabs and Jews,&quot; Odeh said. &quot;If we turn her into a battlefield, she will spit us out,&quot; he concluded to a standing ovation.</p> \n<p>12:14 A.M. Samantha Power: Settlement growth raises questions about Israel's long-term objectives</p> \n<p>U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power opens her remarks by recognizing Haaretz and New Israel Fund's leadership in organizing HaaretzQ conference.</p> \n<p>&quot;Haaretz has long understood strengthening Israeli democracy is part of its mission,&quot; Power says,&nbsp;lauding Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken and Editor-in-chief Aluf Benn for sticking to Haaretz's core principles.</p> \n<p>Power says the U.S. will always stay Israel's partner despite questions if the Israel-U.S. bond is at risk. She&nbsp;notes the U.S. efforts to push back attempts of delegitimizing Israel at the UN, a place where &quot;Israel hasn't always been treated fairly.&quot;</p> \n<p>Power says bias against Israel at the UN persists and blasts the &quot;absurdity of Israel being the only country with a standing item on the agenda - &quot;not Syria, which gasses its citizens.&quot;&nbsp;She notes that the U.S. cut anti-Israel decisions at the UN Human Rights Council by half.&nbsp;Power says Israel fights for the ability to be treated like any other country at the UN, adding that delegitimizing Israel delegitimizes the UN. Power also&nbsp;criticizes the &quot;surge&quot; of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic attitudes in her native Ireland.</p> \n<p>&quot;We are under no illusion that achieving peace is easy - it takes tough choices by both sides,&quot; Power says, adding that &quot;we have not seen sufficient commitment from either side to create conditions for peace.&quot;&nbsp;Power added that &quot;continued settlement growth raises questions about Israel’s long-term objectives.&quot;</p> \n<p>Power posed a number of&nbsp;hypothetical questions: How would dissolving the PA would promote an independent Palestinian state? What do we say to those in the international community who are frustrated by the lack of two-state solution?&nbsp;What is the explanation for settlement building in areas that will be part of the Palestinian state?&nbsp;What answers does Israel have for its well-wishers at UN - what concrete policies that advance a two-state solution? </p> \n<p>Power said that the U.S. &quot;will always&quot; continue working for a two-state solution, opposing any efforts at the UN that undermine such a solution.&nbsp;Power added that she is &quot;still awed by the brave and unpopular decisions often made by Yitzhak Rabin.&quot; READ FULL STORY</p> \n<p>11:18 P.M.

If you want the land, keep it, just give me my equal right.&quot;&nbsp;She says that Israel’s right-wing is taking Zionism to new level that “will destroy all of us together.”&nbsp;Jebreal says she would like to ask her friends at HaaretzQ to revamp the Zionist project. &quot;Sooner or later, the Israeli right will come after you.&quot;</p> \n<p>B'Tselem Executive Director Hagai El-Ad says that &quot;there is nothing moral about an army which has been occupying Palestine for decades.&quot;&nbsp;Rabbis for Human Rights' Rabbi Arik Ascherman says Israeli can live their lives as though the occupation did not exist. Palestinians are aware of the occupation every second.&nbsp;Ascherman says that religious Israelis are much likelier to be racist. Asked what happened to him, he says he was brought up in U.S.</p> \n<p>Levy acknowledges Roger Waters' attendance at the conference. The crowd responds with applause.&nbsp;Sasson says that achieving piece will require moving 150,000 Jews from the West Bank.</p> \n<p>11:05 P.M. ''Droves of Arab voters': Is the struggle of Israel's Arab citizens to equality the new focal point of the conflict?'</p> \n<p>Jafar Farrah, Director of Mossawa, says he does not fly El Al to avoid being profiled. He says the challenge is to change the discussion in Israel and to create a new discourse.&nbsp;&quot;We lost our homeland, our homes, we have to talk about it and resolve problems based on truth and reconciliation,&quot; Farrah says, adding that Palestinians are willing to be the minority forever.</p> \n<p>Sayed Kashua says talk of &quot;Israeli Arabs&quot; vs. &quot;Palestinian citizens of Israel&quot; is confusing. &quot;We have so many titles, as if we aren't confused anyway.&quot; When asked how he defines himself, he says &quot;I'm a married man and father of three.&quot;</p> \n<p>Kashua says that When you are a victim, it's much more difficult to use humor and satire. WHen asked if he feels guilty for his success on Israeli television, he jokes that he wakes up in the morning and feels guilty for the day before.&nbsp;&quot;If writing will change my economic reality, then I will be very satisfied,&quot; Kashua jokes. He says that when he was young, he believed in the power of literature to change things, but less so today. &quot;I hope I can watch the future of the Middle East from my big flatscreen in a big apartment on the Upper West Side,&quot; Kashua jokes.</p> \n<p>&quot;Last week, a group of Arabs wanted to build houses in Afula and it was amazing to see people demonstrating against them,&quot; Kashua says. &quot;It was sad when Afula mayor said sorry, I had no idea Arabs wanted to live here.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;No Arab villages have been established since 1948, that's sad and tragic,&quot; Kashua says. &quot;I don't know how we can build a better future.&quot;</p> \n<p>Amal Elsana Alh’jooj, NIF Board Member and AJEEC-NISPED’s Director of North American Relations, tells Kashua: I admire your work because you are brave enough to bring our inner issues out there. Alh'jooj says that underlying issues are the policy, they need a structural change. Home demolitions in the Negev are just a symptom. &quot;If land is only Jewish land and every time a minister wants to resettle Jews, this is a problem. A change has to be holistic.&quot; Alh'jooj says that after Rivlin's speech, &quot;I feel instrumental. This is not instrumental. This is principle, a human rights thing.&quot;</p> \n<p>Kasua jokes to Ravit Hecht: I love flying El Al - that way, I know I will have a column next week.&nbsp;Communication consult Emilie Moatti says &quot;I'm much more brilliant in Hebrew, and much more modest,&quot; adding that Israelis don't meet real Arabs often enough.&nbsp;Alh'jooj says: Stop counting who is on the left and who is on the right, the name of the game is democracy and human rights.</p> \n<p>&quot;I left because I couldn't lie any longer to my kids that one day you'll be equal here,&quot; Kashua says. &quot;I blame it on the mother - because you don't have a Jewish mother.&quot;</p> \n<p>10:35 P.M. 'Friendship under stress: How would Israel-U.S. ties look following the Iran deal and growing regional turmoil?'</p> \n<p>Haaretz's Barak Ravid says Iran is a threat and Bibi sometimes has a point regarding Hezbollah and ISIS, but Israel is strong and not about to go away.</p> \n<p>Zionist Union MK Omer Bar-Lev says he broke consensus and supported Iran nuclear deal because he saw most important goals were met.&nbsp;Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) says she &nbsp;voted against Iran deal because the deal didn't make region safer and Iran's post-deal actions prove it. Maloney says support for Israel should be bipartisan, but Netanyahu should stay out of American politics. Bar-Lev says Israel-U.S. working closely together is the only way to make sure Iran doesn't breach the nuclear agreement.</p> \n<p>Israeli Foreign Ministry's Jeremy Issacharoff says Israel and U.S. have differences on Iran, but we work together on other issues.&nbsp;He adds that the aim of preventing Iranian militarized nuclear program is ahead of us, not behind us.</p> \n<p>Rob Malley, Senior Advisor to the President for the Counter ISIL Campaign, says that Iran’s regional behavior hasn’t changed, but better that they do it with the nuclear deal than without. Even if they didn't change, they would do what they do without a nuclear weapon, and in next 10 years we can stop one.</p> \n<p>Malley says he expects the new post- Iran deal memorandum of understanding between Israel and U.S. to be signed while Obama is still in office, adding that the &quot;robust debate&quot; about Iran won't have consequences in the U.S.-Israel security relationship.&nbsp;Malley, now Obama's ISIS czar, said Obama is now spending &quot;most of his time&quot; dealing with the ISIS threat and there is close intelligence cooperation with Israel.</p> \n<p>Malley says part of the problem are the allies of the Assad regime which is preventing coalition of Syrians against ISIS - that's why it's important to get Iran and Russia as part of the solution,to change their behavior,if not war will go on.&nbsp;Bar-Lev says for Israel, it is hard to decide to prefer if we want Al-Qaida or Hezbollah on border, how do we want Syria to resolve?</p> \n<p>Issacharoff says Israel remains concerned that Assad has chemical capabilities, and he “does not exclude” that they still have stockpile. &quot;We want stable border, no weapons transfers to hostile parties, no chemical weapons.&quot; He adds that &quot;all realistic Syria choices are bad for Israel. Western democracy isn't going to happen there.&quot;&nbsp;Maloney says countries in the region have to take responsibility for their own protection vs. ISIS.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Malley rebuffs Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon’s assertion that U.S. is “sitting on the fence” on ISIS.&nbsp;&quot;We have been going after ISIS ...but we also know that going in massively on own is wrong after lesson of Iraq,&quot; Malley says, adding that &quot;we have to cut off ISIS finances and have counter-messaging campaigns vs 'pernicious noxious ideology.'&quot;&nbsp;He says that &quot;unless you resolve the conflict in Syria, we can't get a coalition of Syrians against ISIS.&quot;</p> \n<p>Malley says that only resolution of Israeli-Palestinian conflict will allow Arab states to openly cooperate with Israel against ISIS. He notes that peace would not be a magic fix, but would help curb extremism and make anti-ISIS fight easier.</p> \n<p>10:20 P.M. 'An island in a storm: How does the Middle East impact opinions and actions in Israel?'</p> \n<p>Dr. Meir Buzaglo, Hebrew University,&nbsp;says Piyyutim is Jewish Arab music. Musicians, Arabs and Jews playing together, are an important cultural bridge in Israel today. &quot;If you want to change the law, change the music.&quot;</p> \n<p>Not enough stories are written about shared living initiatives in Israel today, says SHATIL director Ronit Heyd, who calls for more involvement of the Mizrahi community in Israel's left.</p> \n<p>10:10&nbsp;P.M. 'Linking struggles: Whose lives matter?'</p> \n<p>Haaretz's Amira Hass says activists work for decades for what politicians and institutional leaders eventually take credit for.&nbsp;Hass says we should use the term &quot;non-armed resistance&quot; instead of non-violent.&nbsp;Non-violent puts the onus on the occupied, instead of those responsible for the occupation, Hass says. &quot;I think Palestinians have a right to throw stones.&quot;</p> \n<p>Hass asks Dove Kent, Executive Director of Jews for Racial &amp; Economic Justice: Why do you need a Jewish organization for racial and economic justice here in the U.S.? Why not join others? &nbsp;“It matters to organize Jews against Islamophobia in the United States,” Kent says. &quot;To organize as Jews in an identity-based way is not particularly powerful, but faith-rooted organizing is powerful.&quot;&nbsp;Kent adds that some of the most powerful movements have been led by people bringing a multiplicity of traditions to the struggle.</p> \n<p>Suhad Babaa, Executive Director at Just Vision, says one must look at the context of Israeli-Palestinian violence - namely the occupation and inequality. Babaa says to look at number of unarmed young Palestinians killed for doing nothing but walking down the street - who is asking why? Babaa adds the IDF is very rarely held accountable for violence toward Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Hass asks: Are white Americans really able to understand the African-American experience? Should they be allowed to give advice to the oppressed?&nbsp;Bridget Todd, digital strategist and community organizer, says &quot;I've been a black woman my whole life...Folks can sympathize, but it's very difficult to say 'I know what that's like.'&quot;</p> \n<p>Babaa notes that &quot;there isn't a Palestine front line activist on this panel....would have been important to this conversation.&quot;</p> \n<p>9:32 P.M. 'Don't let friends drive drunk: What can foreign intervention accomplish?'</p> \n<p>Haaretz's Bradley Burston suggests foreign intervention is the worst form of obscenity for Israeli officialdom. &nbsp;Burston asks Colette Avital: If Netanyahu resists foreign involvement, how can we move the needle toward real change?&nbsp;Avital, International Secretary of Meretz,&nbsp;says her passion was once getting support for Israel. She says that it isn't easy to say nothing will move without foreign help. Avital adds that we have to get through the bubble in which Israelis live, in which Netanyahu acts with impunity.</p> \n<p>Avital says that we can't change Bibi's mind - he is immune to criticism and brought Israel-U.S. relations to their lowest point. &nbsp;She adds that Israelis must understand occupation has a price. European labelling had no effect, but banning soccer teams and reinstating visas to Europe would.&nbsp;Avital notes that she thinks boycotting academics is unjust and she is not pro-BDS, but adds that international intervention or some form of pressure is needed.</p> \n<p>Andrew Gilmour, UN Director for Political, Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Human Rights, says he has been told by Israelis &quot;in distinct anatomical terms&quot; what to do with the UN charter. He says despite this and what many say, the UN is Israel's friend.&nbsp;Gilmour says the UN was created to protect the weak from the strong. It is the strong who want to keep the UN out. He adds that he would echo John Kerry regarding his lack of optimism that Israelis will come around to a two-state solution in time.</p> \n<p>Ghaith Al-Omari, Washington Institute for Near East Policy and former adviser to the PLO negotiating team, says if you view Palestinians as victims, you don't give them agency. He says we should be pushing Palestinians to help themselves internally concerning issues of governance and reform, adding that the U.S. must lead in the Middle East but not have a monopoly.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Americans for Peace (APN)'s Lara Friedman says she has criticized Obama's handling of the peace process.&nbsp;Friedman says the White House should have stuck to its guns on the settlement freeze - it hurt U.S. credibility and the two-state solution. She adds that Israelis still don't feel the occupation has consequences - if you &quot;hug&quot; Israel, anti-peace forces take advantage. Friedman says any peace effort must be multilateral and not solely U.S.-driven, adding that Israel needs &quot;cost&quot; and &quot;consequences&quot; to destructive actions and those who impose them shouldn't apologize.</p> \n<p>9:25 P.M. 'What’s left: Is there a future for the progressive movement in Israel?'</p> \n<p>Zionist Union MK Merav Michaeli says that &quot;we are constantly being accused of not being left enough,&quot; adding that the left &quot;constantly attack one another and try to find the only way to be a leftist.&quot; She adds &quot;when Haaretz decides to join us, that would be great.&quot;</p> \n<p>Jafar Farrah, Director of Mossawa, accuses the Israeli left of not standing with Palestinians.&nbsp;Farrah says &quot;it's about time to look at the left's relationship with Arab and Haredi communities if you want to win the next elections...&quot; He adds that conversations on the Israeli left's future need to be held in Haifa, not New York.</p> \n<p>Meretz MK Tamar Zandberg says that the left doesn't have a sort of test before you can join, saying &quot;this is about the future of Israel.&quot;&nbsp;Michaeli says she has no issues with Farrah, saying &quot;we're not like Meretz. We don't always think we're perfect.&quot;</p> \n<p>Molad's Hillel Ben Sasson says: So what does Labor stand for today? This is a very blurry question.&nbsp;Interpeace initiative's Noam Shuster says Israel unjustly demonizes national-religious community. Shuster asks: Why is it only Tel Aviv talking with Ramallah? What about the rest of Israel's diverse communities? Shuster adds that &quot;there are even ultra-Orthodox legal rulings which can offer very interesting solutions to peace.&quot;</p> \n<p>9:20 P.M. 'You can't handle the truth: What is the role of the media and public discourse in shaping reality in Israel?'</p> \n<p>Channel 2's Amit Segal says Israelis are very focused on Israel. Segal says this is part of the problem - Israeli media only covers the Israeli perspective.</p> \n<p>Alona Vinograd, of the Movement for Freedom of Information, says &quot;freedom of information&quot; has been catalogued as a leftist value in Israel.&nbsp;+972 Magazine's Noam Sheizaf says the media in Israel was never diversified, but today it's more diversified - and weaker - than ever.</p> \n<p>Aluf Benn says that most investigative reporting in Israel today is outsourced by the media to NGOs.</p> \n<p>8:45 P.M. 'Jerusalem burning: Is religion the solution or the problem?'</p> \n<p>Rabbi Michael Melchior calls religion the world's biggest NGO, saying we cannot ignore its role.&nbsp;Melchoir says that &quot;we have just created a coalition of Jewish and Muslim religious leaders in both Israel and Palestine to support peace.&quot;</p> \n<p>Yudith Oppenheimer, Executive Director of Ir Amim, says the movement aiming to change the Temple Mount status quo has penetrated deeply into the Israeli political ruling class.</p> \n<p>Shaun Casey, U.S. Special Representative for Religion and Global Affairs, says U.S. policy hadn't taken religion into account enough, adding that his job was created to engage with religious actors globally.&nbsp;Dan Kurtzer, Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, says our religious leaders have failed as much as our political and diplomatic leaders.</p> \n<p>Melchior asks: Why did were religious leaders excluded from peace talks up to now? Is peace a secularizing process? He says religious leaders shouldn't be relied upon solely to put out flames after they have been excluded from the process. He adds that he has worked on assuring Muslim leaders that only a tiny minority of Jewish leaders support change on the Temple Mount.&nbsp;Even Hamas, Islamic Jihad, settlers and national-religious rabbis can agree to sit together in a religion-based process.</p> \n<p>Casey says grassroots interreligious conversations are what will sustain a peace process when it actually takes off.&nbsp;Melchior adds that the Israeli public simply doesn't listen when he facilitates important Muslim and Islamist leaders rejecting violence.</p> \n<p>7:46 P.M. 'Unifying or separating: Is Israel dividing American Jewry?'</p> \n<p>Haaretz's Chemi Shalev asks if there should be a degree of humility among American Jews about how Israel is behaving because of the danger Israelis live with.</p> \n<p>Peter Beinart says Israeli needs a political strategy for horrible violence while showing Palestinians that non-violent coexistence can work.</p> \n<p>Rachel A. Lerner, J Street Vice President for Community Relations, says the American Jewish community is rapidly leaving behind most American Jews. She adds that it is possible to be Jewish and pro-Palestinian, pro-Israel and pro-peace.</p> \n<p>Matt Nosanchuk, White House liaison to the Jewish community, says that we are actively thinking about confidence-building measures partners can take even if two-state solution seems remote.</p> \n<p>Shalev says that left-wing Israelis don't see common basis with those on the right anymore; in America there's more nuance.&nbsp;Beinart says a day spent in the West Bank has transformative power - it's a shattering experience. He adds that learning from all people in Israel is a wedge lever for change.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum, Congregation Beit Simchat Torah, asks what Israel's character will look like inside the day after the messiah comes?

And if not, what are we doing wrong?</p> \n<p>Yesh Din's Michael Sfard says &quot;I am so proud to be part of changing the discourse in Israel.&quot; He adds that &quot;we need to measure our success by the 'cracks' Israeli dissidents create in the discourse.&quot;&nbsp;He says that he really believes Breaking the Silence is preparing the ground for the end of the occupation.</p> \n<p>Conflict transformation specialist Carol Daniel Kasbari says she was &quot;crucified&quot; for participating in HaaretzQ conference and &nbsp;told by Palestinians &quot;we cannot do anything.&quot; She says that &quot;my Palestinian husband and I had to leave the country because my husband couldn't live with me. How is that acceptable?&quot;</p> \n<p>Levy notes that he expected a social earthquake that never arrived when Breaking the Silence first emerged.</p> \n<p>Breaking the Silence's Avner Gvaryahu tells Levy that he would read his articles while patrolling the West Bank as he served in the IDF. Gvaryahu challenges U.S. Jews to invite them to synagogues and campuses.&nbsp;Levy says Israeli society is in such denial that it's disconnected from reality, and does not want to face the truth. Levy adds that Breaking the Silence is delegitimized in Israel because they tell the truth.</p> \n<p>Suhad Babaa, Executive Director at Just Vision: We ensure through &quot;disruptive media&quot; that human rights work gets out into the world. Babaa adds that the U.S. community needs to see and recognize that Israelis and Palestinians are sacrificing and working.&nbsp;Sfard says that he has some issues with the BDS movement, but it must be acknowledged as a &quot;non-violent legitimate means of resistance.&quot;</p> \n<p>Kasbari says the Oslo Accords are a failure and must be scrapped. She says after being fooled for 20 years, the Palestinian Authority is not accountable and Israel should be responsible.

'Beyond negotiations: Can the peace process be unfrozen to achieve more than 'conflict management?'</p> \n<p>Haaretz Editor-in-chief Aluf Benn asks the panel if the two-state paradigm is over.&nbsp;Zionist Union MK Merav Michaeli says that most Israelis are ignorant about Palestinians and the territories, and scared by the hardcore lies of the Israeli right-wing media.</p> \n<p>Benn asks: Why the Israeli left failed to talk about the two-state solution during the election as elequently as Tzipi Livni just did?&nbsp;Michaeli says the Israeli left must find a way back to power, and the two-state solution will re-emerge like magic.</p> \n<p>J Street founder and President Jeremy Ben Ami says we must stop talking about the dead or damaged peace process, saying it only does the left harm.&nbsp;Dr. Husam Zomlot, Ambassador at Large and Director of Foreign Relations Commission, Fatah, says talk of a one-state solution is most damaging to Palestinians, adding that removal of 1967 lines will remove the illegality of settlements.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Zomlot says that the UN is a legitimate tool of non-violence for Palestinians, just like boycotts and non-violent demonstrations in West Bank and East Jerusalem. He adds that Netanyahu and Yigal Amir each&nbsp;each killed key opportunity moments for peace.</p> \n<p>Dr. Robert M. Danin, Council on Foreign Relations, former head of the Jerusalem mission of the Quartet, says &quot;I am a serial peace processor, for better or for worse.&quot;&nbsp;Danin says that Israeli actions as palliatives to beautify the occupation don't work and make situation worse. He asks: How can a Palestinian leader deliver on a deal when there is hardline Hamas opposition?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Danin notes that &quot;peace process&quot; has become a toxic phrase. He says people on the ground must be convinced that occupation will actually end - diplomacy in sync with actual de-occupation.</p> \n<p>Michaeli says she cannot support or invite sanctions, since it's too easy to be accused of treason in Israel these days.&nbsp;Zomlot&nbsp;says that a privileged society will never give up its privileges voluntarily, adding that there are consequences to occupation, murder with impunity.</p> \n<p>Michaeli says that Israel isn't the only racist player and that we cannot ignore Palestinian incitement, adding that it's no good only blaming one side.&nbsp;She adds that we can't keep fighting over who's more right and who's more the victim.</p> \n<p>Danin says the U.S. must demonstrate bolder leadership in the conflict, and that sanctions and boycotts are tactics without strategy that don't lead toward a national aim for Palestinians.</p> \n<p>6:12 P.M.

So what's the alternative?&quot;</p> \n<p>Erekat says &quot;we might not be able to achieve a two-state solution tomorrow, but Israelis and Palestinians have no other option.&quot; Erekat welcomes the EU decision to label settlement products, and says Israel should recognize the state of Palestine before any other state. He acknowledges that mistake are made, saying that &quot;sometimes it's hard to differentiate between freedom of speech and incitement.&quot; He adds that the Palestinian leadership is &quot;trying to fix it.&quot;</p> \n<p>Erekat vows that &quot;Israel has a partner on the basis of a Palestinian state with the '67 borders and East Jerusalem as its capital.&quot; He says Palestine will accept limitations on arms and military, but won't accept limitations on dignity. Erekat says the era of U.S.-brokered bilateral negotiations is over, adding that Obama and Kerry have done everything possible.</p> \n<p>Erekat criticizes ISIS, saying they are criminals and thugs who have nothing to do with Islam. He predicts the Arab world will need &quot;30 to 50 years&quot; to restabilize from the current chaos, while calling for democracy in the Arab world and Israeli-Palestinian peace to defeat ISIS. Erekat adds there is no difference between ISIS and the Jewish terrorists who burned the Dawabshe family in Duma.</p> \n<p>6:00 P.M. Tzipi Livni criticizes U.S. for not challenging Israeli, Palestinian leaders to make decisions on peace</p> \n<p>Zionist Union MK Tzipi Livni begins her remarks by praising Rivlin's participation. Livni comments that &quot;'peace' became a dirty word&quot; during Israel's 2015 elections, saying that &quot;peace&quot; has become &quot;something the left gives to the Arabs.&quot;</p> \n<p>Livni cautions that &quot;democracy&quot; will become a dirty word in the next elections since &quot;it's something the Israeli left gives to Israeli Arabs.&quot; She accuses Netanyahu of seeing all his political rivals as &quot;enemies,&quot; along with Israeli Arabs, the media and human rights NGOs. Livni calls for the creation of &quot;a new and stronger camp in Israel as an ideological alternative.&quot;</p> \n<p>Livni adds that her vision will always be securing Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, but not on all the land of Israel. Livni says that &quot;Judaism for me is a national matter and not a religious matter,&quot; adding that &quot;my destination in the national GPS is a Jewish and democratic state that lives in peace with the Palestinians.&quot;</p> \n<p>Livni warns that the alternative to a two-state solution is a &quot;bloody binational state.&quot; Livni criticizes Breaking the Silence, saying the place to voice their reports are with Israeli authorites, as well as the settlements, saying they &quot;harm Israel's security and erode its legitimacy.&quot;</p> \n<p>Livni criticizes the United States for not putting their framework for peace on the table and challenging Israeli and Palestinian leaders to make decisions.</p> \n<p>5:35 P.M.&nbsp;Rivlin says military alone will not protect Israel, praises Haaretz as 'beacon for freedom of expression' </p> \n<p>Israeli President Reuven Rivlin has warm words for Haaretz, a newspaper that he said he has read for 70 years, beginning with the children’s version of the newspaper he read in his youth, despite the fact that his right-wing Likud politics was far from the editorial line of the newspaper, saying that Haaretz “carries great value.”</p> \n<p>“All these years I read Haaretz to learn what people who do not share my opinion think,” he says.</p> \n<p>“I am often annoyed and angry by what I read and I insist on reading the paper again and again. Haaretz is not only about news, it's a beacon for freedom of expression in Israel.”</p> \n<p>“In times of right-wing coalitions and left-wing coalitions, Haaretz always remained in the opposition. It criticized both sides. Being in the opposition is not an easy job. Most of my youth I belonged to the opposition - to the wrong side.”</p> \n<p>He declares that “without a live and kicking opposition, our democracy is worth little. I am here today because I believe that the free market of ideas is a holy principle.”</p> \n<p>Rivlin praises the Israel Defense Forces, saying that &quot;from time to time, the obvious should be said: the IDF does everything to keep the highest moral standards possible,&quot; adding that &quot;we are very proud of the IDF, a moral army to whom we owe our existence.&quot; Rivlin also praises Obama, saying that &quot;while we may have different views on the Palestinian issue, his commitment to a secure Israel is beyond question.&quot; READ FULL STORY </p> \n<p>5:31 P.M. In a video address to the HaaretzQ: with NIF conference in New York, U.S. President Barack Obama said that peace is the only way that Israel can remain a Jewish and democratic state.

Sokatch sayd &quot;we are not a marginal movement,&quot; and although the Israeli left is &quot;demonized&quot; in Israel, he remains &quot;proud and grateful for Haaretz's voice. Sokatch concludes by calling on all to &quot;rededicate ourselves to strengthething Israeli democracy.&quot;</p> \n<p>5:20 P.M. Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken speaks of Haaretz's history as a Zionist publication, &quot;supporting the founding and strengthening of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.&quot; Schocken adds that Haaretz continues to stay committed to democracy, in contrast to the settler vision.</p>",

        "text":["<p>At the small mixed-gender training room of the Nafha center for Hebrew and Israeli studies, six students of various ages have gathered. “Me’ayin is the Hebrew word for ‘from where,’” the teacher, Ahmed Alfaleet, explains. Alfaleet, the head of the center, was once a prisoner in Israeli jails.</p> \n<p>The 42-year-old was one of the more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners exchanged for abducted soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011; after he was freed, he decided to take on the challenge of spreading the Hebrew language in Gaza. After all, it’s so important, and so few people know it.</p> \n<p>Alfaleet, who was sentenced to a life term for killing an Israeli in 1992 at the Kfar Darom settlement in central Gaza, served 20 years. In prison, he earned both a bachelor’s and master’s degree from the Open University of Israel.</p> \n<p>“After I was released, I worked as a Hebrew-language trainer in various academic institutes for three years until I decided to open this center in April 2015,” he says. “I’m very much convinced Gaza should have such a specialized center.”</p> \n<p>Released prisoners now represent the cultural bridge between Israelis and the more than 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza. But since the second intifada erupted in 2000, Israel has stopped letting in thousands of workers from the enclave.</p> \n<p>Alfaleet says Gaza is connected to Israel whether people like it or not. “As an occupier, enemy or as neighbors, Israel exists next door to Gaza, so we have to deal with it,” he says.</p> \n<p>His more than 70 students in four classes are journalists, doctors and businesspeople who have to communicate with Israelis. He says he’s very satisfied with the results; most of his students now speak Hebrew fluently.</p> \n<p>Some of these students were fellow prisoners; they felt they had to start businesses when they were freed, and they were buoyed by the monthly stipend they received from the Palestinian Authority when they were in prison.</p> \n<p>Some opened restaurants and others focus on the Israeli-Palestinian cultural side. Some even work as experts on Israeli issues.</p> \n<p>Nafha is the only institute to specialize in both Hebrew and Israeli studies, but it’s not the only one to be launched by a released prisoner. The Atlas Center for Israeli Studies was opened by Abdulrahman Shehab, a 48-year-old affiliated with Islamic Jihad who was released at the same time as Alfaleet.</p> \n<p>Atlas is the only institute in Gaza that translates Hebrew-language news on a website daily. Shehab, who was 19 when he was sentenced to 35 years and served 23 years, finished high school in prison, where he went on to earn a bachelor’s and master’s.</p> \n<p>“I had to use the time of my life I was denied in a better way,” he says. “I spent my years there learning and studying without stopping for a day.”</p> \n<p>In prison, Shehab would watch Israeli TV and realized that Palestinian officials knew little about Israeli society. But Israeli officials knew much more about Palestinian society.</p> \n<p>‘’I wasn’t sure I’d ever be released, but I always thought that if I left I would use all the education I got in raising the awareness of people in Gaza about the Israeli occupation,’’ Shehab says.</p> \n<p>He says he has two goals; one is being done: To translate Hebrew media into Arabic so Palestinians can know more about what Israelis are thinking and planning. The other is to write in Hebrew for an Israeli audience so the Palestinian voice can reach Israelis directly “without makeup and advertising.”</p> \n<p>In Alfaleet’s class, 22-year-old Ibraheem Omar sports a long beard and a long djellaba robe. He says in fluent English he’s very keen to learn Hebrew.</p> \n<p>“I love languages and I’ve always wanted to learn Hebrew, not only because it’s the language of the enemy but also because languages make you better able to understand different cultures around the world,” he says.</p> \n<p>People in Gaza were more open to Israelis in the past; Israeli TV channels 1 and 10 were the stations most watched in the Strip. Also, it was a tradition to listen to the daily bulletin on Israel Radio’s Arabic service.</p> \n<p>Back then, thousands of workers served as a bridge between the two communities, but now the young generations appear to know little about each other, viewing the other as aliens.</p> \n<p>Ahmed Abu Eyada, a 22-year-old journalism student, says he’s learning Hebrew to help him in his career. “You can’t be a journalist in Gaza without understanding the Israeli media,” he says.</p>",

        "text":["<p>To open a restaurant in Jerusalem is always a bold move. Given the security situation in the city during the past year, some might say it’s even a bit crazy. It certainly isn’t any easier if the eatery isn’t kosher (after all, this is still the Holy City). And it’s even more difficult – or, at the very least, more challenging – when two young women are the owner-chefs. But launching such a place is exactly what Rinat and Alice Moyal, who are married, went and did – against all the odds.</p> \n<p>The two opened their restaurant, Rina &amp; Alice, on 38 Keren Hayesod Street before the “lone wolf” attacks in the city began late last year.</p> \n<p>“It was after Operation Protective Edge [in 2014], but before the mess with the random stabbings began, which we couldn’t possibly have predicted, and from which the city has yet to recover,” Alice says.</p> \n<p>Despite the pessimistic forecasts and the still-tense security situation, which have been keeping some people off the streets and out of restaurants, the two actually display cautious optimism. And perhaps they have good reason to look at the glass and see it more than half-full: After all, they are only 25 and already have a restaurant, and indeed a vision of their own, which they are realizing with an unusual humility that seems to belie the inherent defiance of two young women who are married to each other and running a nonkosher restaurant in the middle of Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>They get insulted if you call it “a lesbian restaurant&quot;; it’s a restaurant for everyone, they say. And although a rainbow-striped pride flag has recently been hung inside, they aren’t brandishing it outside. And no, they don’t plan to move to Tel Aviv, even though they’re repeatedly asked whether they will do so.</p> \n<p>As if the restaurant weren’t enough to occupy these two young chefs (who, incidentally, prefer to be called “cooks”), the two talk openly about the big dreams they have for the future, which include, in addition to the business (or afterward), a family, children, a small German Shepherd, a flock of sheep and a small house in the Arava, down south – “or in the Galilee, or maybe even New Zealand or Australia.”</p> \n<p>Stove-side romance</p> \n<p>Rinat and Alice met nearly five years ago, in the kitchen of the Adom restaurant, a beloved Jerusalem institution. “When I first came to Adom, Rinat already had established herself there,” Alice recalls. “She was like a shark in the kitchen and I felt like a small fry in comparison, like some other new, dumb cook. Moreover, she was intimidating. At first she seemed like the devil incarnate and on my first day there I prayed not to cross her path.”</p> \n<p>But her prayers were not answered, and on that first day the first person to greet her when she entered the kitchen was Rinat. As time passed, the fear turned into attraction, and scary and threatening person became friendly and pleasant.</p> \n<p>Alice: “There was a moment, when she was apparently not stressed out. I remember her standing next to the grill, in profile, and her threatening appearance just dissipated. Suddenly there was a young woman before me who was relaxed, smiling and sweet. And so pretty.”</p> \n<p>Rinat remembers it all a little differently: “Her first impression was correct. I really did think she was another new, slightly dumb cook. Maybe it was because she kept asking me trivial questions like 'Where’s the sugar?' Or, 'Where do they put the flour here?' – when it was all right in front of her. I couldn’t figure out what was with her.”</p> \n<p>Only later did it occur to Rinat that Alice was simply flirting with her. Eventually, the two decided to go out for a beer at Taklit, a bar that didn’t manage to survive the downturn in the city and closed recently. “And the rest is history,” Rinat says.</p> \n<p>“Even after Rinat left Adom, fate somehow brought us back to one another, even work-wise,” Alice continues, smiling.</p> \n<p>The two met up in the kitchens of other local restaurants, including Trattoria Haba, near the Mahaneh Yehuda market, and Sapori, an Italian restaurant located a short distance away from Mishkenot Sha’ananim – which was eventually replaced by their own restaurant, Rina &amp; Alice. Asked why she calls herself “Rina” in the restaurant’s name, she says, “Rina is easier to say.”</p> \n<p>The restaurant, the two say, speaks their language – with a Jerusalem dialect – and brings their childhood landscapes and personal connection with each other to the table – “with all our heart and soul.” All this is manifest in the dishes they invented or that symbolize milestones in their lives, as well as in the recipes that they’ve collected, invented or adapted (“in our secret notebook”) along the way.</p> \n<p>One dish that illustrates the way their personal story has made its way to the menu is the salmon fillet, which comes on a bed of sweet potatoes baked with salt, and a green salad with a shallot vinaigrette.</p> \n<p>“The secret is in the crust covering the fish,” says Rinat. “This is a dish that we added to the menu almost at the last minute, and was created when Alice got up one morning with a strange craving for salmon.”</p> \n<p>Alice: “Rinat offered to make it; she went into the kitchen and the pantry and combined all kinds of things, improvising on the spot, to the point where it was hard to remember later exactly what she’d put in it. It went into the oven and it came out simply amazing, a delicacy.</p> \n<p>&quot;In retrospect, it’s a good thing that I took a note pad and jotted down everything she added. We knew that one day, when we’d have a restaurant, this dish would star in it. Still, when we were putting together the menu, we asked each other: ‘Are we prepared to come out with such a bombastic thing?’ And the answer in the end was yes.”</p> \n<p>Today, the salmon, which is coated with poppy seeds (“and other secret ingredients that even the cooks don’t know”), is one of the restaurant’s flagship dishes, alongside offerings including eggplant served on a small foccacia baked in the restaurant’s tabun oven; hummus made from lima beans; Camembert cheese with Indian chutney spilling out of it; and purple calamari in butter with whiskey cream, with potatoes with lemon and coriander – and foccacia on the side of course, “because there’s a lot of sauce and Jerusalemites love to dunk and wipe it up,” they explain.</p> \n<p>No talk of God</p> \n<p>There are Jews, Muslims and Christians working side-by-side in the&nbsp;Rina &amp; Alice kitchen, where the rule is: No talking about God.</p> \n<p>“Let them talk politics, about the occupation, about the territories – let them talk about Bibi and Sara [Netanyahu] for all we care, but not about God,” says Rinat, adding, “You can argue about everything, except when it comes to religion. There are no winners in religious wars.”</p> \n<p>Along with that topic, another less sublime subject that is not talked about is recipes. “When you work by your gut you don’t need a recipe,” they say. This is an approach they are trying to convey to their kitchen staff – some of whom, by the way, are youth at risk whom the owners have taken in from nearby hostels.</p> \n<p>“The idea is to work with your gut and your heart, to learn by trial and error, and not to be afraid to fail along the way, as long as you try,” they say.</p> \n<p>As an everyday example, Alice and Rinat talk about what one can learn from the preparation of a vinaigrette dressing – how to taste it, how to balance the flavors and make adjustments when necessary, “and from there, to take it to other places.”</p> \n<p>This is the theory and the reality of the Moyals' life in a nutshell. First and foremost, “Everything must come from love,” says Rinat. “Cooking is the only profession in the world that you have to love in order to work in it. That’s why we’re here, that’s why we opened a restaurant despite the situation in Jerusalem. And besides, if you can keep God out of the kitchen, surely you can get him out of other places as well.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>JTA - The successful chef and owner of four buzzy restaurants in Manhattan, Einat Admony recently decided to take on a new challenge.</p> \n<p>The Israeli-born chef, who runs two Taim falafel joints and modern Mediterranean eateries Balaboosta and Bar Bolonat, wanted to create a casual spot where the focus was on small plates and wine.</p> \n<p>She considered fusing her signature Sephardic Israeli food with Mexican cuisine, but decided that Spanish food would be a better complement — thanks largely to its overlapping ingredients like tomatoes, saffron, olives and olive oil.</p> \n<p>The result is Combina, which opened to strong reviews this fall.</p> \n<p>“I just really like Spanish food and the tapas style,” Admony told JTA.</p> \n<p>She’s no expert on Iberian food, she says. Instead, she’s doing her “signature Israeli food with a Spanish twist.” Dishes include Mujadara Paella (a spin on the Lebanese and Spanish dishes) and Sabich Tostada, a melding of the Israeli/Iraqi and Mexican sandwiches.</p> \n<p>If it sounds innovative, it is. But Admony is but one of many chefs across the U.S. who are pioneering inventive — and truly modern — ways to merge Jewish and Israeli food with other cuisines from around the world.</p> \n<p>In Los Angeles, we’re seeing dishes like pastrami quesadillas at fast food Mexican spot J&amp;S. &nbsp;In Seattle, a food truck called Napkin Friends serves “latke press sandwiches” in decidedly non-kosher varieties like a BLT. In New York and San Francisco, you can order Kung Pao Pastrami at Mission Chinese Food. And El Nosh, a Puerto Rican-Jewish food mash-up that started as a food truck in California, threw a pop-up event in New York as recently as October.</p> \n<p>“Jewish cuisine is about taking the long way around and cooking food that is real and homey,” says Laura Frangiosa, owner of The Avenue Delicatessen in suburban Philadelphia, which merges Italian and Jewish foods. “And those are all trends that are popular in dining these days.”</p> \n<p>The Avenue — which isn’t in a particularly Jewish neighborhood, notes Frangiosa — serves Italian-style subs topped with schmaltz aioli, Jewish wedding soup — a take on the classic Italian wedding soup, with veal meatballs and matzo balls — &nbsp;and reuben arancini, rice balls stuffed with corned beef and Swiss cheese.</p> \n<p>Jewish food appeals to the masses, says Macy Hart, president of the Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life. He points out that many Southern towns with tiny Jewish communities host popular Jewish food events that are attended almost entirely by non-Jews.</p> \n<p>“Little Rock, Arkansas, for example, has an Israeli food festival that people flock to,” he says.</p> \n<p>Hart sees it as no surprise, then, that “Jewish-slash-something else” food is becoming popular around the country. “It’s a natural progression of the palate,” he says.</p> \n<p>Just as traditional Jewish and Israeli dishes are drawing non-Jewish crowds, these inventive, internationally flavored updates can increase the appeal of classic Jewish food to younger members of the tribe.</p> \n<p>“It’s about progression, about tapping into the next generation,” says Steve Auerbach, former owner of the now-closed Stage Deli in New York. “Millennials have new tastes, and those are the ones these chefs are going after. It’s about keeping it current. Young Jews want the occasional corned beef sandwich and potato pancake, but they want something new.”</p> \n<p>And in big cities like New York and Los Angeles, where most of these fusion restaurants are cropping up, many customers may well have grown up eating one, or both, of these cuisines.</p> \n<p>For many of these fusion chefs — like Frangiosa, who is Italian and married to a Jewish man — the blending of two disparate cuisines is personal. Take Aaron Israel and Sawako Okochi’s Shalom Japan, a Jewish-Japanese restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. They’ve been serving dishes like matzo ball ramen and a lox bowl with rice, cucumber and Japanese pickle since 2013 — usually to a packed house.</p> \n<p>Israel says they get a lot of customers who are like them; one is Asian and the other is Jewish. And while Shalom Japan has been hailed for its ingenuity — “At its best, their food is fusion in the truest sense, seamless and utterly convincing,” according to &nbsp;the New Yorker &nbsp;— &nbsp;such culinary blending is a tradition that long precedes them, he says.</p> \n<p>“Jewish people went from place to place and adapted the flavors of new places to their cuisine,” says Israel. “That’s the whole history of Jewish food.”</p> \n<p>Hasia Diner, a professor of Hebrew and Judaic studies and history at the NYU Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, agrees. “It was always fusion,” she says. “Throughout history, Jews created food that reflected the ingredients available to them, and the climate and style of the people around them. And given the ubiquity of Jewish migration, they were always picking up and moving and getting new styles.”</p> \n<p>This culinary adaptability made them “culinary cosmopolitans,” Diner says, pointing out that as far back as the late 1800s, Jewish cookbooks featured recipes for Italian food and Chinese food.</p> \n<p>“Nowadays it’s just more self conscious and a little ironic,” she adds.</p> \n<p>The history of Jewish-Spanish food is of particular interest to chef and restauranteur Alex Raij. Raij is Jewish and her husband, Eder Montero, is Spanish; they already ran two successful tapas restaurants in Manhattan when they opened La Vara in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, in 2011. Through La Vara, Raij explores the Moorish and Jewish legacies of Spanish cooking.</p> \n<p>Rajj says she likes to imagine the kinds of foods that would have thrived had Spain’s Jews been able to stay. Many of the traditional Spanish sauces — like the pepper-based romesco — have their origins in Moorish and Jewish foods, she says.</p> \n<p>Not far away, in Williamsburg, “Top Chef” alum Ilan Hall recently opened Esh, an Israeli-style barbecue spot. Esh takes the place of The Gorbals, a Scottish-Jewish fusion restaurant Hall opened in Los Angeles in 2009 and in New York in 2014. “That was a representation of my childhood,” says Hall, whose father is Scottish and mother is Israeli.</p> \n<p>For his new venture, he decided to stick to more straightforward, Israeli-style grub, something he says is undeniably popular these days — witness the success of Admony’s empire, as well as that of Philadelphia chef Michael Solomonov’s popular, inventive restaurants. Hall says he will be using some Texas-style barbecuing techniques.</p> \n<p>“This food is healthy and simple,” he says.</p> \n<p>For Richard Kimmel, owner of the the Lower East Side jazz bar and Jewish-soul food joint Kitty’s Canteen (in which Snoop Dogg is a creative partner), the fusion of soul food and Jewish cuisine started for generations ago.</p> \n<p>Kimmel, who founded the music venue The Box, is the grandson of Kitty Kimmel - a bookkeeper at a talent agency who used to cook for the jazz greats of the 1930s. Her food, which began as traditionally Jewish, became influenced by soul food, says Kimmel.</p> \n<p>Kitty’s Canteen and its recent spinoff, Kitty’s-a-Go-Go, serve matzoh-meal fried chicken and and their signature “Bisgel,” a bagel-biscuit hybrid, which Kimmel says was born when Dizzy Gillespie poked a hole in one of Kitty’s biscuits.</p> \n<p>“The combination of Jewish food and soul food is very natural to me. It’s my life,” says Kimmel. “Like jazz, it’s something of an improvisation, but both foods are literally meant to warm your soul. That’s a sentiment we share.”</p>",

        "text":["<p> The Tel Aviv District Court on Sunday convicted Danny Biton, father of superstar pop singer Eyal Golan, of a series of serious sex crimes, including procuring for prostitution and for prostitution with minors. Biton confessed to the crimes, in accordance with the plea bargain signed with the State Prosecutor’s Office, and will serve a two-year prison sentence and pay compensation totaling 50,000 shekels ($12,500) to each of the three plaintiffs.</p> \n<p> Prosecutor Dalia Abramoff said all the injured parties had expressed their agreement to the plea bargain. At the prosecutor’s request, an order was issued forbidding Biton to leave the country. In the next proceeding on April 19, Abramoff and defense attorney Sasi Gez will try to convince the court to adopt the plea bargain.</p> \n<p> According to the indictment, Biton “used his family connection to Eyal to promote his standing among Eyal’s female fans and among his acquaintances, tricking the young fans and treating them disdainfully and with a humiliating attitude, as though they were objects to satisfy and serve him, including his sexual desires and those of his acquaintances. Biton used to invite the girls to meetings, boasting beforehand to his friends about his intention to have them provide sexual services, and would describe to them what sex acts would be done to the girls.”</p> \n<p> The indictment says Biton exploited the girls’ rough financial and social circumstances, which made them vulnerable. “The accused, who was aware of the girls’ admiration for Eyal and their complex personal, economic and family situation, bought their consent to provide sexual services for him and his acquaintances. In return he brought the girls to events in which Eyal participated, to his performances, to nightclubs, to Eyal’s home, and gave them rewards including small gifts such as cigarettes, jewelry, and cash,” according to the indictment.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Boxing great and cultural icon Muhammad Ali, who passed away on Friday aged 74, was known for his quick and darting technique in the ring and his ability, as he put it himself, to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That gift for stinging characterized Ali both in and outside the ring, where his quick tongue and stinging repartee made headlines no less than his fists - and sometimes with greater effect. He became a symbol for black liberation during the 1960s by standing up to the U.S. government and refusing to enlist to the army for religious reasons, famously saying: &quot;I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong. No Vietnamese ever called me a nigger.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>His conversion to Islam in 1964 - accompanied by a name change from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali - and his subsequent sympathy for Arab causes made Jews a frequent target of his silver tongue, even as several Jews were among his long-time supporters and admirers. It made for a complex relationship between the boxer and world Jewry. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When Ali made his triumphant comeback to the ring in Atlanta in 1970, after being out of action for 43 months on draft-evasion charges, he commented on the possibility of another bout with long-time rival Joe Frazier by saying: &quot;To those who might want it, the fight will come. All those Jewish promoters – they’ll see that it comes off.”</p> \n<p>Though a reporter said Ali was smiling as he said it, boxing insiders criticized him for insulting “the guys who went to bat for him” – specifically. Harry Markson, the boxing director of Madison Square Garden in New York, and Sam Massell, the mayor of Atlanta.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After announcing his retirement from the ring in 1974, Ali lost no time in throwing right hooks at Zionism and embracing the Palestinian cause. Talking to reporters in Beirut, Lebanon, at the start of a tour of the Middle East, Ali said that “the United States is the stronghold of Zionism and imperialism.”</p> \n<p>On a subsequent visit to two Palestinian refugee camps in southern Lebanon, the former heavyweight boxing champion was quoted by a news agency as saying: “In my name and the name of all Muslims in America, I declare support for the Palestinian struggle to liberate their homeland and oust the Zionist invaders.”</p> \n<p>Ali even visited Israel, coming to &quot;arrange for the freeing of the Muslim brothers imprisoned by Israel&quot; in 1985, when some 700 Lebanese Shi'ites were detained in the Atlit camp, against the background of the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ali wanted to discuss the release of &quot;all 700 brothers&quot; with the &quot;very highest level in the country,&quot; but Israeli officials politely declined to enter the ring.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 1980, during a visit to India to promote a boycott of the Olympic Games in Moscow after the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, Ali maintained that Zionists “control” America and the world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Asked for his thoughts on the Iranian hostage crisis by India Today, Ali denounced the Iranians as &quot;fanatics,&quot; but still managed to blame the Jews.</p> \n<p>&quot;Religion ain’t bad; it’s people who are bad,&quot; he said. &quot;You know the entire power structure is Zionist. They control America; they control the world. They are really against the Islam religion. So whenever a Muslim does something wrong, they blame the religion.”</p> \n<p>Despite his frequent jabs at the Jewish community and Israel, Ali couldn't seem to alienate some of his most fervent Jewish admirers, among them Hollywood star Billy Crystal.</p> \n<p>Crystal's 1977 impression of the boxing legend deciding to convert to Judaism and change his name to Izzy Yiskowitz became legendary on its own right. Fifteen years later, Ali had the pleasure of having Crystal perform at his 50th birthday party.</p> \n<p>Sportscaster Howard Cosell, born Howard Cohen, was perhaps Ali's biggest defender. Unlike many others, Cosell immediately called Ali by his new, Islamic name after he changed it from Cassius Clay, and also stood up for his right to resist the draft.&nbsp;The Jewish journalist and the Muslim champion had a rapport that was evident in post-fight interviews, where they exchanged barbs and bantered, drawing in enchanted viewers.</p> \n<p>Ali mellowed in his autumn years, perhaps partly due to becoming &quot;zaidy&quot; to a Jewish grandson, born to his daughter Khaliah Ali-Wertheimer and her husband Spencer Wertheimer. Ali was there to witness little Jacob Wertheimer &quot;becoming a man&quot; at Philadelphia’s Congregation Rodeph Shalom in 2012, and, according to his daughter, was nothing but respectful of the bar mitzvah ceremony.</p> \n<p>&quot;My father was supportive in every way. He followed everything and looked at the Torah very closely. It meant a lot to Jacob that he was there,” she said.</p> \n<p>But Ali expressed tolerance well before that, when in 1996, before lighting the Olympic flame at the Atlanta games, he declared: &quot;My mother was a Baptist. She believed Jesus was the son of God, and I don’t believe that. But even though my mother had a religion different from me, I believe that, on Judgment Day, my mother will be in heaven.</p> \n<p>&quot;There are Jewish people who lead good lives. When they die, I believe they’re going to heaven. It doesn’t matter what religion you are, if you’re a good person you’ll receive God’s blessing. Muslims, Christians and Jews all serve the same God. We just serve him in different ways.</p> \n<p>&quot;Anyone who believes in One God should also believe that all people are part of one family. God created us all. And all people have to work to get along.&quot;</p> \n<p>JTA contributed to this report</p>",

        "text":["<p>Peace must be on the verge of breaking out in the Middle East. Hamas is apparently just a political party that has resorted to terrorism solely because of &quot;the isolation of Gaza.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, &quot;Christians, Muslims and Jews are living peacefully together&quot; in Bethlehem (a Palestinian town where there are no Jews and the Christian population has been declining for decades).</p> \n<p>These are some of the geopolitical fantasies that emerged during last week's visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories by leaders of Italy's Five Star Movement, the anti-establishment party that has shaken Italian politics since it was founded in 2009 by Beppe Grillo, a popular comedian turned firebrand demagogue.</p> \n<p>And these gems of misinformation would be very comic indeed, had they not been pronounced by those who have a very good shot at leading the next government in what is one of Israel's closest European allies. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>And more than just sounding the alarm on Jerusalem's ties with Rome, the visit by the Five Star Movement can be taken as a symbol of the trouble awaiting Israel, Europe and the world at large as a tide of populist sentiment sweeps through western democracies and threatens to vote extremists from the left and right into power.</p> \n<p>Fresh off a victory in local elections last month, in which it won control of Rome and other major cities, the Five Star Movement is now polling above the ruling, center-left Democratic Party. According to the same polls, the movement's rising star, 30-year-old Luigi Di Maio, is Italy's most popular politician and is widely expected to make a run for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's job when national elections are held (at the latest in 2018, but you never know in Italy).</p> \n<p>The Five Star Movement leaped to success by vowing to fight corruption and replace the old political establishment, while embracing populist promises to take Italy out of the Eurozone and grant a minimum stipend to every Italian citizen. Its leaders are also known for supporting a number of bizarre ideas, ranging from conspiracy theories about vaccines (they’re against them) through airplane contrails (support for the &quot;chemtrail theory,&quot; that airplanes are secretly used to disseminate chemical agents) to the concept that the world is run by a secret cabal of bankers, financiers and politicians (yes, the Bilderberg Group).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sensing that power is now within its grasp, the party is trying to rebrand itself by toning down its more radical messages. The wild rants of its comedian founder, Grillo, may have become too much even for the most enthusiastic “grillini” – as his supporters are nicknamed. Grillo has repeatedly claimed that the CIA may have been involved in the September 11 attacks, railed against “Jewish Hollywood producers” and stated that a group led by a former Mossad agent controls all information about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that reaches Europe.</p> \n<p>While he remains the party's ideologue and conspiracy-theorist-in-chief, Grillo has faded slightly into the background, leaving the limelight to younger leaders like Di Maio, who serves as the vice president of the lower chamber of parliament and led the movement's delegation on its five-day Mideast visit.</p> \n<p>The tour was part of the party's strategy to present itself as a potential government force and was mainly geared for local consumption back home. After all, nothing projects statesmanship and foreign policy credibility as engagement in the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The trip was also supposed to at least partially redress and temper what so far has been the party's rather open hostility toward the Jewish state, which has gone beyond Grillo's conspiratorial remarks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>During the 2014 Gaza war, for example, Manlio Di Stefano, a former computer engineer who acts as the movement's point person for foreign policy, accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians and of launching the conflict to block the development of Gaza's marine gas fields. Speaking in parliament, he said Zionism was by definition discriminatory against minorities and called on the government to withdraw its ambassador and suspend all economic agreements with Israel.</p> \n<p>On a superficial level, the visit appeared successful in mending some fences. Di Maio, impeccably dressed in a suit and tie despite the July heat, ostensibly did and said all the right things. He and his followers, which included Di Stefano, met with Knesset members, visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and a memorial to Israeli victims of terror, condemned &quot;any terrorist actions by Hamas&quot; and declared their support for a two-state solution, while calling for renewed dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On the other side, while touring Palestinian towns and refugee camps, they pledged that a Five-Star government would officially recognize the State of Palestine, condemned the separation wall and settlements in the West Bank and denounced Israel's refusal to grant the delegation a permit to visit Gaza.</p> \n<p>But there were too many slipups, gaffes and bizarre remarks to convince anyone that the professions of neutrality, of &quot;we are just here to listen and learn&quot; were anything but prepared remarks force-fed to the reluctant politicians by some PR strategist back home.</p> \n<p>When asked by Haaretz about his 2014 &quot;genocide&quot; remarks, Di Stefano said he stood by them, but added that they had been made &quot;in a particular moment, in which we were witnessing the death of 2200 people in the bombing of Gaza.&quot; (Apparently it's OK to talk to genocidal regimes, as long as they are not committing genocide right now.) Speaking to the Italian daily La Stampa, he went on to qualify the condemnation of Hamas by saying that only its actions were terroristic, while the group itself &quot;was born as a party that won free elections. Then, the isolation of Gaza changed things.&quot; (Hamas was founded in 1987, long before Israel blockaded the Gaza Strip, and its charter called for the destruction of Israel from the get go.)</p> \n<p>Di Maio, when repeatedly asked whether Israel had a right to defend itself if attacked by terrorist groups (such as rocket launches by Hamas), refused to be pinned down, saying such that such questions were &quot;hypothetical.&quot; And finally, the potential future prime minister of Italy waxed lyrical on his Facebook profile about the above-mentioned nonexistent Jewish community of Bethlehem.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Beneath their skin-deep neutrality, the visiting &quot;grillini&quot; (barely) concealed a deep-seated mistrust of Israel, while displaying a willingness to listen to and believe anything they heard from the Palestinian side, to the point of propagating grotesque distortions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While they may not necessarily implement all of Di Stefano's recommendations from 2014, this bias makes it unlikely that a future government led by the Five Star Movement will have anything close to the friendly relationship that Israel enjoys today with Rome.&nbsp; &nbsp; Ultimately, the &quot;grillini&quot; – who have been snapping up votes from across the political spectrum – will say and do what their core supporters will demand, on the Middle East or anything else. And, looking at the broader picture, that's really the main problem with all these populist, anti-establishment parties that have been gaining currency in the West. For these groups, the (perceived) will of the people trumps everything else, to the point that facts, figures and reality itself must be molded to fit what the voters want to hear.</p> \n<p>That's how the &quot;grillini&quot; can convince many Italians they will be better off without the Euro, because that feeds off the resentment over austerity measures that are seen as imposed by Germany and successfully deflects any responsibility for the country's troubles from Italy's own dysfunctional economy.</p> \n<p>That's how the right-wing U.K. Independence Party (which shares a caucus with the Five Star Movement in the EU Parliament) helped carry the day for Brexit in the recent UK referendum on EU membership by promising to transfer to the National Health System millions of pounds that did not exist.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And this is how Donald Trump gets away with his outlandish statements, which, as a recent analysis by the AP put it, often &quot;make only passing acquaintance with reality.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When facts become putty in the hands of demagogues; when politics and governments slip from reality into the Twilight Zone, human rights, freedoms and all that we hold dear in a democracy are likely to quickly follow suit. Neither Jews, nor Israel, nor the rest of the world are likely to thrive in such an environment.</p> \n<p>Ariel David is a Tel Aviv-based reporter for Haaretz and other English-language publications.

        "text":["<p>A squad of about half a dozen cats patrols a small, overgrown cemetery in central Istanbul.</p> \n<p>“It’s a kind of magical place, right under our noses,” says Memo K&ouml;semen, a local artist and graveyard habitu&eacute;, surveying the small plot of land.</p> \n<p>But something’s caught his eye and suddenly he’s crestfallen. He bends down and hoists a freshly smashed tombstone, trying to fit the pieces back together. An older woman’s face, split in half and incised with a spider web of cracks, gapes up at him. This is one of the special ones, K&ouml;semen quickly realizes; one of them, the D&ouml;nme.</p> \n<p>The shattered tombstone seems sadly symbolic of a small, secretive society founded during the Ottoman Empire but cruelly stigmatized with bombastic conspiracy theories and forced to assimilate into the subsequent Turkish republic or conceal their true identities.</p> \n<p>Today, the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party, known as the AKP under its Turkish acronym, do not just control of the government; after defeating the recent attempted military coup, its leaders are feeling empowered. Their push to bring Sunni Islam ever closer into public life in Turkey has intensified, making many religious minorities, including descendants of the D&ouml;nme, feel ostracized.</p> \n<p>As one of the few D&ouml;nme members still living in Turkey put it, “They’re trying to force everyone to become a type of Sunni Muslim.”</p> \n<p>In 1665 the Jewish prophet Nathan of Gaza proclaimed the arrival of a Messiah who would lead the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel back to the Holy Land “riding on a lion with a seven-headed dragon in his jaws.” The anointed man was a 39-year-old Sephardic Jewish Kabbalist from Ottoman Izmir, Sabbatai Zevi.</p> \n<p>Within a year Zevi was the adored object of one of the largest messianic movements in history, with followers across the Ottoman Empire and Europe. But in 1666 he was imprisoned and accused of sedition by Ottoman authorities wary of his growing influence. Even then, his legions of adherents only seemed to grow. After several months in prison Zevi was brought before the Sultan in Edirne and forced to choose between death and conversion to Islam.</p> \n<p>To the horror of his acolytes, he converted and, in return, received honors and a generous stipend from the Sultan. Most of Zevi’s followers abandoned him, but about 300 families, believing his actions to be divinely ordained, converted with him. Moreover, after his conversion Zevi retained and preached many of his old beliefs, and a new Kabbalist culture, slightly influenced by Sufism was born that eventually split into three distinct sects</p> \n<p>“They developed a very unique philosophy that separated them from regular Jewish mysticism and Sufism,” says Cengiz Şişman, a history professor at the University of Houston-CL and author of The Burden of Silence, a book about the D&ouml;nme.</p> \n<p>“For them, the Messiah has already come. He gave them the glad tidings, the good news, told them that for the time being you have to work hard to prepare yourself for the messianic age, and then I’ll come back again.”</p> \n<p>In Hebrew the community called themselves Ma’aminim – Believers. But in Turkish they became known as the D&ouml;nme, a word roughly meaning convert, but which can have a more negative connotation closer to turncoat.</p> \n<p>Zevi’s followers thrived in the Muslim Ottoman Empire where, unlike Spain during the Inquisition, authorities didn’t pry into the private religious lives of those they ruled. This was especially true in what became the D&ouml;nme heartland, Salonika, in what was then Ottoman-ruled Greece. There, the D&ouml;nme’s numbers reached about 15,000 by the early 20th century.</p> \n<p>They were an endogamous society, meaning they only married within their own community. The D&ouml;nme established their own neighborhoods, schools, courts, cemeteries and houses of worship. Many became very wealthy and well-educated, pioneering the newest innovations in many fields, such as education, architecture, urban reform and commerce.</p> \n<p>But with the establishment of the Turkish republic in 1923, the D&ouml;nme were counted as Muslims and included in a forced population exchange between Greece and Turkey. They were brought to Istanbul and lost almost all their wealth. Moreover, despite the avowed secularism of the young, fervently nationalistic republic, the D&ouml;nme didn’t fit into the state’s continued upholding of a religious component to Turkish identity. Turkishness was officially defined along lines of racial purity and Sunni Islam. Those outside this dual construct were often looked upon with hostility and suspicion, and seen as potentially disloyal.</p> \n<p>“Banished from Greece because they were Muslim, the D&ouml;nme were greeted in Turkey as if they were Jews,” explained historian Marc David Baer of the London School of Economics, in his 2010 book, “The D&ouml;nme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks.” “They were depicted as disloyal, sponging parasites who hoarded their wealth and did not sacrifice any part of their fortune for the sake of the nation.”</p> \n<p>In response, the D&ouml;nme assumed a very low profile, and in due time the pressure to assimilate led to an almost complete loss of culture among the group’s members.</p> \n<p>“After the establishment of the republic, any kind of minority was suspected, because they had two centuries of war and rebellion before that,” explained K&ouml;semen, who published a book about D&ouml;nme graves.</p> \n<p>Still, Turkey today continues to host a centuries-old, mostly Sephardic Jewish population of some 17,000 that has survived over many generations by adopting a low-key communal profile. Over the course of the Turkish Republic’s history, it’s suffered discrimination and occasional outbreaks of violence of its own, amid formal toleration. Today, its members report increased hostility tied to the ascent of the Islamist-oriented AKP and a period of strife between Turkey and Israel recently softened by a rapprochement.</p> \n<p>The D&ouml;nme, meanwhile, as so-called “crypto-Jews,” are clouded in mystery and misunderstanding. They are the frequent subject of conspiracy theories. Most Turkish writing on them is anti-Semitic pseudoscience. For example, the country’s highest selling book of 2007 falsely “accused” President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of being D&ouml;nme. Many Turks believe the D&ouml;nme are everywhere, seeing their conniving hands behind all sorts of evil deeds.</p> \n<p>“In people’s minds, these secret Jews or whatever are like bogeymen,” K&ouml;semen says.</p> \n<p>Many believe the D&ouml;nme went extinct after being assimilated into the republic, but in fact a small, highly secretive community still exists.</p> \n<p>In a quiet neighborhood on Istanbul’s Asian side, two middle-aged D&ouml;nme from different sects sip tea together.</p> \n<p>Cem speaks rapid-fire English with a flawless American accent, picked up from living in Michigan as a child and later New York. Osman is a hardcore fan of the local Fenerbah&ccedil;e football club and a wise-cracker, saying with a wink that the two have “unfortunately” been friends for over five years. He plays music on YouTube, calling himself a ‘D&ouml;nme DJ.’</p> \n<p>They chat for hours about D&ouml;nme history, the complex beliefs of the three sects, which traditionally don’t intermarry, and most of all, about discrimination against their communities. They both only agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity. They aren’t official representatives of the D&ouml;nme, and their views only represent themselves.</p> \n<p>“Throughout the decades, the D&ouml;nme saw many acts of injustice,” Osman said. For instance, they suffered from a crippling ‘wealth tax’ targeting non-Muslims from 1942 to 1944, and nationalists painted stars of David on D&ouml;nme houses.</p> \n<p>The two friends say that despite the historical prejudice, the D&ouml;nme believed in and in many ways embodied the ideals of Turkey’s founder Mustafa Kemal Atat&uuml;rk, such as secularism and enlightenment. Atat&uuml;rk’s hometown was in fact Salonika, and he went to a D&ouml;nme school, leading many conspiracy theorists to erroneously conclude that he himself was D&ouml;nme.</p> \n<p>“Atat&uuml;rk and our families had good ties,” Cem says. “He kind of looked favorably on us.”</p> \n<p>But both Osman and Cem insist that the D&ouml;nme have never felt more uncomfortable than they do under the country’s current rulers. The authoritarian AKP has established a new model of Turkish society – ‘New Turkey’ – with a restrictive national ideal based on being a publicly pious Sunni Muslim.</p> \n<p>“All of this previous oppression couldn’t create as much distress as the election of the AK Party,” Osman says, referring to Erdogan’s factional base.</p> \n<p>The Islamist-rooted AKP has pushed Sunni Islam ever closer into public life in Turkey. Politicians make constant references to Islam and slurs against religious minorities; the Sunni-focused religious ministry’s budget has more than quadrupled, and Islamic education has massively expanded, in order to “raise a pious generation,” in Erdoğan’s words. Erdoğan once attended an awards ceremony for Necip Fazl Ksak&uuml;rek, an Islamist writer who called for the expulsion of the D&ouml;nme and seizing of their possessions.</p> \n<p>Cem says the discrimination isn’t just against the D&ouml;nme. Anyone not fitting into the ‘New Turkey’ is made to feel unwelcome. Although the D&ouml;nme may be Turkey’s ultimate outsiders, about half the country doesn’t fit into the AKP’s New Turkey.</p> \n<p>“For them [] we’re not human. It’s not just because I’m a D-&Ouml;-N-M-E. Because I’m secular, I’m the enemy. Because I’m Western-leaning, I’m the enemy. Because I want democracy, human rights, I’m the enemy,” Cem says.</p> \n<p>Cem and Osman say there are only perhaps 2,000 D&ouml;nme left who haven’t completely lost their cultural and religious identities. Cem’s worried that one day the culture could be completely lost.</p> \n<p>“These things that could be salvaged, that could be saved, are being lost to history, and to the future generations.”</p> \n<p>Cem, whose sect is extremely secular, sees his D&ouml;nme identity as more cultural than religious.</p> \n<p>“Being D&ouml;nme for me is being part of the Sephardic culture,” he said, since their ancestors were Jews who fled persecution in Spain and Portugal in the late fifteenth century for the relative religious freedom of the Ottoman Empire. “It means an interest in the Kabbalah, because our ancestors were extremely involved with studying it. It means mysticism.”</p> \n<p>Osman, whose sect is more spiritual, explains what he means by mysticism.</p> \n<p>“[Imagine] you’re reading a book written in black ink. You should see the white ink behind the black ink. That’s what mysticism is.”</p> \n<p>Cem adds a little clarity.</p> \n<p>“There’s an open meaning, and there’s a meaning that’s secret. Trying to decipher the secret meaning is what mysticism is about,” he says, such as reinterpreting passages from the Torah and finding new symbolic meanings.</p> \n<p>The D&ouml;nme tradition of furtiveness comes not only from an effort to escape discrimination, but also for religious reasons. The members are obliged to secrecy according to the 18 Precepts – sort of their 10 Commandments. The secrecy also makes the religion more special and exclusive.</p> \n<p>However, Osman is open to speaking about his faith in the hopes of ending common misconceptions.</p> \n<p>“The more you hide and deny things, the more people start to make up nonsense about you, your community and your belief,” he says. “When your whole identity is secret, you leave the door open for this kind of subversion.”</p> \n<p>Still, for this story, at least, Osman insisted on keeping his identity secret. Turkey clearly still has a long way to go before everyone can feel comfortable expressing their own identity.</p> \n<p>For more stories, go to www.forward.com.

        "text":["<p>For a number of years I have argued that Israel’s internal differences — not only between Jews and Arabs, but among Jews — are so large that the country should be divided into cantons linked in a federative structure. Last year, with Haaretz’s Judd Yadid, I presented a detailed proposal on how such a cantonal structure could look.</p> \n<p>The first weeks of Benjamin Netanyahu’s new government show that such a proposal is timelier than ever. Barely sworn in, its statements, policy proposals and steps show that it might use its tenure, brief as it may be, to irreparably damage Israel’s democracy.</p> \n<p>I’d like to present an unorthodox explanation for why Netanyahu’s team is doing this, and why a federative structure might salvage Israel’s democracy.</p> \n<p>Deputy Defense Minister Eli Ben-Dahan has taken the Knesset podium to defend his ministry’s decision to provide separate buses for Jews and Palestinians in the West Bank. But the government halted this plan because it realized the catastrophic international repercussions of a step reeking of apartheid&nbsp;— even when rationalized by security measures — not because it considers the move grievously wrong. (Incidentally, the army was strictly against the separate bus policy.)</p> \n<p>Likud’s Tzipi Hotovely is deputy foreign minister, which, given that there is no foreign minister, means she is acting foreign minister. Hotovely has told the Foreign Ministry staff that Israeli ambassadors should tell foreign governments the truth — that God gave all of Israel to the Jewish people and therefore it is simply ours by right.</p> \n<p>The new culture minister, Miri Regev, has said she does not intend to allow art that harms Israel’s image. “If I need to censor something, I will,” she said.</p> \n<p>And the new justice, minister, Ayelet Shaked, has declared that governance must return to the people’s control by working toward the abolition of the Supreme Court’s ability to block legislation.</p> \n<p>Add to this that Netanyahu, who has kept the Communications Ministry under his personal command, has already taken steps to interfere with the press. For example, he is putting pressure on Channel 10, which he has tried to close down for a while now.</p> \n<p>Let me add the cherry from outside the coalition on the icing of this lovely cake: Yisrael Beiteinu leader Avigdor Lieberman, who single-handedly forced Netanyahu to form a coalition based on 61 MKs by not joining.</p> \n<p>He now attacks his former boss for having scheduled a meeting with Ayman Odeh, the leader of the United Arab List — a meeting required by democratic etiquette. Lieberman called on Netanyahu to cancel the meeting because it “legitimizes the fifth column operating in the Knesset.”</p> \n<p>Nothing in this potpourri of events should be surprising. The lamentations by Israeli liberals that the right has become racist and is trying to undermine democracy have been voiced for a long time — and for good reason.</p> \n<p>But lamentations won’t help; we need to look at the facts without blinking. Hotovely genuinely believes that God gave all of Israel to the Jews. Regev deeply believes that Israeli liberals harm Israel. And Ben-Dahan has explained his hierarchy of human beings from Jewish men to Jewish women and Jewish gays — all superior to gentiles.</p> \n<p>As for Lieberman, I’m less sure, as he’s more of a consummate manipulator than an ideologue. But his rabid attacks questioning Israeli Arabs as legitimate citizens certainly reflect a strong current in Israeli society, which is why he keeps voicing them.</p> \n<p>The right vs. ‘the white tribe’</p> \n<p>As a liberal I am entitled to despise the views of Ben-Dahan, Hotovely, Lieberman and Regev, but I am committed to safeguarding their right to hold them. Incidentally, I assume they despise my views, but they in turn are required to respect my freedom of thought and expression.</p> \n<p>Still, differences in core values even among Israel’s Jews have become so vast as to make it nearly impossible to live in the same polity. To safeguard Israel’s democracy, we need to get a deeper understanding for the reasons the right attacks democratic institutions.</p> \n<p>The right feels that these institutions have been used to impose the views of secular liberals, who judging from the composition of the Knesset, are a minority of about one-third of the country as reflected by Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni’s Zionist Union, Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid and Meretz.</p> \n<p>The mainstream press, the judiciary and academia are overwhelmingly liberal, so they are perceived as representing what is called “the white tribe.” They therefore no longer see liberal democracy’s values and institutions as impartial tools, but as the tools of the liberal Ashkenazi elites to impose their views on the majority.</p> \n<p>They do not realize that the liberal tradition since Thomas Hobbes has been devised as a structure that can enable groups with different beliefs to live in coexistence instead of perpetually threatening or fighting one another.</p> \n<p>But it turns out that liberal democracy has its limits; it can’t bridge yawning gaps between totally different cultures — and Israel seems to have arrived at such a stage. All groups feel that their way of life is threatened; we liberals have felt since Netanyahu’s first government in the 1990s that we must fight for the survival of our core principles. And much has been made of the fact that many young Israeli liberals prefer to live in Berlin because they can’t take it here anymore.</p> \n<p>But let’s not forget that the Hasidic Belz community last year threatened to leave Israel if its youngsters were forced to serve in the army, because this community genuinely feel that its way of life is threatened by military service.</p> \n<p>Traditionalist Mizrahim represented by Shas feel that a secular Ashkenazi elite tramples on their culture, beliefs and values. And Israeli Arabs, for very understandable reasons, feel that the country does not accord them a life of dignity and equality.</p> \n<p>What then can we do? We can continue Israel’s culture wars, wearing us all down and making us miserable. Or we can say it’s time to give some breathing space to one another.</p> \n<p>A federative structure of provinces that roughly reflects Israel’s core groups might do exactly that. The cantons should reflect existing cultural groups as well as possible, while as much power and financial resources as possible should be devolved to the regional governments. As in Switzerland, the United States and Germany, the federal government should only be entrusted with what the regional ones can’t possibly do on their own.</p> \n<p>Such a partition is less outlandish than it sounds. When it comes to education, Israel long ago acknowledged de facto that there is no sufficient common ground for coexistence. Four distinct education systems coexist in Israel: the secular, the religious-Zionist, the ultra-Orthodox (actually two ultra-Orthodox, one Ashkenazi and one Sephardi), and the Arab.</p> \n<p>In such a federative structure, Regev could fund whatever she wants in her own canton. Liberal artists could move a few kilometers away into the Aviv or Carmel provinces, where they could express themselves freely. Vice versa the many members of Naftali Bennett’s Habayit Hayehudi who are offended by homosexuality; they could easily move a few kilometers into Yehuda Province, where there would probably be no gay parties or parades.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>We could finally stop bickering about which rabbis can conduct weddings legally, whether you need a rabbi at all, whether pigs can be raised and pork sold, and whether you can sell leavened bread during Passover. The provinces would determine these issues based on their majorities; the federation would not be involved.</p> \n<p>I know that this proposal has scant chance of being implemented, and I have no illusion that it will solve all of Israel’s vast problems. But I mean it very seriously.</p> \n<p>Israelis are wary. Not only does Israel face genuine external threats in an environment that becomes more chaotic by the year, but Israelis feel that instead of finding a safe haven in their own country, they need to fight for their identities and way of life. While we can’t make the external threats go away, we might at least live and let each other live.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Eliot Spitzer is a very busy man nowadays. He resigned as governor of New York State eight years ago, after an embarrassing sex scandal, and has since become a real estate magnate after inheriting his late father Bernard’s business a year ago. In a highly competitive market where glitz is as critical as floor space and finish, Spitzer is out to put his stamp on the scene with a $700-million Brooklyn residential complex of three towers and mostly luxury apartments. “The project will define the Brooklyn skyline,” he boasts.</p> \n<p>For his showcase project, Spitzer chose Israeli architect Eran Chen, whose design looks like sculpted icebergs on the water.</p> \n<p>Spitzer hopes to attract people with deep pockets from Manhattan; the project is scheduled to be completed in about two years. Spitzer says he chose Chen because – surprisingly, in a city chockablock with large residential structures – he says there are few architects who know how to plan large residential buildings properly. “Eran is talented, he has a good reputation in the industry, he understands the combination of aesthetics and functionalism – and he’s not a prima donna,” Spitzer explains.</p> \n<p>Spitzer is by no means Chen’s only A-list client. Chen, 45, moved to New York from Israel in 2000. Today, he’s involved in the planning of about 50 buildings in the United States, most of them in New York. Fifteen have already been completed, about 20 are under construction and the rest in planning. His clients include large developers like the Simon Group, TF Cornerstone, JBG, Simon Dushinsky and Bruce Ratner. Chen also works with a number of Israeli developers who work in New York, including Yitzhak Tshuva, Ron Izaki and Gil Geva’s Tidhar Group.</p> \n<p>Despite the attractions and money in the U.S. market, Chen continues to work with Israelis. “Israeli entrepreneurs won’t work with someone just because it’s comfortable,” Chen tells MarkerWeek. “But if someone meets expectations and does good work and is also Israeli, it’s a winning combination for them. The relations between a developer and an architect are very intimate, and in effect we build dreams together.”</p> \n<p>Right now, Chen is working on buildings in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and London. In New York’s Bushwick neighborhood – an industrial area that has become a magnet for young artists – he’s planning a residential building with a huge park on the roof that’s big enough to include bike paths.</p> \n<p>In Soho, meanwhile, he’s planning a building for Israeli developer Izaki, owner of the IGI Group. Chen has planned rooms that look like they jump out from the core building and are floating in the air. The residents get to enjoy a near-360 degree view while their roof serves as a garden – amenities that usually belong to penthouses. “I wanted to integrate an intimate style in an area that has an industrial character,” explains Chen. “The modular facade begins with two floors of garden apartments with large windows. Each window is in a deeply inset aluminum frame. The overall composition creates intimacy on the one hand, and the power of an industrial building on the other.”</p> \n<p>According to Eldad Blaustein, who is in charge of IGI’s New York operations, “The squares that jump out of the building on upper floors take advantage of zoning rules that allow that. It’s creative and is a big bonus for the residents.”</p> \n<p>Chen’s name made the headlines recently after he designed an apartment in the Trump World Tower (next to the UN building) that is considered exceptional even in terms of New York luxury. The apartment, which belongs to an unnamed financier, comprises two huge apartments of a combined 2,000 square meters (about 21,500 square feet) on the 89th and 90th floors. The owner bought them at the height of the 2008 financial crisis for about $53 million, after they had been on the market for five years, and invested $67 million over four years building the interiors.</p> \n<p>The views capture nearly every inch of Manhattan. The library faces downtown and Wall Street, and from another room the panorama counts the Chrysler Building and Empire State Building. The floor is made of rare African wood and Italian marble. The apartment has a “dragon” shower with a flow of 500 gallons of water a minute.</p> \n<p>Chen’s role in a property that was over the top even by New York standards generated a lot of criticism, but it doesn’t affect him. “Some of the world’s most beloved monuments were built by wealthy people and became a symbol of the period – for good and ill. My job as an architect is to express the client’s desires and find expression for it in contemporary culture, not fight it. I wouldn’t be surprised if the apartment some day becomes a museum for contemporary art.”</p> \n<p>Another apartment designed by Chen also attracted attention – but this time because of its unique design rather than the price tag. The Neo-Romanesque-style building on a quiet street in Tribeca, previously used as a warehouse for liquor and pistachio nuts, belongs to a real estate mogul who purchased it on eBay from an artist. With a $3-million budget, Chen created a penthouse with an industrial patina, spread over three floors and 280 square meters.</p> \n<p>“The building was constructed of wood 130 years ago,” says Chen. ‘We wanted to leave the original wood exposed, in order to create a unique and authentic look, but we had to take into account the stringent fire safety rules. We took apart the old wooden beams, treated them and reassembled them.”</p> \n<p>McDonald’s changed his life</p> \n<p>Chen was born in Be’er Sheva and grew up in Rehovot. The dramatic change in his life took place when he went to study architecture at Bezalel – Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. “In professional terms, Bezalel changed my life and opened new horizons for me,” he says. During his third year, he met the McDonald’s franchisee in Israel. “They gave me an opportunity to plan a restaurant for them on Dizengoff Square in Tel Aviv, and a love story began between us. When I finished studying, I designed 30 restaurants for them.”</p> \n<p>Sixteen years ago, at age 30, he arrived in New York. “I wanted to do something new, and New York always amazed me,” he explains. “Everything happened much faster than I had thought. I joined Perkins Eastman, and the first building they asked me to help plan was in Israel, of all places – the Davidoff Cancer Center in Beilinson Hospital [in Petah Tikva].”</p> \n<p>After five years Chen became a partner and, among other things, represented the firm to Israeli developers.</p> \n<p>“As a young partner, I was looking for projects in Manhattan. It was during the real estate boom, when many Israeli developers entered the New York market. The first ones to give me a chance to plan a large building were Yitzhak Tshuva and Miki Naftali – The Grand Madison, a 12-story building on Fifth Avenue and 26th Street. It was a project to convert it into a residential building and we had to work with the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The project was successful, and slowly but surely I began to expand my ties with Israeli entrepreneurs.”</p> \n<p>Eight years ago, Chen left Perkins Eastman and started his own firm, ODA (for Office for Design &amp; Architecture): “The dream of every architect is to start an independent firm. Work in a large firm requires a lot of compromises in terms of design and quality, and I wanted to take my career in a new direction with a design orientation. In a way, the large architecture firms are like a big factory: They create high-quality buildings, but not necessarily with a statement or strong design message.”</p> \n<p>Chen went solo just as the 2008 financial crisis exploded and there were days when he considered giving up. By 2010, though, business began to pick up and has been soaring since. “Today, I’m limiting how fast we grow,” says Chen. “There’s a limit to how much you can grow. I want to be personally involved in projects and to ensure that there’s a positive atmosphere in the firm.”</p> \n<p>Like the Brooklyn project, Chen says the biggest opportunities now are to be found in the four New York boroughs outside of Manhattan. “Prices in the Williamsburg neighborhood [in Brooklyn] are already crazy, but in the distant neighborhoods you can find opportunities. Anything along a subway line has a potential for success. New York’s urban development depends on the subway lines – that’s how it is in Brooklyn, but also in Queens and The Bronx, too. There are distant areas that nobody talks about much, but they’re beginning to develop. We see the major developers buying land in The Bronx. The problem is that the banks aren’t eager to finance projects in those areas, because there are no precedents for large transactions in them and it’s hard to assess the value of the land.”</p> \n<p>What do you think about the large number of huge, narrow towers they’re building in the city?</p> \n<p>“It’s unavoidable. There are many rich people in the world, and for them New York is a safe place to put their money. And since an apartment on a high floor is considered a luxury, entrepreneurs will keep building towers.”</p> \n<p>How does your Israeli background affect your work?</p> \n<p>“My personal inspiration comes from my personal history. I’m proud of the fact that sometimes when I think about a building I want to plan, I imagine my childhood in Be’er Sheva or a village on Mount Gilboa. The real Israeli success is the building of cultural foundations that enable us to stand out not only in the field of technology, but also in the fields of construction, art, etc. We should all be proud of our culture. Israel has a social and cultural complexity that helps to consolidate a comprehensive view of life.”</p> \n<p>Don’t you ever feel like becoming an entrepreneur?</p> \n<p>“I was dragged into that once and I reached the conclusion that it’s better for me to stay in architecture.”</p> \n<p>And what about projects in Israel?</p> \n<p>“There’s talk all the time, but nothing comes of it. The truth is, I’m not looking simply to build in Israel. If I build in Israel – it has to be something special. I don’t want to jump at every opportunity that comes my way. So in the meantime there are only feelers.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>JTA&nbsp;– Nearly half the states in the country are considering legislation aimed at countering the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS, movement. But critics say some bills are cause for concern, either because they seek to legitimize&nbsp;Israeli settlements or go so far in punishing boycott supporters they infringe on constitutionally protected speech.</p> \n<p>Two states, Illinois and South Carolina, passed laws last year mandating state divestment from companies that boycott Israel,&nbsp;according to a list&nbsp;maintained by Americans for Peace Now. Another 11 states – Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Virginia – are considering similar laws. Kansas and Pennsylvania are debating legislation that would defund universities that participate in an Israel boycott. And another six states are considering or have adopted nonbinding resolutions condemning Israel boycotts.</p> \n<p>In all, 21 state legislatures have taken up bills concerning BDS. Proponents say the trend will intensify this year, as activists move to consolidate their gains by pushing laws in states that have already passed nonbinding resolutions condemning BDS.</p> \n<p>“Those states see what they’re doing now as a follow-up, as a successor,” said Eugene Kontorovich, a law professor at Northwestern University who has consulted with groups advancing anti-BDS legislation. “They’re implementing laws that use state contracting power to fight back against racism.”</p> \n<p>Liberal activists see a different motivation, describing the push as a stealth maneuver to reverse nearly 50 years of U.S. policy of not recognizing the the legitimacy of Israeli settlements. Americans for Peace Now says 19 of the 54 BDS laws that have been proposed since 2014&nbsp;extend penalties to those targeting only West Bank settlements. A bill&nbsp;adopted by the Indiana House of Representatives&nbsp;in January,&nbsp;for example, requires the state pension fund to divest from companies&nbsp;that&nbsp;participate in a boycott of businesses based in Israel “or territories controlled by the Jewish state of Israel.”</p> \n<p>“Backers of this effort are cynically exploiting concerns about anti-Israel BDS to promote legislation that while purportedly about defending Israel, is actually about legitimizing settlements,” said Lara Friedman, Americans for Peace Now's director of government relations. “Most American Jews and legislators don't understand that their support for Israel is being abused to promote an agenda that is anathema to their long-held view.”</p> \n<p>In some cases, traditional pro-Israel groups and lawmakers have driven the legislative push. Virginia’s legislation, backed by the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, does not include language protecting the settlements. Ron Halber, the JCRC director, said that doing so would split a Jewish community still reeling from the contentious debate last year over the Iran nuclear deal.</p> \n<p>“The greatest threat to Israel is the disunity of the American Jewish community,” Halber said. “Any legislation we do, we’re going to make sure both sides feel comfortable.&quot;</p> \n<p>Nationally, establishment pro-Israel groups including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee back congressional legislation that would extend anti-BDS protections to settlements, most recently a bipartisan bill that removes obstacles in federal law for states that want to divest from entities boycotting Israel.</p> \n<p>New York's bill, which was adopted by the state Senate in January and was ordered to have a third reading in the Assembly, does extend protections to Israeli settlements. The bill requires the state to produce a list of “persons” deemed to be engaging in a boycott who would then be rendered ineligible to do business with the state.</p> \n<p>Jack Martins, the Republican state senator who initiated the bill, said that allies should defer to one another on security issues, noting that the Israeli government has cast efforts to single out settlements as a threat.</p> \n<p>&quot;As a sovereign nation they have the ability to make the decisions for themselves,&quot; he said. &quot;Any actions&quot; boycotters &quot;take against Israel or its components is an attack on our relationship with Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>A spokeswoman for Jewish Voice for Peace, a group that backs the BDS movement and is among a network of groups countering the anti-boycott laws, said New York's bill amounts to a “blacklist.”</p> \n<p>“The tactic of economic pressure is becoming increasingly accepted and has prompted a backlash of questionable constitutionality,” spokeswoman Naomi Dann said.</p> \n<p>The New York JCRC declined to say whether it supports the law, which is backed by the Zionist Organization of America and other right-wing groups. Simcha Felder, the Democratic state senator who co-sponsored the bill, said the law doesn't limit anyone's right to free expression.</p> \n<p>“The legislation doesn’t prevent anyone from speaking or promoting a boycott, nor from making other vile and prejudicial statements,” Felder told JTA in an email. “That’s a person’s constitutional right. But they don’t have a constitutional right to be a New York State contractor.”</p> \n<p>Several activists involved in BDS legislation said the failure of Congress to act on Israel boycotts has forced the issue at the state level, where public pension funds often invest in companies targeted by the BDS movement. Though there are a number of proposals under consideration in Washington, none are as sweeping as the Illinois and South Carolina laws.</p> \n<p>“There’s been no movement,” said Ira Silverstein, a Democratic state senator in Illinois who sponsored the nation's first state anti-BDS law, which banned pension funds from dealing with entities that boycott Israel. “Congress has its own issues.”</p> \n<p>Two trade laws passed in Washington in the last year include provisions extending previous congressional calls to discourage cooperation with entities that boycott Israel to those that solely target settlement goods. The Obama administration has said it will comply broadly with the laws, but will ignore provisions that seek protection for settlement goods.</p> \n<p>Right-wing Jewish activists have allied with Proclaiming Justice to the Nations, a pro-Israel Christian group that has been involved in advancing anti-BDS measures in several southern states. Joanne Bregman, a Jewish lawyer in Nashville, Tennessee, who has worked with Proclaiming Justice to the Nations on anti-BDS legislation, said she sees no difference between boycotting Israeli settlements and boycotting Israel proper.</p> \n<p>“You either believe Judea and Samaria was always part of Israel or you do not,” Bregman said, using the biblical terms for the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Elliot Bartky, a political science professor at Indiana University-Purdue University, Fort Wayne, and his group, the Jewish American Affairs Committee of Indiana, moved the legislation through the Indiana House.</p> \n<p>In 2011, Bartky co-wrote an&nbsp;Op-Ed in the American Thinker&nbsp;that laid out a plan to challenge the “leftist” Jewish establishment. Bregman, who befriended Bartky after reading the Op-Ed, told JTA it was “startling” to encounter official Jewish reluctance to partner with Christian groups in advancing BDS legislation.</p> \n<p>The Indianapolis JCRC in an email said it supports the Indiana law and acknowledged Bartky's leadership in getting it passed.</p> \n<p>&quot;The JCRC has directed the lion's share of our anti-BDS efforts toward educating the larger community outside the statehouse, particularly on central Indiana campuses where there has been a precipitous uptick in pro-BDS events,&quot; said Lindsey Mintz, the JCRC director.</p>",

        "text":["<p>No one dared record or film the Admor of Vizhnitz’s remarks to his followers in the ultra-Orthodox town of Bnei Brak this week, certainly not on a smartphone. But an official in the largest Hasidic community took the trouble to put them in writing.</p> \n<p>“Dear Jews, I am saying this to you in pain and with a broken heart, and in the name of hundreds of hurting families who have lost the head of their family,” the rabbinic leader said.</p> \n<p>“Young children are roaming depressed and neglected in the most terrible way because their fathers have left them on their own. Parents are weeping over their sons who have deviated from the straight path amid the chain of generations cut down by the thrust of technology’s blade.”</p> \n<p>As the rabbi put it, “I urge you, those of you who are with the Holy Name, come to us! Anyone who has a connection to the corrupting devices should know that he is losing all connection to us, removing himself from the camp of those who fear and are in awe of the word of G-d!!”</p> \n<p>As is his wont, the Admor of Vizhnitz, Rabbi Yisroel Hager, speaks to his disciples about holiness and purity with no compromises. But he’s just one of the many ultra-Orthodox leaders have been taking steps against “the ills of technology.”</p> \n<p>The Vizhnitz Hasidim use the slogan “This is a matter of life and death!” while the Lithuanian (non-Hasidic) community has launched a campaign around the country entitled the Holiness Revolution.</p> \n<p>The Sanz Hasidim have sufficed with written explanatory material; for example, students whose parents have mobile phones are warned that they’ll be expelled.</p> \n<p>Among the Kretshnif Hasidim, many have declared in writing they do not possess any means of connecting to the Internet, or they’ve received permission to do so. In return they’ve received a sign for their doors informing the neighbors that theirs is a “devout home” where the family heeds “the instructions of the Great Ones of Israel, and the home is free of the ills of the Internet and technology.”</p> \n<p>Forbidding almost everything</p> \n<p>The current round against the dizzying penetration of technology won’t settle the issue for good. It’s the top rabbis’ annual attempt to divert Earth from its orbit a tad.&nbsp;Of course, no one can replicate the mass obedience to the banning of televisions, but every now and then there are successes, mainly in ultra-Orthodox communities where the individual is particularly dependent on the community’s institutions.</p> \n<p>A member of one of the major Hasidic sects who asked not to be named says that for the first time in the rabbis' longtime battle against technology, he is feeling pressure to bid farewell to his iPhone, which he uses intensively for business. So far, a blind eye was turned to his cell phone use, but recently he was told that due to new regulations, his daughter will not be allowed to attend the local seminary unless he gets rid of the device, or at least installs a stringent screening app.</p> \n<p>&quot;It's a difficult dilemma,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm trying to fight the principal to at least allow me to use a less stringent screening app. They know that some Hasidim need their iPhones to make a living. I don’t want to reach a point where I secretly own a second device. First of all, I don't want to lie, and secondly, I admit, it has become a little scarier to possess a non-kosher device.&quot;</p> \n<p>Over the past decade the rabbis have forbidden almost everything. A cellphone is permitted, but just for talking; no instant messaging or taking pictures, never mind the Internet.</p> \n<p>These simple&nbsp;devices, which are under rabbinical supervision, are still in demand at mobile phone stores in ultra-Orthodox areas, but&nbsp;alongside them there is burgeoning market for cell phones ranging from the newest smartphones to devices titled&nbsp;“kosher supportive” or “kosher generation 2.0.” These differ in their level of supervision and blocking, or in the way they can be hacked and used with forbidden apps.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, there are services and sophisticated software programs to filter Web content for the devices; for example Net-Free, which blocks pages considered inappropriate and erases pictures of women, based on the standards of the ultra-Orthodox press.</p> \n<p>“When a user enters a site classified for having pictures filtered, all the pictures are immediately sent to the inspection desk and examined by non-Jewish female employees,” Net-Free’s website says.</p> \n<p>“The inspection is usually completed within minutes. When the pictures have been filtered once, the good pictures are presented to all the users.”</p> \n<p>More common services are Delta and Nativ, which let an ultra-Orthodox Jew view approved pages.</p> \n<p>The current round of the battle is dominated by the Hasidic courts, each setting an independent policy for its adherents. Each sect stresses a different element – one is irked by WhatsApp, another insists on a specific filtering program.</p> \n<p>The Hasidim have always had a lot to say about issues of “holiness and purity,” but their anti-smartphone movement&nbsp;is striking. The phenomenon is happening because of the Hasidim's&nbsp;heavy dependence on their community&nbsp;institutions, as well as the&nbsp;relatively high percentage of Hasidim who work for a living and therefore need an Internet connection.&nbsp;In contrast,&nbsp;the Lithuanian leaders’ ability to control their people, certainly in the large cities, is limited. That’s where the large masses of ultra-Orthodox smartphone owners can be found.</p> \n<p>New deal</p> \n<p>If they had their druthers, the rabbis would return us to the age of the common telephone, but they realize that smartphones are here to stay and not every ultra-Orthodox Jew obeys the rules.</p> \n<p>So they’re offering a new deal, even if it’s not stated explicitly: a forbidden smartphone won’t get you shunned by the community, but it will deny you certain rights.</p> \n<p>Call it an upgraded phone in exchange for downgraded status without expulsion from the community. For many Hasidim, that’s a good deal.</p> \n<p>About a week ago the ultra-Orthodox Behadrei Haredim site reported that the Admor of Belz refused to serve as the godfather at the circumcision ceremony hosted by one of his disciples. Why? The father had a “nonkosher” phone in his pocket.</p> \n<p>The Gur Hasidim have declared that smartphone owners will be denied certain privileges like grants for grooms, while the Vizhnitz Hasidim have announced that smartphone owners may not read aloud from the Torah at holiday time.</p> \n<p>The Sanz Hasidim have banned the use of WhatsApp, even though permission had previously been granted in certain cases. According to a letter sent by the community’s spiritual committee on communications, business owners who received permission to use it reported something shocking.</p> \n<p>“After they were exposed to the use of this app they became dehumanized, both in the addiction to nearly constant use and in the content and pictures that are the daily bread of WhatsApp groups,” the letter read.</p> \n<p>Still, the Sanz Hasidim added that “anyone who needs this app for a purpose essential to earning his living should apply to the committee’s secretariat to fill out a request form.”</p> \n<p>It’s not only pornography and modesty issues that are distressing the rabbis. The current knifing and car-ramming attacks by Palestinians, for example, have turned ultra-Orthodox WhatsApp groups into streams of dead-body pictures on the smartphones of users in Bnei Brak, Jerusalem, Betar Ilit and Ofakim.</p> \n<p>According to Yisrael Cohen, a writer and commentator for the website Kikar Hashabbat, many ultra-Orthodox people don’t have smartphones and email, so they only learn about world events as depicted by ultra-Orthodox newspaper Hamodiya.</p> \n<p>Still, he says the bad-mouthing of the Internet and smartphones is having an effect. “It used to be that a journalist could take pictures with his mobile phone,” Cohen says. “Nowadays they’ll yell at him right away to drop this abomination.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>After Donald Trump’s victory in the South Carolina primaries on Saturday night, various TV pundits presented this piece of historical trivia: no Republican has ever won both New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries without going on to become the GOP’s presidential candidate. Which means A. that Trump is on course to achieving the hitherto unbelievable or B. that like all the other predictions and projections that have been proffered since Trump entered this race this one will soon perish as well.</p> \n<p>Be that as it may, on an evening in which Hillary Clinton’s victory in Nevada garnered a collective sigh of relief from the Democratic establishment, its Republican counterpart saw its worst nightmare get closer to coming true. Not only did Trump win all 50 delegates that South Carolina will send to the Republican National Convention in the summer, but GOP royal Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite son who amassed an astonishing $150 million war chest, got less than 8% of the vote and bowed out of the race. The party, to paraphrase Star Trek, was now in a place where no Republican had gone before.</p> \n<p>Trump has entrenched himself at the top of the GOP league, despite flouting all the known rules of the game on his way to the top. He insults women, Hispanics, African Americans and anyone else who gets within his sights. Not only does he irritate Mexico and challenge China for no good reason, he then quarrels with conservative superpower Fox News, tangles with George Bush and the legacy of 9/11 and trades insults with the immensely popular Pope Francis. He has no clearly defined policies, he contradicts today what he said yesterday and he often seems clueless about how, exactly, he plans to “make America great again.” Trump’s fans follow him because he fights political correctness tooth and nail, gets on the collective nerves of liberal America and talks like a real, anti-establishment straight shooter: they are apparently less bothered by what Trump actually has to say.</p> \n<p>Like Bernie Sanders and the Democrats, Trump has injected new enthusiasm to the GOP electorate, but unlike Sanders and the Democrats, this has actually brought Republican participation in the primaries to new levels, with South Carolina breaking its own record on Saturday night, as Iowa and New Hampshire did before. The GOP establishment is convinced that this newfound zeal is less about Trump and more about the fervent Republican wish to retake the White House from the Democrats. They are confident that a GOP candidate can beat the scandal-ridden Clinton or the socialist Sanders with relative ease. They would probably be willing to ignore and absorb Trump’s daily abuse with greater ease if they thought he was the one. But they don’t.</p> \n<p>Now the GOP is pinning its hopes on the winnowing of the field, which has brought the field of candidates down from the original 17 to five or even three, depending on who’s being counted. Ohio Governor John Kasich hopes to feast on Bush’s electoral remains, do well in the GOP caucuses in Nevada on Tuesday, somehow survive Super Tuesday the following week and strike gold when the primaries finally get to his Midwest bastion: unlike Bush, he seems impervious to the notion that a GOP candidate cannot survive after getting only single digits in South Carolina. Ben Carson, who is also in the race apparently, is no longer operating in a rational political landscape: he seems to be staying in the race for kicks alone.</p> \n<p>In practice, after South Carolina, Trump has only two competitors left: Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who finished in a virtual tie for second place in North Carolina. The GOP establishment and its benefactors will now line up behind the boyish Rubio, who will be branded as the kinder, gentler face of the Republican party, though, from a purely ideological point of view at least, this is no more than camouflage: after Trump’s victory and Bush’s departure, the relatively moderate wing of the GOP has been demolished. It exists no more. The right of center faction that produced Bush’s own father, George HW, presidential candidates such as John McCain and Bob Dole, former presidents Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, God forgive me, and, on some social and cultural issues, Ronald Reagan, will have expired. The options now on the table include a real estate tycoon with a flexible past, a racist attitude and an unruly mouth (Trump); a radical right Evangelical fundamentalist with a knack for alienating his peers (Cruz); and a charming but inexperienced senator who was invented by the Tea Party and who has expediently realigned himself with the most staunchly conservative wing of the GOP (Rubio). For a liberal/leftist American, the choice, to cite a famous Jewish saying, is between cholera, malaria and the plague.</p> \n<p>From the point of view of “who’s good for the Jews”, the question is which Jews we’re talking about. Cruz could probably find a home in the radical wing of Naftali Bennett’s Jewish Home party, though his neo-isolationist views could pose a problem. Rubio the conservative neoconservative would feel right at home with Benjamin Netanyahu in today’s Likud, though Sheldon Adelson hasn’t given his official blessing yet. Trump should probably be the preferred candidate of Israeli lefties and American two-staters, if only because he is inconsistent and irreverent and always ready to slay a sacred cow or two and on condition that one is able to quench the stench of his chauvinist and racist statements.</p> \n<p>Cruz did not do as well as expected among South Carolina Evangelicals and will have to pick up some Southern states taking part in Super Tuesday in order to revive his prospects. The establishment hopes that Rubio will reap the benefits of Bush’s departure, though Kasich may also be standing in the same line. And Trump, let’s not forget, becomes more and more credible in the eyes of wavering Republicans with each new victory he puts on his belt: Rubio, despite his airs, has yet to pick up anything approaching a victory.</p> \n<p>He has recovered remarkably well from his seemingly inoperable bout of robotic repetitions that struck him in the debate before New Hampshire, courtesy of the also departed Chris Christie. Rubio learned his lesson and has grown more confident as he has managed to appear less programmed and scripted. But Trump and Cruz remain fierce rivals in the South while Trump still drubs him in the polls in other parts of the country. On Saturday night Rubio once again succeeded in casting his non-win in South Carolina as a victory that brings him to the very doorstep of the White House, as he did in Iowa, but there’s a limit to how many times he can sell and then resell the same whopper to his fans.</p> \n<p>Rubio is now the Grand Old Party’s Great White Hope against Cruz and Trump, the barbarians at the gate. Trump knows this and will now be aiming the poison cannons that successfully eliminated Bush and neutralized Cruz against the Senator from Florida. After his South Carolina victory, Trump has morphed from the candidate who doesn’t stand a chance to the one who suddenly seems unstoppable. Other than his most ardent fans, most people still believe that something or someone will still prevent Trump from taking over the White House, but the ranks of potential candidates and scenarios grow smaller by the day.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The hyena, a rare variety of garlic known as allium kollmannianum and the Cleopatra butterfly are all defined as rare species in danger of becoming extinct. But what they also have in common is that all three live within the boundaries of the city of Be'er Sheva which they share with 800 types of flora and fauna – a rather rich variety for a city located at the rim of a desert. In the coming years the city faces a large building boom, one of the challenges the planners will face is to find a way to leave a little space for the plant life, butterflies and large mammals to coexist there as well.</p> \n<p>Next month the Society for the Protection of Nature will present a survey covering 2012-2014. The survey has been conducted by the city and the Environmental Protection Ministry with the help of the Bracha Fund, and its findings will be presented at a conference to be attended by Mayor Rubik Danelowitz. The field work was carried out by botanists, ornithologists and other animal specialists, who have roamed across the hills and valleys of the neighborhoods, climbed down ropes to probe the depths of water wells in search of reptiles and have followed butterflies winging across the streets and gardens. In all they have documented 58 sites.</p> \n<p>The neighborhoods and commercial centers of Be'er Sheva have spread out at a very rapid pace in the past few years, and a third of the space in which the survey was conducted has changed as a result of the urban development, including landscaping, afforestation and Bedouin farming. But within the city’s jurisdiction, which stretches across 117 square kilometers (double the size of Tel Aviv), there are still great expanses of level land and loess plains, hills and streams filled with a rich variety of flora and fauna.</p> \n<p>In natural areas at the city’s edges and also inside it, the survey found 578 types of plants. One of the explanations for this rich variety is that the Be'er Sheva area is a meeting point between the Mediterranean and desert regions, a factor which spawns a large variety of plant and wildlife.</p> \n<p>The list of plants includes some species at risk of extinction. One of the more special varieties is the allium kollmannianum, a rare type of garlic, which grows only in the northern Negev. Scientists discovered it less than a decade ago, and it has survived in several locations in the Be'er Sheva and Dimona regions. In addition another 11 other types of garlic have been found. Not far from the allium kollmannianum there’s another subspecies of a brownish iris, whose population has declined due to construction in the region. Irises and other fauna have been hurt by afforestation including the leveling of land by means of heavy machinery.</p> \n<p>Surveyors have also found another 256 types of animals, among them more than 10 types of butterflies and 19 varieties of reptiles. The survey of reptiles had to be postponed due to Operation Cast Lead and wound up being carried out at a time when they were less active. Therefore the surveyors had to seek them out mainly inside the pits in which they hide.</p> \n<p>Particularly impressive is the rich world of bird life in the area. In the survey 182 types of birds were observed, 60 of them nesters. Some were characteristic to the area such as the cream colored courser and the desert lark. An interesting discovery was the spectacled warbler – a type of songbird that lives among brushes that have decreased in recent years. At the edge of the neighborhoods live the black-eared wheatear whose nesting grounds have been hurt by development. Some rare birds of prey including a lesser kestrel have also been spotted. The list of mammals is also quite long relative to the urban landscape, and it includes the hyena, desert fox and deer.</p> \n<p>The Be'er Sheva survey is the first ever conducted in an Israeli city located in a desert environment. Similar surveys have been conducted in other large cities among them Jerusalem, Haifa, and Ramat Gan. In Jerusalem a master plan for the management of important nature sites has already been completed.</p> \n<p>“Until a few years ago the urban environment was not considered a partner in the need to preserve the environment and its biological diversity,” said Amir Balaban, supervisor of urban nature at the Society for the Protection of Nature. “Accelerated urban development and a rise in public awareness about the environmental crises we face have brought about a situation where local governments around the world have begun to look at ways to limit direct and indirect damage to the biological diversity of the urban environment. The basis of this project is a bank of comprehensive and updated data, such as that presented by the survey. It supplies accurate and accessible pictures of the information about the biological diversity and its location in the urban setting, which permits planning in a way that takes natural surroundings into account.”</p> \n<p>In the words of the acting mayor of Be'er Sheva and chairperson of the local planning committee, Tal El-Al, the survey’s findings surprised even those born and raised in the city, including himself. “We had no idea there was so much natural value and so many rare species,” he said. “We must find a way to preserve them at the same time as conducting accelerated development in the city. A metropolis looking to provide quality of life must budget space to nature preservation as well.”</p> \n<p>The challenge facing Be'er Sheva’s planning bodies are quite complicated. More than 20,000 housing units are in the planning stages for the city. El-Al says that the local planning commission will soon discuss the status of natural sites, and he says: “If we must we will amend building plans in order to protect these sites.”</p> \n<p>He says that the city didn’t wait for the survey’s results, and therefore: “the mayor has recently decided to cancel plans for about 3,000 housing units and to preserve the area as an urban woods.”</p> \n<p>Urban nature is already paying a heavy price for development. One of the neighborhoods in the north of the city approved recently will be built in an area where allium kollmannianum, a form of garlic, grows. In light of this, the Nature and Parks Protection Society is planning to move the plants to a nearby site in the coming months.</p> \n<p>The survey’s conductors are recommending that the city and planning commissions avoid approving land for afforestation in areas near the banks of streams because of their importance. They suggest paving a planned ring road supposed to circumnavigate the city as an underground highway to prevent harm to natural surroundings, and to use local wildlife as a basis for developing public spaces in the city. Another recommendation calls for banning overland vehicles in loess plains type sand dunes.Such vehicles have done a lot of damage to some of the focal points of local natural interest.</p> \n<p>Unless necessary steps are taken to protect natural surroundings in Be'er Sheva, many types of animals are liable to go the way of the Be'er Sheva fringe-fingered lizard – the only reptile that is unique to Israel. Experts who participated in the survey said they failed to find a single such lizard. They believe that the broad urban development has already destroyed its natural breeding ground, and effectively excised it from the population directory of Be'er Sheva. &nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prior to a controversial, abortive 2014 decision to separate Palestinian laborers from Israelis on buses traveling to and from the West Bank, undercover right-wing activists ran a campaign to goad the laborers into making sexually suggestive remarks about Jewish women on the bus, then filmed their responses and distributed the material to political officials and news media, Haaretz has learned.</p> \n<p>Right around the time of Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon’s October 2014 decision, Channel 2 ran footage of such remarks provided by the right-wing NGO, Ad Kan – but the footage broadcast did not include the provocations of the NGO’s moles.</p> \n<p>Ad Kan is the organization that recently provided Channel 2’s “Uvda” investigative program with footage obtained by its moles of left-wing activist Ezra Nawi boasting of having endangered the life of a Palestinian who sold land to Jews by informing on him to the Palestinian Authority, a boast that was never substantiated. The broadcast by “Uvda” led to Nawi’s arrest. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Haaretz has received documents showing that Gilad Ach, chairman of Ad Kan, which has planted moles in human rights organizations, sought to promote the bus-separation campaign and to sway decision-makers to remove Palestinians from the buses – before Ya’alon’s decision.</p> \n<p>Settler leaders, who spearheaded the campaign to remove Palestinian laborers from the buses, have been claiming for years that such workers sexually harass women on the buses. Ya’alon decided in October 2014 to separate Palestinian and Israeli travelers, forcing Palestinian working in Israel to return to the West Bank via the Eyal checkpoint, far from the bus routes used by the settlers. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu froze implementation of the decision last May.</p> \n<p>In contrast, the police assert that only one complaint of sexual harassment on a bus was actually filed. Channel 10’s investigative program “Hamakor,” whose reporter spent two days on buses on these lines, did not find evidence of any aggressive behavior.</p> \n<p>It now emerges that the Ad Kan organization, chaired by Gilad Ach, sent a female mole along with another individual carrying video and audio equipment to travel on these buses. The raw footage provided by Ach’s team documents the camera operator goading a Palestinian laborer to give his opinion about the women traveling on the bus. The material, presented as if the camera were capturing an attempt at sexual harassment of the female passenger, was distributed as part of a lobbying effort to various officials.</p> \n<p>Ach, 32, a resident of the Eli settlement, has in recent years run an NGO called Magen, which says it supports “a Jewish and democratic Israel.” The NGO is the one that ran the moles in human rights organizations prior to the founding of Ad Kan. Ach said in an interview with Channel 2’s investigative program “Uvda,” “We were very careful not to create a reality that did not exist.” However, a look at raw footage gathered by Ach shows Ad Kan members not only documenting events but also provoking them.</p> \n<p>For years, Ach recruited young Arabic-speaking graduates of elite Israel Defense Forces units with experience in undercover work among Palestinians. They were employed in several projects, including the one involving the West Bank buses in October 2014.</p> \n<p>Ach told a PR man during a meeting in Tel Aviv that he started being an activist after his mother, a Tel Aviv resident, complained that she needed public transportation to visit him in Eli. At the same time, the northern Samaria settlers council launched a public campaign for separate buses, which featured a weekly demonstration in the West Bank settlement Ariel.</p> \n<p>On behalf of Magen, Ach drew up a plan to get Palestinians removed from buses in September 2014. “The goal: stopping Palestinians from flooding Israeli buses from the center [of the country] to Samaria, and preventing the consequences,” his plan stated.</p> \n<p>“The mission: documenting the harassment and suffering that Jewish passengers experience on these buses and revealing the scorn Palestinians show toward Jewish passengers. The method: infiltrating a team pretending to be Arabs on a number of buses operated by Kavim from the center [of Israel] to Ariel during designated times; recording conversations with Palestinians en route to Judea and Samaria; having a lone girl board a bus and documenting the treatment she receives during the trip; documenting the general situation on these buses.”</p> \n<p>The plan also detailed the goals of those involved – to record “curses against the driver,” “harassment of girls on the bus, racist expressions, statements that ‘Jews are suckers,’” and ostensible evidence of “enemy activity, transgressions of the law, racism, and sexual [harassment].”</p> \n<p>Short-lived project</p> \n<p>Ach’s project was short-lived, for while he was organizing the teams to document incidents on the buses, Haaretz reported that Ya’alon made the decision to separate the bus lines for Israelis and Palestinians, essentially making the whole enterprise redundant.</p> \n<p>But footage from a single day of filming is enough to learn Ach’s modus operandi. His team included Yulia Tarantarova, who boarded a bus seemingly alone (and was also a mole planted to document the activities of Ezra Nawi), as well as an Arabic-speaking Israeli posing as a Palestinian laborer and a security guard. Ach himself traveled in a private car behind the bus.</p> \n<p>The recorded material was passed on to Channel 2, via the Samaria settlers organization and Israeli security officials, as alleged proof of the insufferable situation on the mixed buses.</p> \n<p>The raw footage was presented as documenting “the kind of sexual harassment that occurs often on the bus, the high point of which is a Palestinian laborer who tells his friend about a girl he sees on the bus, calls her a ‘whore,’ and remarks that he would like to have sex with her and that if he were alone with her, he’d take her to the back.”</p> \n<p>The video recording shows that the presence of Tarantarova alone on the bus did not lead to the anticipated sexual harassment. The mole posing as a laborer began pointing her out to the Palestinians on board, hoping they would respond with a sexual comment. The footage shows Ach’s imposter/laborer-in-disguise starting to talk with workers en route about Tarantarova, asking their opinion about her looks.</p> \n<p>According to the transcript prepared by the Magen organization, the conversation went as follows:</p> \n<p>Imposter: Hello, how are you? Worker: Thank God. Imposter: Where are you from? Worker: From Zatra Imposter: Zatra? Where is Zatra? Worker: Next to Ariel. Imposter: Married? Worker: No, no, single. Imposter: What do you for work? Worker: Construction in Ramat Gan, for a Jewish contractor. Imposter: What do you say about the girl here? Worker: The bus is empty today, but usually there are many pretty girls, thank God.</p> \n<p>(The worker does not comment about Tarantarova, and the imposter tries to draw him out.)</p> \n<p>Imposter: Look at this beauty. Worker: Ya Allah, out of this world. Look how smooth her hair is, the whore. I would take her to the back of the bus and screw her. I wish we were here alone. Wait a minute. I want to take a picture of her. Move over a second.</p> \n<p>This conversation is heard on the Channel 2 report, accompanied by an image of Tarantarova. But an examination of the raw footage indicates that the sound was superimposed on the video – and that during the filming of her standing on the bus, nothing is heard save for the loud noise of the bus’ engine.</p> \n<p>In other sections of the raw footage, Ach’s planted agent is heard trying to draw additional “incriminating” comments, as he called them in his operational plan. In one segment, the man talks with a worker and asks, “Do you hate settlers?” (The answer was “yes.”) In other conversations, the mole tried to extract comments from Palestinians about the police and the army – without much success.</p> \n<p>In response, Ach commented that this Haaretz report “is based on lies, whose sole objective is to cover for and protect the immoral activity of Ezra Nawi. It is puzzling why media like Haaretz throw sand in the eyes of its readers and choose to publish, out of the clear, vengeful interest of its lawyers and the reporter who penned it, an article based solely on a false presentation of events. The claims are false and are meant to undermine the publication of additional material by Ad Kan.</p> \n<p>“The Ad Kan organization and Gilad Ach base all their facts and claims on authentic material that was collected by Israelis who managed to penetrate the headquarters and heart of activity of anti-Israeli organizations, and to document, via cameras and audio recordings, the frightening reality within them.”</p> \n<p>Channel 2 declined to comment.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Given his long history of broken promises, it’s admittedly hard to believe in the sincerity of the intentions the prime minister voiced in his video appeal to Israel’s Arab citizens last week. And yet, it seems that this time, there was something different. If, for a moment, we leave aside score-settling, which is justified in and of itself, I felt that the man simply wasn’t bluffing. And if you compare this speech of conciliation to his other speeches, with their hate-filled looks and words of incitement, you’ll see that in this speech, there’s a discernible harmony between the man and what he says.</p> \n<p>After all, there’s a seed of good in everyone, and in everyone there beats the desire to look nice and to be loved by those who are good. Everyone wants to be like us, the members of the family of peace and brotherhood, or at least to look like us. This isn’t a game, it’s a genuine aspiration. Do you think Benjamin Netanyahu enjoys seeing children fleeing in fear to hide from the person who may have been pointed out to them as the scary man from the horror speeches?</p> \n<p>Now, when he has an opportunity, he wants with all his might to seem nice, to seem full of love and human warmth. And why not? In fact, we should encourage him, and my advice to his cronies is to periodically show him clips from his various speeches, so he will learn to distinguish hatred from conciliation, human ugliness from human beauty.</p> \n<p>The power of morality is such that even racists don’t want to appear immoral. Take, for instance, Lower Galilee Regional Council Chairman Moti Dotan, who wants to ban Arabs from “his” swimming pools, yet in the same breath urges his listeners not to think he’s a racist. Instead of walking with his head held high as a proud racist, he tries to hide this fact. And that is the problem of racists here and everywhere: They’re a-s-h-a-m-e-d. And they’re j-e-a-l-o-u-s of us, the nonracists.</p> \n<p>Late last year, the cabinet approved a plan to allocate 15 billion shekels ($4 billion) in additional funding for the development of the Arab community. The next day, we witnessed Netanyahu’s frightening podium appearance, in which he lashed out at Arab citizens while the blood of two people murdered in a terror attack was not yet dry. I said to myself that if the choice is between 15 billion shekels plus incitement or zero shekels without incitement, I’d prefer the second option. After all, even 150 billion shekels could be consumed in a moment by the fires of incitement.</p> \n<p>Therefore, Netanyahu’s latest speech is a kind of belated appendix to the 15-billion-shekel plan — and a welcome one. It’s wonderful. For when it comes to words and deeds, words are also a kind of deed, and an extremely important one. And if they clear the air, so much the better.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s statement as prime minister constitutes a message to every Jewish citizen: It urges them to treat Arabs as equals and as an important part of Israeli society. And more than this speech was aimed at Arabs, its target audience must be the Jewish community, and especially Netanyahu’s own base.</p> \n<p>The prime minister’s speech also revealed the demise of the opposition. I assure you, opposition leader Isaac Herzog would never in his life make a speech like this, lest he be portrayed as an Arab-lover. And let’s hope Yesh Atid Chairman Yair Lapid never sees Netanyahu’s speech, because if he does he’ll accuse the prime minister of joining hands with the “Zoabis” — MK Haneen Zoabi and her ilk.</p> \n<p>The only problem is that if, heaven forbid, Netanyahu continues with speeches like this, we, his opponents, will find ourselves out of work. The man is expropriating all our assets. He’s talking like Meretz Chairwoman Zehava Galon and Hadash MK Dov Khenin. So who will we consume with our wrath from now on? All we need now is for MK Bezalel Smotrich, leader of the Jewish racism movement, to register his pure child in the bilingual school run by Uncle Shuli Dichter of Hand in Hand.</p> \n<p>Can someone please direct me to the unemployment office in Nazareth?</p>",

        "text":["<p>The bombing of a Hebrew University cafeteria in July 2002 goes down in history as one of the darkest chapters of the second intifada. Anyone who is English-speaking and connected to Israel, to Jerusalem, and even more specifically, to Pardes – the co-ed yeshiva that lost two students in the bombing, Marla Bennett and Ben Blutstein – remembers that loss, is somehow connected to it, or is otherwise haunted by it.</p> \n<p>Largely forgotten, as is often the case, are the people who were seriously injured in the bombing. One of them, a young American student named Jamie, happened to be bending down to get a book at her feet when the bomb went off. The explosives, planted in a gym bag on a nearby lunch table, killed Marla, Ben and seven others; Jamie survived. Standing nearby as she recovered from second and third-degree burns over 30 percent of her body and surgery to remove shrapnel from her small intestine was her husband, David Harris-Gershon. The couple then flew home to America, hoping to move on.</p> \n<p>Easier said than done, found Harris-Gershon. As part of his search to understand what had happened to them, and what had made a middle-class, married Palestinian father named Mohammed Odeh drop off a bag of explosives on a university campus where he’d once worked, Harris-Gershon wrote a memoir, published last month, entitled: “What Do You Buy the Children of the Terrorist Who Tried to Kill Your Wife?”</p> \n<p>Revisiting that story sounds like a depressing task, but Harris-Gershon’s narrative is ultimately inspiring and thought-provoking. While trying to uncover everything he could learn about Odeh, who planned and planted the bomb on behalf of Hamas and is now in prison after being convicted on nine counts of murder, Harris-Gershon learned that Odeh had expressed remorse for what he had done – a rarity.</p> \n<p>Stretching the confines of memoir</p> \n<p>It was when I got to the writer’s imaginary conversation with the surgeon who removed a steel nut from his wife’s intestines that I was reminded of the horrors of this conflict – that almost-forgotten reality of a decade ago to which no sane Israeli or Palestinian would wish to return. It was also then that I realized that I was going to like this book, because the writer boldly stretches the confines of memoir and lets it deserve the adjective of its literary category, creative nonfiction.</p> \n<p>Doctor: Here you go.</p> \n<p>Me: What’s this?</p> \n<p>Doctor: Just a little something you might like, you know, to have, something to hold when you look back on these times we shared.</p> \n<p>Me: You’ve got to be kidding.</p> \n<p>Doctor: No, really. Sometimes people want these things.</p> \n<p>Me: Why on earth would anyone want this?</p> \n<p>Doctor: Oh, come on. You know you’ve wanted this all along, a tragedy, to know whether or not you’re strong enough to survive.</p> \n<p>Me: Have not.</p> \n<p>Doctor: Sure you have. It’s something you’ve wanted, a defining moment, and this nut is my gift to you, a physical reminder of the pain and grief you asked for, felt you always deserved, felt you’ve had coming to you after a quaint, two-parent upbringing devoid of poverty, sickness or death.</p> \n<p>Me: I don’t want it, don’t want any of this.</p> \n<p>Doctor: Whatever. Just take it. You’re one of us now. There’s no going back.</p> \n<p>Me: I can go back.</p> \n<p>Doctor: No, you can’t. And another thing: you’ll never throw it away. It will always be with you. Put it on a keychain or turn it into a necklace. You know, something meaningful, as a reminder.</p> \n<p>Me: Fuck you.</p> \n<p>Doctor: Bye now.</p> \n<p>In an interview with Haaretz, Gershon-Harris explained more about his approach to writing the book, his feelings about Jerusalem, and what he learned in the process of trying to understand if not forgive.</p> \n<p>There was a lot more political analysis in the book than I had expected. For example, you explore the fact that there was supposed to be a cease-fire on July 22, 2002 – a little more than a week before the bombing. You suggest that Israel undermined the cease-fire effort because it didn’t believe it was authentic. What was the significance of that revelation for you?</p> \n<p>“I came back to the States and was suffering from PTSD symptoms. Therapy didn’t work. Compartmentalizing didn’t work. I started to research and think that information was my path to recovery. When I learned that Mohammed Odeh expressed remorse, as was written in the AP article, it sparked this irrational desire to understand him – how someone from a moderate East Jerusalem family could do this.</p> \n<p>“I knew Palestinians as a caricature of evil. For me, this information just gave me a fuller context of how this could have happened and how this fit in to the suffering. It wasn’t about placing blame.”</p> \n<p>You write about Israel as a traumatized place, and the center of it all, Jerusalem, as the place of the binding of Isaac – “the place for such an incomprehensible test of brutality.” Do you still feel that way? Would you ever come back here again for a year, with your wife and kids?</p> \n<p>“The return trip mentioned in the book was in December 2007. I haven’t been back, but it’s only because there hasn’t been an occasion to come. We’ve definitely discussed going back and bringing our children. It’s something we’d definitely like to do, though psychologically, it’s just not something we’d be ready to do right now – perhaps more on my wife’s side than my own.</p> \n<p>“Looking at Jerusalem as a metaphorical fulcrum for the conflict is accurate, so yes, I still feel that way. It is practically and politically the center of the conflict. I found it absolutely fascinating to realize that that pivot point has been in existence for so long. That fact that you can trace this into the Humash [Bible] – it’s a story that I find depressing and compelling.”</p> \n<p>You wrote about how the average American Jew has been taught to see Palestinians, adding that before this evolution, “I did not think of Palestinians as human – they taught children to champion martyrdom and spilled blood joyfully, dutifully, in the streets of Israel.” Explain how you moved from that to realizing that there are “shades of brutality on both sides.”</p> \n<p>“It began here in the U.S. and it began with intensive reading. When I learned in my research that Odeh expressed remorse, I was faced with a person who had been humanized. I felt that the only way I could understand him was to read a lot about Palestinians.</p> \n<p>“I read a lot of Rashid Khalidi, I read Gershom Gorenberg, and I began gaining an understanding of the Palestinian experience in the territories. I knew nothing about any of this. I was kept in the dark about who Palestinians were, by the Jewish community, perhaps by the media, and by my own lack of inquisitiveness – and that was concretized by the trip to meet the family. All of that formed my new political identity.”</p> \n<p>Better to keep him behind bars</p> \n<p>I found this aspect of what you call “fictionalizing memoir” fascinating; these conversations with yourself, and in particular, the one with the doctor. Aren’t you breaking the rules of nonfiction? How did those sections come about?</p> \n<p>“With the imagined dialogues, there are two primary reasons I decided to use them. The topic of the book is so heavy and serious that as a writer one of my fears was, how can I avoid melodrama? How can I tell a story as serious as this without seeming that I’m taking myself too seriously within the context of everything else that happens in the world? I happen to be a sarcastic person. I did want the reality of who I am to come across.</p> \n<p>“The second reason I used those dialogues is that my experience was my own internal struggle, which no one else knew about. I had to figure out how do I get across to the reader my struggle and my thought process without being a bore?”</p> \n<p>Did you have any reservations or come under criticism for calling it a memoir but putting in these imagined conversations?</p> \n<p>“The dialogues are fake, but they construct the reality of what was going on. I do it in such a way so that it becomes obvious that it’s imagined. As long as you’re open about it, no one will point fingers. Where I got the most pushback from my editors on whether these would be helpful or serve a purpose, I fought hard to have them in there.”</p> \n<p>How do you feel about the prisoner releases? Is there any chance Mohammed Odeh would get released at some point?</p> \n<p>“Mohammed Odeh was originally on the release list for the Gilad Shalit exchange, but he was removed from it. Someone asked me last week in an interview if I would support his release, and the answer was no. That might surprise some people given the orientation of the book and the connection I made with the prisoner’s family. I would never think that someone who has murdered nine people and injured 81 should be released.</p> \n<p>“So in that sense, I can’t be in favor of his release, even if he expressed remorse and is sorry for what he’s done. I can’t say if I’m for or against releases. On a case-by-case basis, there’s a reason for some releases. If he had been released in the Shalit deal, my first response would have been fear, and I think that’s just natural.”</p> \n<p>What would you have said to Mohammed Odeh if you had met him?</p> \n<p>“The first thing I would probably ask would be a question. Are you really sorry for what you did? Are you really remorseful? The second question would be, why? Why’d you do it? I’m asking that without na&iuml;vet&eacute;, and understanding more fully exactly the kinds of things his family went through.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Though many Israelis are convinced that the history of the human race revolves around Judaism and the Jewish people, in truth, Judaism has played a relatively minor role in the annals of our species. Unlike such universal religions as Christianity, Islam and Buddhism, Judaism is a tribal creed. It focuses on the fate of one small nation and one tiny land, and has little interest in the fate of all other people and all other countries. For example, it cares little about events in China or about the people of New Guinea. It is no wonder, therefore, that its historical role was limited.</p> \n<p>It is certainly true that Judaism begot Christianity, and influenced the birth of Islam – two of the most important religions in history. However, the credit for the global achievements of Christianity and Islam, as well as the guilt for their many crimes, belongs to the Christians and Muslims themselves, rather than to the Jews. Just as it would be unfair to blame Judaism for the mass killings of the Crusades (Christianity is 100 percent culpable), so also there is no reason to credit Judaism with the critical Christian idea that all human beings are equal before God (an idea that stands in direct contradiction to Jewish orthodoxy).</p> \n<p>The role of Judaism in the history of humankind is a bit like the role of Newton’s mother in the history of science. It is true that without Newton’s mother, we wouldn’t have had Newton, and that Newton’s personality, ambitions and opinions were likely shaped to a significant extent by his relations with his mother. But when writing the history of science, nobody expects an entire chapter on Newton’s mother. Similarly, without Judaism you would not have had Christianity, but that doesn’t merit giving much importance to Judaism when writing the history of the world. The crucial issue is what Christianity did with its Jewish legacy.</p> \n<p>This idea may shock and annoy many Israelis, who are educated to think that Judaism is the central hero of human history. Israeli children usually finish 12 years of school without receiving any clear picture of global historical processes. Though they learn about the Roman Empire, the French Revolution and World War II, these isolated jigsaw pieces do not add up to any overarching narrative. Instead, the only coherent story offered by the Israeli school system begins with the Hebrew Bible, continuous to the Second Temple era, skips to various Jewish communities in the Diaspora, and culminates with the rise of Zionism, the Holocaust, and the establishment of the State of Israel. Most students leave school convinced that this must be the main plotline of the entire human story. For even when pupils hear about the Roman Empire or the French Revolution, the discussion in class focuses on the way the Roman Empire treated the Jews or on the legal and political status of Jews in the French Republic. People fed on such a historical diet have a very hard time digesting the idea that Judaism in fact had relatively little impact on the world as a whole.</p> \n<p>It goes without saying that the Jewish people is a unique people with an astonishing history (though this is true of most peoples). It similarly goes without saying that the Jewish tradition is full of deep insights and noble values (though it is also full of some questionable ideas and of racist, misogynist and homophobic attitudes). It is further true that, relative to its size, the Jewish people has had a disproportional impact on the history of the last 2,000 years. But when you look at the big picture of our history as a species, since the emergence of Homo sapiens more than 100,000 years ago, it is obvious that the Jewish contribution to history was very limited. Humans settled the entire planet, adopted agriculture, built the first cities, and invented writing and money thousands of years before the appearance of Judaism.</p> \n<p>Even in the last two millennia, if you look at history from the perspective of the Chinese or of the Native American Indians, it is hard to see any major Jewish contribution except through the mediation of Christians or Muslims. Thus the Hebrew Bible eventually became a cornerstone of global human culture because it was warmly embraced by Christianity. In contrast, the Talmud – whose importance to Jewish culture surpasses that of the Bible – was rejected by Christianity, and consequently remained an esoteric text hardly known to the Arabs, Poles or Dutch, not to mention the Chinese and the Maya. Though Jewish communities that studied the Talmud spread over large parts of the world, they did not play a key role in the building of the Chinese empires, in the early modern voyages of discovery, in the establishment of the democratic system, or in the Industrial Revolution. The coin, the university, the parliament, the bank, the compass, the printing press and the steam engine were all invented by gentiles.</p> \n<p>Ethics before the Bible</p> \n<p>Israelis often use the term “the three great religions,” thinking that these religions are Christianity (2 billion believers), Islam (1.5 billion) and Judaism (15 million). Hinduism, with its billion believers, and Buddhism, with its 500 million followers – not to mention the Shinto religion (50 million) and the Sikh religion (25 million) – don’t make the cut. This warped concept of “the three great religions” often implies in the mind of Israelis that all major religious and ethical traditions emerged out of the womb of Judaism, which was the first religion to preach universal ethical rules. As if humans prior to the days of Abraham and Moses lived in a Hobbesian state of nature without any moral commitments, and as if all of contemporary morality derives from the Ten Commandments. This is a baseless and somewhat racist idea, which ignores many of the world’s most important ethical traditions.</p> \n<p>Stone Age hunter-gatherer tribes had moral codes tens of thousands of years before Abraham. When the first European settlers reached Australia in the late 18th century, they encountered aboriginal tribes that had a well-developed ethical worldview despite being totally ignorant of Moses, Jesus or Mohammed. Indeed, scientists nowadays point out that morality has evolutionary roots, and that it is present among most social mammals, such as wolves, dolphins and monkeys. For example, when wolf cubs play with one another, they have “fair game” rules. If a cub bites too hard, or continues to bite an opponent that has rolled on his back and surrendered, the other cubs will stop playing with him.</p> \n<p>In one hilarious experiment, the primatologist Frans de Waal placed two capuchin monkeys in two adjacent cages, so that each could see everything the other was doing. De Waal and his colleagues placed small stones inside each cage, and trained the monkeys to give them these stones. Whenever a monkey handed over a stone, he received food in exchange. At first the reward was a piece of cucumber. Both monkeys were very pleased with that, and happily ate their cucumber.</p> \n<p>After a few rounds, de Waal moved to the next stage of the experiment. This time, when the first monkey surrendered a stone, he got a grape. Grapes are much more tasty than cucumbers. However, when the second monkey turned over a stone, he still received only a piece of cucumber.</p> \n<p>The second monkey, who had previously been very happy with his cucumber, became incensed. He took the cucumber, looked at it for a moment in disbelief, and then threw it at the scientists in anger, jumping and screeching. He’s no sucker. Equality and social justice were central values in capuchin monkey society hundreds of thousands of years before the prophet Amos complained about social elites “who oppress the poor and crush the needy” (Amos 4:1), and before the prophet Jeremiah preached, “do not oppress the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow” (Jeremiah 7:6).</p> \n<p>Even among Homo sapiens living in the ancient Middle East, the biblical prophets were not unprecedented. “Thou shall not kill” and “thou shall not steal” were well-known in the legal and ethical codes of Sumerian city states, pharaonic Egypt and the Babylonian Empire. A thousand years before Amos and Jeremiah, the Babylonian king Hammurabi explained that the great gods instructed him “to make justice prevail in the land, to abolish the wicked and the evil, to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile in Egypt – centuries before the birth of Moses – scribes wrote down “the story of the eloquent peasant,” which tells of a poor peasant whose property was stolen by a greedy landowner. The peasant came before Pharaoh’s corrupt officials, and when they failed to protect him, he began explaining to them why they must provide justice and in particular defend the poor from the rich. In one colorful allegory, this Egyptian peasant explained that the meager possessions of the poor are like their very breath, and official corruption suffocates them by plugging the passage through their nostrils.</p> \n<p>Many biblical laws copy rules that were accepted in Mesopotamia, Egypt and Canaan centuries and even millennia prior to the establishment of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. If biblical Judaism gave these laws any unique twist, it was by turning them from universal rulings into tribal codes aimed primarily at the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>Jewish morality was initially shaped as an exclusive tribal affair, and remained so to some extent until the 21st century. The Bible, the Talmud and many though not all rabbis maintained that the life of a Jew is more valuable than the life of a gentile, which is why, for example, Jews are allowed to desecrate the Shabbat in order to save a Jew from death, but are forbidden to do so if it is merely to save a gentile (Babylonian Talmud, Yoma, 84:2).</p> \n<p>Some Jewish sages argued that even the famous commandment “Love your neighbor as yourself” refers only to Jews, and there is no commandment to love gentiles. Indeed, the original text from Leviticus says: “Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18), which raises the suspicion that “your neighbor” refers only to members of “your people.”</p> \n<p>It was only the Christians who selected some choice morsels of the Jewish moral code, turned them into universal commandments, and spread them throughout the world. Indeed, Christianity split from Judaism precisely on that account. While many Jews to this day believe that the so-called “Chosen People” are closer to God than other nations are, the founder of Christianity – Saint Paul the Apostle – stipulated in his famous Epistle to the Galatians that “there is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28).</p> \n<p>And we must again emphasize that despite the enormous impact of Christianity, this was definitely not the first time a human preached a universal ethic. The Bible is far from being the exclusive font of human morality (and luckily so, given the many racist, misogynist and homophobic attitudes it contains). Confucius, Laozi, Buddha and Mahavira established universal ethical codes long before Paul and Jesus, without knowing anything about the land of Canaan or the prophets of Israel. Confucius taught that every person must love others as he loves himself about 500 years before Rabbi Hillel the Elder. And at a time when Judaism still mandated the sacrifice of animals and the systematic extermination of entire human populations (the Amalekites and Canaanites), Buddha and Mahavira already instructed their followers to avoid harming not only all human beings, but any sentient beings whatsoever, including insects.</p> \n<p>Jewish physics, Christian biology</p> \n<p>Only in the 19th and 20th centuries do we see a truly extraordinary Jewish contribution to humankind as a whole – namely, the role of Jews in modern science. In addition to such well-known names as Einstein and Freud, about 20 percent of all Nobel Prize winners in science have been Jews, though Jews constitute less than 0.2 percent of the world’s population. But it should be stressed that this has been a contribution of individual Jews rather than of Judaism as a religion or a culture. Most of the important Jewish scientists of the past 200 years acted outside the Jewish religious sphere. Indeed, Jews began to make their remarkable contribution to science only once they had abandoned the yeshivas in favor of the laboratories.</p> \n<p>Prior to 1800, the Jewish impact on science was limited. Naturally enough, Jews played no significant role in the progress of science in China, in India or in the Maya civilization. In Europe and the Middle East, some Jewish thinkers such as Maimonides had a significant influence on their gentile colleagues, but the overall Jewish impact was more or less proportional to their demographic weight. During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Judaism was hardly instrumental to the outbreak of the Scientific Revolution. Except for Spinoza (who was excommunicated for his trouble by the Jewish community), you can hardly name a single Jew who was critical to the birth of modern physics, chemistry, biology or the social sciences. We don’t know what Einstein’s ancestors were doing in the days of Galileo and Newton, but in all likelihood they were far more interested in studying the Talmud than in studying light and gravity.</p> \n<p>The great change occurred only in the 19th and 20th centuries, when secularization and the Jewish Enlightenment movement caused many Jews to adopt the worldview and lifestyle of their gentile neighbors. Jews then began to join the universities and research centers of countries such as Germany, France and the United States. Jewish scholars brought from the ghettos and shtetls important cultural legacies. The central value of education in Jewish culture was one of the main reasons for the extraordinary success of Jewish scientists. Other factors included the desire of a persecuted minority to prove its worth, and the barriers that prevented talented Jews from advancement in more anti-Semitic institutions such as the army and the state administration.</p> \n<p>Yet while Jewish scientists brought with them from the yeshivas excellent discipline and a deep faith in the value of knowledge, it is hard to say that they also brought a helpful baggage of concrete ideas and insights. Einstein was Jewish, but the theory of relativity wasn’t “Jewish physics.” What does faith in the sacredness of the Torah have to do with the insight that energy equals mass multiplied by the speed of light squared? For the sake of comparison, Darwin was a Christian and even began his studies at Cambridge intending to become an Anglican priest. Does it imply that the theory of evolution is a Christian theory? It would be ridiculous to list the theory of relativity as a Jewish contribution to humankind, just as it would be ridiculous to credit Christianity with the theory of evolution.</p> \n<p>Similarly, it is hard to see anything particularly Jewish about the invention of the process for synthesizing ammonia by Fritz Haber (Nobel Prize for Chemistry, 1918); about the discovery of the antibiotic streptomycin by Selman Waksman (Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, 1952); or about the discovery of quasicrystals by Dan Shechtman (Nobel Prize for Chemistry, 2011). In the case of scholars from the humanities and social sciences – such as Sigmund Freud – their Jewish heritage perhaps had a deeper impact on their insights. Yet even in these cases, the discontinuities are more apparent than the surviving links. Freud’s views about the human psyche were very different from those of Rabbi Joseph Caro or Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai, and he did not discover the Oedipus complex by carefully perusing the Shulhan Arukh (the code of Jewish law), or the Mishnah.</p> \n<p>To summarize, the Jewish emphasis on education and learning probably made an important contribution to the exceptional success of Jewish scientists. However, it was gentile thinkers who laid the groundwork for the achievements of Einstein, Haber and Freud. The Scientific Revolution wasn’t a Jewish project, and Jews found their place in it only when they moved from the yeshivas to the universities. Indeed, the Jewish habit of seeking the answers to all questions by reading ancient texts was a very significant obstacle to Jewish integration into the world of modern science, where answers come from observations and experiments. If there was anything about the Jewish religion itself that necessarily leads to scientific breakthroughs, why is it that between 1905 and 1933, 10 secular German Jews won Nobel Prizes in chemistry, medicine and physics, but during the same period not a single ultra-Orthodox Jew or a single Bulgarian or Yemenite Jew won any Nobel Prize?</p> \n<p>Lest I be suspected of being a “self-hating Jew” or an anti-Semite, I would like to emphasize that I am not saying Judaism was a particularly evil or benighted religion. All I am saying is that it wasn’t particularly important to the history of humankind. For many centuries, Judaism was the humble religion of a small persecuted minority that preferred to read and contemplate rather than to build empires and burn heretics at the stake. Anti-Semites usually think that Jews are very important. Anti-Semites imagine that the Jews control the world, or the banking system, or at least the media, and that they are to blame for everything from global warming to the September 11 attacks.</p> \n<p>I would say to the anti-Semites: Get over it. Jews may be a very interesting people, but when you look at the big picture, you must realize that they have had a very limited impact on the world. Throughout history, humans have created hundreds of different religions and sects. A handful of them – Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Confucianism and Buddhism – influenced billions of people (not always for the best). The vast majority of creeds – such as the Bon religion, the Yoruba religion and the Jewish religion – had a far smaller impact. One of the central and most beautiful values of Judaism is modesty. We would do well to take this value to heart.</p> \n<p>Prof. Yuval Noah Harari lectures at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is the author of “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,” and of “Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow” (forthcoming in English). His website: www.ynharari.com</p>",

        "text":["<p>A growing number of journalists and intellectuals are fleeing Turkey, following a major crackdown on the press in the aftermath of last month’s unsuccessful military coup that tried to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p> \n<p>In a climate of fear where those who decide to stay are bowing to self-censorship, they warn that the country now risks being bereft of any independent media sources to hold the increasingly autocratic AKP government to account.</p> \n<p>Information that doesn’t conform to AKP party narratives on crucial issues like investigations into the failed coup, the ongoing military repression of the Kurds or the huge influx of refugees is becoming “almost extinct.” So says Bulent Mumay, a former Hurriyet journalist who has just been released after spending four days in police detention. He warns that “the obliteration of an independent press will have dire consequences on [Turkish] democracy.”</p> \n<p>In a seemingly unprecedented attempt to cleanse the media of journalists affiliated to “Hizmet” – the movement linked to Fethullah Gulen, the onetime ally of Erdogan but now living in exile in Pennsylvania – more than 130 media institutions have been shuttered; hundreds of press cards have been revoked; 89 arrest warrants have been issued against journalists, with 61 journalists detained.</p> \n<p>“No wonder a massive brain drain is currently underway. I expect many more government critics and journalists to leave Turkey for Europe, and try to do their job from there for some time to come,” says a former editor of Zaman, which was Turkey’s first daily broadsheet but was formally closed by the state 12 days after the July 15 coup.</p> \n<p>“The more critical voices leave, the more authoritarian Turkey becomes,” he says, adding, “Like the progressive intelligentsia that left Iran in 1979, I hope our intellectual diaspora will be able to enlighten the outside world on the true nature of the Erdogan regime.”</p> \n<p>Like other publications linked to the “Hizmet” movement, Zaman had already been put under “trusteeship” by the government last March, which translated into an overhaul of its staff and editorial stance.</p> \n<p>“I have lived in Brussels ever since the paper was seized by the government last March. It was too risky for me to remain in Turkey,” says Sevgi Akarcesme, the former editor-in-chief of the English edition of Zaman.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, Akarcesme was notified that her passport had been canceled by the Turkish government, after she boarded a flight to New York, and she was escorted off the plane by border police. According to Turkish Interior Minister Efkan Ala, 75,000 people linked to the failed coup have had their passports canceled.</p> \n<p>“On the same day,” continues Akarcesme, “Turkish police raided my house in Istanbul, confiscating books – including the biography of the prophet Mohammed by preacher Gulen.</p> \n<p>“At Zaman, we never denied being influenced by Gulen’s teachings on tolerance and interreligious dialogue,” she says. “But we have nothing to do with the failed coup and were frightened by the bombing of the Parliament in the capital like everyone else,” she adds, referring to the most shocking event on the night of the coup, when Turkish F-16 planes bombed the parliament building, aiming at the office of the prime minister.</p> \n<p>Gulen had been an ally of Erdogan within the Islamist camp until a rift developed in 2013. He has since been accused of nurturing a “parallel state” of loyalists who infiltrated Turkish institutions.</p> \n<p>The government and President Erdogan have interpreted the attempted military coup as Gulen’s make-or-break attempt to wrest power from them. In turn, purges have ensued against his alleged affiliates – ranging from the army and police to the judiciary, and from civil servants to academics. Members of the so-called “Gulenist press” are accused of spreading bogus, antigovernment propaganda and being partially implicated in the failed coup as part of Gulen’s “fifth column” in Turkey.</p> \n<p>“I believe the authorities are also targeting people disconnected from the movement,” says Mumay, still recovering from the shock of his four-day police detention.</p> \n<p>He believes the goal is to create “an intentional climate of fear where obedient journalists make it easier to steer public opinion,” in the aftermath of a coup “engineered by a broad coalition of forces, probably also including elements of the ‘Hizmet’” movement.</p> \n<p>Orhan Kemal Cengiz is a former columnist at Zaman, as well as a human rights lawyer representing the paper before the Constitutional Court, in a case concerning the legality of its trusteeship. He says he was detained over a tweet he made 18 months ago, where he criticized arbitrary arrests of people who had given donations to Gulen-related institutions.</p> \n<p>Cengiz labels himself as an “atheist,” making police allegations that he might be associated to the Islamist Gulenist movement “simply ludicrous,” he says.</p> \n<p>“I am planning to bring the Zaman case to the European Court of Human Rights,” he adds. This would add to an already lengthy backlog of pending freedom of expression cases on Turkey there.</p> \n<p>Renate Schroeder, director of the European Federation of Journalists, confirms that many Turkish journalists who were abroad on the day of the coup are choosing not to return home. “I recommend everyone to keep away from the country,” she says. “Even those who have nothing to do with Gulen risk arbitrary arrest and detention.”</p> \n<p>Her organization has launched an international campaign of solidarity with Turkish journalists, encouraging members to send protest letters to Turkish embassies around the world.</p> \n<p>The Freedom in the World 2016 report classified the Turkish press as “not free,” while the World Press Freedom Index by Reporters without Borders ranked it 151st among 180 countries – and that was before the current crackdown on freedom of speech in the aftermath of the military coup.</p> \n<p>In its Turkey overview, the Freedom in the World report criticized a “discriminatory accreditation system,” the use of the penal code and extensive antiterrorism laws against journalists in a judicial system where they “do not generally receive fair treatment,” as well as “systematic political pressure from the executive branch.”</p> \n<p>Lack of media freedom is a long-standing obstacle in Turkey’s accession process to the European Union, as highlighted most recently in the Commission’s latest progress report on Turkey last November.</p> \n<p>“One major issue is the concentration of media ownership in large private holdings that make their profits elsewhere, be it in energy or constructions,” says academic and Turkey analyst Michelangelo Guida, head of the political science department at 29 Mayis University in Istanbul.</p> \n<p>“Corporations whose stakes are highly dependent on public procurement have no interest in jeopardizing relations with the government for the sake of promoting an independent press,” he adds.</p> \n<p>However, “you cannot compare the current climate to the situation prior to the state of emergency,” says Duygu Guvenc, the diplomatic correspondent at Cumhuriyet, whose editor-in-chief, Can Dundar, was arrested last year after providing evidence that Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT) was trying to supply arms to Syrian rebels.</p> \n<p>Selcuk Gultasli is the former Brussels bureau chief of Zaman, and he says he has no intention of going back to Turkey anytime soon. He speaks of “many instances where families of fellow journalists haven’t heard back from their arrested loved ones for days – even two weeks in the case of Ibrahim Karayegen,” referring to a Turkish journalist who was detained last month.</p> \n<p>Such prolonged periods of silence are particularly worrisome, because Amnesty International reported on cases of torture during detentions related to the failed coup. Index, an international platform for the protection of freedom of expression, has reported that the wife of journalist Bulent Korucu – who is on the run following an arrest warrant for him – has been detained by police in his stead.</p> \n<p>This case of family retribution is reminiscent of the case of Yasmine Taskin, a Sabah journalist who was fired in 2014 after her husband, Marco Ansaldo, interviewed Gulen for Italian daily La Repubblica.</p> \n<p>“The situation is worse for us than in the days of the coup in 1980,” says Gultasli, referring to the successful military takeover 36 years ago, after which the junta imprisoned 85,000 people, including many journalists and intellectuals.</p> \n<p>Affected journalists disagree on whether Turkey can still be called a democracy. “I believe we should wait until the shock of the failed coup is over before drawing our conclusions,” says Zaman lawyer and former columnist Cengiz. “When the dust settles, we will see whether the current autocratic drive is due to exceptional circumstances or simply our new normal. A captive press could well be the prologue to the end of democracy.”</p> \n<p>Hisyar Ozsoy, vice chair of the Kurdish opposition party (HDP), is more negative, though, as he speaks from the bombed-out parliament building in Ankara. “Turkey is in a state of nature where no rule of law seems to be protecting people’s rights anymore. Sheer power is the only thing that counts,” he concludes.</p>",

She wasted her entire tenure as health minister studying the material in a course called the German Committee. As social affairs minister, Meir Cohen established the Alalouf Committee to Fight Poverty in Israel, little of which has remained.</p> \n<p>The finance minister — Lapid, as you will recall — took it upon himself to battle rising home prices. He wasted a lot of time setting up a government agency that would build 150,000 rental apartments. That generated a few sporadic projects. The zero-value added tax plan was buried long ago, and housing prices continue to rise.</p> \n<p>Lapid fought to the death to impose criminal sanctions on Haredi draft evaders. The sanctions were canceled. He invested all his political capital into fighting to have all Haredi schools teach the core curriculum; two weeks ago that law was also dumped. Lapid also promised cabinets with 18 ministers, and no ministers without portfolio. Ha!</p> \n<p>On the Yesh Atid website there’s a section called “Reforms carried out.” Here are some of its headlines about those reforms. Under “Cost of living,” one of the party’s central objectives, it says “putting white cheese under price supervision.” Wow. Under “Holocaust survivors,” it lists, “a calculator for Holocaust survivors’ rights.” For that it was really worth entering the Knesset.</p> \n<p>Under “changing the system of government,” the achievement was, “no-confidence motions will be debated only once a month.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the first to welcome that. </p> \n<p>Along with the reforms “carried out,” there’s also a category called “Reforms stymied by Netanyahu.” For the last interview I did with Netanyahu, I came with numerous questions about promises that weren’t kept. His standard answer was “The citizens of Israel didn’t give me enough power to carry that out.” </p> \n<p>Lapid long ago adopted this approach. But recent polls position him as the only viable rival to Netanyahu (at least so long as Isaac Herzog continues to stubbornly destroy the Labor Party). </p> \n<p>People like me might have to swallow hard, but in the end we will prefer Lapid over Netanyahu.

        "text":["<p> Exactly two months ago, missiles were fired at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.</p> \n<p> A million residents sat in shelters, and tens of thousands of reservists received emergency call-up orders. Politicians angrily demanded that the Israel Defense Forces “destroy the Hamas government,” television military correspondent Roni Daniel sent his commanders to wipe out a neighborhood in Gaza, and political commentators claimed that by embarking on a military operation in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “is trying to steal the elections.”</p> \n<p> All this took place just two months ago yet oddly, Operation Pillar of Defense and its consequences have already disappeared completely from the public and political discourse in Israel.  The largest military operation in Netanyahu’s second term was also absent from the television summaries of 2012 and from the election broadcasts that began last week. Rightly so, it seems, since all the victory speeches paled in comparison with Hamas’ celebrations in the Gaza Strip and its growing popularity in Judea and Samaria since the end of the operation.</p> \n<p> Those running the political campaigns don’t even have a “victory picture” to display. It’s the Palestinians who have one this time, after a precise strike by a Fajr-5 missile on a residential building in Rishon Letzion.  The details of the agreement signed between Israel and the leaders of the Hamas movement have not yet been revealed to the public. Yet it is already clear that, in terms of the attempted policy of the past government, the operation was a failure. Israel’s leaders were forced to yield – at a high diplomatic price – on most of the issues over which they had insisted in recent years, in exchange for an end to the firing of missiles at Israel.  As part of the agreement, the crossings to the Gaza Strip from Sinai were reopened. Palestinian fishermen are now permitted to sail out to sea, farther than ever before (six miles, double the previous limit). The owners of fields in the separation zone created near the security fence were permitted to cultivate their lands once again, after many years of threats and shooting. Goods that were not allowed to enter the Strip until now – such as cars and trucks, building materials and fuels – have been transported freely from Egypt in recent weeks. &nbsp; A senior military source said this week that “major changes” have also been instituted in the targeted assassination policy and the instructions on opening fire. “The IDF has never before been as restricted as now, as a result of the cease-fire,” he said.  Prof. Yagil Levy of the Open University, who researches civil-military relations, believes that Operation Pillar of Defense ended in a colossal failure. “In military terms, of course the operation can be treated as an achievement, as the government ministers are trying to do,” he says. “In the balance of blood, Israel may have killed about 160 Palestinians while only six Israelis were killed. A ground operation in Gaza was prevented, while the IDF retained its deterrence against Hamas. The performance of the Iron Dome [antimissile] system was also impressive. But the operation actually revealed to Hamas and the world Israel’s weakness and the limits to its freedom of operation.”  Levy calls this weakness the “death hierarchy” in his sixth book, “Israel’s Death Hierarchy: Casualty Aversion in a Militarized Democracy,” recently published by NYU Press. The book centers around Levy’s claim that, over time, there have been substantial changes in the blood price that Israeli society is willing to pay in military confrontations. These changes, according to Levy, have in recent years brought the army to a position of weakness and restricted its ability to accomplish its missions. This weakness is reflected, for example, in the Second Lebanon War, Operation Cast Lead [2008-09] and, mainly, in Operation Pillar of Defense.  The changes Levy points out are not quantitative, since there will always be victims in wars, but he claims the reality demonstrates that these victims will come from different sectors of the population each time.  Levy does not judge the process that led to the present hierarchy in terms of good or bad. He describes it as one that “is carried out in temporary agreements between the state and its citizens,” and says there is no guiding hand or policy of an individual government behind it. But he points to numerous ethical problems that arise in the course of the process and warns of the dangers that await at its conclusion.  Levy was born and raised in Ramat Gan. He served in the Armor Corps and became a branch head in the Operations Division of the General Staff, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. After his discharge he began academic studies; his doctoral thesis dealt with the role of the army in shaping the social order. In his books and research, Levy examines the triangular relationship between the army, society and the political arena. He focuses mainly on the effect of the social factors on military policy.  The price of sacrifice  In his book “Israel’s Materialist Militarism’” (in English), he formulated the “republican equation” – which constitutes a cornerstone of his research and his present book. The equation defines the balance of social, political and economic rights granted to the citizen, and especially his social networks, in exchange for the potential sacrifice of his life during the course of military service. The republican equation affects individuals and population groups. For example, a senior officer who is discharged from the army can exchange his status in the civilian job market and receive a lucrative job. The kibbutz movement also received additional privileges for many years due to the willingness of its sons to sacrifice for society.  In Levy’s new book, the death hierarchy is demonstrated on a graph composed of two axes. One is based on “the level of freedom of choice of the social group the state is likely to sacrifice.” This means, primarily, the willingness of that group to sacrifice, and this choice is of course derived in every group from its motivation and its interests. The increase in the number of combat soldiers from the religious Zionist community in recent decades, for example, and their increased readiness for sacrifice, faithfully reflects the desire of young people from this sector to penetrate to the heart of the old elites.  The second variable that affects the location in the blood hierarchy is derived from “the political cost that results from their choice, especially when the state fails to justify the death beyond question.” This variable depends on the political and social power of the group that is paying the price.  According to this concept, disrupting the lifestyle of Tel Aviv residents in Operation Pillar of Defense, for example, was not equal to the price paid by residents of the south during the many months of rocket fire.  The meeting point between the two variables on the graph shapes the death hierarchy and locates the various populations along it. According to Levy’s concept, army reservists are currently at the top of the pyramid. In his opinion, their blood is the most highly valued in Israeli society. He claims they are usually more involved in the political arena than soldiers doing compulsory service, and are perceived by the Israeli public as social activists.  Next in the hierarchy are regular soldiers from among the old elites, secular young men from the middle class. Below them, in descending order, are religious soldiers and combat soldiers from among the lower economic classes and from the periphery of the country. Surprisingly, at present there are two civilian populations at the bottom of Levy’s hierarchy of death. The first is Israeli residents of the periphery. At the end of the list is the enemy civilian population.  Yagil writes that, if in the 1950s Ashkenazi soldiers (of European origin) set out to endanger their lives in defense of Mizrahi civilians (of North African or Middle Eastern origin) in the periphery, today the hierarchy is inverted. He claims that the changes in society during the past decades have led the army to overprotection of the lives of its soldiers, sometimes at the expense of the civilian population. He offers an angle of observation of Israeli society, by means of the process that has led to the new situation.  “Experience teaches that changes in the death hierarchy and in the image of the State of Israel take place only under circumstances in which the costs of war become too high,” he says. “As long as we are able to create economic growth and maintain a low number of casualties in military conflicts, no protest arises and the social and political price of the conflict is not high. In that case the government can continue with its policy.  “In that sense, Operation Pillar of Defense, for example, is considered cheap, perhaps even more so than usual. The economy was barely affected and the number of Israeli casualties was relatively low, certainly among high-ranking population groups. This is true not only of localized clashes, but of the very existence of the conflict. As long as it is not too expensive, there will be no change. That is apparently why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or the discussion of sharing the burden of military service, were not central to the discourse prior to the election.”  Changes in the death hierarchy, according to Levy, take place when the government has difficulty justifying the blood price in the sacrifice of a specific group. The death of many reservists in a failed military operation, for example, would, in his opinion, be seen by the Israeli public in a much harsher light – and perhaps even as less legitimate – than the death of the same number of conscript soldiers. In such a situation, both the army and government would be forced to change their policies.  Another change in the hierarchy takes place as a result of a change in “the level of freedom of choice of the various population groups.” Levy predicts that about 20 years from now, the percentage of religious Zionists serving as combat soldiers will decline. “From their point of view, too, the point will come when the need to penetrate the mainstream of Israeli society will weaken, as will their enthusiasm for the army and their willingness to sacrifice. Their place in the hierarchy will rise at the expense of another population, just as happened with the sabras [native-born Israelis], afterward with the Mizrahi community and with the immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia.”  And when there are no large reserves for another wave of immigration, who will take their place at the bottom of the hierarchy? “The social gap creates reserves, which is also why it is maintained. In that situation there will always be a broad periphery that regards sacrifice as their entry route to society. There will always be work migrants whose children will be granted Israeli citizenship via their military service. That’s why it’s the nature of the sacrificing elites to keep changing.”  Changing values  The Israeli consensus still finds it difficult to accept Levy’s research. It deviates from political correctness and undermines such concepts as the “people’s army.” According to Levy, “Only after the Second Lebanon War, when the picture on the issue was clear, did Israeli public opinion begin to deal with it.” He thinks the academic world underwent a similar process several years earlier, “although there too, there are still places where this discussion is not legitimate.”  “I find that argument repugnant,” says Prof. Asa Kasher, from Tel Aviv University, in reference to Levy’s central thesis. He has yet to read the book, but after hearing the argument it presents, calls it “a mish-mash of considerations and ideas.” Kasher, who was one of the authors of the IDF ethical code, finds it difficult to accept the discussion of blood price.  “First of all we have to realize that demographics in the State of Israel are undergoing a process of change, and because there is compulsory service, the demographics in the army are changing as well. That’s why the internal changes in kibbutz society and in religious society have led to a change that is also reflected in military service. These are internal changes within the groups that don’t attest to changes in Israeli society as a whole. Two-thirds of the kibbutzim, for example, are no longer kibbutzim. They don’t educate their children to take on social responsibilities like their fathers and grandfathers. National religious society, on the other hand, now wants to assume broader social responsibility. That’s why they have mekhinot [pre-army programs combining Torah study and military preparation], and the rabbis send them to elite units. These are changes that have taken place within the groups. There’s no clandestine hand here that is causing them to change.”  Regarding the second variable in Levy’s graph, concerning the social and political price required to justify the sacrifice of the members of a specific population, Prof. Kasher argues, “The justification is supposed to meet the requirements of a democratic country, and it must be egalitarian. A democratic country has values-based considerations that are not dependent on demographics, on the government or on social trends. They are derived from the type of democratic regime that is, in essence, concerned with human life. We have an ethos in which everyone defends everyone else. That doesn’t actually happen, because there are groups that don’t serve, but I see it as the labor pains of a democratic country. At the end of the process, everyone will serve and everyone will defend everyone else. That’s why we must not, and cannot, implement such a hierarchical division.”  On the other hand, Maj. Gen. (res.) Elazar Stern, who served as the head of the Human Resources Directorate on the General Staff, is willing to accept the hierarchy presented by Levy, but with certain reservations. He also emphasizes that he has yet to read the book, but argues that the theory it presents reflects “the great tragedy of Israeli society.”  “I think the issue comes from below rather than above,” Stern says. “That’s why the question is not which population the country will find it easy to sacrifice, but which populations will be ready to bear the sacrifice.”  Stern says that “Young religious Zionists seem to contribute more, but that’s not from a desire to stand out, but because of their education. And still, their percentages in combat units are far lower than those of young people from kibbutzim and moshavim. At least that’s how it was during the period when I served as the head of the Human Resources Directorate. The difference was that the young people from agricultural settlements were less likely to become officers. In my opinion, that’s mainly a matter of identification with the army’s activities. They want to contribute and go to the most combat-oriented units; some even sign up for the professional army, but they choose not to continue in the army and not to take positions of leadership when it’s hard for them to identify with the missions on which they are sent.”  Stern believes there will be a similar counterreaction when a diplomatic process that is likely to lead to the evacuation of settlements begins. “Then it will be difficult for members of the national religious sector to identify with the mission, and their motivation to do meaningful military service will decline.”  Stern sees the entry of the civilian population into the equation as the principal danger in Levy’s hierarchy. “That’s the most worrisome stage. In recent years there has been confusion regarding values, which is a disaster in a democratic country. I said that at the end of the Second Lebanon War, too. We attribute too much importance to the lives of IDF soldiers at the expense of civilian lives. In this situation, it’s no coincidence that Operation Pillar of Defense began, absurdly, because of firing at an IDF jeep rather than as a result of firing at Be’er Sheva.”  Sparing the soldiers  Yagil marks the entry of Israel’s civilian population into the equation with the first withdrawal from Lebanon, which took place in 1985. “That was a unilateral withdrawal that was carried out without an agreement or guarantees, despite the fear that it would endanger the residents of the north. That withdrawal was the result of a protest that arose among the public and in the army, tipping the balance in favor of taking the risk. Placing the population in the range of fire in order to spare the blood of soldiers was even more common during the second withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000. Since then, it’s the dominant trend.”  Levy’s opinion, as presented in the book, is that the Four Mothers movement, which led the protest prior to the withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, was the first to raise the dilemma presented by the new hierarchy. “The movement raised a question,” he says, “not about the justice of the war but about its blood price, particularly in the wake of the helicopter disaster. [In February 1997, 73 IDF soldiers were killed when two helicopters collided in northern Israel. The helicopters were supposed to have crossed the border into Israel’s “security zone” in Lebanon.] In that sense, the movement presented a new concept: that soldiers are entitled to protection equal to that of civilians along the border.”  Levy also sees the release of Palestinian prisoners and Hezbollah fighters in the latest prisoner exchange deals as a choice by Israeli society to set the blood price of kidnapped soldiers higher than that of the civilian population. Stern – who ran in the election on the Hatnuah slate – says that’s we he “was opposed to the Shalit deal” (the prisoner exchange in return for captive soldier Gilad Shalit). “It displayed this absurdity in the clearest possible way.”  Levy maintains that public criticism of placing a civilian population in danger in order to protect combat forces reached a height in the Second Lebanon War. “In many cases, army commanders refrained from sending soldiers to areas from which rockets were being fired at civilian communities, fearing for the soldiers’ lives. As a result, for the first time there was widespread public criticism of the new order of priorities.”  According to Levy, this criticism placed the enemy civilian population, which until now was not part of the equation at all, at the bottom of the pyramid. He says, “One of the lessons of the Second Lebanon War was the “Dahiya doctrine,” which was formulated by the new Deputy Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot, who at the time was serving as the head of the Operations Directorate on the General Staff. According to this doctrine, IDF forces initiated attacks against a variety of civilian infrastructures in the Dahiya neighborhood in southern Beirut, in order to create deterrence at a minimal risk to the combat forces. Then came Operation Cast Lead, which illustrated this attitude even more clearly. That was when commanders and politicians said for the first time: ‘We have to protect our soldiers, even at the expense of the enemy population.” As the Dahiya doctrine said, “We won’t send ground forces to a rocket-launching area, for example. Instead of endangering them, we will destroy the entire village or the neighborhood from which they were fired, from a distance, using planes or artillery.”  Levy believes this concept represents one of the greatest dangers in the new hierarchical structure. “In addition to the obligation to protect the lives of enemy civilians in the context of various international conventions, the prevailing concept in other armies in the world maintains that, in effect, that is the operational necessity. British and American researchers have been claiming very clearly in recent years that ‘protecting the force’ in Iraq and Afghanistan has become the central issue, sometimes even at the expense of carrying out the military assignment. They argue that in the long run, a peripheral strike at innocent bystanders clearly harms interests and security, and in the final analysis endangers the soldiers even more.”  In recent years, U.S. Army commanders have also understood the paradox that overprotection of the force endangers it even more. Gen. David Petraeus, as commander of the multinational force in Iraq and commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, led this train of thought. He made a firm decision that protection of the civilian population had to be placed higher in the hierarchy of missions.  “He understood the need to capture the hearts and minds of the citizens too,” Levy says. “He understood that overprotection of the army’s forces unavoidably leads to greater harm to the population, and that the resulting alienation leads to an increase in hostility and turns the uninvolved population into an enemy. His conclusion was ‘There’s no choice, we have to endanger our soldiers more.’”  Could such an idea be accepted in the Israeli army as well?  Unfortunately, what the Americans realized thousands of kilometers from home, we have yet to recognize several dozen meters from Gaza. We regularly manage to create only a hostile awareness of the enemy. And you see that in the sweeping support that Hamas is now receiving in Gaza and the West Bank.”  Prof. Kasher also refuses to accept this part of Levy’s equation. “They spoke about purity of arms in Tel Hai in the 1930s. Already then they determined that it’s possible and necessary to use weapons only for the purpose of self-defense. The problem is that the situation has changed, not the values. Against the Syrian army, for example, we have clear rules on the use of weapons. Army versus army, and in such situations you conduct the battles according to classic principles of the just war.  “Now we’re fighting against people who are located within a civilian population,” Kasher adds. “They keep their mat?riel there and fight from there. As an army, you now have to make decisions you didn’t have to make in the past. And I think that the reality has given rise to such questions and that the army has provided good solutions. In my opinion, there has been no change in the Israeli value system regarding other populations.  “The Americans fought in Afghanistan in two phases,” he continues. “At first against the Taliban. Then they caused great collateral damage, even more than we did here. But that was a war, a purely military action. From a certain moment, when a government was formed in Afghanistan, the Americans fought alongside them against the rebels. That’s not war in the classic sense. When you operate against rebels, you try to protect the population, you come to its assistance so that the regime will be calmer. That’s the reason for the change in the American attitude to collateral damage and to increasing the protection of the lives of uninvolved citizens.”  Like Kasher, Stern finds it difficult to accept Levy’s argument regarding the change in the status of the enemy population in the equation. “I think we understood the Petraeus doctrine long before he did. You have to see the numbers, what percentage of the Palestinian dead were innocent bystanders. I’m certain that they are far lower than those of the Americans in Afghanistan or the NATO forces in Kosovo.”  Asymmetrical wars  Levy believes the hierarchy of death, as it is arranged now, will have to change. “On the assumption that the international community won’t allow Israel to cause too much harm to civilians, the government will undergo a long-term process of moderation and restraint. We have to understand that Operation Cast Lead demonstrated that, under certain circumstances, the international community can grant limited legitimacy to harming civilians. But it also set the limits. The moment a ground invasion began and there was a need to protect the force, there was a dramatic increase in the number of Palestinian dead. The world will no longer agree to accept that. In Operation Pillar of Defense, too, during the first days there was a relatively small number of Palestinian casualties. That enabled the army to operate. Israel would have lost its legitimacy the moment there was a ground invasion with overprotection of the force, which would have led to killing civilians. And this was understood in Israel and within Hamas, too. Israel exposed its major weakness.”  Israel has not received international legitimacy for the occupation either, but it continues.  “It continues because it is cheap, in economic and human terms, for us as Israelis,” says Levy. “And also because Israeli society does not see any cheaper alternative at the moment. After all, a population cannot be left under occupation, which contradicts international legitimacy, over the long-term. There’s a reason why our diplomatic status is steadily deteriorating, but the price Israeli society is paying is still not high enough for it to decide to behave differently.”  In Levy’s opinion, Israeli society is paying a relatively low price for the occupation and its wars, largely thanks to advanced technology. The Iron Dome defense system, for example, significantly reduced the number of casualties among the civilian population in Operation Pillar of Defense, and enabled more freedom of activity for the army. Thanks to technology, precise missiles hit targets in Gaza and the entry of the infantry was avoided – and with it the risk to soldiers, whose blood price in the hierarchy of death is higher than that of civilians. Air force pilots, whose status is even higher, flew few sorties over Gaza due to the increased use of unmanned aircraft.  The use of advanced technology also has limits, though. In addition to discussing the ethical and legal questions that arise as a result of using these methods, Levy suggests returning to the death hierarchy. He claims that “technology has created asymmetrical wars, which have led to the loss of criteria for defining the terms ‘victory’ or ‘defeat.’ Israel did not ‘win’ in Operation Cast Lead or Operation Pillar of Defense. Hamas today is stronger than ever. The United States did not ‘win’ in Iraq or Afghanistan. Both are torn among ethnic groups, under unstable regimes. And in both, Islamic terror organizations are operating.  “Victory is achieved today through international legitimacy, but also through legitimacy among the population of enemy countries as well. The Americans realized in Iraq and Afghanistan that if they don’t capture the hearts of the inhabitants, no technology can win. The enslavement to technology, just like overprotection of the force, had led until then to the opposite outcome. Here we’re still talking about the need to sear the enemy’s awareness, and don’t understand that we have to sear exactly the opposite awareness.” &nbsp;</p> \n<p> &nbsp;</p> \n<p> &nbsp;</p> \n<p>   &nbsp;</p>",

Maybe a soldier with a hole in his pocket?</p> \n<p>“The coin may reflect the presence of the Roman army in the region some 2,000 years ago – possibly in the context of activity against Bar Kochba supporters in the Galilee – but it is very difficult to determine that on the basis of a single coin,” says Donald T. Ariel, head curator of the coin department at the IAA.</p> \n<p>“Historical sources describing the period note that some Roman soldiers were paid a high salary of three gold coins, the equivalent of 75 silver coins, each payday. Because of their high monetary value, soldiers were unable to purchase goods in the market with gold coins, as the merchants could not provide change for them,” Ariel adds.</p> \n<p>Several non-gold coins minted by Trajan have been found in Israeli digs, as well as two other gold ones: one in Givat Shaul, a Jerusalem neighborhood, and one in Kiryat Gat, a city in the south of the country. However, they were not of the commemorative series.</p> \n<p>This extraordinary find was made by Laurie Rimon, who lives on Kibbutz Kfar Blum in the Upper Galilee, and had hiked with a group to an archaeological site that the IAA declines to name, for fear that enthusiasts might start arriving in droves and digging. Picking it up after noticing it in the grass, Rimon realized it was an ancient gold coin.</p> \n<p>The group’s guide, Irit Zuk-Kovacsi, contacted the IAA and within two hours, says the authority, it sent over a representative, who took charge of the find.</p> \n<p>“It was not easy parting with the coin,” Rimon confessed.</p> \n<p>The IAA has announced that it will award Rimon a certificate of appreciation for good citizenship, as not everybody hands over archaeological finds that they serendipitously make – let alone gold coins of clearly ancient provenance.</p>",

        "text":["<p>On August 16, the Polish cabinet approved a bill, drafted by the Justice Ministry, that would impose prison terms of up to three years on anyone convicted of referring to the death camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland as “Polish.” Claiming that the Poles collaborated with the Nazis in exterminating the Jews would also be a criminal offense.</p> \n<p>Predictably, the decision evoked a strong reaction from Yad Vashem, in Jerusalem. The director of the Holocaust museum and archive, Avner Shalev, said there were many instances in which Poles murdered Jews during the Holocaust and participated in atrocities. Therefore, he said, the new law could lead to a distortion of the facts concerning the Holocaust. The head of Yad Vashem’s International Institute for Holocaust Research, Prof. Dan Michman, said no law could negate what is known about Poles’ role in the Holocaust. Prof. Yehuda Bauer, an academic adviser to Yad Vashem, said: “A law that imposes punishment on someone who says Poles participated in the murder of Jews contains a total lie.”</p> \n<p>Let it be said right away: This bill is shameful. Not because it denies the Holocaust, as some claim. It does not. Nor would it punish anyone for saying that Poles murdered Jews. It’s shameful because it adds Poland to those states that avoid acknowledging injustices they have committed and even that they occurred. Israel is a member of this dishonorable club. Turkey’s denial of the Armenian genocide is the most famous example. But the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe also did not accept responsibility in the past for their murder of Jews and other minorities during World War II: specifically, Romania, Hungary, Ukraine, Lithuania and Latvia (which were part of the Soviet Union), Croatia (which was part of Yugoslavia), and also Poland. But Poland, in contrast to Romania and Hungary, was not authorized by Nazi Germany to exterminate Jews. Unlike Lithuanians and Ukrainians, Poles were not recruited into organized mass killing units. They murdered their Jewish neighbors for various reasons, in terrible ways, and apparently in large numbers. But they were not responsible for the Holocaust of Polish Jewry.</p> \n<p>If you actually read what Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro wrote about the law, you see that he is correct on several points. He says that Poles cannot consent to victims of the Nazi terror being portrayed as collaborators in the Holocaust, as responsible for murder in the concentration camps, to essentially being charged with genocide. Factually this is correct. Accusing the Poles of responsibility for the genocide is a distortion of the historic truth. The minister also said that the tendency to attribute the killing of Polish Jews to the Poles not only slanders Poland but also violates the memory of the Polish tragedy under the years of Nazi occupation. Between the lines, of course, hides a worrisome revisionist history. The law is meant to block attempts to reveal the truth about the murder of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust. The Polish government is trying to assimilate the outlook of a nationalist, antiliberal regime that aims to redefine the Polish national identity and historical memory. In Poland these issues cannot be addressed without addressing the murder of the Jews.</p> \n<p>However, the new law is also part of a counterreaction to the discourse that has developed in Polish scholarship on the Holocaust over the past 20 years. Ever since historian Jan Tomasz Gross detailed the murder of the Jews in the town of Jedwabne by their Polish neighbors, Holocaust research in Poland has come to focus largely on one thing: the Poles’ treatment of their Jewish neighbors. One could generalize and say that Holocaust scholarship in Poland is primarily the study of the hostile, often lethal relationship of the Poles to their Jewish neighbors during the years of the German occupation.</p> \n<p>A small group of Polish historians has devoted many years of study to this subject. They have taken on a most important task: uncovering a chapter in Polish history that has been long ignored. But in their efforts to uncover exactly what happened in the towns and villages in which Poles informed on Jews who were in hiding, where Jews were blackmailed by their neighbors in return for their silence, or sometimes killed so that their property could be stolen — this research has lost sight of the big picture to some degree. For while examining the murderous, anti-Semitic tendency that was let out of the bottle in Poland with German help, one cannot neglect to consider the broader perspective of a country that was being crushed by violent terror unlike that in any of the other occupied countries.</p> \n<p>The historical picture is not complete if one tells about the killing of Jews by their Polish neighbors without also mentioning, for example, the labor camps that were in operation in those same areas, and in which many Poles found their deaths. The murderous Nazi violence was applied in different ways and hurt different parts of the society. The patterns of violence fed one another, and thus must be examined as a whole, while noting their points of similarity and difference. In Holocaust scholarship in Poland, this important element has gotten lost.</p> \n<p>As noted, the Polish government is handling this complex historical question in a crude manner, and with motivations that are less than pure. Obviously, it is not the only government that refuses to accept responsibility for a historic injustice it caused to another group. The same thing can be seen in Israel’s attitude toward the Palestinian Nakba. Of course, it’s not surprising to find plenty of similarities between the Catholic-nationalist government in Poland and the Jewish-nationalist government in Israel, and not only in the dictation of an official explanation for their country’s national history.</p> \n<p>Prof. Daniel Blatman is a Holocaust historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>",

        "text":["<p>For the average Jewish Israeli, whose mind hovers between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton but whose boots are dug in at the Balata refugee camp, Hezbollah means rockets shot at Haifa. But for Arab citizens, things look different.</p> \n<p>So amid the condemnations of the Hadash and Balad parties after they objected to the Gulf states’ designation of Hezbollah as a terror group, I’ll try to shed some light on the matter for those who think Israel is the center of the universe.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah is a Lebanese organization that arose following the repression of Shi’ites in that country. According to the political compromise up there, a Christian will always be the president, a Sunni the prime minister and a Shi’ite, representing 40 percent of the population, the head of parliament.</p> \n<p>Until 2000, Hezbollah devoted all its efforts in the battle against the Israeli occupation. Clashes with Israel in 2001 and 2006 came against the backdrop of Israel’s refusal to close the file on the occupation of Lebanon.</p> \n<p>When the issue of Lebanese prisoners ended a decade ago, Hezbollah was mired in Lebanese domestic politics, and for the past four years it has been mired in the Syrian quagmire. If Israel had settled the issue of Lebanese prisoners still held after Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon, a lot of blood would have been spared.</p> \n<p>It can be said Israel is trying to open the gates of hell, settling scores on both sides of the border, on top of its daily sojourns in the skies over Lebanon. Currently, Hezbollah is seen a threat based on the arms it’s acquiring, but there has never been a report of a Hezbollah man patrolling the streets of Kiryat Shmona.</p> \n<p>Yet Hezbollah only benefits from Israel’s assessments and threats, which give it political capital in its battles in Lebanon and Syria. It makes veiled threats against Israel, which it calls the Zionist entity, such as the threat to bomb chemical plants in Haifa. These are designed to cover up the group’s involvement in the criminal morass in Syria.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah’s intervention in Syria has been generating a lot of criticism, even among the group’s leaders. After all, what business does a Lebanese party have in a Syrian civil war?</p> \n<p>It’s true that all the world’s fanatics are coming to Syria, but the main reason&nbsp; is that the Syrian regime continues to cruelly suppress any sign of democracy there. Meanwhile, Hezbollah is supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad, who claims to support the Palestinians but who opposes the Palestinians’ legitimate leadership, the PLO.</p> \n<p>Therefore the dispute with Balad and Hadash is over the way Hezbollah is operating at the moment. No concessions can be made to the organization whose sectarian face is revealed in its support for a dictator whose hands are covered with the blood of his own people.</p> \n<p>In conclusion, I’d like to crack the code regarding the conduct of the Arabs in Israel. The Arabs have been burdened with a lot of painful historical baggage since the Nakba, amid arrogant criticism of them for alleged defeatism.</p> \n<p>Every time the Arabs complain about discrimination, they’re reminded of the National Insurance Institute benefits they receive and are beseeched to thank God they’re not being slaughtered like their brothers in Syria.</p> \n<p>All this helped burnish the image of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as an answer to Israeli arrogance. But that didn’t detract from the decision of Israel's Arabs to be part of the country as citizens with equal rights.</p> \n<p>After the second Lebanon war in 2006, there was a terrible accident in Sinai in which 11 Israeli Arab tourists were killed. Amid the Egyptian rescue services’ problems, an elderly Arab woman from Israel's north said: “May Allah strengthen you, Nasrallah, and protect you, Israel.”</p> \n<p>The time has come to take off the boots and return the focus in Israel to the region – that’s where the future is being shaped.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Education Minister Naftali Bennett’s decision, announced on Tuesday, to remove Al-Midan Theater’s “A Parallel Time” from&nbsp;the list of performances made available to Israeli schools,&nbsp;contrary to an earlier decision by the ministry’s Repertoire Committee, doesn’t come as a big surprise to the play’s author and director Bashar Murkus.</p> \n<p>“Honestly, something like this doesn’t shock me anymore in this country,” he tells Haaretz after having declined for a long time to speak to the Israeli media. “What’s unusual this time is that it’s so blatant, so clear, we can see it as something that isn’t hidden. It’s frustrating and it reminds us where we’re living and how we really have to work and create art amid all this.</p> \n<p>“The only surprising thing is that all this fuss took place without anyone actually having seen the play. It has nothing to do with the play but rather with people who are afflicted with blindness, who don’t want to see and won’t give me the right to ask. If you ask me, it’s fascism.”</p> \n<p>Murkus, 22, took the inspiration for “A Parallel Time” from the story of Walid Daka, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who was convicted of involvement in the abduction and murder of Israeli soldier Moshe Tamam in 1984 and sentenced to life in prison.</p> \n<p>The play had its premiere about a year ago and in recent months has attracted controversy on a number of occasions, including when it was presented as the final event of Palestinian Prisoner Day in Haifa.</p> \n<p>In early May, the Haifa city council approved a motion by councilman Shai Blumenthal (Habayit Hayehudi) to put a one-month freeze on the municipality’s support for Al-Midan (which amounts to 1.3 million shekels this year) until a committee headed by the mayor’s deputy could examine the matter. The committee has yet to submit its recommendations, but in the interim, petitions from theater artists have been sent in support, as have some protest petitions calling on government bodies to permanently cease its support for the institution.</p> \n<p>During this time, various entities have also called on the Culture Ministry to halt support for the theater. Last week, Bennett asked the repertoire committee that determines what goes in the schools' so-called “culture basket”&nbsp;to consider removing the play from the arrangement, but the committee adhered to its approval of the play. On Wednesday, Bennett announced that he was invoking his authority as minister and removing the play immediately.</p> \n<p>Some of those who object to the play call it “a murderer’s play” or complain that it expresses sympathy for him, but Murkus thoroughly denies such criticisms. “The play is not about Walid Daka, but rather was inspired by his life story. It raises a lot of questions that he asks, that other characters ask, and that I as a director and the play’s writer ask,” he says.</p> \n<p>“It’s not about murder but about the war against time in prison. I don’t think the day will ever come when, because of what’s happened, we’ll stop putting on ‘A Parallel Time’ or stop asking what we want to ask.”</p> \n<p>How did you get to Daka’s story?</p> \n<p>“Al-Midan had asked me for a suggestion for a project, and I said I was interested in exploring the issue of political prisoners. My initial research was very general, on Israeli prisoners and foreign prisoners as well as tales from history. As I was working on it, I came upon some of Daka’s stories that were published online and I saw there was something interesting here. One of the things that really captured my interest was a letter he writes to his unborn son.</p> \n<p>“I met with his lawyer, as well as his mother and wife and brothers. I saw that his was a really big story, one that also contained within it a lot of stories of other prisoners. For us, as theater people who research a subject and start to work a play, it was very interesting raw material. In addition to the stories that were published, we got hold of some personal letters that he wrote to his family and friends. The thing we want to explore is the person within the prisoner.”</p> \n<p>Did you meet with him in prison?</p> \n<p>“No, but we wrote to each other. I asked him a ton of questions about his life, I asked him to write me what he is seeing now inside the prison. Things that are helpful to us in our theatrical research. He was very excited by our interest in him. In Palestinian theater, it’s been a long time since anyone dealt with the subject of political prisoners. I think that if we’re going to relate to them like Israel does – as numbers, or as heroes – then we’re essentially putting them in the same place. There’s no difference between a hero and a number.”</p> \n<p>The fact that you selected a person who was convicted of involvement in the kidnapping and murder of a soldier makes some people equate it with being “his play.” How does this reconcile with the claim that the play also represents the stories of other prisoners?</p> \n<p>“We thought about that a lot. In some way you see Daka, you hear him, you read that he wants a child, that he is marrying and that he’s writing and studying, that he’s earned degrees. You know he has a past and he’s done things I have a lot of questions about. It’s not an easy subject but for me, it’s very important because he’s a part of my people. I can understand why he chose this path, without agreeing or disagreeing with it. He question isn’t what I think. He did something, and now he’s in jail, but I still want to question him, to ask him questions about himself. That is something I will fight for, so I will always have this right to ask. Plays and movies have been made about much worse characters than him.”</p> \n<p>Have you ever talked to Tamam’s relatives?</p> \n<p>“No, but when I was researching I was very interested in what they had written. I collected things that were published online and that the soldier’s family posted. We don’t talk about the murder at all in the play. What I’m asking in the play is how a person fights time while in prison. That’s what interests me. As someone who makes theater I have a right to talk about my pain, because I can say something about that. But I don’t have the right to talk about others’ pain. I can’t allow myself to do that. Maybe another director needs to take this on.”</p> \n<p>Contacted for a response, the Tamam family says: “We are not interested in commenting on the statements of someone who has called Moshe’s despicable murderer a ‘hero.’”</p> \n<p>Murkus, a graduate of the University of Haifa theater department, is currently teaching there as well as at the Drama Academy in Ramallah. He recently directed “1945,” the new play being presented by Al-Midan about relations between the Arabs and British here before the founding of the state, and he also directs at other Arab theaters in Israel. He believes that theater is the place where big questions are asked, though he feels that Israeli theater usually avoids them.</p> \n<p>“This is why we have theater that's not always that interesting,” he explains. “It chooses very easy questions in order to be sure to have an audience, to make sure the subscribers will come and everything will be fine. To me that’s not theater. I do theater because I have a reason to do theater. I want to ask myself questions, to pose questions to the team I work with and to the audience. I don’t give answers.”</p> \n<p>Isn’t one aim of the theater to have the audience identify to some degree with the characters and the action on stage?</p> \n<p>“No, no, no,” Murkus furiously objects. “The aim of theater is to make the audience witness to something. That’s how I work and that’s what I believe. I have a right to talk about things that make other people angry, about people who someone else sees as enemies. Israeli theater has done a lot of plays about people whom I consider my enemies. When you do plays about the founding of the State of Israel, for example, that’s something I don’t agree with. But can I say, ‘Hey guys, don’t do it?’ No. So they also don’t have the right to tell me, ‘Don’t do it.’ Because it’s theater and it’s art. I have a right to say what I want and anyone else has a right to see it and get angry. But they absolutely do not have the right to tell me ‘Don’t do it.’”</p> \n<p>Did you ever worry that ‘“A Parallel Time” could cause financial losses?</p> \n<p>“I don’t have any financial fears about it. That doesn’t concern me. I’m only concerned with the theater as an institution, but like I said, I’m not surprised. I expected reactions. That’s why you do theater. To make something move. The annoying thing is that these reactions came out without the people having seen the play, which means it wasn’t the play itself that upset the right this time, but the fact that it depicts a prisoner as a human being, that we made a play about this and that the state’s money is going into it. The closing off of the financial pipeline to Al-Midan is scary and makes it hard for us to continue operating, but what really scares me is that if it happens this time it will be this way all the time. This is what needs to be talked about. Because it’s not happening only with ‘A Parallel Time’ but also to Arkadi Zaides [the Culture and Sport Ministry recently revoked its sponsorship of the choreographer’s show ‘Archive’]. I should realize that I’m not living in a democratic country, because this country is telling me, ‘Bashar, you can’t say what you want to say.’ I understand this now and now I’m starting to work with this thing.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Last week Lev Tahor, a small ultra-Orthodox sect that has become a reluctant globe-trotter, found itself challenged in its most recent refuge – Guatemala. While it ponders its next move, this is a good time to look at some truths, and misinformation, about extreme Jewish sect.</p> \n<p>First and foremost, it bears saying that any comparison between this movement, which the yellow press dubbed &quot;The Jewish Taliban,&quot; and the fundamentalist Islamic movement in Afghanistan, is categorically unfair. Lev Tahor is a pious, arguably overly pious, group of Jews. The Taliban has been associated with extreme violence and destruction in pursuit of imposing its views on the people under their control.</p> \n<p>In fact, the only reason the Israeli press dubbed the group the “Jewish Taliban” is that the women of Lev Tahor clad themselves in black robes from head to toe, which is how the Taliban prescribe women should appear, if appear they must.</p> \n<p>Lev Tahor, presently consisting of some 250 members, gets its name - literally “Pure Heart” - from the Biblical passage: ״Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me״ (Psalms 51:10). That well describes the philosophy of Lev Tahor leader Shlomo Helbrans, who says the group aspires to attain the utmost purity by shedding the corrupting influences that, he says, pollute mainstream ultra-Orthodox groups, let alone other forms of Judaism.</p> \n<p>This zeal to keep an extremely pious lifestyle takes on many forms. Lev Tahor adherents practice extreme kashrut regulations, making their own food from scratch to the best of their ability. They do not consume chicken or chicken eggs, which they (like some other extreme ultra-orthodox sects, such as Neturei Karta) consider non-kosher because of genetic manipulation – in other words, the birds are not as the Lord made them. Indeed, arguably chickens have undergone profound change through selective breeding, for instance to increase their thorax muscles because of the human fondness for chicken breast.</p> \n<p>They will however eat geese, whose genomes they believe remain much as originally created.</p> \n<p>Regarding meat, they only consume animals slaughtered under Helbrans' personal supervision. They do not eat the skins of vegetables - even tomatoes – lest they harbor microscopic agents of foulness, such as fungal spores. They eschew rice for fear that tiny insects are concealed in it and for the same reason they only eat lettuce on Passover – when they have no choice but to partake, because it is one of the holiday's mitzvot. But for that occasion, to maintain the required purity, the lettuce undergoes washing in a process that lasts hours.</p> \n<p>Their praying sessions are longer and louder than those in other Jewish denominations. They carefully and slowly articulate each word of prayer with great concentration and often shout the verses.</p> \n<p>As said above, their modesty in female dress is extreme even by ultra-Orthodox standards. For men, dress is nearly identical to that of other ultra-Orthodox Jews, especially to those of Satmar Hasidic sect.</p> \n<p>As for religious doctrine, Helbrans picks and chooses from different streams of Jewish sects, accepting certain traditions from the Hasidim, the Misnagdim, and Mizrahim, from which he arbitrates the most appropriate practices. The core of his doctrine is that of the extremely pious Satmar Hasidic sect, taken to the extreme.</p> \n<p>Apocalyptic prophesies</p> \n<p>The group’s leader, Helbrans was born in 1962 as Erez Shlomo Elbarnes. He was raised by secular parents in Jerusalem, but &quot;found religion&quot; during his teens and left to study at yeshiva.</p> \n<p>After moving between different ultra-Orthodox schools, he found himself in the Satmar sect. He also adopted the anti-Zionist Satmar ideology, which is why he changed his name to Shlomo Helbrans, shedding the Zionist name Erez and taking a more diaspora spelling of his last name.</p> \n<p>In the late 1980s, Helbrans began to attract a following in Jerusalem, mostly among secular Jews converted to the ultra-Orthodox lifestyle. By the decade's end he was preaching the destruction of the evil State of Israel, based on biblical prophesies.</p> \n<p>Spurred by these predictions, in 1990 he moved with a few dozen yeshiva students to Williamsburg, New York, where he founded a small yeshiva. Israeli media at the time reported that he left Israel because of an investigation into his alleged contacts with agents of extremist Islamic organizations hostile to Israel.</p> \n<p>But his stay in Williamsburg was cut short. In 1994, he was convicted of kidnapping a boy sent to study for his bar mitzvah with him. Helbrans had convinced the boy to become ultra-Orthodox and sever ties with his family.</p> \n<p>He was paroled after two years and moved with his followers to Monsey, New York, where he again ran a yeshiva. However, the local ultra-Orthodox were extremely hostile towards him, and fresh allegations started to appear in the local and Jewish press.</p> \n<p>In 2000, the United States deported Helbrans back to Israel, but he didn’t stay. Together with his followers he moved to Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, Quebec, in 2000.</p> \n<p>Helbrans sought and in 2003 received refugee status from the Canadian government, claiming he was being persecuted by Israel for his anti-Zionist views.</p> \n<p>But once again allegations of child abuse surfaced, and in 2013 after the scrutiny of the Quebec child protection services, most of his followers left the province and settled in Chatham-Kent, Ontario.</p> \n<p>Their stay there was to be short. A number of the sect’s children were placed in foster care. The group then decided to flee Canada and settle in the village of San Juan La Laguna, Guatemala, but even there, its unusual ways were contested. Just last week a council of local natives demanded that the group leave, or face being cut off from the electrical grid. A member of the group told Reuters last week that they will be seeking another Guatemalan village in which to settle.</p>",

        "text":["<p>This article was originally published June 10, 2015, and is being reupped following the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria.</p> \n<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico – This could be the only synagogue in the world where Friday night services are conducted in a mix of four languages: Hebrew, English, Spanish and Ladino, a dialect once spoken by Sephardic Jews.</p> \n<p>It is also one of the few Reform congregations in North America where membership is growing in leaps and bounds.</p> \n<p>The congregants gathered at Temple Beth Shalom as the service begins are an eclectic bunch: Toward the front of the sanctuary are many of the old-timers, mostly elderly American Jews who relocated to this island more than half a century ago when business opportunities beckoned, while the middle and back rows are crowded with younger faces, largely native Puerto Ricans who are Jews by choice or in the process of becoming such. Their rapidly growing numbers explain the membership boom at this congregation.</p> \n<p>An elderly American woman with a beehive hairdo and strong southern drawl goes up to the podium to light the Shabbat candles, while the rabbi-in-training, a young Puerto Rican convert, whispers in Spanish to the cantor – a former Argentinean, who made his way to this U.S. protectorate, like many other Jews from this South American country, about 20 years ago.</p> \n<p>No&nbsp;two stories here are alike, least of all that of Shula Feldkran, a 70-year-old ball of energy who serves as president of this congregation. Born and raised in the Tel Aviv suburb of Kfar Shmaryahu, Feldkran attended the University of Wisconsin in the 1960s, where she majored in Latin American studies. Enamored of the region, she arrived in Puerto Rico 48 years ago as an idealistic young college graduate and never left. Still a bit of a hippy at heart, Feldkran loves organizing lively jam sessions and huge potluck lunches here on Shabbat (“just like at the kibbutz”) that stretch out over the entire day.</p> \n<p>Of the 70 or so regulars who attend services here on Shabbat, 30 have already converted and 15 are in the process. “We, too, wonder why,” she acknowledges, “and it’s all been happening in the past two or three years. Some claim descent from Jewish ancestry, while others say they’re just dissatisfied with the religion they were born into.”</p> \n<p>That would include Stephanie Bermudez, a 30-year-old single mom who works as a firefighter. “Even though I was born Catholic, it never fit me,” she says during a conversation following the Friday night kiddush ceremony. “I’ve been looking for something spiritual, and after a lot of research, I decided to give this a try. It’s one of the best things I’ve ever done.”</p> \n<p>Among the other congregants munching on fresh-baked challah and other treats at the Oneg Shabbat, a weekly ritual here that follows the kiddush, are Zaiyara Adorno, a 33-year-old doctor and the daughter of Adventist priests who converted to Judaism when she was a child; Sue and Jimmy Klau, who moved here from the United States in 1966, but have since moved back and are now visiting; Gilbert Perez, a mechanic originally from Colombia who converted to Judaism two years ago (“it’s about feelings, and I felt that I was Jewish”); Thomas Gonzalez, a 28-year-old artist in the process of converting; and Anthony Cruz, the 22-year-old rabbi-in-training who was raised in an Evangelical family. Explaining his attraction to Judaism, he says: “While studying the Bible, I learned that Jesus followed the Jewish traditions, so I asked myself why aren’t we following his path? Besides that, there’s a type of inclusiveness here that other communities don’t have.”</p> \n<p>Some would claim that the Jewish community of Puerto Rico is among the oldest in the Western Hemisphere, its first members believed to have accompanied Christopher Columbus on his second journey across the Atlantic. Others rank it among the youngest, pointing out that until American Jews began arriving here in the 1940s and 1950s, first as military personnel and then as part of the “Operation Bootstrap” program aimed at industrializing the island, there was no community to speak of.</p> \n<p>The Jewbans are coming</p> \n<p>All concur, however, that it is a community in flux. The first wave of Americans – or “continentals,” as they are known here because Puerto Ricans are also American citizens even though they don’t vote in the U.S. elections – established the Conservative synagogue, which is the oldest Jewish congregation on the island and is housed in a historic building that serves as headquarters for the Jewish Community Center. A decade later they were outnumbered by a large influx of Cuban Jews fleeing the Communist regime set up under Fidel Castro. The Cubans – or “Jewbans,” as they are known here – arrived mostly penniless.</p> \n<p>“Puerto Rico was a welcoming society and it had many similar characteristics to Cuba – the language, the island life – so it was an easier transition for many of them compared with going to the United States,” explains Diego Mandelbaum, the director of the JCC, who himself is an Argentinean-born Jew, who arrived here following a stint in Havana, where he served as representative of the Joint Distribution Committee.</p> \n<p>As often happens in Jewish communities, even small ones like this, the congregants at the one and only synagogue that was around back then had their differences about how things should be done, with the Cuban contingency more rigid in its approach. And so, the Americans broke away and established their own Reform synagogue.</p> \n<p>Estimates put the size of the Puerto Rican Jewish community at anywhere between 1,000 and 3,000, the higher number including non-affiliated Jews. About half have a Cuban connection, the remainder comprised mainly of American transplants, Argentineans and a smattering of Israelis. Almost the entire community is based in the capital of San Juan. On the whole, it is a very affluent, pro-Israel community, whose members stick together. An indication of the disproportionate political clout this tiny community wields in this island of 3.8 million is its recent successful campaign to have a huge Holocaust monument erected just outside the landmark Capitol building.</p> \n<p>A dwindling community</p> \n<p>Ever since the last large batch of Jews arrived her from South America in the 1990s, the numbers have been dwindling. The reason is that most of the second generation of Puerto Rican Jews have left. “About 90 percent of the children are sent to college in the United States, and most never come back,” notes Mandelbaum. “So we are becoming a smaller and smaller community.” As a sign of the changing times, the JCC pre-school recently closed its doors because of sinking registration figures.</p> \n<p>Efforts in recent years to persuade Jews fleeing Venezuela to resettle in Puerto Rico have largely failed, most of these South Americans preferring Miami to San Juan. But over the past year or so, the Puerto Rican Jewish community has been able to recoup a small share of its losses through new tax incentives designed to lure wealthy “continentals” to its shores. Among those who have relocated to Puerto Rico thanks to these extremely generous tax breaks aimed at reinvigorating the ailing economy are quite a few rich Jewish stockbrokers and hedge fund owners from New York. “It’s a new wave of Jews, although it’s still too early to assess what the impact of this on the size of our community will be,” says Mandelbaum.</p> \n<p>In the 1970s and 1980s,many Israelis relocated here to work on agricultural projects. There are few left anymore, although in the past year or so, a new big mall in San Juan has drawn about a dozen post-army Israelis trying to make an easy buck hawking skin care products.</p> \n<p>Diana Berezdivin and Raquel Bender, who both fled Cuba in the 1960s, are pillars of the Jewish community here. “Our children are still here, but who knows what will be with our grandchildren,” says Berezdivin.</p> \n<p>Although there are no Jewish schools in San Juan, surprisingly, says Bender, most of the new generation maintain a strong sense of identity and rarely intermarry. “The reason,” she says, “is our strong affiliation with the Young Judaea movement. Our kids attend the Young Judaea camp in North Carolina every summer, and then they do a Young Judaea gap year in Israel after they graduate. They have a very strong Jewish network as a result.”</p> \n<p>David Solomiany, 43, is a rare example of someone who’s returned. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban Jews who fled Castro, he studied at Tufts University in Massachusetts before completing his law degree at Tulane. His three brothers still live in the United States, but he decided to come back. “I like it here, I was born here, and I feel I can make a difference here,” he says.</p> \n<p>A comfortable life</p> \n<p>Gregory Demel, a member of large well-known Jewish clan on the island, expresses similar sentiments. “Life is very comfortable here, and there’s hardly any anti-Semitism,” he notes. “If anything, there’s ignorance about Judaism.” Born in Puerto Rico to Holocaust survivors who were among the lucky few to get their money out of Cuba before fleeing to San Juan, he runs the family jewelry business today. That’s after a stint in the United States, where he studied at Brandeis and completed his law degree at Cordoza.</p> \n<p>At the weekly Shabbat lunch held after services at Shaare Zedek, the old-timers are having a heated discussion about current events. On one thing they seem to agree though: They don’t like U.S. President Obama. Number one, they don’t like his treatment of Israel, and number two, they don’t like his recent overtures to Cuba.</p> \n<p>Over on the other side of town, in the neighborhood of Isla Verde, Chabad is holding its weekly Shabbat lunch for about 40 congregants, most of them regulars at this time of year, considered to be the off-season. Thanks to Chabad, Puerto Rico is the only island in the Caribbean that holds the distinction of having Orthodox, Conservative and Reform congregations.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Mendel Zarchi, who has been in charge since Chabad set up base here in 1999, serves as regional director of the movement, which means he’s in charge of 10 Caribbean islands. In Puerto Rico alone, Chabad serves 30,000 meals a year.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Levi Stein, his second in command, is a well-known face on the main strip in Old San Juan, where he is quick to point out every shop with a Jewish or Israeli connection. Thanks to a $5 million fundraising campaign, the Orthodox outreach movement is now building a brand new center. “It will house the first mikveh [ritual bath] Puerto Rico’s history,” boasts Stein, a Detroit transplant.</p> \n<p>Among those who make a practice of dropping by the Chabad house in San Juan is Gal Atya, a 29-year-old who manages a cosmetic shop in the old city and is married to a Puerto Rican woman. Asked why he would trade in Israel for this Caribbean island, Atya replies: “For the sea and the sun.”</p> \n<p>And doesn’t he have that in Israel?</p> \n<p>“Not all year round,” responds Atya.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Tel Aviv, Israel’s business and cultural capital, is the center of the country’s largest metropolitan area. Liberal and wealthy, this beachfront city is all about lifestyle. Restaurants and cafes abound and are full at all hours, making some wonder whether anyone here works. The gay scene here is flourishing, and goes far beyond hot nightclubs; same-sex couples strolling with babies and strollers are a common sight.</p> \n<p>It’s known among Israelis as “the bubble,” or alternately “the Country of Tel Aviv” – disparagingly or fondly, depending on whom you’re talking to. One thing they’ll all agree on is that visitors will find no shortage of ways to keep busy.</p> \n<p>Must-Do</p> \n<p>If you have limited time in Tel Aviv, here’s what you should do:</p> \n<p>Hire a Tel-O-Fun, the green bikes available for rent at stations throughout the city, and tour through the many kilometers of bike paths. We recommend starting at Rabin Square, passing through the shaded Chen Boulevard until you reach the plaza at Habima National Theater, and then continuing down scenic Rothschild Boulevard until you reach the picturesque neighborhood of Neve Tzedek. From there, head west toward the beach and follow the coastline to the old Jaffa port.</p> \n<p>The key places to visit are Tel Aviv’s bustling Carmel Market, and perhaps also the crafts market on neighboring Nahalat Binyamin Street (open Tuesdays and Fridays), and the stone-paved alleys of the Old City of Jaffa, as well as its port and the neighboring flea market. Stop there for lunch at one of the many cafes in the market precinct, or head back at night for dinner and a drink in one of the lantern-lit alleyways.</p> \n<p>And then there’s the beach. Make sure you visit the beach! Sink your feet into some of the best sand you’ve ever encountered and lap up some Mediterranean sun. Rent beach furniture easily at one of the new machines stationed on the boardwalk and refresh yourself with a cold drink from one of the numerous waterside kiosks or restaurants (warning: the price is commensurate with the location).</p> \n<p>Different stretches of beach cater to different crowds: there’s a beach for sea sports north of Gordon; a beach popular among gay men in front of the Hilton; and a walled-off section in front of Independence Park where men and women alternate days, which caters to Orthodox Jews. You’ll notice the locals playing shesh besh (similar to backgammon) and matkot (the noisy ball-and-paddle game popular on the sand). Want to get in on the fun?&nbsp; Buy your own at beach supply stores around town, including at the Carmel Market.</p> \n<p>Neighborhoods</p> \n<p>The center of the city is known as Lev Ha’ir, literally “the heart of the city,” and it includes the White City – the UNESCO-recognized collection of Bauhaus buildings – as well as the landmark Rabin Square, Habima National Theater, the Cinematheque and Dizengoff Center. It also includes the famous King George Street and Rothschild Boulevard. The center of the city is green and walkable, as is its continuation to the north of Arlozorov Street, known as the Old North.</p> \n<p>The Old North is mainly residential, but also includes plenty of coffee shops and restaurants. South of the center you’ll find the picturesque Neve Tzedek, a tony neighborhood of low houses, little boutiques and landmarks, including the Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance and Theater – home to the renowned Batsheva Dance Company. Neve Tzedek is known for being one of the first neighborhoods in Tel Aviv. So is the neighboring Yemenite Quarter, originally founded by immigrants from Yemen. This neighborhood was until recently quite run down but has undergone an impressive facelift in recent years. It includes the Carmel Market as well as a nearly endless selection of hole-in-the-wall luncheonettes that are extremely popular among locals.</p> \n<p>South of Neve Tzedek is Florentin, a sooty neighborhood with narrow streets and lots of young, single residents. Here you’ll find plenty of bars and restaurants as well as the Levinsky Market, where vendors offer dried fruits, legumes and spices. South of Florentin you’ll find Jaffa, the ancient seaport city. The northern end of Jaffa includes the historical old city, the clock tower and the flea market area, which is bustling with fashionable restaurants and bric-a-brac to buy.</p> \n<p>Caf&eacute;s</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv is known for its coffee shops, and in this regard it’s hard to go wrong – most places that appear attractive from the outside will also be able to dish up a decent latte. Having said that, we’ve listed our favorites in this review: “The 10 Best 10 Cafes in Tel Aviv.”</p> \n<p>“Cafe hafuch” is Tel Aviv’s drink of choice, or alternately an iced coffee in the summer. Don’t be afraid to pick a coffee shop based on location alone; consider sitting at one of the coffee kiosks in the middle of Ben-Gurion Boulevard or Rothschild Boulevard, and relaxing with a drink as you people-watch. If your priority is a top-quality brew, hit up Mae, a boutique coffee roaster that imports its own beans from Costa Rica. Mae also provides beans to various coffee shops around the city, including the funky Xoho with its San Francisco vibe. The coffee chain with the best coffee is arguably LovEat – the beans are organic and fair trade, although prices are admittedly not so modest.</p> \n<p>You can get free Wi-Fi at most cafes. In fact, the municipality offers free Wi-Fi throughout much of the city. Search for the FREE_TLV network.</p> \n<p>Restaurants</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv has no shortage of good restaurants run by acclaimed chefs, and the city’s culinary scene has been drawing significant attention abroad. The most well known include Eyal Shani, whose Miznon chain of upmarket street food has expanded abroad, as well as Meir Adoni of Catit and Mizlala fame, but the quality extends far beyond those big names. There are so many restaurants to enjoy, it can be hard to narrow it down to a handful. We’ve done the hard work for you in our list of the 10 best restaurants in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Nightlife</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv is a city that never sleeps. That’s where it gets its other nickname, the “White City” – a reference to white nights. You’ll find locals walking their dogs after dark, dinners being served at 9 P.M. and clubs just getting started after the clock strikes midnight. There’s absolutely no reason for your day to end when the sun goes down.</p> \n<p>Stroll the streets after dinner, then catch a theater show or dance performance (see “Culture,” next), or head to any of the many bars and clubs that make the city a hot nightlife destination. We’ve listed the best bars with food here; those interested in Tel Aviv’s flourishing gay nightlife can find recommendations here.</p> \n<p>Standard tips range from 12 to 15 percent, but be generous with your bartenders and they’ll be good to you.</p> \n<p>Culture</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv is all about culture. Catch a dance performance by the internationally acclaimed Batsheva Dance Company or Inbal Pinto and Avshalom Pollack Dance Company at the Suzanne Dellal Center. Tel Aviv is also home to many of the country’s greatest theater companies – including Habima (Israel’s national theater) the Cameri, Gesher (which regularly has English surtitles) and Beit Lessin – as well as fringe theaters including Tmuna, Simta and Aravi-Ivri.</p> \n<p>The Tel Aviv Cinematheque screens arthouse cinema and also houses events, from the DocAviv film festival to annual science fiction conventions and Ethiopian cultural and religious festivals.</p> \n<p>If you’re looking for art, you can catch some of the country's best exhibits at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.&nbsp; Other notable galleries include Beit Ha’ir, ambitious and provocative; Sommer, with its finger on the global scene; and Rosenfeld, which features contemporary trailblazers. Tel Aviv University's Botanical Gardens has on display a one-of-a-kind collection of local flora, and the Eretz Israel Museum hosts a sprawling collection of historical and archaeological exhibits.</p> \n<p>Find out about special events and exhibits by checking “The Guide,” Haaretz's weekly culture supplement, distributed with the Friday paper and available online as “Things To Do Around Israel.”</p> \n<p>Shopping</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv is home to some of Israel’s leading fashion designers. Hit up one of the dozens of local clothing boutiques on Dizengoff Street and Sheinkin Street in the center of the city, as well as in the Gan Ha’hashmal complex and Neve Tzedek neighborhood farther south. You can also browse fresh, unique fashions from Israel's up-and-coming designers at the Dizengoff Center fashion fair each Thursday and Friday.</p> \n<p>Edible souvenirs such as olive oil, baklava, olives, tahini and spices can be found at the city’s main markets. These include the Carmel Market, which offers nearly endless fresh produce, as well as clothing and Chinese-made trinkets; and the Levinsky Market, with its nearly endless collection of spices, dried fruits and legumes. The city also has a third market, Hatikva Market, also in the south; most of the streets are wide and walkable, but this market is much less tourist-oriented. The Tel Aviv Port’s farmer’s market is a small and pricey newcomer to the local market scene, with indoor shops open throughout the week and an expanded offering of vendors under an outdoor tent on Fridays. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you’re looking for a more international shopping experience (or even just air conditioning), consider visiting the up-market Ramat Aviv Mall, Dizengoff Center or Azrieli Mall (which also offers an observatory with great views of the city from the top floor). These shopping centers all have the larger Israeli fashion chains, as well as international brands. You’ll find a similar collection of stores at tourist-friendly outdoor complexes like Sarona, Hatachana and the Tel Aviv Port. All three occupy historical sites – Sarona is the renovated German Templer colony, Hatachana is the first Jaffa-Tel Aviv train station, and the Tel Aviv Port is, well, a former port and overlooks the sea. All have the advantage of being open on Saturdays.</p> \n<p>Transport</p> \n<p>There are lots of ways to get around Tel Aviv. Locals often use bikes, and indeed this is one of the best modes of transport for touring the city. Tel-O-Fun bicycles – one of the green bikes parked at rental stations throughout town – can be borrowed at one station and returned at another. Just note that the system is made to encourage commuting, and extra fees are incurred when a bike is borrowed for more than 30 minutes at once. Try to stick to the bike paths.</p> \n<p>Buses are also frequent and accessible – you can plan your route and double-check arrival times with a cell phone app like Moovit. Moniot sherut – minibus shared taxis – are also available on select routes.</p> \n<p>Taxis are also widely available. Hail down a passing cab, or order one with the cell phone app Gett, which gives you the added comfort of knowing your driver’s name and number, seeing exactly when it will arrive, and paying by credit card. You can also use Uber in Israel, but it’s not the Uber you’ve come to know in other countries; instead of private vehicles, this app is serviced only by taxis.</p> \n<p>For intercity travel, trains and buses are your cheapest bet on weekdays, but be aware they don’t run on Friday nights or Saturdays until after Shabbat is out. Shared taxis (moniot sherut) can get you to and from other major cities around the clock and on weekends.</p> \n<p>Kids</p> \n<p>Israel is known as a kid-friendly country, and Tel Aviv is no exception. Children are welcome at restaurants, and breastfeeding in public is perfectly acceptable, so don’t be shy about taking your kids with you to dinner.</p> \n<p>For entertainment, there are plenty of options, the most obvious of which is the beach. Metzitzim beach, directly south of the Tel Aviv Port, is an excellent choice for children: It offers a brand-new playground meters from the water, as well as comfortable indoor showers and toilets, and the airplanes flying low as they take off and land at nearby civilian and military Sde Dov Airport are a hit attraction for toddlers. Also consider Gordon Pool, a complex of three pools overlooking the ocean and a large dock. There, children splash around a shaded wading pool full of toy installations.</p> \n<p>Children will also find plenty to do at the Tel Aviv Port, much of it free. Attractions there include several massive, modern playgrounds; fountains for playing (scheduled to reopen in September); a carousel and the occasional public performance. Child-friendly food options abound there, too.</p> \n<p>You’ll also find plenty of families and playgrounds in the nearby Yarkon Park. Older children can rent paddleboats to explore the river.</p> \n<p>Visit the safari in neighboring Ramat Gan, the new Sarona complex – with its big playgrounds next to convenient food options – and the Land of Israel Museum, with its child-friendly exhibits. Need to escape the heat? Take refuge at a gymboree at the Gan Ha’ir Mall (a bargain at 10 shekels ($2.60) per child), the Weizmann Center mall or Ramat Aviv Mall. Be aware that child-friendly destinations are crowded over the weekend, particularly on Saturdays, after 4 P.M. on weekdays, and during the entire month of August.</p> \n<p>Accommodation</p> \n<p>Most of the five-star major hotels are stacked up along the beachfront, from Hilton and Carlton on the north end to Dan and Royal Beach, extending to David Intercontinental on the far south. All of them are fine, some more expensive and some less so, but you get what you pay for, and in Tel Aviv, home of high real estate, do not expect spaciousness for chump change.</p> \n<p>If you’re in town strictly for business, maybe stay at a hotel along the Ayalon Freeway, such as Crowne Plaza Tel Aviv City Center or Leonardo City Tower, from which you can take the train to the airport.</p> \n<p>But as Tel Aviv’s chic quotient has risen in recent years, high-end boutique hotels are trending now. Find them in Jaffa (including Market House in the modish flea market, or Margosa and soon-to-be-opened W a bit further south) or off Rothschild Boulevard in the Bauhaus district (Norman, Rothschild, Diaghilev and Montefiore).</p> \n<p>On a budget? Try Airbnb, but stick to Lev Hai’r if you want to be central or somewhere by the beach. Alternatively, choose a neighborhood that suits you best, based on the guide above.</p> \n<p>Liz Steinberg is an editor at Haaretz English Edition and a long-time Tel Aviv resident.</p> \n<p>Aimee Amiga, Marty Friedlander and Avi Pitchon contributed to this guide.</p>",

        "text":["<p>He’s a real estate and media tycoon with a scandal-studded past. He’s known for his super-inflated ego, his penchant for young and beautiful women and his tendency to let his mouth get him into trouble. He tried to encourage investors by saying “we have the prettiest secretaries.” He responded to an unwanted question from a journalist by making a gesture of a shooting pistol with his hand. He said that President Obama was “tanned.” He claimed he’s the best leader in the world “and there’s no reason for me to feel inferior to anyone in history.”</p> \n<p>It sounds like Donald Trump, but actually it’s former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Like Trump, Berlusconi was the bane of liberals and intellectuals but a hero for the common folk, many of who viewed the world through the prism of Italian television, which was gaudy and vulgar way before American TV caught up. As Italian-Palestinian journalist Rula Jebreal wrote in the same comparison she made last September in the Washington Post&nbsp;“Italians were endlessly entertained by the comedy Berlusconi brought to politics.”</p> \n<p>For the time being, Trump is not only entertaining his fans and riveting the media, if we put aside concerns for the future of the human race, he is also delighting many of his critics. It’s hard to resist deriving some joy, after all, from Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP in particular and unexpected domination of American politics in general. Just as Chance the gardener, played in the movie Being There by Peter Sellers, was used by Polish-Jewish author Jerzy Kosinski to mock politicians and other high society types who are enthralled by hollow generalizations, Trump’s run for the presidency has exposed the feeble foundations of the ideological right wing as well as the easy conquest of digital-age politics by a master of entertainment and reality TV.</p> \n<p>For anyone who is not a registered and caring member of the Republican Party, Trump’s amazing race provides both Schadenfreude and poetic justice. Just as the forces of reactionary conservatism were about to eliminate the last pockets of moderate and open-minded resistance in the GOP, Trump came out from nowhere to rearrange the forces and redraw the battle lines. While other Republican candidates were priming themselves to bend their wills and adapt their positions to those of the fundamentalist minority that sets the tone during primaries season, along came the thrice-married Trump, unrestrained by ideology or consistency, and stole the party from under the watchful eyes of its zealots.</p> \n<p>While the party was preparing to choose between a pragmatic conservative like Jeb Bush, a congenial conservative like Marco Rubio and a devout conservative like Ted Cruz, it was Trump who was enticing actual voters, including dedicated Evangelicals, with his mishmash of fly-by-night policy positions which are often anathema to the party faithful. He’s against ObamaCare but in favor of universal health insurance. He opposes free trade, which they support, and supports entitlements, which they oppose. He’s a pro-lifer, ostensibly, but has good things to say about that Satan’s spawn, Planned Parenthood. Archconservative columnist Eric Erickson pledged he would “never” vote for Trump and condemned Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr, who tweeted support for Trump, for “joining the whores of Moloch”, no less.</p> \n<p>Hawks and neocons are also in panic mode. As MSNBC’s Chris Matthews has noted, some of them were probably lining up for administration appointments under President Jeb!, or, even better, President Rubio. Now they have to deal with Trump, who says he opposed the Iraq war, pins the blame for it on St. George, the other Bush, refuses to toe the GOP’s Israel right or wrong line, and disdains democratization, nation building or otherwise unnecessary interventions in the world’s affairs that don’t directly threaten the United States. Yesterday it was reported that some of the neocons are floating the idea that Rubio concede the race to Trump in exchange for a vice presidential appointment, a move that would at least get his hawkish supporters to the Old Executive Building near the White House. (On the Democratic side, and possibly from similar motives of fear and apprehension, some people are touting the possibility that potential also-runner Michael Bloomberg would be picked as Hillary Clinton’s number two.)</p> \n<p>“The main problem with Trump is that he isn’t a Republican” is how Senator Lindsey Graham summarized it, in his usual pithy manner. Trump’s surging popularity has exposed the fact that the GOP leadership is far more reactionary and doctrinaire than many of its rank and file supporters, that it’s electoral base cares far less about the purity of the family or the sanctity of the constitution, as evidenced by the fact that they are now following a candidate devoid of any commitment to core values, conservative or otherwise. More ominously, perhaps, Trump’s supporters don’t seem to care that he said white yesterday, black today and grey tomorrow, they are unperturbed by his racist comments or his combative nature or his willingness to insult the Pope, mock the disabled or strangle hecklers, and they are completely unmoved by his lack of consistency and lackluster devotion to the truth.</p> \n<p>The normal political rules of accountability simply don’t apply where Trump is concerned. He said that he opposed the war in Iraq until recordings showed this week that he didn’t? He repeated as fact an urban legend about General Pershing executing Muslim guerrillas in the Philippines a century ago with bullets dabbed in pigs’ blood? He says “thousands of Muslims” were dancing in the streets of New Jersey on 9/11? Obama wants to allow a quarter of a million Syrian refugees to enter? Unemployment is at 42%? Mexico sends criminals over the border? America has the highest taxes? Ot er Gezugt, as they say in Yiddish, so he said. Who cares. Water under the bridge.</p> \n<p>And if fact checker PolitiFact says Trump is 2015’s liar of the year and Facts on File dubs him the biggest liar ever, it’s only because they are part of the “hostile media” that Trump likes to ridicule, even though it is the media’s complete capitulation that brought him to this point in the first place. CNN is even bragging about its sagacious decision to “invest in politics” even though said investment for many weeks amounted to turning into a Trump Channel that broadcast hours and hours of uninterrupted feeds to Trump’s speeches. As in politics, ratings rule the news these days while journalistic and public responsibility are outdated values of a long gone past, presumably.</p> \n<p>In this and other ways, Trump is actually a practitioner of post-modernist politics. Just as the political fight for gays, women and African Americans were defined in the 60’s and 70’s of the last century as leftist post-modernism, so Trump engages in “identity politics” from the right, but with a twist: with Trump, the white man is not the evil representative of the status quo but the underprivileged group which is deprived, depressed and discriminated against. Trump is leading their struggle for liberation from the repression of political correctness and the dictatorship of the upstart minorities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trumps adherents care less about the substance of his positions and more about the combative, in your face way he presents them. They are excited by him more than they actually agree with him. They want him to make America great again, whatever that means, and to reclaim their own lost honor. They dream, first and foremost, of being exactly like him: fabulously rich and famous, with supermodel wives at their side, free to say whatever they wish, racist and vulgar as it may be, like a combination of their childhood heroes, Archie Bunker of Queens and J. R. Ewing of Dallas.</p> \n<p>It would be hilarious were it not for the fact that it has become a bit scary. The notion that Trump could actually be the Republican candidate for president is earth shattering in and of itself but the possibility that he could also be elected President is a mind boggling gamble, at best, and a clear and present danger to America and the world, at worst. Philosopher and linguist Noam Chomsky said yesterday that Trump’s triumphs are a result of widespread fear and the disintegrating social order stemming from the excesses of neoliberal ultra-capitalism, the same elements that saw the rise of Fascism in Europe in the 1930’s. He didn’t mention Berlusconi’s predecessor Benito Mussolini and certainly didn’t evoke Adolf Hitler by name, because, really, there is no room for comparison, except for the fact that like Trump, Hitler and Mussolini were also regarded initially as clowns.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Giulio Venture, 29, lives in Arezzo, Italy; and Naomi Bar, 27, lives in Midreshet Ben-Gurion; Giulio is arriving from Milan</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask how long you’ve been a couple?</p> \n<p>Naomi: In 2013 I lived in Italy and took part in a project called Rondine Cittadella della Pace. The village of Rondine gives master’s students from countries in conflict a full scholarship, at a university in central Italy. The project was a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. It’s a kind of commune for Lebanese, Serbians, Armenians, Azerbaijanis and others. That’s where I met Giulio.</p> \n<p>Giulio: I was doing a year of service and my job was to help students acclimate, find a place to do their master’s and cope with bureaucracy.</p> \n<p>Naomi: I wore him down, because I couldn’t find a place and I just kept coming back.</p> \n<p>Giulio: It was a tactic. (They laugh)</p> \n<p>Naomi: We started dating after July 2014. I came back to Israel last July, and he came for two months. Then I flew to him for Christmas, and now he’s back again. It’s been going like that for about 18 months.</p> \n<p>How hard is the long distance?</p> \n<p>Naomi: We’re pretty used to it. But this summer, when we spent two months together in one place</p> \n<p>Giulio: ... we traveled all over Israel.</p> \n<p>Naomi: That was nice. The last time I went to him we agreed it’s not good to be separated for more than a month and a half.</p> \n<p>What are you doing now?</p> \n<p>Giulio: I work for a publisher of e-books, but as you see I am still lugging a paper book.</p> \n<p>Naomi: I’m not doing much. I’m a textile designer, and in Italy I studied how to design leather bags. Now I’m living with my parents and developing something made out of plastic bags. I’m still at the stage of product development. The dream is to find a place where we both have work, where we can live.</p> \n<p>Giulio: I want a place of my own.</p> \n<p>Where would you like to live?</p> \n<p>Naomi: Giulio loves Israel and I love Italy; we’re fine with either option. And also with Spain or India.</p> \n<p>Giulio: If it doesn’t work out we can always travel.</p> \n<p>Naomi: When we started out, we didn’t think the question of where to live would be a problem. We just like being together and will find a solution.</p> \n<p>Giulio: I don’t feel there is a problem with the cultures we came from, only the physical distance.</p> \n<p>Naomi: I would gladly have stayed in Italy – I’m still sending resumes – but it has a serious economic situation; there are no jobs. For now I’ve started to develop the things here, and I have to say that recycling plastic bags is fun.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You wanted to go to Italy to become a professional bag designer?</p> \n<p>Naomi: I went to Italy because I wanted to be in the village project. It was a passion since my army service. It was hard for me to find something to study, in the end I chose fashion and I had to do an apprenticeship. I was accepted to a special course of the Bottega Veneta company in conjunction with the design institute in Venice.</p> \n<p>Bottega Veneta, wow! The real deal.</p> \n<p>Naomi: There were admission interviews and everything. There’s nothing in Israel on that level. It was one of my best experiences in Italy. We studied design and also practical technique and planned a mini-collection of three bags. I of course did weird things, not at all in their style. The idea was to learn the work process, to understand each stage. I learned a lot.</p> \n<p>What was it like living in the village?</p> \n<p>Naomi: There’s no diploma and no politics. I met people. I learned about other conflicts. I spoke with Palestinians who had similar views to mine. I also tried to talk to those who didn’t speak to me at all. They tend to speak in slogans there: “Don’t look at the flag, look at the person.” My roommate was an Armenian woman who established a not-for-profit organization, and with her help I saw how much strength each of us has. It’s not just flowers and butterflies in a commune. I was there during Operation Protective Edge, the chaos had just started, and there were people who didn’t want even to sit with me, it was awful, ... We also met Italian youth. We visited Taranto with them, a region involved in World War I. The students from war regions told the Italians that war is not just computer games. That all the things they read in history books or see in movies really do happen. They teach us about peace, we teach them about war.</p> \n<p>Moran Asraf, 34, lives in Sderot; flying to Cologne, Germany</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask you where you’re going?</p> \n<p>I was chosen by Sapir Academic College, along with three girls, to go to Germany. Our scholarship was donated by an amazing woman named Maria Hier, who saw a show about Joseph Beuys that was curated by my teacher, Lior Mizrahi, and was very impressed. We will stay with her for five days and tour in the wake of Beuys, in galleries and museums. It’s very exciting. I achieved it with blood, sweat and tears.</p> \n<p>How long have you been involved with art?</p> \n<p>I’ve gone through multiple incarnations. I’m from Dimona originally, but I left early. I lived in Eilat and Kiryat Motzkin, working in sales, and then in Haifa, where I worked at a hostel for youth in distress. After years of searching for myself, I went to Be’er Sheva, and worked in customer service, and a lot of things happened: I stopped smoking, I became vegetarian and suddenly I realized I was wasting time and got a powerful urge to learn.</p> \n<p>All this happened after the age of 30?</p> \n<p>Yes. Before that I wasn’t very interested. &nbsp;I went to a brief college-preparatory course for people over 30 at Sapir [in Sderot] to improve my matriculation results. I’d planned to become a social worker. It was only at the end of the course that I asked myself, “Why these subjects?” I wanted to discover places within myself that I wasn’t familiar with. There was something in me that wanted to work with the hands. And then, one day, I saw Umm Kultur on television.</p> \n<p>Who?</p> \n<p>Umm Kultur, a group of female performance artists from the south. I was very excited by their show and by their occupation with gender. They had studied in the arts school at Sapir – that’s how I found out about it. I went to an open house there and met Michal Shamir, who’s now my teacher, and there was a click between us.</p> \n<p>Did you have a portfolio?</p> \n<p>Until then I hadn’t created anything. But Michal said she wasn’t looking for a portfolio but for “souls with a unique inner world.” That dispelled my anxiety. There was some argument, but I was admitted without a portfolio.</p> \n<p>What was it like?</p> \n<p>I arrived with zero self-confidence and didn’t know how I’d fit in with all the young students. Now it’s nice – boys of 20 hit on me – but at first I didn’t know what I’d do. As a person, I am goal-focused. I worked very hard. I took private lessons in drawing, painting and sculpture, I had to learn everything from scratch. But it’s not only the professional aspect. There are fears, too.</p> \n<p>What did you have to cope with?</p> \n<p>Mostly a lack of self-confidence. I didn’t come from a home of museums. I was on my own from a young age, I worked for a living, not for my spirit. But now my soul is soaring.</p> \n<p>What kind of art do you do?</p> \n<p>Photography, performance and video art. I deal with my place as a woman in Israeli society, which is one of suppression and violence against women. I did a series of photos in which I dress up as a different woman each time, in a different location: a drugged girl in a filthy bomb shelter, a whorish bimbo, a widow at a memorial monument. I also did a performance work that was inspired by [Serbian performance artist] Marina Abramovic. Because of the security situation, and because I am studying in a mixed Jewish-Muslim college, it was important for me to talk about what’s going on. With me everything is transparent.</p> \n<p>In the performance, another female [Arab] student and I sat across from each other to create a silent dialogue on experience and pain. People stopped, looked, asked. Feelings arose for which there are no words, very powerful. Afterward, the performance expanded to include more female students from Sapir, Jews and Arabs, and a guy from the Muslim community. A report about the event was broadcast on the Arte channel in France and also in Germany. Things gathered momentum. Gidona Raz from the Elmina Theater in Jaffa contacted us and we did the performance there, too, with the Women Make Peace group. In four years I turned my life completely around. Four years ago, if someone had told me I’d be living in Sderot and making art I would have said he was hallucinating.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It wasn’t difficult for HBO, the American pay-television broadcaster, to persuade Katharina Otto-Bernstein to produce a documentary about the legendary photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. Otto-Bernstein, an art collector and a director of films about art, encountered Mapplethorpe (1946-1989) at social events in Manhattan back during the swinging 1980s, when she was a young film student at Columbia University. Already then he was quite well known, but he was hungry for more fame and money – “ambitious” was too small a word to describe him, by far.</p> \n<p>Otto-Bernstein had suffered all her life from the opposite problem: She was too well known and too rich. As the daughter of one of Germany’s wealthiest men, Werner Otto, founder of Otto GmbH, which eventually became the world’s largest mail-order company, she felt that no matter what she accomplished in her country, people would assume that opportunities came to her on a silver platter. As it was important for her to succeed on her own, she left Germany at an early age for a boarding school in England and afterward went on to New York, where she studied philosophy and film at Columbia.</p> \n<p>“In Germany, my family’s name always got in the way,” she said in an interview earlier this summer in their New York townhouse. “That’s why America truly seemed to me the land of unlimited opportunity. I wanted to do something that would be only me, but no one thought I could do it. Here, no one knew me, at least until the internet made all the information very accessible. It was always my desire to create a life for myself, not the life that someone else had already created for me.”</p> \n<p>Otto-Bernstein, who declines to give her age (according to the internet, she was born in 1964), was born in Hamburg, the fifth and youngest child of Werner Otto and his third wife. Her father died five years ago, at the age of 102, by which time he had amassed a fortune of tens of billions of dollars. Katharine’s siblings continue to manage the family business, which has since expanded into retailing and real estate. But from her childhood, Otto-Bernstein, who is married to art dealer Nathan A. Bernstein had been drawn to the creative world, and New York suited her to a T.</p> \n<p>“New York in the 1980s was wonderful,” she says. “It was the most liberal period in American history. The artists and the Pride community were the leaders of New York. Downtown went up to uptown, and uptown came down to downtown, everyone mingled and you could meet them all in the clubs. Times without worries, an extremely creative era. Until the day the music stopped, when the economic crisis and the AIDS crisis struck. The art market collapsed, clubs shut down.”</p> \n<p>“Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures” was directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato. It is now available for viewing on the satellite channel Yes Docu. The film shows how connections were forged rapidly during that fateful decade between the wealthiest class and creative artists. Mapplethorpe himself crossed the class divide in one swift leap – from street prostitution to flights to a private island in the Caribbean.</p> \n<p>Otto-Bernstein, who says she is interested above all in human stories and history, also sought those connections – only coming from the opposite direction. When the party ended, as it were, she started to work in television documentary production, and in short order found herself in another sort of party, no less riveting. She was sent to Berlin to work on a series about East and West Germany, and while she was there, in 1989, the Berlin Wall came tumbling down, leading her to stay somewhat longer than she’d planned.</p> \n<p>“I made a film about family unifications [of residents] from both Germanys,” she recalls. “I too come from a divided family – I had relatives in East Germany. I interviewed many spies from that period, such as the real ‘Red Sonja’ [Ursula Kuczynski, a German communist who was recruited by the Soviet Union]. It was fascinating. And then I went back to New York and completed my graduate studies before starting to work as a director.”</p> \n<p>Her first full-length documentary, “Beautopia” (1998), was about the dark side of the modeling world. Then, when she met the avant-garde theater director Robert Wilson, when he showed up at a party at her home, she suggested doing a film about him. The result, “Absolute Wilson,” was only released in 2006. “At the time of the first interview with him, I was in my ninth month of pregnancy,” Otto-Bernstein explains. “And a year later I was pregnant again, so the film was made amid having babies and raising children, and in the course of trips all over the world, because he [Wilson] is a globetrotter.” She also wrote a biography of the same name of the theater director, with whom she says she remains close.</p> \n<p>The Mapplethorpe documentary is the first on which Otto-Bernstein has served only as producer, and hasn’t directed. “Sheila Nevins [president of HBO Documentary Films] came to me with an offer to produce,” she says. “She had no idea that two Los Angeles museums, the Getty and the Museum of Modern Art, were about to jointly mount a huge Mapplethorpe retrospective. But she has superb instincts for things that are about to be hot.”</p> \n<p>The film’s two directors, adds Otto-Bernstein “were part of the New York pride community in the 1980s. They have the right sensitivity to feel the pain of Mapplethorpe, who, like many others in that community, discovered one day in the middle of his life and career that he was going to die from AIDS. They made the film from a very authentic place.”</p> \n<p>She finds a clear connection between her interest in both Wilson and Mapplethorpe. “Wilson knew Mapplethorpe well, because they were both at Pratt [School of Art and Design, in Brooklyn], they are both gay and both came from very rigid religious and conservative backgrounds. Both had the absolute artistic impulse.”</p> \n<p>Otto-Bernstein and her husband, Nathan Bernstein, who also took part in the interview, have in their art collection a special souvenir of the relationship between Wilson and Mapplethorpe: a copy of Mapplethorpe’s well-known photograph of Wilson with composer Philip Glass, which was included in the Getty’s part of the retrospective. Wilson himself gave the print to Bernstein a few months ago, as a birthday present. “Take note,” she says, “that he gave it to Nathan as a birthday present, even though it’s I who have been following his career all these years and made a film about him and wrote his biography.” To which her husband retorts, with a guffaw, “We celebrated my birthday in Berlin during the Berlinale – we were there for the screening of ‘Absolute Wilson’ – and we went out for dinner. He was a bit tipsy and he hugged me and said, Nathan, I’m going to give you an original Mapplethorpe for your birthday. I didn’t think he meant it, but two weeks later I received the 1976 photograph via FedEx.”</p> \n<p>The couple also has a classic Mapplethorpe self-portrait and another work of his, which Otto-Bernstein bought years ago and hung in her office. But the film notwithstanding, Mapplethorpe is definitely not the major figure on the walls of the couple’s homes (they have several). The two are avid collectors, whose holdings are rumored to be between $50 million and $100 million.</p> \n<p>‘A Herzl groupie’</p> \n<p>Katharina Otto met Bernstein, an art dealer of Israeli origin who has now been living in New York for more than 40 years, some 18 years ago at a cocktail party in the Hamptons, the Long Island resort area. A divorced father of two, he was considered a highly eligible single man not only in America, but also in Europe and Israel. They became engaged within two weeks and were married three months later. Their two sons, aged 17 and 16, attend boarding schools in Massachusetts. When husband and wife are interviewed together they can be a mutual admiration society, but fur also can fly. For example, when each relates how they met the other’s parents.</p> \n<p>The encounters took place in Germany and Israel, shortly after they met. “Her parents were very easy compared to my mother,” recalls Bernstein, whose father was already dead by then.</p> \n<p>Was that because Katharina is German?</p> \n<p>Katharina: “No. His mother asked me why I am so tall, and immediately afterward whether I had considered converting to Judaism. I made it clear immediately that the answer was no.”</p> \n<p>Nathan: “Because we are a very old family in Israel, who arrived [from Eastern Europe] long before the Nazis came to power, we had no relatives who perished in the Holocaust. So my mother had no complexes about ties with Germany.”</p> \n<p>She: “My father spent two years in a Berlin prison because of his opposition to the Nazis – it’s a well-known story.”</p> \n<p>He: “Yes, but my mother didn’t know that.”</p> \n<p>She: “I assumed you’d told her.”</p> \n<p>Of the two, she is more judicious in her speech, and it’s important for her to talk primarily about her professional work: documentary cinema. He doesn’t mind showing off a little, all in a good spirit. “We are the power couple of the New York art world,” he declares, laughing. But he also backs up the assertion with a few magazines, one of them with a list of the 212 couples without whose presence social events in New York (area code 212) are sad and insipid.</p> \n<p>Bernstein, too, is from a privileged family, in Israeli terms. He was born in Haifa 60-something years ago (he too prefers to be coy about his age), attended the city’s prestigious Reali school and was expelled, but after a few years in agricultural and army boarding schools was allowed to return, not least because of his family connections. On one side, his maternal grandfather, Shlomo Nathanson, was director general of the Anglo-Palestine Bank, the forerunner of today’s giant Bank Leumi. He is also a scion of the family of Shimon Friedman, one of the oldest in the Yishuv (pre-state Jewish community of Palestine) and the founder of one of its first vineyards. His father, Eliahu Bernstein, was in the insurance and customs-agency business, and also liked to collect art.</p> \n<p>“My father always bought art, both Israeli and Jewish, and especially of the Paris School, which was very much in fashion in the 1960s and 1970s,” he relates. “It was a respectable middle-upper class collection, relative to Israel. But it wasn’t comparable to the collections of Sami Ofer or Efraim Ilin, two other Haifa residents, who made their fortunes abroad. Ilin was friends with my parents; we lived next to his family and I was a friend of one of his sons. I was very impressed by Ilin’s collection. When he died [in 2011] I wrote a condolence letter to his sons in which I mentioned that one of the main reasons I became an art dealer was the works I saw in their parents’ home. That was an opening.</p> \n<p>“It was a period of austerity in Israel, but he had money,” he continues, referring to Ilin’s collection. “He had works by Picasso, Braque and Chagall, and drawings by Matisse and Toulouse-Lautrec. You could say I coveted that; I hoped that one day I would have similar things. And in the end it happened.”</p> \n<p>In the 1970s, Nathan and his brother, Michael, inherited the estate of Hermann Struck, a German Jewish artist known for his etchings, who was a quite distant relative on their mother’s side. Neither Struck nor the nephew who was his original heir, had children, so it was passed on to the Bernstein brothers. Struck had immigrated to Palestine from Berlin in 1922, settling in Haifa, because – according to Bernstein – that was Theodor Herzl’s favorite city. “To his delight, he was able to attend the World Zionist Congress in Vienna in 1903, a year before Herzl’s death. All the well-known etchings and drawings of Herzl are by Struck. He was a Herzl groupie.”</p> \n<p>Struck taught at the Bezalel art school in Jerusalem and was also on the board of directors of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, which was then still located in Dizengoff House (the home of Meir Dizengoff, the city’s first mayor). Struck died in 1944, not long after taking part in the wedding celebration of Bernstein’s parents and giving them a work of his, an etching of Venice, as a present. In 2013, Nathan Bernstein donated the funds and artwork for the establishment of the Hermann Struck Museum in Haifa, which displays the works of a range of artists. He is now a member of the board of the Haifa Museums company and is also on the boards of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>As a young art dealer in Israel at the start of his career, Bernstein sold a considerable number of works by Struck, who was popular among local collectors at the time. “Everyone who had any sort of art collection had at least one Struck etching,” Bernstein relates. “These days, he’s already somewhat forgotten.”</p> \n<p>After moving to the United States, Bernstein continued to deal in art; he has a gallery on Manhattan’s East 65th Street. He visits Israel three times a year, maintaining what he calls a “bachelor apartment” on Pinkas Street in north Tel Aviv, where aquarelles by Joseph Zaritsky, a painting by Moshe Kupferman and of course etchings by Struck adorn the walls. But that is negligible compared to the artwork that fills the three-story family New York townhouse, located a few blocks north of Bernstein’s gallery. A visitor entering the elegant home is dizzied by the ubiquitous art: It turns out that between Struck and Mapplethorpe lies a whole ocean of possibilities. Before we continue the interview, Nathan gives me a guided tour.</p> \n<p>Hot trend</p> \n<p>The couple’s collection is rich, diverse and moving – especially for aficionados of modern art.</p> \n<p>“Fortunately, we have pretty much the same taste,” Bernstein notes. “We both brought a little art from home, and together it developed a great deal. We started with Old Masters from the 17th and 18th centuries, then moved to the Impressionists and then modern art from the 20th century. It’s all still here, we have never sold anything, so it’s a nice mixture.”</p> \n<p>On the ground floor is a sculpture by Antony Gormley. A large glass cube by Anish Kapoor stands at the center of a covered patio, and on the walls are two matching mosaic-like works by Damien Hirst made from thousands of insects and butterflies set against a black background. The couple commissioned the works from Hirst, to suit the scale of the wall. The second-floor library contains an 1893 oil by Edvard Munch, a painting by Max Beckmann, and four (out of 14) paintings from the “Turned Sheets” series by German artist Gerhard Richter.</p> \n<p>“Those are works from 1965,” Bernstein explains, referring to the Richter series. “Some of the others are in museums and some are in private collections. It took us a few years to acquire these four. In each one the page moves a bit, more or less. He is so good that he can do everything, it’s a perfect deception of the eye.”</p> \n<p>Otto-Bernstein adds that it would be nice if one day the whole series was in their possession. The large living room displays the “little” that Katharina brought from her home, including a landscape painting of simultaneously bold and gloomy colors by the German-Danish Expressionist Emil Nolde. A portrait of her father done by Andy Warhol hangs above the fireplace. A pair of Gormley sculptures placed next to the window have been dubbed “Nathan and Katharina” by the couple.</p> \n<p>At the outset of their life together the couple accumulated a small, romantic collection of paintings of children. “It was the emotional moment when our children were born,” Otto-Bernstein recalls. “So we bought three portraits of Renoir’s sons, at approximately the age our children were then. That was the start. We also have a Picasso painting of his children and a Cezanne drawing of his son, and a painting by George Grosz. We did it for our children, from thinking about them.”</p> \n<p>But perhaps the most important part of the couple’s collection these days is that devoted to contemporary Chinese art – reflecting the new, hot trend in the market. Otto-Bernstein says she was always attracted to China, so it’s not surprising that she was also drawn to Chinese art when it began to crop up in the major Western galleries and at fairs.</p> \n<p>“It’s very rare to succeed at the beginning of a completely new movement,” she observes. “But it happened in China, when political changes began to take place there. Art reflects the politics and culture of our time – that is what makes it meaningful and also what excites you.”</p> \n<p>Their interest in Chinese art was not spawned by economic considerations, she adds: “No one knew it would become so valued and in demand. It wasn’t a financial thing. China has always had very skilled artists, but they produced propaganda art, the kind we know from the Soviet Union. And suddenly all those talented people had something else to say.”</p> \n<p>They chose the first painting together by chance at an art fair 10 years ago, when they browsed separately and found themselves admiring the same work. It was a canvas by Wang Ziwei, whose prices haven’t actually gone up much since then, according to the couple. “We frequently have the same taste,” Bernstein says, “and for the most part we buy things that we both love.” Pointing to a large painting in striking colors of chewing gum, by the American-Swiss Christian Marclay, which hangs above the sofa, Otto-Bernstein says, “That, I didn’t like at first.”</p> \n<p>Bernstein: “Yes, it was a shock for me the first time I saw it. It just arrived a few weeks ago, and I’m still getting used to it. It definitely made the room 20 years younger.”</p> \n<p>After purchasing the Wang Ziwei work, they began to take an interest in which other Chinese artists to acquire – and not a moment too soon, in terms of the prices. “We were able to obtain them in time, we acquired them very early,” Bernstein says. An artist whom Katharina is particularly fond of, and whose large and somewhat unsettling paintings are also on display in the New York townhouse, is Zhang Xiaogang, who does huge portraits of children in black and white with a small red stain or a depiction of red thread somewhere in the painting.</p> \n<p>“I was always fascinated by the stories behind these paintings,” Otto-Bernstein says. “They are of children who were taken from anti-regime parents [during the Cultural Revolution]. There are books of pictures, like graduation books, in which the children appeared. This series is called ‘Bloodline,’ because these children were connected to one another in the sense that all were taken from their parents. It’s a subject that haunts me.”</p> \n<p>Nathan: “Today these paintings fetch insane prices, millions of dollars. But we bought them at an auction in China before he became so well known.”</p> \n<p>“The irony is that this is art that had its genesis in social criticism, including criticism of capitalism in China, but in the end it’s sold to rich people, and thanks to that the artists themselves become very rich,” notes Otto-Bernstein, who is currently working as an artistic consultant for a new film about changes that have occurred in the art market. “It’s a key question that has to be put to them: How do you reconcile the fact that you yourselves have become capitalists? This art was originally classified as ‘forbidden art,’ but then it reached the West and fetched excellent prices, and now it is returning to China. These days its biggest collectors are Chinese. All the major galleries in the West have opened branches in China.”</p> \n<p>The two are at pains to emphasize that they do not collect as a financial investment but are impelled by love of art and by the intention of displaying all their numerous works in their homes. When one home is full, they move works to another. Some works are in storage.</p> \n<p>Even if the collection is not intended for investment purposes, both Nathan and Katharina have vivid memories of good deals – and bad ones. He recalls how, “In the 1990s, even before I met Katharina, I had a few works by Warhol and Basquiat, and I sold them prematurely, because I needed money. That was a mistake. The market was low at the time. I had things that now are worth 50 times as much, which I barely managed to sell back then.”</p> \n<p>Otto-Bernstein had the opposite experience: “In the dining room here below, there are three small Warhol paintings of Rorschach inkblots, that I bought in the 1990s. They all went up. The market was depressed at the time. In our previous apartment they hung in the kitchen, unframed. The children were little then and ate in highchairs and used to throw food every which way. About 10 years after I bought Warhol’s Rorschach inkblots, we went to an opening at the Michael Werner Gallery, and they had one on display. I told him that I had one like that, too, and I asked him how much he was selling it for. For $250,000, he told me. I rushed home, removed the paintings from the wall, made sure they had no food stains on them and immediately had them framed. That’s what goes on in this bizarre market.”</p> \n<p>Is there any chance that this artistic richness will one day finds its way to a museum in Israel?</p> \n<p>“We’ve never talked about what will be done with the collection after we die. I don’t even have a will,” Bernstein says with a smile. “I totally consider myself to be 20 years old.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is an excellent manager who knows how to distinguish the important from the unimportant and focus on achieving his goals: keeping his government in power and perpetuating the occupation in the West Bank and East Jerusalem while minimizing domestic and international opposition.</p> \n<p>All his actions and decisions are a product of these goals, and the results are in his favor. Over the past seven years, Netanyahu has won three elections and removed the two-state solution from the Israeli and global agendas.</p> \n<p>In his Haaretz column this week, Raviv Drucker belittled the prime minister’s managerial abilities as “nonexistent,” providing examples of his promises that haven’t been fulfilled – from lowering housing prices and advancing his natural gas plan to an Eilat casino and the bill authorizing the suspension of Knesset members.</p> \n<p>The nation-state bill, the so-called balcony construction reform, the introduction of Uber to Israel and the shuttering of the Israel Broadcasting Authority can all be added to the list. Bibi promises, Bibi gets enthusiastic, Bibi pushes for what he wants, but nothing happens.</p> \n<p>All this is true, but unimportant. These failures haven’t stopped Netanyahu from achieving his goals. Let’s assume the gas framework is too complicated to arouse the public’s interest, and Israelis don’t care if they do their gambling in inexpensive Bulgaria rather than expensive Eilat.</p> \n<p>But the cost of homes affects everyone. Frustrated Israelis who can’t buy real estate for their children should be taking it out on the government and the person who heads it. Still, soaring prices haven’t prevented Netanyahu from being elected again and again. Netanyahu has only benefited when “the housing crisis” has ruined the careers of potential rivals such as Yair Lapid and Moshe Kahlon.</p> \n<p>A good manager needs to know what to do and what not to get involved in, and Netanyahu lets others deal with what could stir controversy or fail. The so-called “change the elites” project designed to eliminate public support for dividing the land into two states was transferred to Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Culture Minister Miri Regev. The fight against international pressure to end the occupation was contracted out to the heads of the “opposition,” Isaac Herzog and Lapid.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the smashing of the Supreme Court was entrusted to Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked and Tourism Minister Yariv Levin. In his previous terms, Netanyahu dispatched Ehud Barak to take the fall for the project on attacking Iran, and Tzipi Livni to commit political suicide on a “peace process” without any prospect of success.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s great teacher was Ronald Reagan, who showed little interest in the work of the administration and viewed rhetoric as the essence of leadership. Like Netanyahu, Reagan kept to himself and lacked friends – someone who lived in the shadow of a domineering wife but shone in front of a crowd and the cameras.</p> \n<p>Like Reagan, Netanyahu talks like an aggressive hawk and acts like a dove when it comes to using force. Both would prefer a good story to precision on the facts. Reagan quoted an imaginary statement by Lenin, while Netanyahu blamed the mufti of Jerusalem for the Holocaust. Jacob Weisberg, a Reagan biographer, called these lies “sentimental fictions.”</p> \n<p>Reagan was considered a chatterbox and clown by his adversaries, but today he’s remembered as a leader who won the Cold War thanks to the wild arms race he forced on an impoverished Soviet Union. Netanyahu isn’t there, but the winds are blowing in his favor. He’s taking advantage of America’s ebbing in the Middle East and the collapse of Arab states to near his dream of eliminating international recognition of the existence of a Palestinian people with national rights.</p> \n<p>No one in the West had heard of the Palestinians until they started hijacking planes in the late ‘60s. Netanyahu hopes that with a little more determination, effort and a crackdown on dissidents at home and boycotters abroad, he can return the Palestinians to their hazy status as “Arabs” without rights.</p> \n<p>Journalists who use minor matters like housing, natural gas and the staffing of Netanyahu’s office to convince people that Netanyahu is a weak man, soft politician and failed manager are only helping him. While they’re busying themselves with such nonsense, or with Sara Netanyahu’s unfair treatment of her servants, Netanyahu is quietly moving ahead unhindered toward his real goals. That’s his real test, and for now at least he’s passing with flying colors.</p>",

        "text":["<p> Israel Space Agency chairman Yitzhak Ben Israel said on Wednesday that talks are underway about training a new Israeli astronaut, 10 years after the death of Ilan Ramon, Israel’s first astronaut. The topic came up at the eighth annual International Space Conference this week in Herzliya, during unofficial talks between space agency representatives in the Science and Technology Ministry and more than a dozen senior officials representing space agencies from around the world.</p> \n<p> The Science and Technology Ministry stated that initial talks with international bodies were recently begun to look into the possibility and implications of training an Israeli astronaut. But the identification and training of candidates may take several years. Identifying Ilan Ramon took two years, followed by another four years of training until Ramon was ready to go into space.</p> \n<p> In July 2011, NASA (U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration) announced it would no longer be launching manned space shuttles. At present, astronauts are being sent into space only to staff the international space research station, which orbits earth and is expected to be in operation at least until 2020. It is operated by astronauts from different countries. The Israel Space Agency made it clear that once space agencies around the world give the go-ahead, the process of identifying the next Israeli astronaut will begin and he or she will starting training for a mission on the space station.</p> \n<p> At the space conference, Menachem Greenblum, director-general of the Science and Technology Ministry, and Dr. Paul Weisenberg, deputy director-general for development and industry at the European Commission, signed an agreement of cooperation for several space projects, including research budgets and integrating Israel into Horizon 2020, the EC’s seven-year program.</p> \n<p> At the conference, Dr. Mazlan Othman, director of the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, called for Israel to join the international conference for using space for peaceful ends. Currently, Israel is an observer at the conference. Science ministry representatives proposed that Othman place a model of an Israeli satellite at the permanent space exhibition at the UN office’s headquarters in Vienna. The exhibition displays satellite models and rocks from space.</p> \n<p> Israel’s community of space scientists is pinning its hopes on the next Israeli astronaut after the disaster in which Ramon was killed on February 1, 2003, when the Columbia space shuttle disintegrated during reentry into the earth’s atmosphere.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The High Court of Justice ruled on Thursday in favor of state recognition of&nbsp;private Orthodox conversions to Judaism and that those converted through this process should be eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return, in a decision Israel's chief rabbi blasted as &quot;outrageous.&quot;</p> \n<p>The decision by nine-justice panel headed by Court President Miriam Naor weakens the chief rabbinate and the official system of conversions, and strengthens the private rabbinical courts operating in the haredi and Zionist sectors.</p> \n<p>The ruling also&nbsp;has possible repercussions concerning Reform and Conservative conversions which have thus far not been recognized by Israel.</p> \n<p>&quot;Restricting recognition of conversions to the official track alone, as the respondents suggest, will hurt the right to return (to Israel) which is a fundamental right of every Jew, and violates the instructions of the Law of Return,&quot; Naor wrote in her judgement.</p> \n<p>In response, Sephardi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef blasted the decision as &quot;outrageous,&quot; saying it was &quot;inconceivable that the pirate conversion industry will be recognized by the state.&quot;</p> \n<p>Rabbi Yosef added that &quot;Israel operates its own conversion mechanism which operates with clear standards and is welcoming to all parts of the Israeli public, [the court's decision] is the de facto execution of official state conversion mechanism.&quot;</p> \n<p>Conversions of immigrants are generally overseen by the chief rabbinate, within the framework of the Law of Return, which grants automatic citizenship to Jews. Most of those who undergo these conversions are Russian and Ethiopian immigrants not seen as Jewish under Orthodox law.</p> \n<p>Occasionally, an exceptions board at the Interior Ministry permits foreign nationals to be converted through the rabbinical system as well.</p> \n<p>The justices ruled on three appeals filed on behalf of foreign nationals who came to Israel as tourists and were later converted to Judaism by private rabbinical courts operated by the ultra-Orthodox.</p> \n<p>The Interior Ministry refused to recognize these conversions and even made those who went through the process&nbsp;leave Israel once their visas expired.</p> \n<p>The state had replied in its response to the appeal that the Law of Return applied only to those who converted while in Israel and by the official system overseen by the chief rabbinate.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Gilad Kariv, head of the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism said &nbsp;&quot;the High Court ruling determines unequivocally that there is more than one way to convert in Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;We expect the Israeli government to fully recognize reform conversions in Israel just as it for years has recognized such conversions when performed abroad,&quot; Kariv said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;This is a day of celebration&nbsp;for all who believe that the unity of the Jewish people will come only through mutual respect and religious tolerance and by Israel's recognition of all streams of thought of the Jewish people.&quot;</p> \n<p>Religious Services Minister David Azoulay (Shas) blasted the decision.</p> \n<p>“The High Court is trying to undermine Israel’s Jewish foundations and is harming the state conversion system and the Chief Rabbinate,” he said. “Anyone who keeps silent about the High Court’s decision to recognize pirate conversions shouldn’t be surprised to find hundreds of thousands of non-Jews here in the State of Israel who have obtained citizenship under the Law of Return as the result of a dubious industry of fake conversions. I intend to work through legislation so that conversions in Israel will be exclusively those performed by the state conversion system.”</p> \n<p>Meretz chairwoman Zehava Galon welcomed the court’s “dramatic ruling,” which “breaks the rabbinate’s monopoly and constitutes another step forward in the battle by different [Jewish] movements in Israel to be Jews in their own way, with no ranking of Jews as equal and more equal.”</p> \n<p>She added that she hoped the ruling, which was handed down in the case of Orthodox converts, would also apply to non-Orthodox conversions.</p> \n<p>MK Ksenia Svetlova (Zionist Union) similarly welcomed the breaking of the rabbinate’s monopoly and hoped the court would soon recognize non-Orthodox conversions as well.</p> \n<p>MK Elazar Stern (Yesh Atid), who sponsored a bill to reform the conversion system in the previous Knesset, said the decision constituted “great tidings” for “the war on assimilation,” and especially for the hundreds of people who have already converted via alternative conversion courts. He termed the court’s ruling “a direct result” of the current government’s decision to abandon his proposed reform.</p>",

        "text":["<p>April 4, 1945, is the birthdate of Daniel Cohn-Bendit. Better known as Danny the Red — both for the politics and the red hair of his youth — and later, as Danny the Green, Cohn-Bendit has been involved in European public life since leading the student protests that helped to shut down large parts of France in the turbulent days of 1968.</p> \n<p>Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit was born in Montauban, in southern France, to Erich Cohn-Bendit, a German Jew, and the former Herta David, a Polish-born Jew. The couple had fled Weimar Germany in 1933, as Erich's left-wing legal work had made life untenable for them there.</p> \n<p>In the early 1950s, Erich returned to Germany, where he began working on war-related restitution issues. The family followed him there in 1958. Daniel attended the prestigious Odenwalschule boarding school outside Frankfurt, and at age 14, he elected to become a German citizen.</p> \n<p>The students rally by his side</p> \n<p>In 1966, Danny moved back to France to attend the newly formed University of Nanterre, in Paris suburbs. He studied sociology and became involved in various anarchistic student groups. One of his preferred causes was a call for more sexual freedom for students, in particular the right for male students to visit women in their dormitories.</p> \n<p>In 1967, after leading a demonstration, Cohn-Bendit found himself facing an attempt by the university administration to expel him. This move rallied other students around him.</p> \n<p>On March 22, 1968, students occupied the administration offices of Nanterre. When the school was shut down, on May 2, protests spread to the centre of Paris.</p> \n<p>By now, the protests were about a lot more than mixing of sexes in dormitories, having joined the causes of a wide range of French political, economic and social issues.</p> \n<p>Eventually, the labor unions joined the protest movement, and on May 13, France was paralyzed by a general strike.</p> \n<p>When a speech by Cohn-Bendit elicited reactions of public figures who referred to his “foreign origins,” protesters responded by chanting, “We are all German Jews.” &nbsp; Although Daniel Cohn-Bendit is remembered for his leadership role in the protests, after May 10, he wasn’t even in Paris, and his Nanterre colleagues, feeling sidelined, retreated to the Atlantic coast. Come May 22, he was deported, after French authorities declared him a “seditious alien.”</p> \n<p>Revolutionary imagination</p> \n<p>Cohn-Bendit’s subsequent career was in Germany. Initially, he worked at the community level with anarchistic groups, working in the Karl Marx bookstore and at a revolutionary kindergarten.</p> \n<p>His activity as an educator led to a controversial episode that dogs Cohn-Bendit to this day. In his 1975 book “Le Grand Bazaar,” he noted how at the pre-school, he had participated in sexual activities with some of the children; several years later, in a magazine article he described the “beautiful” experience of being “seduced” by a six-year-old girl.</p> \n<p>Confronted with the quotations in 2001, Cohn-Bendit said that the encounters never took place, and that he had invented them as an “obnoxious provocation” meant to mock contemporary sexual mores.</p> \n<p>In 1984 Cohn-Bendit joined the Greens movement and in 1989, became deputy mayor of Frankfurt, and a member of the European Parliament a decade later. He has always been characterized by a humanistic moderation, but has also moved closer to the center in the intervening years.</p> \n<p>Cohn-Bendit never hid his origins, but also never identified in any significant way with Jewish affairs. In 2010, however, he was among the founders of JCall, a Jewish advocacy group based on the J Street model, meant to push a pro-Israel left-wing agenda in Brussels.</p> \n<p>In January, 2015, after the murderous ISIS attack on a kosher grocery in Paris, he expressed his shock and concern that the European media and political left seemed unable or unwilling to acknowledge that the victims were attacked solely for being Jewish, and nothing else.</p> \n<p>“It’s hard for me. At this moment I feel I’m a ‘Jew,’ while my entire life was not ‘Jewish,’ he told an interviewer. “And this feeling, when I see today we’re returning to the same situation, is terrifying.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>In August 2013, as polio-virus particles were detected in the sewers of southern Israel and the government launched a vaccination campaign, the Health Ministry asked for an exemption from the requirement to publish a tender. The contract was for a company to develop an app that could locate nearby well-baby clinics, and the exemption was granted on the grounds of “urgency to prevent material harm.” In the end, the ministry signed a four-month deal with the IT company Matrix for 118,000 shekels ($31,400).</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the nonprofit group Hasadna put out a similar app, developed in two business days, at no cost other than the volunteer programmers' time. And it’s better than the government’s app. The Health Ministry paid a decent chunk of taxpayer money for work that could have been done in a fraction of the time without the hefty outlay.</p> \n<p>This case shows that when information is made public, entrepreneurs and developers innovate faster, better and more cheaply than the government can. But the government rarely publishes such information voluntarily, and the current policy of tenders blocks it from contracting with startups, which usually don’t meet the conditions for working with the government.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to gauge how much this approach costs the people and the state. Some of the lag in Israel’s GDP per capita lies in red tape, outdated technological infrastructure and the government’s slowness in giving the people access to databases. Some bureaucrats seem to view information as power; its mass distribution would cost them their relative advantage and expose them to criticism.</p> \n<p>It doesn’t have to be that way. A study by Deloitte financed by Google shows that allowing access to databases and clever use of the data can be a great way to boost productivity and narrow the productivity gap between Israel and the United States – currently at about 45%. And it could add 54 billion shekels a year to Israel’s gross domestic product.</p> \n<p>Deloitte analyzed the way 150 companies, representing the entire Israeli economy, obtain and process information, and the innovative applications arising from these processes. The researchers developed a unique gauge for such “data-driven innovation” – DDI – and checked how success under this metric buoyed the companies’ profits. The researchers found a positive correlation between DDI and a company’s success.</p> \n<p>Deloitte concluded that if Israeli companies climbed on the DDI index, overall productivity could improve by about 5%. In other words, that could lift the value of goods and services produced in Israel in one hour to $39 from the current $37.</p> \n<p>Energy, crime and road accidents</p> \n<p>According to Shally Tshuva, high-tech chief at Deloitte, traditional industries could benefit more from data-driven innovation than high-tech – but they’ll need government intervention if they’re to change their hidebound outlook.</p> \n<p>The research included a survey on the economic benefit of opening up databases in various countries. Deloitte said that for Israel this could mean hundreds of millions of shekels a year. The databases could include, for instance, information on road and construction-site accidents, energy consumption, crime and government spending.</p> \n<p>Israel has things to be proud of in this sphere. For example, the chapter on pricing transparency in Israel’s Food Law, which came into force at the start of the year, requires supermarket chains to disclose pricing by store. Private companies like MySupermarket and Prices have developed technologies that can read this information and make it accessible to the consumer.</p> \n<p>Another example is the Finance Ministry’s capital-market reform of 2012 to reveal the information held by institutional investors. That reform created a clearing house for pensions covering all savings at insurance companies, pension funds and provident funds.</p> \n<p>The clearing house opened the door to new ventures that use the information to make the traditionally opaque pension industry clearer. The company Wobi, for instance, developed a system that accesses the clearing-house data; it can see if a client is paying higher management fees than the norm and suggest cheaper alternatives.</p> \n<p>But Israel lags other OECD countries in data accessibility to the public. While some countries put hundreds of thousands of databases on data.gov websites, Israel provides access to only 300. Moreover, only 50% of the databases are “machine-readable” by a computer.</p> \n<p>In contrast, 90% of the databases in the United States are accessible; 95% in Britain.</p> \n<p>Three weeks ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement on database accessibility; he said Israel was contributing to the tremendous revolutions in software and artificial intelligence.</p> \n<p>“You see it on the roads with navigation systems, and in medicine, agriculture, water. But there is one place where you don’t see it – government services to the citizens. It’s time for Startup Nation to become Startup Government.”</p> \n<p>Ministries will be required to share information, Netanyahu said. People won’t have to drag themselves from counter to counter – everything will be doable at one stop.</p> \n<p>Missing commitments</p> \n<p>Don’t hold your breath. Seven years ago the government decided to open databases with economic value to the public, and in 2012 Israel even joined a global open-government initiative.</p> \n<p>But the government basically remains shut. A 2014 study that gauged the government’s ability to meet its open-government commitments found that of 13 commitments, where the goals were modest to begin with, Israel fully met only two and significantly met only three more.</p> \n<p>Israeli law doesn’t address voluntary publication of information by government agencies, other than the obligation to publish annual reports. And those contain little relevant information and aren’t sent out online.</p> \n<p>In fact, the government has no clear policy on collating and saving information efficiently. And the main grounds the state cites when rejecting freedom-of-information requests is that its system can’t recreate or retrieve the information.</p> \n<p>We’re missing out on a revolution happening in many other places. Proper collation, storage and retrieval of digital information as a routine part of decision-making could render government programs more efficient, reduce public-sector fraud, diminish abuse of state subsidies and benefits, and make tax collection more efficient.</p> \n<p>Deloitte’s research suggests that scanty government involvement is impairing private investment in data-driven innovation. “The way to realize the economic potential is by formulating a policy that creates an environment conducive to innovation and the consumption of information,” Deloitte says.</p> \n<p>“The assumption is that public funding to support integration of DDI is significantly smaller than the economic benefits likely to ensue from this investment.” Government support, Deloitte says, could come via grants or tax breaks.</p> \n<p>Another method the report cites is granting technological services like the government cloud online. “The state has an advanced, secure server ranch with a great deal of storage space,” Deloitte says.</p> \n<p>“Allowing small businesses to use them could let them implement innovative technologies they need to integrate DDI in the business, almost cost-free.”</p> \n<p>Deloitte also suggests that the state support small businesses by distributing demo versions of select software enabling use and processing of data for DDI integration.</p> \n<p>Finally, Deloitte touches on a sore point: the shortfall of people with experience in data sciences. The whole world suffers from this problem. McKinsey projects that by 2018, the world will need anywhere from 140,000 to 190,000 more information experts.</p> \n<p>This dearth of information management and analytical skills are a barrier to adopting data-driven innovation in science, health care and the public sector. Deloitte’s advice to the government is to start providing training. Australia, Britain and North Carolina already are.</p>",

        "text":["<p>I often meet Jonathan Sacks, the former British chief rabbi, for lunch. He just doesn’t know it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I eat at my desk while watching one of his ten-minute lectures on the weekly Parsha on YouTube. Sacks’ erudition—not just about Jewish texts but also about Western history, philosophy and literature—is extraordinary. Once, sitting in a synagogue in London, I came across an essay in which he employed the African-American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr’s work on Br’er Rabbit, the wily trickster from Southern folk tales, to understand the Biblical Jacob. I was amazed. How many Orthodox rabbis read African-American literary criticism? And even if they did, how many would dare use it to analyze one of the Patriarchs?</p> \n<p>Like many English-speaking Jews, I owe Sacks a debt. I daven from his siddur. I’ve led Seders from his Haggadah. He’s a wise and brilliant man. Which is why his recent essay declaring that, “Anti-Zionism is the new Anti-Semitism,” is so disappointing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In it, Sacks argues that anti-Semitism is “a virus that survives by mutating.” In every age, it latches on “to the highest source of authority available within the culture. In the Middle Ages, it was religion. In post-Enlightenment Europe it was science. Today it is human rights.” Thus, Sacks argues, today’s anti-Zionism—which on human rights grounds challenges not merely Israel’s policies, but its very existence as a Jewish state—is merely anti-Semitism in a new guise.</p> \n<p>It’s an elegant formulation. But there’s a problem. The claim that medieval Jews deserved blame for the murder of Christ, or that nineteenth century Jews were genetically inferior, had no rational basis. To believe it, you had to be an anti-Semite. It’s not irrational, however, to believe that Israel is seriously abusing Palestinian human rights. Anti-Semites may exploit those abuses to vilify Jews. But you don’t have to be anti-Semite to find them profoundly troubling. In the film The Gatekeepers, one former Shin Bet head, Avraham Shalom, says that in the West Bank, Israel has become “a brutal occupation force.” Another, Carmi Gillon, says “We are making the lives of millions unbearable.” There’s no place in Sacks’ historical schema for them.</p> \n<p>Sacks dismisses Israeli human rights abuses in one phrase: Israel is “the only fully functioning democracy in the Middle East with a free press and independent judiciary.” But in the West Bank, Israel is none of those things. The vast majority of people in the West Bank are Palestinians who cannot vote for the state that controls their lives. They are not citizens of the country in which they live. Their Jewish neighbors enjoy a free press and an independent judiciary. But West Bank Palestinians live under military law, which, among other things, forbids ten or more of them from gathering for a political purpose without prior approval from the Israeli military, even if they gather in someone’s home.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In his essay, Sacks only mentions the word “Palestinians” once. But it’s impossible to understand contemporary anti-Zionism without them. Palestinians didn’t become anti-Zionists because they needed a rationale for hating Jews and found the old ones outdated. They become anti-Zionists because their experience with Zionism was extremely rough.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the early twentieth century, Palestinians constituted the vast majority of people in British mandatory Palestine. Like colonized peoples around the world, they began developing a national consciousness and a national movement aimed at securing their independence. As Jews began migrating to Palestine in large numbers, the Zionist movement—which sought a Jewish state—became an obstacle to their national desires.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yes, Palestinian nationalists made mistakes (for instance, their rejection of the 1947 partition plan) and committed crimes (for instance, the 1929 Hebron massacre). But you don’t have to consider Palestinians blameless to understand why they might view Zionism in a negative light. After all, it was a Zionist army that displaced roughly 700,000 Palestinians between 1947 and 1949 and would not let them return. A Zionist army controls the Palestinians who live without basic rights in the West Bank. A Zionist army oversees Israel’s partial blockade of the Gaza Strip. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some Palestinians accept the two state solution on pragmatic grounds. But the vast, vast majority of Palestinians are anti-Zionist. Even most Palestinian citizens of Israel (often called “Arab Israelis”) vote for parties that seek to turn Israel into something other than a Jewish state.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The growing anti-Zionism that Sacks decries is a Palestinian export. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanction (BDS) movement began with a call from Palestinian civil society groups in 2005. Since then, BDS—and the anti-Zionism that undergirds it—has grown in direct proportion to Israeli policy. When Zionism, as practiced by Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, means entrenching Israel’s undemocratic control over millions of stateless Palestinians in the West Bank, converting people to anti-Zionism becomes easier. As BDS leader Omar Barghouti declared in 2014, “We’ve got to give credit to Netanyahu. Without him we could not have reached this far.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yes, some anti-Zionists are anti-Semites. And yes, of course, some Palestinian anti-Zionists are anti-Semites. But equating anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism means claiming that virtually all Palestinians are anti-Semites, even Palestinians like Knesset Member Ayman Oudeh, whose political party, Hadash, includes Jews, or intellectuals like Ahmad Khalidi and commentators like Rula Jebreal, who have Jewish spouses.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Equating anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism turns Palestinians into Amalekites. By denying that they might have any reason besides bigotry to dislike Zionism, it denies their historical experience and turns them into mere vessels for Jew-hatred. Thus, it does to Palestinians what anti-Semitism does to Jews. It dehumanizes them. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Like Sacks, I am a Zionist. Like him, I oppose the BDS movement. But one can be a Zionist, and celebrate the miraculous rebirth of Jewish statehood in the land of Israel, yet also recognize why Palestinians—even Palestinians who don’t hate Jews—might see our blessing as their curse. One might even call that recognition, to borrow the words of a great man, the “dignity of difference.”&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Hillary Clinton got hammered by Bernie Sanders in Wisconsin on Tuesday, but she is still the favorite in the Democratic presidential race. Donald Trump was clobbered just as hard by his main rival Ted Cruz, but his injuries could turn out to be critical: Trump’s prospects of securing enough delegates to ensure his nomination as the Republican candidate have now moved from slim to minimal. Without such a majority, the GOP will dump Trump like a hot potato and appoint another candidate instead.</p> \n<p>The difference between the two major parties isn’t just mathematical, though that’s a factor as well:&nbsp;The Clinton-Sanders face-off facilitates a binary either/or result, though the unpledged Super Delegates leave some room for maneuver. On the Republican side, in addition to Cruz’s 514, the 300 plus delegates siphoned off to Marco Rubio and John Kasich have significantly narrowed Trump’s path from his current 740 delegates to the required 1237 majority. After Wisconsin, Trump needs to win over 60 percent of the remaining delegates, but after Wisconsin, that goal seems less attainable than ever.</p> \n<p>The Democrats are holding a conventional race in which the candidate who wins the most delegates wins, if there are no shenanigans. For Sanders to start closing the 250-delegate gap with Clinton&nbsp;he needs to repeat his stellar performance in Wisconsin in all of the upcoming primaries. But even with his six straight primary victories, which could become seven after Wyoming votes on Saturday, he would still need a complete Clinton meltdown in order to achieve victories that are sufficiently decisive to seal the deal. Possible? Yes. Likely? Not very, at least not yet.</p> \n<p>On the Republican side they’re playing a different ballgame by different rules. In the GOP, it’s less a contest between rivals and more a targeted political termination of one D. Trump versus the world and vice versa. No one expects the victorious Cruz or the fading Kasich to come close to the 1,237 majority or even to Trump himself, if he fails to reach that number. The collective GOP objective is to prevent Trump from crossing the threshold needed for a first round win at the Republican National Convention. Once that’s done, Trump will be toast, and the hitherto petrified GOP stalwarts can finally start talking.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump, apparently, understands this, but instead of pondering why he’s gone off the rails in recent weeks and how he’s morphed from invincible Superman to mere mortal, he reacted last night in a wild outburst that could have been scripted by Saturday Night Live’s Drunk Uncle. Trump not only lambasted “Lyin’ Ted Cruz,”&nbsp;he explicitly accused him of illegally coordinating with his Super Pacs. The New York tycoon painted a wide-ranging conspiracy in which “Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet - he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mister Trump.” With such vain and heated rhetoric, Trump will hardly win new friends, just when he’s starting to need them.</p> \n<p>Wisconsin was never in Trump’s pocket: he went up and down in the polls in recent weeks, like a seesaw. But a series of unfortunate events, from Trump’s point of view, turned what could have been an acceptable defeat into a 49-35 percent drubbing. Trump’s controversial statements on women being punished for abortions, the energetic campaigning carried out by popular Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker on behalf of Ted Cruz, the spreading assessment that a Trump candidacy could spell a GOP disaster in Congress as well - all of these combined handed Trump his worst setback since his loss in Iowa&nbsp;at the start of the primary season.</p> \n<p>Trump is right to say he is the only candidate with any chance of securing the 1,237 majority. It’s also hard to imagine Cruz or Kasich erasing the commanding 30-point lead that Trump holds in advance of the crucial April 19 primaries in New York. Nonetheless, and despite the risk involved in once again forecasting Trump’s impending political demise, there was a sense on Tuesday night that his spell might have broken, that the magic was wearing off. Trump’s allure in the eyes of his voters was his image as an almighty winner, but once his aura of invincibility evaporates and Trump suddenly seems vulnerable, Republicans can just as well make do with a standard-issue GOP loser, albeit one who is more conservative and less controversial.</p> \n<p>Cruz’s double digit win positions him as Trump’s heir apparent, especially in light of Kasich’s dismal showing. Cruz and the conservative wing of the party will now increase pressure on Kasich to suspend his race so that Cruz can unite the anti-Trump forces behind him, but the stubborn Ohio governor is hoping that he will now surge in more moderate northeastern states in which Cruz’s rigid ideology is less attractive. Kasich knows, just like Cruz knows, that once Trump is gone people will start to remember that they can’t stand Cruz either.</p> \n<p>One way or another, the GOP is facing almost certain internal convulsions: If Trump becomes the party’s candidate, his critics will start to distance themselves and possibly even field a third party rival who will serve as a spoiler. If Trump is deposed, there will mutiny in his ranks, which could lead to a different kind of third party challenge that would also ensure a crushing GOP defeat. If Trump goes all the way, even a knight in shining armor such as House Speaker Paul Ryan won’t be able to save the day.</p> \n<p>On the Democratic side the battle is not as fierce, though that could also change soon. Although Sanders'&nbsp;victory was more or less expected in recent days, no one foresaw his 12 percent&nbsp;advantage. Reports from the Clinton camp indicated that the Democratic frontrunner has finally come to terms with the fact that Sanders is no mere nuisance, but a clear and present danger to her hitherto inevitable nomination. Clinton activists told television networks on Tuesday night that gloves are coming off and the days of playing nice will soon be over.</p> \n<p>Conveniently, Sanders has supplied his rivals with valuable ammunition: in an unfocused interview with the New York Daily News, Sanders seemed insufficiently primed on everything from gun control to breaking up the banks to West Bank settlements and even to New York’s subway. Wishing to impress with his first hand knowledge of the underground train, Sanders mentioned that the subway token, which, he later found out, was last in use in 2003.</p> \n<p>Sanders’ convincing win in Wisconsin has certainly given him turbo-momentum that could help him whittle down Clinton’s already shrinking advantage in New York. Wisconsin, after all, wasn’t just a small state holding a caucus, but a full-fledged primary with unprecedented and enthusiastic Democratic participation. Sanders won big with younger Democrats, with men more than women, with the avowedly liberal as well as the politically independent. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>On the other hand, Wisconsin, with all due respect, isn’t New York, or Pennsylvania, New Jersey or California, for that matter. It is whiter, it is more liberal and it has a long tradition of attraction to the kind of egalitarian/socialist politics that Sanders represents. In order to try and close the gap with Clinton, Sanders will have to make inroads with African Americans and Hispanics, and he’ll have to do it quickly. It still seems like a mission impossible, unless Clinton panics, starts making foolish mistakes and goes into a tailspin. If she is perceived as going down she will soon find herself, just like Trump, crashing to the ground.</p> \n<p>Which could leave us with the utterly fantastic, Ripley’s Believe it Or Not scenario of a contest between two extremes, Cruz versus Sanders, capitalist versus socialist, hard right against deep left, messianic Evangelism pitted against devout secularism, a Christian from Texas going head to head, God Save Us, with a Jew from Brooklyn.&nbsp;It brings to mind the curse disguised as a blessing “May You Live in Interesting Times,” which is erroneously ascribed to ancient Chinese wise men. The origin of the saying is in Europe in the 1930s, and we all know how that&nbsp;ended. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Has one of the biggest mysteries in contemporary literature finally been solved? On Sunday, as Israelis prepared for Rosh Hashanah, the French investigative website Mediapart published a scoop that rocked the literary world: The famous Italian author writing under the pseudonym Elena Ferrante is a translator (German to Italian) and editor named Anita Raja, wife of an author named Domenico Starnone. She worked for the publishing house Edizioni, which also publishes Ferrante’s books. In 2016, Time named Ferrante, author among other things of the four-volume “Neapolitan Novels,” one of the 100 most influential people on the planet.</p> \n<p>Raja had never been suspected of being Ferrente before, nor has anybody proven the claim to be true. The allegation was made by an Italian journalist, Claudio Gatti, after months of ferreting, based less on analysis of language use and more on cross-checking money transfers, tax payments and land registries. Raja earned much more from Edizione than she could have for translation and editing, certainly compared with other employees, and the amounts corresponded to the dates of publication of translated Ferrante books in Europe and the United States.</p> \n<p>Gatti also showed that shortly after Ferrante’s books were published in Europe and the U.S., Raja or Starnone bought homes in Rome and Toscana.</p> \n<p>In an email interview with Haaretz last December, Ferrante wrote, “Everything that can rightfully be invaded are my books. There, inside the cover, you find me as an author with a first name and surname It’s not my pen name that creates interest in my books, but my books that create interest in my pen name. My private life is completely separate from my public presence in the books. No one can invade it.”</p> \n<p>Practically since she began writing in the early 1990s, and certainly since she achieved the rank of most popular contemporary female Italian writer, the literary world has been obsessing over Ferrante’s true identity. Two years ago The Guardian called her identity the biggest literary mystery today. Theories abounded: Some thought her a Neapolitan woman who married and divorced a non-Italian man, some assumed she is in her 70s, others that she is an academic living in northern Italy.</p> \n<p>Her books ostensibly contained some clues. Her first, Troubling Love was published in Italy in 1992 and dealt with the troubled relations a between a daughter and mother who drowned to death in her 40s. The Days of Abandonment, published in 2002, was about Olga, whose husband abandoned her after eating dinner in the house one day while the children played in the other room. The Lost Daughter talks about a girl born in Naples who lives in Florence and finally feels happiness after her daughters move to live with their father in Canada.</p> \n<p>My Brilliant Friend is the first of the Neapolitan tetralogy, about the friendship of Elena and Lila from childhood to age 66. Friends and rivals, both grew up in the same impoverished, violent neighborhood at a time that women, even the most scintillating, were not given education or considered responsible for their fate, and were vulnerable to the brutality of the men around them.</p> \n<p>The Neapolitan tetralogy, an epic spanning four books that encompasses themes and abilities that appeared in her previous books, is widely felt to be Ferrante’s finest literary endeavor. She writes without mercy or finessing about “female” subjects – friendship between women, becoming a wife (or mother) in the turbulent, Mafia-ridden areas of Napoli and the Italian south, in an era of social and political change.</p> \n<p>Escape from Germany</p> \n<p>“A story succeeds if it is able to establish its own autonomy, if it is able to affect even my beliefs, as its author,” she told Haaretz last year. “A story is not a manifesto; it’s an attempt to translate the inherent disorder of the human experience into words.”</p> \n<p>The ties between Raja, who lives in Rome with her husband – who had also been suspected of being the mysterious Ferrante – and Naples, are rather tenuous. But as Gatti reported, her mother’s family story is heartrending, and begs the thought that the tendency to look bleak reality and tragedy in the eye, especially as it pertains to women, originates there.</p> \n<p>Raja’s Jewish mother, red-headed blue-eyed Golda “Goldi” Frieda Petzenbaum, was born in Germany in 1927. The mother’s parents, Sally Regina and Abraham Wrumek,fled Poland because of the anti-Semitism – to Germany, but in 1937, as life for Jews in Germany became intolerable, they decamped to Milan. Fascism and anti-Semitic laws however dogged their heels: In September 1938, Mussolini declared his race laws, and two years later, in June 1940, some days after Italy had officially joined World War II, the military announced a warrant for all foreign Jews. Goldi and her mother were detained in one camp, in an isolated village called Spezzano in Italy’s south. The father was sent to a concentration camp for men.</p> \n<p>Goldi managed to escape Spezzano, fleeing to Milan with a family friend, and hid until November 1943, when the friend, her mother and Goldi fled onward to Switzerland. Finally the family reunited and moved to Naples, where Goldi finished high school and married Renato Raja, a judge. Their daughter Anita was born in 1953.</p> \n<p>In contrast to her intensely Neapolitan characters, Raja’s personal history with the city is short. The family left Naples for Rome when she was 3. Yet neither Rome nor her Jewish history mark Ferrante’s books, and while still maintaining anonymity, “Ferrante” claimed in interviews and the like to have grown up in Naples, in poverty, as the daughter of a seamstress.</p> \n<p>Homes in Rome and Tuscany</p> \n<p>“The most urgent question for a writer may seem to be ‘What experiences do I have as my material, what experiences do I feel able to narrate?’ But that’s not right,” she said in an interview with the Paris Review. “The more pressing question is ‘What is the word, what is the rhythm of the sentence, what tone best suits the things I know?’ Without the right words, without long practice in putting them together, nothing comes out alive and true. It’s not enough to say, as we increasingly do, ‘These events truly happened, it’s my real life, the names are the real ones, I’m describing the real places where the events occurred.”</p> \n<p>In 2000, when Ferrante’s book Troubling Love was made into a movie, Raja bought a seven-room apartment in an expensive Roman neighborhood and a year later, she bought a house in rural Tuscany. More property was bought with the success of the Neapolitan tetrology, starting in 2014. In June this year another luxury apartment was bought in Rome, in Starnone’s name.</p> \n<p>Raja meanwhile denies being the author and since Gatti’s thunderous expose, a counterattack has begun. One Roman paper wondered at Gatti’s priorities and wrote that perhaps he had pursued his aim with “fury that was worthy of a better cause .”</p> \n<p>“Stop the siege of Elena Ferrante. She is not a criminal,” said Sandra Ozzola Ferri, Ferrante’s publisher, who also accused Gatti of indulging in gutter press. The British writer Jojo Moyes tweeted that she and Ferrante owe nobody “nothing but our books.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Lovers of Elena Ferrante’s books have been on an emotional roller coaster this week. The ride began with sensational (supposed) identification of the acclaimed and assertively anonymous author of heart-wrenching sagas that have captivated millions of hearts around the world. But the shiver of delight was succeeded by disappointment that evolved into anger, even into a sense of offense, surrounding the identity-outing itself and the manner of it all.</p> \n<p>For one thing, the methods utilized by the journalist Claudio Gatti, who tipped Ferrante to be a German-to-Italian translator and editor named Anita Raja, are usually reserved for investigating corrupt politicians and mafia dons. Ferrante’s whole crime was wishing to remain anonymous in a world obsessed with exposing and hounding celebrities. The ferreting into the financials of her and her husband, the author Domenico Starnone, leaves a bad taste. “He forensically obtained and investigated financial and property records,” the Times Literary Supplement describes it, in an article defending her choice of anonymity.</p> \n<p>Whiff of misogyny&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The somewhat limping arguments offered in defense of the exposure – that it’s important for the poor of Naples to know who Ferrante really is, and that Ferrante, Raja, owes her success to them, whiffs of misogyny. Would a male author have been expected to return something to the community about which he wrote, ostensibly because he owes his success to them? Would he be criticized for acquiring homes in Rome, where he lives, rather than in Naples, about which he wrote? After all, literature isn’t charity work. Ferrante owes her success to her talent and writing skills.</p> \n<p>The forced exposure of a female author by a male journalist is a manifestation of the balance of power between the genders in society, the very balance that Ferrante describes so evocatively. All Ferrante’s books are about women (and are typically adorned with “chick-lit” cover imagery that appalls some but that the Atlantic, for one, dubbed “subtle genius.”</p> \n<p>Her plots center on the relationships between the women. It is evident from her books that women’s lives matter. They ascribe the highest esteem to teachers who enable genius girls who grew up in poverty like Elena (the narrator in her famed four-volume work “Neapolitan Novels”) and her friend Lena to escape the cruel, violent fate awaiting them as housewives and mothers, in which beatings are an accepted, central means to subject them to their husbands, through education.</p> \n<p>Speculation about gender</p> \n<p>Some even suspect Ferrante triggered rage because she, a woman writer, managed to invent, all by herself, a plot that complex and credible, without having experienced such things herself. Throughout the years there has been speculation that Ferrante was actually a man; one theory named Raja’s husband Starnone. Possibly the discovery that the Neapolitan Novels are not memoirs in genre – an area considered to be more female – but a sweeping imaginary creation of fiction is hard for people who don’t believe that women can write with such power. Such sentiment may have been newly “empowered” by crudely misogynistic utterings by Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton, the first female to reach the presidential finals.</p> \n<p>After that polemic, only one question remains open in my mind: What does it matter who Elena Ferrante is? What does she owe us, anyway?</p> \n<p>Everything she wrote really happened, if not to Elena and Lena, then to other women in Italy and around the world. Ferrante didn’t invent poverty in Naples. Ferrante did not invent the denial of schooling to brilliant girls, and the terrible effect that had on their lives. Ferrante did not invent beaten housewives. She did not invent the power of female friendship and the ability of relationships between women to change each other’s worlds. All these things are real.</p> \n<p>Here is a quote from Ferrante in an interview she gave last year to the Financial Times, which looks prescient given the present debate. “Today much has changed but I still think the men who can really be trusted are a minority maybe (and this is what I tend to believe) it’s because male power, whether violently or delicately imposed, is still bent on subordinating us. Too many women are humiliated every day and not just on a symbolic level.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Senior executives of Israel’s five largest food manufacturers – Tnuva, Osem, Strauss Group, Unilever and the Central Bottling Company (Coca Cola Israel) – gathered in Shefayim.</p> \n<p>The last time they gathered together like this was for an emergency meeting three months ago on the Health Ministry’s proposed regulations for products with large amounts of sugar and salt. That raised the hackles of the antitrust commissioner, who ordered an investigation. This time, however, the antitrust watchdog didn’t need to worry about a cartel being formed under our noses.</p> \n<p>The food executives were meeting to learn from young startups how they can improve their work processes, find new ways to grow raw materials and prevent bacterial contamination on their production lines.</p> \n<p>All told, about 450 people came to the conference, including some senior figures in the global food industry such as the chief scientists from Pepsico and Estee Lauder, and the CEO of Rabobank, a Dutch multinational bank that is a leading global investor in food and agricultural finance.</p> \n<p>For Strauss, which is behind the conference, this meeting was the culmination of a four-year journey. It started with the “Alpha” project in Strauss, which was meant to create and connect technology entrepreneurs, nutritional experts and food scientists, and moved on to the establishment of a body to invest in food technologies as part of a new high-tech incubator named The Kitchen FoodTech Hub a year and a half ago.</p> \n<p>The offices of The Kitchen in Ashdod reflect the attempts of an 80-year-old firm to look young again. A large kitchen with a refrigerator featuring transparent doors – and filled with Strauss’ Milky pudding products stands near the entrance. The rooms all have packages of erasable markers and chalk to draw on the walls and windows. The walls themselves bear corporate-style slogans in English, such as “Better Industry. Better Food. Better World,” or “Recipe for Success.”</p> \n<p>While Strauss is a trend-setter in placing women in influential positions, with women making up 42% of management in the company – the corridors of the incubator suffer from an almost complete absence of women, which makes them much more like the local high-tech scene.</p> \n<p>When Strauss won the tender from the Chief Scientist’s Office in the Economy Ministry to set up its technology incubator, it led to quite a lot of criticism from the other bidders, who claimed Strauss would operate it as its own corporate research and development arm financed by the government.</p> \n<p>“Instead of the entrepreneur coming with the product, the incubator that is held by the corporation will convince him to develop products that interest [the company],” one of Staruss’ competitors told TheMarker at the time.</p> \n<p>Jonathan Berger, CEO of The Kitchen, takes it all in stride. He brings us into rooms in the complex and presents us to the various teams. “Every entrepreneur who comes here usually arrives with a ‘proof of concept,’” he says.</p> \n<p>“We examine and bring in companies that do not necessarily deal with Strauss’ areas of interest. For example, a company that produces protein from flies or one that gives a solution for meat,” says Berger. “The likelihood that Strauss will buy a company that makes a chip that identifies salmonella is very low. What is more reasonable is that the buyer will be a quality assurance company, and Strauss might buy services from them in return for payment. The new company that we brought in, which does personalization of recipes on the internet (My FavorEats), came from an accelerator program that Tnuva sponsors. We are focused on companies that can reach a milestone that will allow them to raise money at the end of the incubator period, and if the companies do not come with their own crystallized idea, then it won’t mature.”</p> \n<p>One of the first companies that was hosted in the incubator was Deep Learning Robotics, which shows the type of investment the hothouse is looking for. They develop smart robots that know how to carry out various tasks on the production line. Heavy industry is characterized by many robots who work all the time on the same task, says Berger. “But the food industry is characterized by short production series and high variability of products, so the penetration of robots into this industry is significantly lower relative to other industries.”</p> \n<p>Tasks that are complicated to program, such as arranging crackers in a tray, a change in the form of the cracker or tray means changing the production line, and stopping to reprogram it, says Berger. DLR uses cameras that program the robots by having cameras watch and learn from workers doing the same job. After a few hours of acculturation, the robots know how to do the new job themselves. “We hope DLR’s technology will help in increasing productivity in industry,” he says.</p> \n<p>Long development cycle, high risk</p> \n<p>The choice of the incubator model looked like an opportunity not to be missed. For those running the incubator, it is a simple way to leverage government funding, and it’s easy to understand why there was competition: They are required to finance only 15% of the investment in the startups during the incubator period, in addition to operating expenses, some 40 million shekels ($10.7 million) over the period of the incubator franchise of eight years. In return, they receive 20% to 50% of the shares in the companies in the incubator.</p> \n<p>It is an opportunity, too, for the Israeli government to diversify its high-tech investments, by encouraging strategic investors with deep pockets to invest in young startups in areas characterized by long development cycles, large investment needs and a high-risk profile.</p> \n<p>The incubator program is intended to help the startups bridge the financing problems while being helped to reach the stage in which they can stand on their own feet and raise the capital they need to carry on in the private sector. In addition, the program is intended to help meet such goals as transferring knowledge and technology from research institutions to business applications, create a technological and entrepreneurial culture in Israel, and provide investment opportunities for private venture capital – in addition to bringing R&amp;D operations to the periphery.</p> \n<p>MK Erel Margalit (Zionist Union), who is promoting a center of innovative food industries in the eastern Galilee along with 17 mayors from the region, says that in recent years most of the investments were about the internet, mobile and communications, and that in the case of a slowdown in these areas, Israel could well suffer. In comparison, the demand for food will remain high even during a global economic crisis, says Margalit.</p> \n<p>For Strauss, opening the incubator signifies another stage of maturity, along with the change in the way it views the term “innovation” in the food industry. So far, such innovation was linked to launching new products, whose main goal was to beat competitors and take market share from them, for example Osem’s flat pretzels or fancy new yoghurts. Now this view is changing to how to create something out of nothing, and develop new markets.</p> \n<p>The best way to find such technologies is through creating a community, cooperation and meetings between the young entrepreneurs and the older companies. This is exactly why Strauss created its Alpha project in March 2012.</p> \n<p>“Until now, we talked about changes that meant cannibalization of other products, improvements such as Bazooka [gum] without sugar or manufacturing new value for the customer such as Actimel,” says Dagan Eshel, head of Alpha Strauss. “But for Strauss, most of whose operations are outside Israel, there is no way to compete with the global giants using the same weapons. We need to create value where we have an advantage, and this advantage is that we are Israelis, with a developed high-tech community,” he says.</p> \n<p>Alpha Strauss’ activities show the great value that large food companies get from their exposure to young entrepreneurs. “We met with an Israeli company that developed new technology to handle home food. We did experiments with them and found that the technology could pasteurize hummus without damaging its taste and give it a long shelf life,” says Eshel.</p> \n<p>“The company was not interested in developing the system for industry, and focused on the home user. But this meeting gave us an idea to search for similar technology, and we found it at an Italian company that worked with drying leather. In order to show how much this story is revolutionary, we conducted 8,500 lab tests, 2,000 chemical tests and threw out 100 tons of hummus along the way to preparing the technology for our factory,” says Eshel.</p> \n<p>Sometimes the Israeli entrepreneurs come to the food companies with technologies intended for one specific purpose, but after meeting with and understanding their customers’ needs, they can adapt the product for a different purpose. An example is a startup named Viaar. “They came to our office with their technology, radio frequency sensors that they use to identify breast cancer at an early stage,” says Eshel. During their conversation, Strauss understood that they knew how to identify a small object inside a biological matrix, a human body. So it was possible they could do the same inside food. “The next morning, we received an image of a small piece of glass inside a cake. They went from a situation in which they had an amazing application for a problematic market, medicine, which takes years before you receive approvals, to another, important solution for an easier market to implement,” says Eshel.</p> \n<p>The biggest challenge is in the area of health, he says: Reducing sugar, fat and salt in products without harming the taste and texture, while reducing costs for production processes so customers will receive healthier products at a good price. Another challenge involves food safety. The opportunity is in personalization and creating individually appropriate food, says Eshel. In the future, instead of sending trucks with products, we will transport information over the internet and the consumers will receive only the raw materials, which machines will know how to manufacture into various complex products, he adds.</p> \n<p>Eshel says they have seen some 700 new technologies over the past year and a half, and Strauss has agreements with about 20 companies at various stages of development.</p> \n<p>Global investments in foodtech in the first half of 2016 were $1.8 billion, a drop of about 20% from the same period the previous year. Most of this drop can be attributed to a general fall in venture capital investments in all areas, which declined 14% in the same period. Most of the rest of the gap can be explained by electronic sales sites for food reaching their full potential – for now – which made up a large part of such investments in 2015.</p> \n<p>On the positive side are signs of growth in startups raising funds in the first half of 2016 (307 fund raising rounds in the first half of the year), and a large number of new foodtech investors, up 52% to 425. This is mostly due to the rising number of accelerators, venture capital funds and grants available to startups in the foodtech and agritech sectors.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The news of Shimon Peres’ passing was the talk of the day at the DLD Innovation Conference, which came to a close Thursday in Tel Aviv. The original plan was for Dr. Yossi Vardi, the conference chair, to hold a public discussion with his close friend Peres on technology, high-tech and Israel’s place as a leading innovator in the world. But when Peres suffered a stroke two weeks ago, the event, at which the prize for Outstanding Startup was also to be announced, was canceled.</p> \n<p>In recent years, Peres was a splendid ambassador for Israeli high-tech. He took part in many international conferences and economic forums at which he energetically promoted the Israeli high-tech industry. Peres met with the founders of tech giants like Google, Amazon, HP and many more, and encouraged their top executives to invest in Israel and assist in technological developments and collaborative projects. Just a few months ago, the Peres Center for Peace, located in Jaffa, opened the new Israeli Innovation Center with interactive exhibitions about the inventions that have made Israel the “Startup Nation.”</p> \n<p>Read more on Shimon Peres:&nbsp;Peres pursued peace for sake of Israel's values, and Palestinians' dignity&nbsp;|&nbsp;Hawk to dove, pro-settlements to pro-peace: Shimon Peres was it all&nbsp;|&nbsp;The countless contradictions of the late and great Shimon Peres&nbsp;|&nbsp;Obama, world leaders mourn Peres&nbsp;|&nbsp;Shimon Peres, the eternal immigrant&nbsp;|&nbsp;Peres' quixotic battle for Israeli-Palestinian peace&nbsp;|&nbsp;Drop the kitsch: Shimon Peres had a dark side, too&nbsp;|&nbsp;Peres, 1923-2016: an interactive timeline</p> \n<p>At the center’s inauguration in July, Peres talked about how, since the state’s founding, Israel has managed – against all odds and with scant resources – to invent and manufacture from scratch leading technologies in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry, by drawing on its human capital as the most important basis for all of this. “Science, innovation and peace are our goal, and they must be there for all, not just Israel – all the nations of the region should benefit. I believe that everyone has the potential to become a scientist, and Israel must strive toward this,” Peres said.</p> \n<p>Maxine Fassberg, CEO of Intel Israel, said Thursday, “What’s left after his passing is his vision. Peres was a remarkable man of vision – in the field of technology as well. More than a decade ago, he identified the importance of the nanotech field, described it as Israel’s future and put unprecedented energy and effort into it. Every year, at the Presidential Conference that he founded, he displayed the best of Israeli tech innovations. Peres was the prophet of the high-tech superpower and someone who could really read the tech map – sometimes better than people in that field. It was a huge honor for us to host him at our plant in Kiryat Gat and to show him how we are making his vision come true.”</p> \n<p>The Israel Advanced Technology Industries, the umbrella organization of high-tech and life sciences industries in Israel, also noted Peres’ contribution: “We will always remember him as someone who for many decades promoted high-tech and life sciences in Israel, who nurtured close ties with the industry and found many ways to promote the importance of the innovative and entrepreneurial thinking at its core,” the organization said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Professor Peretz Lavie, president of the Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, said Thursday that in a letter he wrote to him in 2013, Peres said, “The researchers and scientists of the Technion, including many talented young people, are helping to situate Israel as a bold and original global laboratory at the forefront of scientific development in the world. Your path-breaking innovation knows no bounds. You are the guarantee for Israel maintaining its qualitative advantage in the future.”</p> \n<p>Lavie says that Peres was a very unique person, a man of optimism and vision, who believed in the power of science and engineering to move humanity toward a better future. He was a strong supporter of nanotechnology research and even laid the cornerstone for the Technion’s Nanoelectronics Center. At the time, this was a brand new and pioneering field, and it is now a key area of activity at the institution.</p>",

        "text":["<p>JTA — In January 2015, Rabbi Marcelo Polakoff was stuck in Buenos Aires when his phone rang.</p> \n<p>He’d been planning a trip to New York but a storm had canceled all flights, and Polakoff, the rabbi of Cordoba, a province in central Argentina, was cooling his heels at his sister’s house.</p> \n<p>A woman he didn’t know was on the line. She introduced herself by saying that she remembered him from a wedding he’d performed for a friend of hers, and asked if he could help her family in Buenos Aires.</p> \n<p>The woman was a cousin of Alberto Nisman, the Argentine federal prosecutor who was found dead last year, just days after accusing then-President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of covering up Iran’s role in the 1994 bombing of this city’s AMIA Jewish center.</p> \n<p>Polakoff did not know Nisman, but the call brought the rabbi into a circle of private mourning, public outrage and global intrigue over an event that made headlines around the world.</p> \n<p>Nisman was 51 at his death. He left behind a formidable tribe of women: his mother, Sara Garfunkel; her sister, the psychologist Lidia Garfunkel; a sister, Sandra Nisman; and his former wife, Sandra Arroyo Salgado, the mother of their daughters Iara, who was 15 at the time of her father’s death, and Kala, who was 8.</p> \n<p>When the cousin called Polakoff, their usual rabbi was out of town. In fact, half the Nisman family was out of town. Polakoff was asked to accompany Nisman’s mother to identify his body.</p> \n<p>Argentine law stipulates that a body must be formally identified before burial. On the day of his death, Sara Garfunkel had been taken by jittery police officers to Nisman’s apartment, where she was the first to see his lifeless body splayed on the bathroom floor in a pool of drying blood.</p> \n<p>Ten days later, she was asked to view the body again at the city morgue.</p> \n<p>“You can’t imagine,” Polakoff, 49, the president of the Latin American Rabbinical Assembly, told JTA. “Sandra [Nisman’s sister] decided not to enter, and Sara asked me to accompany her. Of course, it was very complex and difficult. But this is what rabbis do.”</p> \n<p>Polakoff uses his hands to frame a smallish oval on his face. That is what he was able to see of Alberto Nisman’s face when they were called upon to identify the body.</p> \n<p>“The magnitude of an event like this can unfocus you,” said Polakoff, who had not told his story before speaking to JTA. “During this year and a bit, I’ve tried not to lose focus and to attempt to simply accompany the family. It is paradoxical that I didn’t meet Alberto Nisman alive. Incredibly, lamentably, it came to me to see him only in death.”</p> \n<p>Polakoff also served as shomer, or guardian, of Nisman’s body at the funeral home in the hours before a public wake – a custom of Argentine Jewry distinct from the shiva.</p> \n<p>“I was there alone with the coffin for a few hours — well, ‘alone,’” he said. “The streets were blocked off, there were barriers up, guards, snipers, helicopters, attack dogs, anti-terror vehicles.</p> \n<p>“Later on, when people started streaming in, there was a waitress, not Jewish, who worked there who’d seen me since I slipped in, who came up to me sobbing, crying rivers of tears. She grabbed my arm and said, ‘Rabbi, I am incensed. I feel desperate. Did you see the deployment out there, even snipers on the roof?’ She’d noticed even that. A waitress. ‘If the prosecutor had had this kind of security two weeks ago, we wouldn’t be here today.’ Sobbing.”</p> \n<p>For years, Nisman had received threats to his life and to the well-being of his family. His friends to this day aren’t certain if he was fully aware he was endangering his life by investigating Iran’s role in the bombing of the AMIA community center or in accusing Kirchner of covering it up.</p> \n<p>Nisman was protected around the clock by a detail of the Argentine Federal Police. On Jan. 18, 2015, for unknown reasons, they refused to break down his door for the better part of a day when he stopped answering his phone.</p> \n<p>Now his family is guarded by officers of the same security force.</p> \n<p>“It’s a different government,” friends of the family point out, accurately but without conviction.</p> \n<p>On Jan. 29, 2015, the hearse’s slow journey to the Jewish cemetery of La Tablada was interrupted by people jumping into the middle of street shouting “Nisman!” or “Argentina!” or both. Others threw flowers onto the car.</p> \n<p>“At one point, while I was riding in the hearse towards the burial, someone jumped out and kissed the car, and it was then that I allowed myself to react, a little,” Polakoff said. “It was unbelievable, unbelievable.”</p> \n<p>As part of his eulogy, Polakoff told a story directed at Kala, Nisman’s younger daughter. It was about a little boy her age who liked asking his rabbi tough questions. One day he asked why crocodiles, so ugly and dangerous, live so long, compared to butterflies, which are so pretty and benign.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know,” the rabbi answered. “But I do know a crocodile can’t achieve in 1,000 years what a butterfly achieves in two weeks.”</p> \n<p>Kala read aloud a letter to her father that ended “Bye Daddy, I’ll see you when I die.”</p> \n<p>In January of this year, Mauricio Macri, the newly elected president of Argentina, invited the two Nisman girls to his home to mark the anniversary of their father’s death. Their mother was abroad, so they went with Polakoff.</p> \n<p>“It was the two Macris with Antonia, their 4-year-old little girl and the three of us,” the rabbi recalled. “I read Psalm 23 and ‘El Maleh Rachamim’ and explained what it meant to the president.”</p> \n<p>The president’s office tweeted an image of the gathering that went viral alongside the message that Macri promised the Nisman girls “there will be justice.”</p> \n<p>Last month, a Buenos Aires court ruled that the investigation into Nisman’s death must be handled by a federal court, under the assumption that “the death of Natalio Alberto Nisman could also be a result of the act of a third party.”</p> \n<p>Despite the tragic and tabloid-ready circumstances of Nisman’s death, Polakoff said he tries not to view it as anything but a particular family’s loss.</p> \n<p>“When death comes early, is violent and has national and international significance, it should be indistinguishable” from any other, from a rabbi’s point of view, he said.</p> \n<p>“Because for the person who has lost a loved one too early and violently, no matter what other transcendence the event may have it is the same to me whoever is the person who died.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s hard to be a Jew! Not because of the anti-Semitism spreading in the world, not because of the thousand-and-one ugly things that the world, or parts of it, invented about the Jews. No, it's mainly because of the legacy.</p> \n<p>Every pure Jewish baby born into this world – even if not defiled by some Arab doctor, as the wife of Habayit Hayehudi MK Bezalel Smotrich puts it – already carries an unbearable burden on his shoulders: a legacy going back millennia, which is embedded in the memory of every Jew on the planet.</p> \n<p>In his most recent speech to Congress, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu managed to bring the strife with Iran back to the era of King Ahasuerus and his evil adviser Haman. A mere 2,500 years ago, no more. Prime Minister Menachem Begin is said to have remarked about Egypt, “Our forefathers built the pyramids” – and that was a matter of 5,000 years ago.</p> \n<p>Happily, during a lovely trip I recently took with my wife and daughter to Rome and southern Italy, the memory span barely reached back 2,000 years there. Yet while admiring the beauty of the country and its long history, replete with so many seminal, painful events, we found ourselves sunk up to our necks in the question of what the goyim did to the Jews, from the destruction of the Second Temple in the year 70 C.E. through the expulsion from Spain, the Inquisition, the first ghetto, and through to the darkness of the 20th century.</p> \n<p>That’s how it is: Even when the Jews try to enjoy themselves, they get 2,000 years of bitterness cast in their faces.</p> \n<p>Since we have been living with Jews all our lives, I shared the story of Shimon Bar Giora, who had bravely fought the Romans, with some of my partners on the trip. Bar Giora was so dogged in his struggle that he ordered his brothers-in-arms who wanted to surrender to be killed. When the Romans attacked, he fled to some tunnel (sounds familiar), where he wrapped himself in a shroud, in order to cast an aura of terror upon the enemy.</p> \n<p>But Bar Giora was caught and taken to Rome, where he was dragged along in a victory parade while being lashed. At the end of the march, he was cast from the Tarpeian Rock, overlooking the Forum, to his death. How badly I wanted to see that rock, to salute the courageous warrior.</p> \n<p>My insightful friend asked if I remember the history of my forefathers going back 2,000 years. I sniggered, and answered: “I’ve already forgotten what I ate last night.” My friend said, “That is a good thing!” Astonished, I replied, “But to know history is a noble thing.” He dismissed that with a wave of his hand. “Let it go, who knows what’s happened? Why drag a legacy of thousands of years around on your back?”</p> \n<p>And in conclusion, my friend said something that stunned me: “The more ignorant a person is of historic sense, the more free and available he is to build the future.”</p> \n<p>I thought about that and finally accepted the sentiment, in part: History is a good thing, as long as it doesn’t become an obstacle to the future.</p> \n<p>The tour I participated in looked good, and promising. Without prior planning, it became a perfectly Arab-Jewish tour. A tour of equals who came to enjoy, to learn, to appreciate. And, albeit unplanned, a chance to forge ties of friendship. The truth is that this is how a person achieves greatness: when things that touch on humanity are not alien to him.</p> \n<p>I, with my nave optimism, thought that such trips, free of the shackles of the damned conflict, are an important pillar of peace. I promised my friends to fight for subsidies for such trips, so as to strengthen the amity between Jews and Arabs. In Israel, thank God, plenty of resources have been allocated to subsidizing hatred and separatism.</p> \n<p>Don’t the people who find the human in every person deserve a little encouragement too?</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel’s first lady, Nechama Rivlin, has trouble making her way through the garden at the president's residence in Jerusalem, and gets some help from an oxygen concentrator. It was decided to grow plants, such as angelonias and balsam, on the patio, so she wouldn’t have to walk far to reach them. “I grew up in a moshav, close to the earth,” says Rivlin, the wife of President Reuven Rivlin, “although I left when I was 18, so I didn’t completely turn into an agriculturalist. But until this day, everything that has to do with agriculture is important to me. We had fruit trees. There were these kind of plates that we used to water with a hose and [my mother] would plant all sorts of things so that we didn’t need to go to the supermarket for anything,” she recalls.</p> \n<p>The spirit Rivlin took with her to the presidential residence fits in with the spirit of the times, as many Israelis take to a the growing trend of cultivating vegetable gardens in their homes. The well-gardened inner yard of the president’s residence is hardly the site of a guerrilla urban garden, but the current tenant’s love for agriculture and plants has turned gardening into a central theme here. When she moved in, Rivlin wondered what she could contribute to the residence. Alongside rearranging the art on display, her love for agriculture and plants encouraged her to make the patio bloom again — as well as create two communal gardens outside. Dishon and Menashe Nissim, the gardeners who tend to the them, join our conversation in one of the shady spots. The patio, which lets light into the house, is built like a sukkah. “During Sukkot, we lay palm fronds on the concrete rafters and eat meals out there,” says Rivlin. “There are also butterflies that lay their eggs on the patio, which turn into larvae, pupae and butterflies. That’s how my grandchildren learned about the life cycle of a butterfly.”</p> \n<p>The garden in the president’s residence was designed by architect Abba Elhanani, who planned the structure, and landscape architects Miller-Bloom. At the edge of the bower is an amphitheater covered in vegetation that serves as a reception area. The agronomists responsible for planting the garden designed it as a botanical microcosm of Israeli flora. It is one of the most beautiful gardens created in Israel: free of peculiarities, over-design and superfluous materials. With grass, trees, flowers, simple tiles and works of art, it is an island of green in the heart of a stuffy city. It wouldn’t hurt to open it to the public.</p> \n<p>The garden itself has gone through various phases. At the initiative of Nina Katzir, the wife of Israel's 4th president Ephraim Katzir, 50 olive trees were brought here from the Judean Hills. Three citrus trees were planted in the southern garden in 1985 to represent the settling of new Israeli communities. Five cedar trees were planted at the request of Ora Herzog, the wife of Chaim Herzog, the country's 6th president, to represent the north. Now, Rivlin is adding her metamorphosis.</p> \n<p>Over the years, the couple lived in apartment houses, “so [we] didn’t have much influence over the garden.” In their last home, on Jerusalem's Nof Harim Street, she resurfaced her old passion. “We had a neighbor there, Ruth Begin — no doubt you’ve heard of her,” Rivlin says with a smile, mentioning the wife of politician Benny Begin. “Part of her personality was to work in the garden. They had everything there. She would get up at 4 A.M. to work. When we arrived here, we thought — Orit and I — ‘What can we do to leave my mark on the president’s residence?’” she says, referring to her personal assistant. “It’s important to me that children know pepper is not just bought at the supermarket. And it was important for me to have a communal garden here, like there are throughout the city,” she adds, explaining how she joined the urban trend.</p> \n<p>Her influence was felt as soon as the question of whom to recruit to work on the garden came up. “We decided it was important to nurture at-risk youth. A group of children from the Beit Hatzayar and Gymnasia Rehavia schools were brought here. We had three meetings with them and they bonded with one another. These are kids on the verge of prison. It isn’t easy. We worked on all sorts of things in the garden and we also made nest boxes for birds. These are activities that develop their hands,” Rivlin notes. In addition, students with special needs were invited from the Beit Hinuch school. When asked what influence the gardening had on the various youth and children who worked in the garden, she says, “The very fact that they came here, even those with disabilities, is enough for me.”</p> \n<p>In one of the gardens, constructed hanging window boxes are filled with herbs like basil, oregano, hyssop, mint, white-leaved savory and sage. “I learned botany for my undergraduate degree at the Hebrew University. That’s how I know all the plant names,” says Rivlin. In the second garden under her management are spiral flowerbeds with seasonal, perennial plants: alyssums, lobelias, coleus, begonias, spiderwort and succulents, too. Currently, there aren’t edible vegetables in the garden. “The earth here isn’t good enough, but we could put dirt in pots and grow radishes and beans,” she supposes.</p> \n<p>Rivlin declares that she supports taking care of the environment, and that there is a link between growing plants, urban gardening, recycling and protecting open spaces. “Everything is connected to everything; if only there was more awareness,&quot; she says, choosing her words carefully. &quot;Connecting to the earth is so important. It’s better to build upward; not everyone needs to live in a villa. I can’t go to protests, but I would happily join protests with those who oppose building on the beach.” At Rivlin’s request, a recycling room has been added to the president’s residency for paper, plastic, glass and batteries. They've even installed a compost bin. “We put all the peels in there and use the compost that forms to fertilize the garden,” she says.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Twenty five years after the major wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union to Israel, large socioeconomic gaps remain between the olim and veteran Israelis, as shown by newly released data from the Central Bureau of Statistics. The average gross monthly income for a veteran Israeli household is NIS 20,945, compared to NIS 14,074 for a Soviet immigrant household. About 80 percent of the income for olim households comes from work, and 15 percent from stipends and other support.</p> \n<p>The figures were presented on Wednesday at a conference held by the CBS to mark the 25th anniversary of the aliyah from the former Soviet Union. Two days ago, in the Knesset, there was a conference of the lobby for “empowering the 1.5 generation of Russian-speaking Israelis,” led by MK Yoel Razvozov of Yesh Atid.</p> \n<p>The conference focused on the problems facing members of the “1.5 generation,” those who made aliyah as children and are now emigrating from the country at a higher rate than native Israelis; on pensions for olim who immigrated at an older age; access to higher education; cultural belonging; conversion; civil marriage and burial in Israel. There are over 754,000 olim from the former Soviet Union living in Israel and they accounted for 77 percent of all immigrants between 1990 and 2015.</p> \n<p>CBS figures show that only 51.7 percent of olim own the homes they live in, compared to 73 percent of veteran Israelis. Among immigrants, there is also a higher rate of three generations living together. They rely on old-age stipends over twice as much as veteran Israeli households (7.2 percent, compared to 3.2 percent, respectively).</p> \n<p>“We came here as children and we’re going through the same thing that our mothers and grandmothers continue to go through,” says social activist Lena Rozovsky. “In Israeli society, if you’re a ‘Russian,’ no matter how old you are or how long you’ve been here, you’re always a ‘Russian.’ We are labeled with stereotypes that have a direct effect on our lives. It’s not just somebody hurling an insulting word at you on the street. It’s the stigma that’s prevalent in society, and continues to be part of the way television characters are created and how we are represented in the press. It all affects the attitude toward us.”</p> \n<p>The rate of sexual assault on girls and women of Russian extraction is 2.5 times higher than among native-Israeli Jewish girls and women (38 percent versus 16 percent), according to the latest figures from the annual Women’s Security Index study conducted by a coalition of six women’s organizations, which was presented at the conference.</p> \n<p>“Due to the unique problems for the 1.5 generation, who made aliya at a young age – in the fields of economics, religion and state, and education – many olim are leaving Israel,” Razovzov said at the event. “In order to make it here, they have to fight harder than native-born Israelis their age. The world opened its doors to them, but they wanted to live in Israel. They served in the army, worked hard and got an education here. The 1.5 generation isn’t the problem. The problem is the way Israel is pushing them out.”</p> \n<p>CBS figures show that many olim from the former Soviet Union have remained in their own sociocultural circle. Some 60 percent marry olim from the same countries. Half say their friends are from a similar background, while this is true for just 16 percent of the general Jewish population. About 45 percent of the olim say their command of Hebrew is only average at best.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Giora Zarechansky has never had an easy time with his surname, which in Hebrew begins with an “S” sound. “Zarechansky is a tough name to pronounce, and there’s hardly any place that I go where people don’t get it wrong. If you are sensitive about such things, you have to constantly correct people. When I have to write the name in English – Zarechansky – it is even more complex. I always have to be sure I’ve written 11 letters,” he says.</p> \n<p>But Zarechansky, the CIO at Amitim Senior Pension Funds, has no regrets about deciding not to change his last name, as did his elder brother, Interior Minister Gideon Sa’ar. “We have only one sister, who is married [and changed her name], so as far as I know, today my parents and I are the only ones with this name,” the younger sibling explains. (Both of them were born in Israel.)</p> \n<p>His politician-brother’s choice of Hebrew surname, Sa’ar, was not random. The family name is of Russian origin, and was inspired by the Zarechansky railway station that belongs to the jurisdiction of the Berezivka regional council in the Odessa region of Ukraine. But the Israeli immigration clerk who dealt with the Ukraine-born father, Shmuel, when he immigrated here by way of Argentina, wrote “Sarachensky,” with a samekh. In the vicinity of Berezivka flows the Tiligul River, and the train station was probably named for the river, since “Zarechansky” means “beyond the river.” So it was that Giora’s brother Gideon decided to change his surname to “Sa’ar,” the name of a stream in the Golan Heights.</p> \n<p>Two years after he moved to Israel, in the mid-1960s, Shmuel Zarechansky settled with his family in Sde Boker and became the personal physician of then-retired Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, the same Ben-Gurion who had passionately importuned new immigrants to Hebraize their last names. Already in the 1950s, there had been a rise in the name-changing phenomenon, which had its origins during the First Aliyah (wave of immigration to Palestine between 1882-1903). Zarechansky says Ben-Gurion pestered his father to Hebraize his name as well, and even chose a surname for him: “Snir,” also the name of a stream in the north. The father declined.</p> \n<p>Prof. Aaron Demsky, founder and director of the Project for the Study of Jewish Names at Bar-Ilan University, and academic adviser for those who created the database of surnames at Beit Hatfutsot - The Museum of the Jewish People, explains that Hebraizing surnames was a way for the Jews who came to Palestine to express ideological identification.</p> \n<p>“The fathers of modern Zionism – David Ben-Gurion, Levi Eshkol, Eliezer Ben Yehuda, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi - took it upon themselves to change their names, and so did a good share of those who arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, for the purpose of realizing the new national home,” Demsky says.</p> \n<p>“Thus, ‘Gruen’ became ‘Ben-Gurion,’ ‘Shkolnik’ became ‘Eshkol,’ ‘Perlman’ became ‘Ben Yehuda,’ and ‘Shimshelevich’ became ‘Ben-Zvi.’ These people set an example, in the hope that others who arrived later would likewise change their surnames. Such an act was a declaration, a hoisting of the flag, showing that they were rejecting the Diaspora and the names they had been forcibly given there. They chose new names for themselves and they put a great deal of thought into it.”</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, many families who arrived tried to retain some connection to their old names. For example, the Ashkenazi name ‘Eisenstadt’ (meaning, iron city) became ‘Barzilai’ (from the Hebrew word for iron, barzel). In many cases names were Hebraized by immigration officials into similar-sounding names. Thus, for example, Franz Kishunt was renamed “Ephraim Kishon” by a Jewish Agency clerk.</p> \n<p>During the War of Independence, the Israel Defense Forces set up a committee that issued a pamphlet titled “Choose a Hebrew Name for Yourself.” Then, in the 1950s, Ben-Gurion stipulated that anyone who represented the state in a formal capacity - be it as an athlete, a diplomat or in the military - must have a Hebrew surname. Some people Hebraized their last name, while their siblings and parents may have retained the original one. The former Israel Defense Forces chief of staff and prime minister Ehud Barak, for example, changed his surname, which was “Brog,” whereas his brother, Avinoam, did not.</p> \n<p>In 1955, Ben-Gurion, as defense minister, sent a directive to then-chief of staff Moshe Dayan, declaring that only military personnel with Hebrew surnames could henceforth represent the IDF abroad. That is, even if a soldier had what Ben-Gurion called “the dubious right” to retain his foreign name, he would not be able to go overseas on assignment for the state. But there were some military personnel and politicians who defied the new rule and kept a surname that held special significance for them: Ezer Weizman, nephew of Israel’s first president Chaim Weizmann, refused to change his name, and Haim Laskov, who was later chief of staff, was permitted to retain his original last name out of respect for his late father.</p> \n<p>There was no shortage of opinions on this matter, including among civilians who did not represent the state. Demsky describes the case of Rabbi Meir Bar-Ilan, who was among the leaders of religious Zionism who had Hebraized his original surname, “Berlin,” whereas his elder brother, Chaim Berlin – who immigrated to Israel only in old age – kept the name. According to Demsky, alongside the desire to be a new person in a new land, many immigrants also felt responsible for preserving the name of their family that perished in the Holocaust, and therefore elected not to Hebraize it.</p> \n<p>There are also those who eventually went back to their original name, or added it on later. The author Yitzhak Averbuch-Orpaz had to Hebraize his name for a reason that seems quite ludicrous today: To enable his debut story to be broadcast on Israel Radio. Israel Radio suggested he ask the Jewish National Fund to propose a new name, and the JNF suggested “Orpaz.” Several decades later, he added his original name, “Averbuch.” Likewise, the late Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a former IDF chief of staff who changed his original family name, “Lipkin,” to “Shahak” when he went abroad to study, subsequently went back to being called “Lipkin,” and later still combined the two names.</p> \n<p>“The beauty of names is that they reflect changes in history and fashion in a society,” Demsky notes. “Each person carries with him historical baggage that is reflected in names, but to a certain extent, a name is also a matter of fashion. There are people who in the throes of immigration and with the aspiration to build and fulfill [the Zionist dream] said, ‘Let’s change our name.’ What sounded nice in one generation, however, may not sound good a generation later, and in the next generation the children may want to switch back to the original name.</p> \n<p>“I knew a man who worked for the Foreign Ministry. He changed his name to ‘Shvat,’ but when he arrived overseas in a service capacity, he was called ‘Schwartz.’ Once he retired he went back to his Hebrew name, Shvat.</p> \n<p>Buzaglo becomes Ben</p> \n<p>In the case of Haim Bograshov, principal of the Herzliya Gymnasium high school, the reason for the change in appellation was modesty. Bograshov was one of the rare figures for whom a Tel Aviv street was named while he was still alive, but he did not like that decision so he took the rather radical step of changing his name to “Boger.”</p> \n<p>As in the case of Ashkenazim, surnames of many Mizrahim (Jews of Middle Eastern or North African origins) often took a Hebrew turn as well: “Havai” became “Shaham,” “Biton” was exchanged for “Golan” and “Buzaglo” was replaced by “Ben.” In such cases, the name change does not always stem solely from a wish to forge a new Zionist identity, but also from a desire to avoid ethnic discrimination. Just last August, the Tel Aviv District Labor Court ruled that Israel Aerospace Industries had discriminated against a job candidate because of his Mizrahi origin, and had to pay him compensation of 50,000 shekels ($14,300). The court decision came after the candidate in question, Michel Malka, failed to get a position when he submitted a resume with his actual name, but subsequently, when he resent it under the name “Meir Malkieli,” found himself invited in for an interview.</p> \n<p>Vardit Avidan, a lawyer with the Tmura Antidiscrimination Legal Center, who represented the plaintiff, says that even now she has students in her law classes at the College of Management who change their surnames before applying for internships. “I know female and male lawyers who changed their last name so they wouldn’t be categorized straight away as criminal lawyers – as generally happens when the surname is ‘too Mizrahi.’ Lawyers who work in a profession that demands attracting clients will change a Mizrahi surname if they want to open a firm.</p> \n<p>“We did an experiment at the College of Management: Students sent law firms the same CVs, but each time under a different name – with a woman’s name, or a Mizrahi, Russian, Ethiopian or Ashkenazi name – and requested an interview. Some places realized it was the same resume, but there were those that responded only to those with the Ashkenazi name.” A surname seems important and even essential today, so it is hard to imagine that a few centuries ago family names didn’t even exist – and the choice of such a name later on was often arbitrary.</p> \n<p>Demsky explains that most Sephardi families only took surnames after the expulsion from Spain in 1492, and that most Ashkenazim adopted last names between 1787 and 1830, when authorities in their respective countries instituted a policy to register the Jewish subjects - having until then referred to them by first name and father’s name. One reason for this move was an increase in the Jewish population: The fact that more and more people had the same first name led to a need for family names.</p> \n<p>Demsky: “The Jews viewed this as a positive move, because it showed that they were being acknowledged. On the other hand, they knew that when they had a surname it was easier to track them down for the purposes of taxation and military service.”</p> \n<p>Those “new” surnames can be classified in several major groups. There are names that were determined by the first name of the paterfamilias. Abraham, for example, took on a suffix and became Abramov or Abrahms; Yaakov became Yankelevich; and Arieh (Leib in Yiddish) became Leibovich. Sometimes the source of a surname was the first name of a mother or grandmother, which is how “Rivkin” or “Tzipkin” came into being (from Rivka or Tzipora). Families of kohanim (the priestly class) were given names like “Cohen” or “Kahana,” and Levites became “Levy” or “Levin.” Names of one’s country of birth or profession were also widely accepted when it came to coining family names. These include, respectively, “Deutsch,” “Portugali” and “Warshawsky”; or “Kravitz” (tailor), “Plotnik” (carpenter) and “Wexler” (money changer). The late Israeli journalist Dahn Ben-Amotz’s name was originally “Tehilimzeigger” (reciter of Psalms, in Yiddish). Other groups of surnames include those related to community roles or other traits, such as “Altman” (old man) or “Gutman” (good man).</p> \n<p>“Surnames were not sacred,” Demsky continues. “Jews who migrated from place to place changed their surname along the way, for all kinds of reasons. The surname is a mark of identification, but ultimately names were assigned under various circumstances and many Jews did not necessarily ascribe much importance to them.”</p> \n<p>What may have contributed to this attitude is the fact that in many places in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries, it was government or other officials who gave Jews their surnames. Sometimes the officials mocked Jews by deliberately giving them demeaning names such as “Dreyfus” (drei Fuss means “three feet” in German), which surprisingly has survived to this day. Demsky points out the prevalence among Hungarian Jews of the names “Weiss” (white), “Schwartz” (black), “Gross” (big) and “Klein” (small) – popular appellations assigned by local officials.</p> \n<p>“There is also an interesting phenomenon,” the professor adds, “of Jews contending with foreign names that were forced upon them: ‘Wallach,’ for example, or ‘Bloch,’ were inspired by a region in Romania called Wallachia. The reluctance some people [who immigrated to Israel] had about those surnames, if they wanted a Jewish identity, was solved by turning it into a Hebrew acronym for ‘Ve’ahavta Lere’ha Kamokha’ [Love thy neighbor as thyself]. The same goes for the Polish surname Byk: byk is an ox, but it was easier to treat it as an acronym for ‘Bnei Israel Kedoshim [Israelites are saintly],’” Demsky says.</p> \n<p>Spelling errors</p> \n<p>In contrast to the Jews of Eastern and Central Europe, who were compelled by the authorities to take on surnames, in Yemen, for example, Jews were not forced to assume a family name. However, Prof. Aharon Gaimani of the Jewish History department at Bar-Ilan University, who studies Yemenite names, says that during the past few centuries, in that country’s larger Jewish communities, such as Sana’a, Rada’a and Sada’a, popular surnames used were often inspired by locales (“Tza’anani,” “Radai”), professions (“Nagar,” meaning carpenter) and sometimes also by plants or personal traits.</p> \n<p>Thus, during Operation Magic Carpet (1948-1950), when some 44,000 Yemenite emigrants departed Aden for the nascent Jewish state, those who did not yet possess a surname were given one, according to criteria noted above. For example, Jews from the southern province of Sharab were named “Sharabi” – today perhaps the most common surname among Israelis of Yemenite origin.</p> \n<p>According to Gaimani, the names were often transcribed into Hebrew with spelling errors, which have remained to this day. In some cases, siblings were given different surnames, because each stated something different during the immigration process: One gave the father’s name, another his place of origin and the third a family name. Eventually, many newcomers from Yemen and other Arab countries opted for Hebrew names, with either a corresponding meaning or similar sound. The Sibahi family switched to “Zehavi,” “Hasar” became “Hasid,” “Maorhi” became “Maor” and “Yafai” - “Yafe.” The surname of Israel’s onetime transportation minister (and Histadrut head) Yisrael Kessar had previously been “Qasr,” and singer Yigal Bashan’s name was originally “Bashari.”</p> \n<p>Gaimani also gives the example of the surname “Zabib” (“raisin,” in Arabic), inspired by a generations-long, familial occupation involving raising, transporting and selling raisins. When some persons of this name arrived in Israel, they opted for a Hebrew version with a related connotation, such as “Gefen” (grapevine), “Sorek” (a biblical term for choice vine) or “Carmon” (from the word for vineyard, “kerem”). This phenomenon extended to first names as well: “Banat” became “Batya,” “Shama” became “Shoshana,” “Salama” was renamed “Shulamit,” “Musa” was “Moshe” and “Ya’ish” became “Yishaya.”</p> \n<p>Genetic innovation</p> \n<p>Today, Beit Hatfutsot has a database containing tens of thousands of surnames that were verified by members of its academic committee and classified in groups taking variant spellings and other factors into consideration.</p> \n<p>Before the founding of the state, it was customary to publish individual name changes in the Palestine Gazette. The Israel Genealogical Society (www.isragen.org.il/‎) has reviewed and posted a database of the over 28,000 names appearing in the Gazette that were changed between 1921 and 1948. From the time the state was established until 1979, name changes were publicized in an official publication called “Portfolio of Notification,” and this information is also available on the society’s website. Persons interested in tracing names of their forebears can also check genealogy sites that facilitate this process by means of building family trees and cross-referencing names, dates and relationships.</p> \n<p>Gilad Japhet, CEO of an Israeli site called MyHeritage, says tracking down relatives by name is not always simple. For example, he says, to avoid compulsory army service in czarist Russia, many Jews would “attach” their son to another Jewish family with no offspring, because an only child was exempt from the military; that young man then would receive the surname of the adoptive parents (even if there had been no official adoption), and once he arrived in Israel he continued to be called by that name.</p> \n<p>Science offers its own way of identifying relatives. Researchers here and abroad have jointly developed a computerized algorithm that can determine what a man’s surname is based solely on data relating to his Y chromosome. This innovation has been proposed by Israeli-born Yaniv Erlich, a fellow at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Boston, Prof. Eran Halperin of Tel Aviv University’s school of computer science and department of molecular microbiology and biotechnology and David Golan, a doctoral student in statistics at TAU. The idea is that just like a surname, in many cases the Y chromosome is passed down from father to son, with minor changes because of mutations. Therefore, it is shared by all the men in a given extended family.</p> \n<p>The algorithm the researchers developed was tested on a sample of 911 men in the United States. Their Y-chromosome data were entered into a database of sequenced genomes of 135,000 people, who represent the most common surnames in the U.S. The algorithm accurately identified the surname of one of every eight test subjects, and erred regarding only one in 20.</p> \n<p>This article originally appeared on January 2, 2014.</p>",

        "text":["<p>One day in the late 1990s, Safaa Dabour left her home in Nazareth and traveled to Tel Aviv. She had heard that one of the theaters was screening the film “Chronicle of a Disappearance,” by Nazareth-born Palestinian-Israeli director Elia Suleiman, and because she very much wanted to see it, she decided to head for the big city. To her surprise, she discovered that most of the spectators who had come to the showing were, like her, residents of Nazareth who had traveled to Tel Aviv in order to see the film.</p> \n<p>“When the screening ended we sat and talked, and we wondered why in the entire Arab community there isn’t a single movie theater where films are shown,” she says. “Some of the people said that someone had to get up and start such a theater, and then I got up and said that I would do it, but everyone laughed.”</p> \n<p>Dabour, who grew up in a well-to-do religious Muslim family in Nazareth, didn’t allow the laughter to suppress her enthusiasm. Since she had lost her husband a short time earlier, and her father had died too, she decided to approach her brother, who was the head of the family, and to share with him the new initiative that had excited her. But very soon she realized that she wouldn’t find a shoulder to lean on there either.</p> \n<p>“He looked at me and said ‘You have a fever, let’s check that you don’t get drunk in the evenings,’ and the entire family laughed at me,” says Dabour. But the laughter didn’t stop her either. A week later she started looking for a hall in Nazareth where she could start her movie theater.</p> \n<p>Eventually, Dabour succeeded in fulfilling her dream in 2003, when she started the first (and only) cinematheque in Israel’s Arab sector. Her quest is brought to life in the documentary film “Safaa: A Cinematic Portrait,” directed by Nurit Jacobs Yinon.</p> \n<p>The film will be screened next Wednesday at the Haifa International Film Festival. It shows Dabour to be an amazingly courageous woman, unafraid to defy social norms and not hesitating to smash the glass ceiling that prevents so many women from daring, dreaming and lifting their heads in a conservative society that prefers to see them in their traditional roles in the family home.</p> \n<p>At first, Dabour operated a “traveling movie theater.” She purchased films and screened them in community centers, at weddings and in back yards. The fact that she comes from a well-to-do family enabled her in the end to invest money in a hall she had found and to turn it into a movie theater — it was the hall in the Histadrut labor federation building in Nazareth, which singer Frank Sinatra donated to the city in 1970 as a sign of friendship and peace to the Arab and Jewish children of Nazareth. She rented the hall, installed rows of movie theater seats, built a screening room and purchased the necessary equipment for the high-quality screening of films.</p> \n<p>The Egyptians refused</p> \n<p>The beginning was not easy. Dabour was unable to find investors for her initiative, because businessmen in the Arab sector were not enthusiastic about the idea of a woman starting a movie theater. In addition, she had to deal with the negative feelings of city residents, who recalled the previous movie theater that operated there. “In those days there wasn’t a single movie theater in the entire Arab sector, because the theater that had operated in Nazareth for 30 years closed down.</p> \n<p>“In its final days it deteriorated badly, showed mainly porno films, and was considered an unrespectable place,” she says. “That’s why everyone was surprised; they didn’t understand why a religious woman from a Muslim family would be involved in such a business. And then they started telling all kinds of stories about me, and it took time until I proved to everyone that the movie theater I had started was a respectable and proper place.”</p> \n<p>Jacobs Yinon accompanied Dabour for 10 years in order to create the film, recording the innumerable battles she had to wage in order to operate the place.</p> \n<p>“She’s a person in a very complex situation — a Muslim woman in Nazareth, an Arab woman in Israel and an Israeli woman in the eyes of Arab countries. And that has many implications,” says Jacobs Yinon. “For example, for bringing Arab films from Egypt to her cinematheque. As opposed to normal cinematheques the world over, where they send reels of 35 mm. film via a messenger service, and the money via a bank transfer, in this case the film distributors in Egypt refused to follow this procedure, due to the cultural boycott against Israel.”</p> \n<p>So, while Dabour was able to show films from Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Gulf states, she was forced to improvise a bypass route for films from Egypt. Jacobs Yinon accompanied her on some of her trips to Jordan, where the film distributor from whom she bought the Egyptian films was based.</p> \n<p>The first time she arrives there, after a long and exhausting trip, Dabour discovers the distributor’s offices empty and deserted, and is forced to return empty handed. The second time she arrives in Jordan she encounters evasive answers and people who play for time and delay giving her the films. She is forced to rent a hotel room and to spend the night there, and only after a nerve-racking wait does she get the films the next morning, and has to carry them by herself — a suitcase full of very heavy reels of 35 mm. film.</p> \n<p>Dabour’s problems stemmed not only from her being an Israeli, but also because she’s a woman. Her family wasn’t happy about the challenge she took upon herself, and the residents of Nazareth were suspicious of the woman who insisted on displaying independence and creativity. Some of them stayed away from her cinematheque for that reason.</p> \n<p>“At first, after I financed and did everything by myself, and invested a lot of emotional baggage and a great deal of money, and encountered scorn and opposition on the part of my family and the society in which I live, I thought to myself: what do I need this for?” admits Dabour, when asked if there were moments when she broke down. “But I’m a stubborn woman. So even when I was afraid of failing, I still carried on.”</p> \n<p>Jacobs Yinon tells about her part in the story: “I was very interested in observing Safaa as a woman in a man’s world, a woman who wants to do something that women don’t usually do. In her case, no man had done it before her either. In this film, I tell a very specific story about a specific woman who lives in a specific culture and a specific place, but of course there are women everywhere who want to make a breakthrough deal with similar conflicts. The same is true of the combination of a career and a family and the expectation of a woman not to be a trailblazer, unless men have been there first.”</p> \n<p>20 percent Israeli films</p> \n<p>Only after six years of activity did the Culture Ministry agree to support the Nazareth Cinematheque. Dabour made a great effort to meet all the criteria, as required, but this time the problem was the fact that she is an Arab. “The criterion [of the Culture Ministry] that requires the Cinematheque to screen at least 20 percent Israeli films was problematic for me, because in our Arab society I couldn’t show so many Israeli films. But because that was a minimum condition, I tried to comply with it anyway. But even then, when we already began to receive support from the Culture Ministry, it was a sum that wasn’t even enough to pay for leasing the hall.”</p> \n<p>In the end did the place manage to pay for itself?</p> \n<p>“Not really. We tried to raise donations here and there, to find advertisers, but that wasn’t enough. The price of a ticket was also low, not like in other movie theaters. A ticket cost between 10 and 20 shekels ($2.5-$5).</p> \n<p>Did the attitude of Nazareth residents toward you change at some point?</p> \n<p>“At first, during the first year, if 20-50 people came to a screening, I would tell myself that I had succeeded, because people didn’t want to come and many attacked me, some wanted to cause me to fail. But after two to three years the situation changed, and if fewer than 100-120 people came to a film I was depressed, I would feel I had failed, do some soul searching or get angry at my staff. I also made a plan to market the place, I brought schoolchildren, and in the end even the Islamic Movement cooperated with me on all kinds of screenings.”</p> \n<p>What was the frequency of the screenings, and what films did you show?</p> \n<p>“There were screenings every day — in the mornings for schoolchildren, non-profit organizations and organized groups, and in the afternoons and evenings for the general public. On Sundays the theater was closed, unless there was a festival. We showed high-quality films, documentaries and commercial Arab films, because we wanted the place to keep going financially.”</p> \n<p>And did your family continue to oppose this initiative all the time?</p> \n<p>“In the beginning they were angry, didn’t support me, but in the end, after the place began to succeed and after people started talking about it as a respectable place, then they got up and said, ‘Look, this is our daughter.’ My late brother Qassem, who was the head of the family, was the manager of the Ahi Nazareth soccer team, and that’s also a type of culture, like cinema, so there was a certain similarity between the things.”</p> \n<p>In the film “Safaa: A Cinematic Portrait,” Dabour is seen as a courageous woman who is not willing to give up her dream or to surrender to the expectations of others. But the harsh Israeli reality refused to be impressed (here comes the spoiler, and anyone planning to see the film who hates spoilers, is invited to stop reading), and the endless chain of obstacles that it placed before the Nazareth Cinematheque reached a particularly cruel finale about two years ago.</p> \n<p>Dabour’s debts kept piling up. An evacuation order forced her to evacuate the hall in the Histadrut building and her lifetime project was forced to close its doors. “It was as though they had killed my son before my eyes,” she says in a choked voice. “Exactly like that. A feeling as though someone has grabbed my son before my eyes and I can’t protect him. A feeling that they took my soul.”</p> \n<p>When asked whether she sees a chance that she will revive her Cinematheque at some point she sighs. “Financially I lost everything I had, so I don’t know whether it’s possible, but the dream still exists. Because our society is entitled to something good. Despite everything that happened, I still have a little hope.”</p>",

        "text":["<p> A disproportionate share of Israelis leaving the country in recent years are immigrants from the former Soviet Union whose Jewish credentials had been called into question, according to an expert on emigration trends.</p> \n<p> Speaking at a Jerusalem conference on Israeli expat communities, Yogev Karasenty, a policy adviser to the Jewish Agency, noted that more than one-third of the 15,900 Israelis who left in the country in 2012 were defined by the Central Bureau of Statistics as “other.” This is the term generally used to describe immigrants from the former Soviet Union who were eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return but are not considered Jewish according to Halakcha (Jewish law).</p> \n<p> Difficulties confronted by this population in converting to Judaism in Israel, he posited, was motivating them to leave the country.</p> \n<p> “If this particular group had access to a friendlier conversion process, it would be very reasonable to assume that their drop-out rates would not be as high,” he said. “Because they are not considered Jewish here, it is much more difficult for them to feel a part of the country.”</p> \n<p> Karasenty a former fellow at the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute, said the 2012 figures were representative of trends in recent years. He estimated that the number of immigrants from the former Soviet Union who fit the definition of “other” is somewhere between 200,000 and 250,000.</p> \n<p> “I had expected that their share among those leaving the country would be higher than that of native-born Israelis, but I was surprised to discover that it was that high,” he said.</p> \n<p> The definition of a Jew under the Law of Return is anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent or a Jewish spouse. But to be considered Jewish for the purpose of marriage in Israel, a person must have been born to a Jewish mother or have undergone an Orthodox conversion. Many of the immigrants from the former Soviet Union have resisted these conversions because the process is lengthy and requires them to adopt an Orthodox lifestyle.</p> \n<p> Karasenty presented the figures at a conference in the Knesset organized by Israeli Global Leadership, a group that seeks to strengthen and cultivate lay leadership in Israeli expat communities around the world. It was the first conference of its kind to be held in Israel.</p> \n<p> Recent reports of young Israelis leaving the country, especially to destinations like Berlin, have sparked concerns.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> Infographic by Haaretz</p> \n<p> According to World Bank figures, some 350,000 Israelis currently live overseas, the overwhelming majority in North America. Karasenty said this figure only takes into account individuals born in Israel and, therefore, tends to underestimate the phenomenon.</p> \n<p> According to his calculations, the number of Israelis living abroad today is somewhere between 550,000 and 580,000 – in line with figures published by the Central Bureau of Statistics. This figure does not include children born abroad to Israeli citizens, but it does include about 100,000 Arab citizens of the country.</p> \n<p> More than half the Israelis who left the country in recent years were not native born but had immigrated from elsewhere, said Karasenty. That includes many immigrants recognized as Jews, he said, who are part of a growing global community of what he termed “multi-locals” – young adults who move from country to country.</p> \n<p> Despite recent reports that “tens of thousands” of Israelis were relocating to Berlin, Karasenty estimated that the actual number was somewhere between 6,000 and 12,000.</p> \n<p> Today’s event was organized by leaders of the Israeli communities in New York, Toronto, Australia and London. Many of the speakers, including the organizers, stressed the important role Israeli ex-pats could serve as bridges between Israel and the local Jewish communities where they reside.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Let’s say your parents aren’t Jewish, but you feel Jewish and want to be a Jew. Who could stop you? The rabbis, the bureaucrats? How could they deny something that you know to be true, with every fiber of your being? They tell you that if you want to be Jewish, you must convert, but that makes no sense to you, because you are sure that you’re already Jewish.</p> \n<p>To many Jews, whatever their level of belief or observance, the argument may sound absurd: You can’t just be Jewish. Either you are born Jewish, or you have to go through some official process to be recognized as Jewish.</p> \n<p>But in an age where society is gradually coming to accept that a person’s gender is not necessarily defined by the circumstances of his or her physiology at birth, and that steps can be taken to increase physical congruence if desired, the idea that external validation is needed for one’s choice of religion seems increasingly anachronistic.</p> \n<p>I’m not aware of any research or surveys on the subject, but I have no doubt that a growing number of people consider themselves Jews without having undergone any kind of conversion. What’s more, most of their friends, relatives and neighbors regard them as Jews as well.</p> \n<p>Over the years I’ve met many such Jews: immigrants to Israel and their children, who are not recognized by any rabbinate but are convinced that by living in the Jewish state, paying taxes and above all by putting their lives in danger serving in its army, they have earned the right not to have their Judaism questioned.</p> \n<p>There are people, mainly outside of Israel, who chose to identify as Jews after they researched their genealogy and discovered a Jewish ancestor. Others married a Jew and accepted their spouse’s faith. Still others became captivated by the beauty of the Torah, the Talmud, the Hebrew language (or Yiddish or Ladino) — by chance, or destiny — and adopted this knowledge and culture. As one such student told me, in perfect Hebrew, “Torah is my life, I don’t need a rabbi to tell me I’m Jewish. I just know I am.”</p> \n<p>The civil war that broke out this week within Jewish orthodoxy after a group of Israeli rabbis broke with the Chief Rabbinate and established an alternative, “friendlier” conversion court, could catalyze forces that are already pulling the oldest stream of Judaism — the most dominant one in Israel — in opposite directions.</p> \n<p>Either side in this religious, but also very much political, conflict could still back down so as to reestablish an uneasy status quo. In any event, the conversion issue is only one of the ticking time bombs under the fissure that will ultimately tear apart Orthodox Jewry, if the movement is not irrevocably split already.</p> \n<p>It is not only this current round of bickering and power plays among the rabbis. The six decades-plus of theological, political and legal arguments fought between the Orthodox movement on one hand and the Reform and Conservative movements on the other, in the Knesset, the Supreme Court and the Israeli and Jewish Diaspora media over “who is a Jew” are growing increasingly irrelevant. As long as the religious parties have the power to dictate the state’s recognition of Jewish identity, its subsidization of religious education and its control of marriage, divorce, burial, much of the food industry through kashrut restrictions and so many other parts of civic life, this debate will matter. But as more and more alternatives become available and individuals become more self-aware and confident in making their own cultural and religious decisions, the rabbis will be scrabbling for a rapidly devaluating currency.</p> \n<p>The rebel Orthodox rabbis realize this. Connected as they are to a much wider cross-section of Israeli society than their ultra-Orthodox rivals, they are fully aware that the great majority of the approximately 350,000 Israelis and their children who emigrated from the former Soviet Union under the Law of Return, only to be told on arrival that they weren’t considered Jewish enough to get married in Israel, are not particularly motivated to go through a long and arduous conversion process.</p> \n<p>For years these rabbis hoped that a clamor from this “Russian” community would force the rabbinate to liberalize its hidebound religious courts, and now they’re trying to do it themselves.</p> \n<p>They may be fighting a battle which for all purposes is over. Most of those “Russians” simply don’t care anymore. Many of them have lived in Israel now for nearly a quarter of a century, or were born here. As far as they are concerned, they are Israeli and Jewish and no rabbi can tell them otherwise. Nor have more than a few opted for the more user-friendly Reform and Conservative conversion programs.</p> \n<p>The Jewish Agency has come out in support of the rebel rabbis. Naturally the organization is anxious that prospective Jews and Israelis will not be deterred because of the obstinate Chief Rabbinate. But their endorsement played only a tiny role, if any, in this saga. The rabbis didn’t need the blessing of the Jewish Agency, and would have gone ahead even if it had expressed its disapproval.</p> \n<p>Writing in Haaretz this week, Or Kashti revealed how the organization was totally sidelined by the grandiose Initiative for the Future of the Jewish People of Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett, which will receive 190 million shekels ($50 million) in state funding. The Jewish Agency, once Israel’s government-in-waiting, is now increasingly marginalized in every field of operations, pushed out by more dynamic, efficient, well-funded and often ruthless outfits such as Chabad, Nefesh b’Nefesh, Birthright Israel and Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein’s International Fellowship of Christians and Jews.</p> \n<p>Never before in Jewish history has there been so much competition, and so much money spent, on trying to connect Jews to each other. Ironically, this hyperactivity is becoming increasingly obsolete, as just about every Jew in the world today is free to emigrate, to practice whatever faith they choose and to learn and communicate about any form of Judaism they like, using the Internet.</p> \n<p>Judaism began as an aggressively proselytizing religion, and remained so until Christian and Muslim persecution forced the rabbis to change tack and to set up barriers. As it was, few wanted to join the ranks of a persecuted minority. Now, after a millennium and a half as the gatekeepers to being Jewish, the rabbis and their conversion courts are in danger of becoming quaint throwbacks. For better or worse, we are entering an era where being Jewish is matter of individual choice.</p>",

However, the appointment has still not been approved by the cabinet and therefore senior member of the Jewish community still believe that it is not too late to reconsider.</p> \n<p>Sources in the Jewish community in Italy told Haaretz that last Thursday during Rivlin’s visit, the president of Rome’s Jewish community, Ruth Dureghello and Rome’s chief rabbi, Ricardo Di Segni, asked to meet privately with Rivlin.</p> \n<p>According to the sources, who are familiar with the details of the meeting but asked to remain unnamed because of the sensitivity of the matter, Dureghello and Di Segni expressed great concern over the appointment and its negative implications for the Jewish community and relations between Israel and Italy.</p> \n<p>The sources said that the two Italian Jewish leaders explained to Rivlin that the appointment of someone who had so recently been a senior member of the Italian parliament and had also run unsuccessfully for president of Rome’s Jewish community three months ago could raise claims of dual loyalty.</p> \n<p>The two also told Rivlin that Nirenstein was almost fully identified with the right wing in Italy, which could have a negative impact on ties between Israel’s government and the Italian government, which is controlled by the left wing.</p> \n<p>Rivlin told Dureghello and Di Segni that he understood their concerns but that he had to decline their request because he had neither authority nor responsibility for the appointment of ambassadors. Rivlin proposed that the two leaders present their arguments to Netanyahu, who is also the foreign minister.</p> \n<p>Nirenstein, who holds dual Italian-Israeli citizenship, served from 2008 until 2013 as a member of the Italian parliament representing the right-wing party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, to whom she is very close. She also served as chairwoman of the parliament’s foreign affairs committee.</p> \n<p>An Israeli official who knows her described her as identified with the right wing of Likud. Nirenstein would frequently defend Israel on television programs in Italy and elsewhere in Europe, confronting politicians or other public figures who criticized Israel.</p> \n<p>In 2011, she told Israel Hayom in an interview that she had once been a leftist, but after her first visit to Israel in 1967, even before the Six-Day War, she began to abandon her left-wing views.</p> \n<p>Before going into politics Nirenstein was a journalist. In the 1990s she served as cultural attach&eacute; in the Italian Embassy in Israel and thereafter represented a number of Italian newspapers in Israel. After leaving politics in 2013, she went back to working for the right-wing newspaper Il Giornale, owned by Berlusconi.</p> \n<p>In 2013, Nirenstein moved to Israel; she now lives in Jerusalem’s Gilo neighborhood. Still, only a month ago she made her unsuccessful bid for the presidency of Rome’s Jewish community.</p> \n<p>If Nirenstein is made ambassador to Italy, she will have to give up her Italian citizenship.</p> \n<p>The president’s spokesman declined to comment for this report.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It is easy to forget that, for much of its history, the British Labour Party provided a welcoming political home for left-wing Zionists. Either side of the World War II influential Labour figures including Arthur Henderson, Josiah Wedgwood, Stafford Cripps, Ian Mikardo, Nye Bevan, Hugh Dalton, Richard Crossman, Manny Shinwell and Harold Wilson, brought a discernibly pro-Zionist influence to bear upon party policy. &quot;The Party’s Palestinian policy,&quot; Crossman wrote in 1946, &quot;was the result of a profound conviction that the establishment of the national home is an important part of the Socialist creed.&quot;</p> \n<p>Before 1967, the Palestinian Arab cause was not one which generated great enthusiasm within mainstream Labour circles and it was only with the creation of the Labour Middle East Council (LMEC) in 1969 that Christopher Mayhew, former Minister for the Navy and MP for Woolwich, established the first of what would become a network of pro-Palestinian groups within the Labour movement. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>By the early 1980s, that network included the &quot;Trade Union Friends of Palestine&quot; (an organization noted for the flamboyant rhetoric of its ambitious General Secretary, George Galloway),&nbsp;a &quot;Labour Committee on Palestine&quot; backed by Ken Livingstone’s Greater London Council and a &quot;Labour Friends of Palestine&quot; group that was formally established within the Party in 1986.</p> \n<p>Mayhew and his allies developed a campaigning language of anti-Zionism which proved to be both hugely influential and, as the current Labour leadership is now discovering, deeply controversial. Mayhew himself did much to develop comparisons between Israel and South Africa. In a June 1971 article for the Fabian journal, Venture, he argued that, &quot;support for Israel and Zionism is as difficult as support for South Africa and apartheid and for very similar reasons.&quot; The cry of &quot;Israeli apartheid&quot; would quickly become a staple feature of British anti-Zionism. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Likening Zionists to Nazis also emerged as a deliberate rhetorical strategy. &quot;Germans who massacre Jews are tried and executed,&quot; Mayhew liked to observe, &quot;Jews who massacre Arabs are elected to political leadership.&quot; &nbsp;Ken Livingstone’s Labour Herald newspaper adopted the &quot;Zionism equals Nazism&quot; trope with enthusiasm in the 1980s; perhaps the most notorious example being a cartoon which, under the caption &quot;The Final Solution,&quot; depicted Menachem Begin in SS uniform, standing atop a mound of bloodied corpses, making a Nazi salute.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The notion that British Jews possessed &quot;dual&quot; or &quot;divided&quot; loyalties, a theme with a long and problematic history, was also revived by Mayhew and his LMEC comrade, Andrew Faulds in this period. &nbsp;After the Six Day War, Mayhew published an article attacking the Chief Rabbi, Immanuel Jakobovits, for addressing British Jews &quot;almost as if he and they were Israeli nationals.&quot; &nbsp;Faulds’ pronouncements on this theme were even more forthright and, during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, he stated that the &quot;Zionist propaganda machine&quot; was &quot;a fifth column in every country of the world with a Jewish community,&quot; a claim for which he was promptly sacked from the Shadow Cabinet by Harold Wilson.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Accusations against British Jews on the grounds of &quot;divided loyalties&quot; recurred at regular intervals thereafter, more recently in comments made by the Labour MP for Newport West, Paul Flynn, who in 2011 questioned&nbsp;whether a &quot;Zionist&quot; could serve as British Ambassador to Israel with the same effectiveness as &quot;someone with roots in the U.K. [who] can't be accused of having Jewish loyalty.&quot;</p> \n<p>Another disturbing characteristic of this emerging rhetoric was an emphasis on the conspiratorial nature of Zionism and its supporters. &quot;The Jews,&quot; Mayhew observed in an ill-judged moment in 1967, &quot;are about the world’s best propagandists and pushers&quot; and he even appears to have believed that sales of his 1987 autobiography suffered because of &quot;Jewish pressure&quot; as &quot;so many Jewish supporters of Israel are literary editors, reviewers, members of library committees and so on.&quot; Faulds also reportedly complained to Tam Dalyell that the &quot;Jewish Labour establishment&quot; had &quot;cost him a peerage.&quot; The conclusion that this kind of rhetoric blurred the boundaries between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism seems inescapable. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Mayhew (who earlier in his career had helped set up Britain’s Cold War anti-Communist propaganda organization, the Information Research Department) liked to present himself as someone who could &quot;speak about the problem of left-wing take-overs of democratic organizations with longer practical experience than anyone else in the United Kingdom.&quot; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Disconcerted by the rising influence of the Labour left, he left to join the Liberal Party in 1974 and watched on as a new generation of activists flocked to his anti-Zionist networks in the name of a left-wing radicalism that he had rejected. He warned in 1981 that the pro-Palestinian movement in Britain faced a &quot;Bennite militantly left threat&quot; and, the following year, refused to address a rally protesting against the Lebanon war on the grounds that he was not prepared to share a platform with the General Secretary of the Communist Party.</p> \n<p>Christopher Mayhew succeeded in his aim of transforming Labour Party attitudes towards Israel. In so doing, however, he unwittingly paved the way for an alliance between radical anti-Zionism and the far-left within mainstream Labour circles. Ironically for a politician derided by the Labour Left as a closet “Tory,&quot; Mayhew’s legacy to the party he abandoned might now be said to be the deeply discomfiting views about Zionists and Jews which certain members of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party have recently been shown to hold.</p> \n<p>Dr. James R Vaughan is a lecturer in International History in the Department of International Politics at Aberystwyth University.

        "text":["<p>A sign displayed prominently above the entrance to Beit Daniel, Tel Aviv’s only Reform synagogue, advertises its conversion program, beckoning potential candidates with the statement “Certified by the Ministry of Interior.”</p> \n<p>The program may indeed bear the official seal of the government office that decides who is a Jew in Israel. But it is definitely not considered kosher by the Chief Rabbinate, which is the body that ultimately decides who is allowed to marry here under Jewish law.</p> \n<p>Yet that doesn’t seem to bother any of the 20 or so men and women entering the building on this unusually warm Hanukkah morning and climbing up to the second floor where their weekly conversion classes are held.</p> \n<p>Most of them have been living in Israel for at least 10 years by now, they’ve served in the army and hold full-time jobs. Among them are a professional opera singer, a trained economist and a kibbutz factory executive. The overwhelming majority come from the former Soviet Union, have Jewish fathers and were raised as Jews. But because the Reform movement in Israel, unlike its sister organization in the United States, does not recognize patrilineal descent, they are required to undergo conversion here.</p> \n<p>This group takes a special expedited course – not the usual one year of study mandated for converts with no Jewish background whatsoever, but rather two to three months of what its administrators describe more as a “confirmation” process.</p> \n<p>And what benefits are conferred upon them by the certificate they receive upon completing this process? “Absolutely none,” acknowledges Rabbi Gregory Kotler, the Russian-born director of the Reform movement’s conversion programs in Israel. “These are people who are going through the conversion process out of completely pure motives. They’ve always felt Jewish, and being recognized as Jews by the Reform movement provides them with a sense of validation.”</p> \n<p>Both the Conservative and Reform movements in Israel launched their first conversion programs in the country about 10 years ago, in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that individuals converted by the non-Orthodox movements in Israel were entitled to be registered as Jews in the Interior Ministry’s population registry. For practical purposes, though, this registration is meaningless, since the Rabbinate does not recognize those who undergo non-Orthodox conversions in Israel as Jewish, and therefore prohibits them from marrying in the country under its auspices.</p> \n<p>Unlike Jews who undergo non-Orthodox conversions abroad and then move to Israel, those who go through the process in Israel are not eligible for the significant benefits provided to new immigrants, putting them at an even further disadvantage.</p> \n<p>Yet despite all this, their numbers are growing. This past year, the Reform movement oversaw 200 conversions, and the Conservative movement about 130. “Every year, there are about 10 percent more,” says Kotler, noting that the non-Orthodox movements in Israel will agree to convert only individuals who already have Israeli identity cards or permanent status in the country, so as to prevent those not legally in the country from exploiting the conversion option to legalize their status.</p> \n<p>One-third are children</p> \n<p>About one-third of the converts are individuals with Jewish fathers or grandparents, many of them from the former Soviet Union, who are already recognized as Jews by the Law of Return, which grants them the automatic right to immigrate to Israel. Another third are non-Jews seeking to marry Jewish Israelis. The remaining third comprises children who were either adopted abroad or born to surrogate mothers abroad; according to Israeli law, these children must be converted – although not necessarily by Orthodox rabbis – in order for their Jewish parents to obtain custody of them.</p> \n<p>This latter category, says Rabbi Andrew Sacks, the director of the Conservative movement’s Rabbinical Assembly in Israel, is the fastest-growing one. “We’re now doing about 25 of these conversions a year, many of them children born to surrogate mothers and adopted by same-sex couples.”</p> \n<p>The Rabbinate prohibits Orthodox rabbis from officiating at the marriages of these converts. But a growing number are choosing to have their wedding ceremonies performed by Conservative or Reform rabbis, after which they go abroad and have a civil ceremony so that their marital status is recognized in Israel. Circumventing the system in this way, insists Sacks, “is not a big deal, and many of us in the Conservative and Reform movements believe that the marriage laws will change in the next few years. In fact, there are many proposals on the table right now.”</p> \n<p>Galia Sadan, a former kibbutznik, is one of Israel’s most prominent Reform rabbis and director of the Beit Daniel conversion school, which she boasts is the biggest Reform conversion school in the world today – at least based on the size of its student body. It’s quite a claim to fame, she notes, considering that Tel Aviv is hardly the world center of Reform Judaism.</p> \n<p>Unusual circumstances</p> \n<p>Sadan opens this Friday morning session quizzing her students about the blessings made during the Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony.</p> \n<p>“Who can recite the second blessing for me?” she asks.</p> \n<p>“I can,” a student named Daniel and wearing a beret immediately accepts the challenge. “Blessed are you, O Lord Our God, who made miracles for our forefathers.”</p> \n<p>“And?” Sadan coaxes him.</p> \n<p>“And what?” Daniel looks at her quizzically.</p> \n<p>“And?” she says again.</p> \n<p>“Oh, right,” he catches his omission after a few seconds, “for our forefathers and for our foremothers.”</p> \n<p>“Good job,” Sadan congratulates him.</p> \n<p>Daniel, 40, who asked not to have his last name published, came to Israel under rather unusual circumstances, and unlike most of his classmates, has no Jewish blood running through his veins. “I was born into a Muslim family in Morocco,” he says. “I’m gay, and as a result, I was persecuted where I grew up, so when a bunch of Jewish friends came to Israel in 1999, I joined them. I’ve always felt very connected to the Jewish people and to Jewish history.”</p> \n<p>Today, he works in a hotel and lives with his Israeli partner in Herzliya. “For me, going through this conversion process is part of building my Jewish and Israeli identity,” he explains.</p> \n<p>Like Sadan, Alexandra Kedem, another student in the class, doesn’t care that she won’t be able to be married down the road by an Orthodox rabbi. “I’m a lesbian,” says the Chilean-born quality-control supervisor, who immigrated to Israel in 1999 and has a Jewish father. “But I was once married to a kibbutznik, and he told me before we got married that if I even thought of converting, he wouldn’t marry me. So we had a civil ceremony in Cyprus. I always wanted to go through a proper conversion, though, and was looking for the right push. It came when I met a religious woman who told me she couldn’t be with me if I wasn’t Jewish. I’d been to weddings of lesbian friends where there were Reform rabbis, and that’s one of the reasons I decided to seek a Reform conversion.”</p> \n<p>Yanina Tsirina, a 29-year-old Russian immigrant, says she decided to undergo a Reform conversion because she identifies much more with Progressive than with Orthodox Judaism. “The purpose for me is to have a better sense of my religion,” she says. “The stringency of Orthodoxy – it’s just not for me, and I have no intention of leading an Orthodox lifestyle.”&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>There is an unusual bustle of activity just off Molenbeek’s main square, where one after the other women in all sorts of different styled headscarves are filling into a brightly lit cultural center, followed by crowds of little children sniffling and clinging to pushchairs and their mothers’ handbags .</p> \n<p>This is the main event tonight in Brussels’ infamous inner city neighbourhood. The place that became the centre of a media frenzy when it was discovered that the area was home to the Paris attacker Salah Abdeslam and served as a hotbed of terrorist activities in the run up to November 2015.</p> \n<p>The streets are now void of any journalists and life has seemingly returned to normal. The only buzz of activity comes from the local cafes where their strictly male clientele can be observed sipping their Moroccan mint tea, as if nothing had ever happened in what is now known universally as Brussels’ most troubled area. </p> \n<p>While the men drink tea and chat between themselves, returning to business as usual is far from the agenda of Molenbeek’s Muslim mothers, who have come together precisely to talk about radical Islamic extremism and to take action into their own hands.</p> \n<p>Ben Ali Saliha, an active member of the support group ‘Les Parents Concern&eacute;s’ (The Affected Parents) leads the evening’s discussion, part of a series of events held to give advice to concerned local mothers, many of whom have been personally affected by the issue of radicalization. Her own son left for jihad in 2013, the 29th to leave for Syria from Vilvoorde (a suburb of Brussels similar to Molenbeek) in just one year .</p> \n<p>“Everyone knows someone who has gone, a son, a brother or a friend”, principally vulnerable young dropouts like her son, who are preyed on by recruiters such as ‘Sharia for Belgium’, lurking around schools and mosques, she explains. “If I was blond and blue-eyed, I would have been accepted into the military, or become a sales assistant or a fire-fighter, the older I get the more I realize that even though they tell us we are Belgian the more I realize we aren’t and never really will be”, is what Sabri Ali Saliha used to tell his mother Ben in the lead up to his departure to Syria.</p> \n<p>Radical movements are preying on young men “tapping into the structural racism that exists implicitly in Belgian society, and we mothers are unable to deal with the situation,” explains Asmaa, another ‘orphaned parent’, as the group of mothers of jihadists self-define themselves.</p> \n<p>Faced with a lack of any support, be it state, social services, or from their community these grieving and ostracised women from across class backgrounds, from gritty Molenbeek to more middle class Schaerbeek (where Abdelslam hid in the days after the Paris attack), have joined forces to deal with the issue.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The women meet regularly as a support group for grieving mothers but also to plan an action strategy. They have begun speaking in schools, and in May 2015 successfully campaigned for the Flemish Parliament to adopt a resolution intended to counter violent radical extremism which included a number of their suggestions. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is a small victory within a much larger crisis - what the mothers have experienced as a total failure by the state. They describe the local authorities in Molenbeek as bewildered, unable to understand even the issue’s point of departure: why Muslim youth would feel ostracized from society.</p> \n<p>In 2013 when her son Sabri left for Syria, Saliha Ben Ali explains, “The authorities let young men like him go voluntarily. &nbsp;It was a burden off their shoulders to see their problems jet off to Syria on a one way ticket via Turkey, the calculation was for them not to come back”. But all that changed in 2015, “when they started to return”.</p> \n<p>The mothers nod in agreement as Ben Saliha explains: “In 2013 there was a convenient lack of structures to help prevent departures” from Belgium, the country with the largest per capita supply of foreign fighters in Western Europe. “Now the authorities are starting to react, but only as the issue effects them directly.”</p> \n<p>The structural issue remains, explains Ben Saliha. “As the chief of police in Molenbeek told me more recently in the light of the recent attacks in Paris, “We just don’t know what to do, we just don’t understand’”. While the authorities let these young men leave at the beginning of the conflict in 2013 as part of a strategy to ‘export’ their problem abroad, now that strategy has collapsed and the authorities are at a loss of how to deal with those now battle-toughened Islamists returning to Europe today.</p> \n<p>Another mother (who wished to remain anonymous) explains: “There is a lack of trust, with many now not reporting their children’s departure to the police at all’. </p> \n<p>There is a sense of betrayal from the side of the families who feel that the institutions and judicial system in Belgium “have failed our sons: many of us warned them of their imminent departure before they left and they let them go.” </p> \n<p>She sighs, and continues, “We fear the acts of retribution from the movements they have joined if we publicly denounce them”.</p> \n<p>Ben Ali Salihi, by contrast, has nothing to lose by talking publicly about her experience: her son Sabri was killed with a bullet to the back of his head the first time he saw action. </p> \n<p>The woman with the pink veil who wants to keep her identity private still receives weekly phone calls from her son in Damascus, which she is too scared to report to the authorities.</p> \n<p>The mothers aren’t angry and frustrated only by the inaction of the Belgian state, but by that of their fellow Muslims as well. “The community was absent, some families have lost two or three children, but where is the reaction from the imams?” asks the Ben Ali Saliha. “I was listened to, but not supported” is how Belgian society reacted to Ben Ali Saliha.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The mothers have given up on the formal structures of power in the state and the community” which they feel have both equally failed them. Part of that feeling of disempowerment from the establishment power structures is also a gender issue.</p> \n<p>“Where are the fathers of Molenbeek?’ shrieks Ahmed El Khannous, deputy of mayor of Molenbeek and one of the only men in the room. His provocation has a purpose: to highlight the lack of support these mothers are getting from even within their family units. </p> \n<p>”This is why we are here, the authorities are at a loss and our husbands refuse to acknowledge the issue existsthe local authorities continue to hope our children are buying one way tickets to their graves and the men of our community refuse to acknowledge there is an issue,” Ben Ali Saliha sadly concludes.</p> \n<p>While Molenbeek has been bleeding young men to Islamist movements for years, last year’s Paris attacks illustrated to the general public that this is not just a local community or Muslim issue, but a larger issue affecting Europe as a whole. Ironically, the 2015 attacks finally gave these women, battling alone, a brief exposure to the mainstream, and for a short period gave a public voice to mothers like Ben Ali Saliha. </p> \n<p>This interest faded quickly- the mothers are still unaccompanied by fathers to the meetings, and the local authorities are still failing to acknowledge the structural weaknesses in Belgian society, such as racism or unemployment.</p> \n<p>Most worrying is that many of these mothers have given up on community or state institutions. This will have serious consequences: many mothers aren’t even reporting the departure of their sons to fight the Syrian jihad. </p> \n<p>Both the local community and society as a whole will, sooner or later, be forced to confront this issue, this time with the problem at a much more extreme stage. For the mothers of Molenbeek, still, no&nbsp;one’s listening.</p> \n<p>Esti Judah is a freelance journalist, researcher and translator.

        "text":["<p>The High Court of Justice on Wednesday narrowly upheld a law allowing small communities to screen potential new members via admissions committees.</p> \n<p>In a 5-4 decision, the justices said the petition filed against the law by several Fhuman rights organizations was premature, because “it isn’t yet clear how the law will be applied in practice.”</p> \n<p>“The High Court has approved one of the most racist laws of the past several years,” charged Adalah – the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, which was one of the petitioners. “It was legislated by a majority of the Knesset with the declared intent, primarily, of keeping Arab citizens out of these communities.”</p> \n<p>The law, which was passed in March 2011, allows small communities to set up admissions committees to screen potential new members based on criteria laid down in the community’s bylaws. Such committees have been standard practice in small communities for decades, but until this law was passed, they had no legal basis.</p> \n<p>Several human rights organizations, including Adalah and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, argued that the law would allow these communities to reject homosexuals, people with disabilities, Arabs or anyone else who differed from the community’s social norm. Since both Israeli and international law prohibit discriminating against someone just because he differs from the dominant social group, they said, that makes the law unconstitutional.</p> \n<p>Though the law explicitly prohibits discrimination against members of other social groups, it permits the admissions committees to reject candidates on such vague grounds as “unsuitability to the community’s social life” or its “social-cultural fabric” or to “unique characteristics of the community as defined in its bylaws.” The law also allows the committees to send applicants to evaluation centers or graphologists and to demand a great deal of personal information from them.</p> \n<p>Supreme Court President Asher Grunis, with Justices Miriam Naor, Elyakim Rubinstein, Esther Hayut and Hanan Melcer concurring, rejected the petition mainly because “it isn’t yet clear how the law will be applied in practice.”</p> \n<p>“The court, with its limited resources, will not engage in investigating hypothetical and theoretical claims,” Grunis wrote.</p> \n<p>Justices Edna Arbel, Salim Joubran and Yoram Danizger dissented, saying the court should rule two provisions of the law unconstitutional: the one allowing admissions committees to reject applicants who “aren’t suitable to the community’s social life,” and the one allowing it to reject candidates because of “unsuitability to the community’s social and cultural fabric.”</p> \n<p>This, Danziger wrote, is a “vague legislative formula that opens the door wide for the entry of ulterior motives and for discrimination in practice.”</p> \n<p>The last justice, Neal Hendel, objected to a different provision – the one giving members of a given community a majority of seats on that community’s admissions committee. Regarding the law’s other provisions, he agreed with the majority that the petition was premature. But this provision is liable to result in “unconscious discrimination” by the admissions committee, and should therefore be overturned, he wrote.</p> \n<p>Attorney Suhad Bishara of Adalah, who drafted the petition on the organization’s behalf, said the ruling constituted a significant retreat from the principle the court laid down in the Kaadan case in 2000, in which it overturned a decision not to sell land in the Jewish community of Katzir to Iman and Adel Kaadan, an Arab couple from Baka al-Garbiyeh. The court reaffirmed this principle in 2011, when it accepted a petition by another Arab couple, Fatna and Ahmed Zabidat, against their rejection by the admissions committee in the Jewish community of Rakefet.</p> \n<p>“This [ruling] reflects the continued deterioration in constitutional protections of the legal status of Israel’s Arab citizens,” Bishara said. “In the wake of this decision, hundreds of Israeli communities – 434 communities – will be legally run, with the approval of the High Court, on the basis of apartheid in housing.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>One of the less discussed aspects of Michel Foucault’s intellectual biography was his enthusiastic endorsement of the Iranian Revolution spearheaded by Ayatollah Khomeini. James Miller, one of the biographers of the late French philosopher and historian, characterized Foucault’s Iran episode as one of “folly.” Far from being an aberration in Foucault’s thought, Miller suggests, on the contrary, that his fascination with death, danger and limits, and his disgust with capitalism, explain his enthusiasm for the Iranian Islamists, with their celebration of martyrdom and their overthrow of the Western-supported regime.</p> \n<p>Claire Bri&egrave;re and Pierre Blanchet’s book “Iran: La R&eacute;volution au nom de Dieu,” published in 1979, included a lengthy interview with Foucault. In it he deplored the Western left’s “unease when confronted by a phenomenon that is, for our political mentality, very curious.” He meant that the phenomenon of religion offered something deeper than ideology, which the left in the West was unable to recognize. Religion, in his view, “has been the vocabulary, the ceremonial, the timeless drama into which one could fit the historical drama of a people that pitted its very existence against that of its sovereign.” When secularists and worried feminists wrote to him in protest, “he dismissed them as inauthentic because they were too Westernized!”</p> \n<p>Foucault was only the first of what has become a long list of intellectuals committed to the values of the left (whether Marxist or postmodernist) who tried to rehabilitate religion in the name of the discriminated minorities usually practicing a religion.</p> \n<p>Some members of the Israeli left have used the same strategy, rehabilitating religion in order to defend the cultural dignity of Mizrahim (Jews of Middle Eastern descent). In an exchange of articles in the Haaretz Hebrew edition, Israeli sociologist Yehouda Shenhav lambasted the authors of “New Jewish Time: Jewish Culture in the Era of Secularism,” and rejected the authors’ endorsement of secularity, claiming that both normatively and descriptively, the project of secularity is fraught with binary classifications that are invalidated by an empirical reality in which secularity and religiosity exist side by side, tightly and indissolubly tied together. Implicitly rejoining Michel Foucault and other left-wing thinkers (Homi Bhabha, Judith Butler, Terry Eagleton), Prof. Shenhav expressed his distaste for the kind of binary thinking presumably embodied by the West and in particular by the secular world view.</p> \n<p>Shenhav’s position is more puzzling than Foucault’s – for, not without a certain amount of bad faith, the late philosopher supported religion from within the comfortable framework of a thoroughly secular society, which was totally unlikely to demand that women wear the veil, to stone homosexuals, or to repress dissident religious minorities.</p> \n<p>Foucault or Butler can defend religion from within the framework of a secular state, precisely because religious freedom was originally the very raison d’&ecirc;tre of the liberal polities in which they lived. In Israel, however, this is far from being the case. In contradistinction to Western liberal polities, in Israel, citizenship laws, marriage, burial, adoption, conversions – all are controlled by clergy, who regularly trample human rights, and make religion into an active component of state repression and state discrimination.</p> \n<p>Such a strange and unexpected alliance between fundamentalist and left-wing attacks on secularity shed a poignant light on the frequent inarticulateness of secular people to explain and defend their way of life. As reflected in a famous exchange between Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and the Hazon Ish (Rabbi Avrahom Yeshaya Karelitz, a late leader of ultra-Orthodox Judaism), it has been commonly held in Israel that secular people should defer to the religious because the former’s “cart” is empty, while the latter’s is full (the camel without any goods on his back must defer to the camel carrying heavy goods on his back). In fact, many secular people ironically agree with the fundamentalists in viewing their way of living as “empty,” “selfish,” “materialist,” “narcissistic” and “hedonist.”</p> \n<p>For example, Orhan Pamuk, the celebrated Turkish writer, claims in his 2003 book “Istanbul” that, “In the secular fury of Ataturk’s New Republic, to move away from religion was to be modern and Western; it was a smugness in which there flickered from time to time the flame of idealism. But that was in public. In private life, nothing came to fill the spiritual void. Cleansed of religion, home became as empty as the city’s ruined yalis [mansions on the Bosporus] and as gloomy as the fern-darkened gardens surrounding them.”</p> \n<p>Unanswered challenge</p> \n<p>The imagery here is very strong; it is an imagery of abandonment, emptiness, darkness, ruin and void. In the romanticized imagery of secular societies, religion is warm, where secularity is cold; it is vibrant and full of meaning, where secularity is hollow and arid.</p> \n<p>Although the question of what defines the secular outlook is a burning one, secular people have often remained strangely silent on its content, as if implicitly acknowledging that it had none. Confused and disempowered by relativism and postmodernism, secularity has had a hard time explaining its moral foundations. Indeed, when protesting against religious coercion, seculars have not argued in the name of a concrete and strong morality, but rather in the name of vague ideals of “freedom” and of democracy. Religion continues to pose a challenge to secularity, and this challenge remains, by and large, unanswered.</p> \n<p>The challenge can be formulated as follows: You may be free, argue the religious, but your freedom is an empty one. For the religious (and numerous segments of the secular public as well), secular freedom is at best the freedom to choose between McDonald’s or Pizza Hut, Zara or H &amp; M, Haagen Dazs or Ben &amp; Jerry’s. Interestingly enough, in this as well, fundamentalists agree with the radical critics of modernity, who have all suspected that the cultural space opened by the decline of religion and the practice of freedom has been filled up with new and abominable deities.</p> \n<p>Against such an impoverished view of freedom, religious people proudly brandish a rich and complex world of meanings, stories and symbols; a communal life in which mutual aid is practiced; an ethic of brotherliness and altruism that puts to shame the “egoism” and “emptiness” of secular society.</p> \n<p>The challenge that religion poses to secularity thus concerns the “depth” and “thickness” of the meaning of life: Secularity seems to be flat and empty precisely because it is exclusively concerned with affirming “rights” and “freedom,” which, by definition, are culturally weak – that is, devoid of a grandiose cosmology, a sense of the sacred, and powerful binding rituals. For this reason, secular people are often portrayed by the religious as having chosen the easy and lazy path. We, the religious claim, follow arduous and demanding commandments, and this effort makes us and our inner life richer and more valuable.</p> \n<p>But the secular option has rich and demanding moral commandments. Contrary to the stereotype that has been offered by the religious world and has too rarely been contested, secularity is not easy; it is not the mode of life of those who simply don’t have the strength to abide by exacting laws. It is a life option that entails a demanding and difficult commitment vis-a-vis oneself and vis-a-vis others. This is not only because, as existentialists have taught us, freedom makes life more difficult, but also because secularity entails the capacity to share with others a world whose meaning is not “owned” by a single group.</p> \n<p>Unapologetic Durkheim</p> \n<p>Paradoxically, but unsurprisingly, the only sociologist who had an uncompromisingly hopeful attitude vis-a-vis secularity was the founder of the sociology of religion, Emile Durkheim. Durkheim did more than anyone else to rehabilitate religion in secular eyes, but he was also the only one to be vigorously unapologetic vis-a-vis religion.</p> \n<p>As he famously argued in his 1912 book “The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life,” religion binds members of a group to each other through rituals. But for him, if religion holds society together, it is because religion is from the outset a secular phenomenon. Religion – a system of deities and rituals – is a “glue” binding people together into groups, but this glue, according to Durkheim, is not intrinsically more valuable than other forms of secular “glue” – such as, for example, the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, or patriotism.</p> \n<p>Durkheim was thus perhaps the only sociologist who dramatically reversed the relationship between religion and secularity, as he showed that if religion generates morality, it is because human associations as such – not religion – generate commitment, loyalty and solidarity. In contradistinction to many of his German contemporaries, who thought that the foundation of social cohesion was in essence a religious one, Durkheim suggested that religion owed, so to speak, everything to “society.” Religious morality, altruism and solidarity have, fundamentally, a nonreligious origin. If they have a nonreligious origin, then this means quite simply that they will survive the disappearance of religion.</p> \n<p>Moreover, he said: Far from being a threat to morality and solidarity, secularity enables these values to accrue depth and complexity. Thus Durkheim could see what Marx and Weber could not: namely, that secular phenomena such as nationalism or human rights could be a source of identity, meaning and even sacredness.</p> \n<p>Reason vs. revelation</p> \n<p>But what is secularity? A secular society can be defined as a society in which economic, political and cultural decisions are made based on the belief that human knowledge and human reason, not divine revelation, should guide its members. It is a society in which the ultimate principle of legitimacy is the well-being of its population, and not the enactment of a law that has a non-human, divine origin. It is a society in which human beings as human beings, and not their Creator, are viewed as the source and object of the legitimacy of its key institutions.</p> \n<p>But when trying to go beyond this general definition and be more specific, we are faced with an almost insurmountable difficulty: Unlike religion, secularity has no unified body of texts, no clear “commandments,” no binding “dos” and “don’ts” (except those mandated by civil law). Moreover, because secularity encourages a multiplicity of lifestyles, it is cacophonic to the point of incoherence. Because secularity encourages multiplicity, it is difficult to grasp what, beyond this diversity, is the defining attitude of the secular outlook.</p> \n<p>Let me thus suggest this: The content of secularity is precisely to be found in that cacophonous plurality of lifestyles and, more exactly, in what it demands from human beings who live side by side with other, different human beings. The ability to live in a world of multiple and uncertain meanings demands moral qualities that are as demanding as they are often unnoticed.</p> \n<p>To clarify these qualities, let us go back to that period in history in which nonreligious values were explicitly and militantly affirmed and defended – namely, the Enlightenment.</p> \n<p>Historically, the secular attitude emerged as a weapon against the world of demons, witches and false saints fabricated by the Church to control people. As philosophers of the Enlightenment relentlessly suggested, power and domination rest on fear, and fear is the close cousin of superstition. We fear far more the chimeras of our imagination than real objects. Thus, the great intellectual achievement of the Enlightenment was to suggest that justice and equality could be accomplished only with a healthy dose of suspicion of established dogmas and political institutions, because superstition, false prophets and idols helped maintain injustice and political abuse.</p> \n<p>It is this connection between false beliefs and abusive power that is at the heart of the great program of secular modernity. The main program of secularity is the claim that reason should guide knowledge and self-knowledge, and that this reliance on reason is in itself a source of morality. The secular outlook puts at its center lucidity and self-critique, an attitude that is often mistaken by conservative thinkers and religious people as “self-hatred.” Why are self-critique, self-knowledge and lucidity so central to the secular outlook, and why are they its (hidden) glory?</p> \n<p>Following are the basic principles that make self-knowledge and critique the moral commandments of secularism:</p> \n<p>1. The initial impetus of the secular mind is to be found in Immanuel Kant’s famous answer to a question posed by the Berlinische Monattschrift in 1784: “Was ist Aufklarung [What is Enlightenment]?”: “Sapere Aude [Dare to Know]!” That is, dare to make up your mind for yourself, dare to choose for yourself, dare to challenge authorities and commonly accepted wisdom.</p> \n<p>For Kant, choosing for oneself meant being a more moral person because, for him, to be truly moral, decisions have to be self-generated. They have to come from the very process of deliberating and finding an opinion from within one’s own reason. Morality, he thought, cannot come from the dictates of outside authorities, from tradition, revelation or group pressure. Kant affirms here the supreme value of a freedom to think, radically opposed both to authorities and to conventional wisdom, clich&eacute;s, stereotypes. An opinion must be free and self-generated because choice, according to him, is the essence of moral life.</p> \n<p>To use a familiar analogy to understand what Kant means: To make a child moral through encouraging him to use reasoning and deliberation is far superior to instilling morality through fear and punishment, or through the hope of being rewarded. Thus, freedom is a supreme value not because secular people cannot commit themselves to a distinct vision of the good, or because they selfishly want to keep all their “options open.” Rather, it is because the act of choosing makes moral life more autonomous and therefore more mature.</p> \n<p>Secularity prefers a hesitating but self-generated commitment to values, rather than a strong but imposed one. And this secular self is hesitant, I argue, precisely because it is often replete with conflicting value commitments. While religions offer hierarchies of values, secular people navigate the world of values in a horizontal way. For the secular, morality cannot be a set of rigid “dos” and “don’ts,” because this would deny the faculty that defines our humanity: the ability to reason and to choose for ourselves. Where religious people often pride themselves in holding on to views and practices handed down by long traditions, the capacity to rely on our own reason requires an unnoticed but cardinal virtue: that of courage.</p> \n<p>The sung and unsung heroes of the secular world are the multitude of men and women who challenged authorities, conventional wisdom and the dominant ideology of their times. These heroes are such people as Galileo, Manet, Oscar Wilde and Rosa Parks, who all confronted what other people thought they knew and offered disquieting new truths, derived from their conscience and their own understanding of the world.</p> \n<p>Secularity thus takes the following bet with the human species: that in the process of being left to ourselves to deliberate and to choose – without relying on what others have thought for us before us – we will mature, and that maturity will take us, collectively, one step forward. Secular morality recognizes and accepts the fact that a morality that is imposed by outside authorities is more stable, coherent and manageable, but claims also that such morality loses vigor and ultimately becomes stifled and stifling. Thus, even if freedom and autonomy mean a loss in stability and coherence (and they obviously mean that), there is so much to gain from a morality that is chosen rather than imposed that it is worth taking the bet.</p> \n<p>2. This insistence on the act of choosing, on “making up our minds for ourselves,” comes from a basic difference between the religious and the secular views concerning human beings’ position in history: For the religious, the laws regulating our conduct were handed down by God. Because the ancient sages were living closer to the times in which the laws were given, they had more direct access to fountains of wisdom than we do. This means that the ancient sages’ views always have precedence over ours.</p> \n<p>According to the religious outlook, history is the history of decay. We have not improved on our past spiritual masters. We may learn from them but we cannot, and in fact must not hope to improve anything they have thought of. In this way, for religious people, our present life is not imbued with a meaning in itself but rather has a meaning only to the extent that it is an imitatio dei, an imitation of God or an imitation of the ancient sages.</p> \n<p>Secular philosophy, at least during the formative period of the Enlightenment, holds the opposite view. Voltaire, Condorcet, Hume, Mill, Bentham and Bayle, all philosophers of the Enlightenment, took the position that our lives here and now, as they are, have a meaning, and that they must be treated as such. This is what Voltaire meant when he called on his readers at the end of “Candide” to “cultivate [their] garden” – namely, to make beautiful what they have here and now.</p> \n<p>Secularity thus makes on us the demand to soothe suffering and to better human lives here and now, not in the world-to-come. If secular people pay so much attention to themselves, it is not because they are narcissistic (or not only), but because secularity calls on us to make this world a livable and beautiful place. Now, not tomorrow. No less and perhaps more than the religious world, the secular world is devoted to the improvement of its surroundings: Caring for the underprivileged and the environment through a wide array of social movements and nongovernmental organizations illustrates the commitment to the improvement of the world.</p> \n<p>3. This is not to say that only the present exists in the secular mind. Quite the opposite. If the human enterprise has a meaning, this meaning resides in the capacity to learn, and to improve our individual and collective destiny. Secularity makes the demand that we improve ourselves, and thus makes the future into a central feature of collective and individual action. For example, “green” thinking is essentially about the future and future generations. The secular person’s attention to the future is not naively optimistic and does not reflect a linear view of history. Far from it. Enlightened secularity is a fundamentally restless and worried attitude to the world because it assumes that the present is unsatisfactory and that the future, unless carefully thought out, could be worse.</p> \n<p>A basic premise of the secular outlook is that knowledge enables us to shape the future. And that knowledge, contrary to the accusation that secularity has no connection to history, is deeply dependent on history. Secular societies are more and more intensely busy with their pasts and with their collective memories than traditional societies. That is why secular societies have a more creative, intense and alive relationship to the past than religious societies, for which the past is more an object of imitation and reverence than it is something to argue with or recoil from.</p> \n<p>This is why the secular outlook is at one and the same time restlessly striving forward and anxiously looking backward: The existential position of the secular person is that, while hope is the great engine of human action, that hope should always be looking back, with great concern. Israeli post-Zionist historians are the best illustration of such an attitude. They are wrestling with the Israeli past, with the future-oriented hope that such knowledge will bring greater justice to their society.</p> \n<p>4. Many critics of modernity have rightly argued that the Enlightenment has brought about a dry and arrogant view of knowledge. Science has been and often remains enamored of its power and remains blind to its own “religious” fundamentalism. But the “love of knowledge” has also other properties.</p> \n<p>Since the ancient era of the Stoics, knowledge was synonymous with skepticism. Later on, that skepticism became a feature of scientific thought. Skepticism is not only a formal and dry quality of the mind; it is perhaps first of all a moral stand vis-a-vis one’s ability to know the world in a definite fashion. The famous concept of scientific doubt suggests that one’s truth is just that: one’s truth.</p> \n<p>If, for the religious mind, truth is literally and metaphorically inscribed in stone, for the scientific mind, truth is temporary, fragile and gained only after a process of discussion and negotiation with peers. This means that scientific skepticism entails a fundamentally restless attitude vis-&agrave;-vis the world, as it is inherently aware of the fragility of all claims, a fragility that entails a modesty with regard to our capacity to know the world in a definite way.</p> \n<p>5. When Freud made his appearance in Western culture, he quickly became its ultimate representative, not because, as has often been claimed, he promoted a facile ethic of hedonism, but rather because he brought the project of secular self-knowledge to its ultimate accomplishment: Freud situated the problem of arbitrary power and injustice within our own psyches, within our compulsion to believe, and within our hidden desire to give and abandon ourselves to authority figures. Thus, Freud suggested that true freedom could never be blind or mindless. It had to come from an austere, relentless and uncompromising battle with the hidden and dark corners of our own psyches.</p> \n<p>Freud made lucidity and self-knowledge into the moral program of secularity. Such a program demands a rare and difficult virtue: the courage to wrestle with one’s own demons, to refuse to excuse or embellish oneself. For the awareness of one’s limitations and the courage to come to terms with them is perhaps the only way to offset the dangerous illusion of omnipotence that is always waiting for us around the corner. Thus, Freud and his legacy continue and complete the program of scientific skepticism, as they demand nothing less from us than an attitude of intransigent lucidity vis-&agrave;-vis ourselves.</p> \n<p>6. Lastly and perhaps most importantly, the pluralism that is inherently attached to secularity has made the business of “having an identity” a very complicated one: In a religious society, one is particularly good at figuring out one’s identity, at knowing who one is, because one knows very well who is the “other.” Self-identity is always much clearer when one knows who one is not and does not want to be.</p> \n<p>In a secular society, one is indeed far more confused. I entirely agree with the claim that a secular person is usually less competent at “knowing who s/he is” than a religious person. As many have said, the rise of fundamentalism takes place in the context of a great crisis of identity among the secular.</p> \n<p>I would agree with that assessment, but would disagree with the common interpretation of “identity crisis.” The so-called crisis of identity of the secular person is a blessing. That person’s identity is plagued by a sense of chronic crisis because it is not based on a clearly marked “us vs. them.” What the secular person values most is the ability to identify with, understand and empathize with a variety of points of view.</p> \n<p>This is perhaps the single most powerful moral lesson to be learned from the invention of the novel in the 18th century: The supreme commandment of literature, operas, novels, theater, movies, television series, is to “imagine the other as if he were yourself,” and this commandment is the precondition of morality. Without the capacity to imagine the lives and aspirations and struggles of others, the moral life cannot start. The ability to imagine, empathize and sympathize with a multiplicity of forms of life, rather than to define rigidly in-group/out-group classifications is the great accomplishment of secular culture.</p> \n<p>Contrary to Shenhav’s claims, I would argue that religions have far more rigid binary systems than secular cultures (pure/impure; secular/religious; sacred/profane; Jewish/Gentile, pious/impious, etc.). Binarism is produced by clearly defined moral cores, which, I have claimed here, are precisely what secularity lacks.</p> \n<p>Secular identity is more complicated and more fragile because it tries to build loyalty based on autonomy, not on total and unconditional identification with one’s group; it tries to build coherence not from unconditional membership to a single group, but from the ability to identify with many forms of life.</p> \n<p>Of course, not every secular person corresponds with the description of secularity provided here. But most religious people also fail to live by the standards of their commandments without this invalidating religion per se. The gamut of secular forms of life is as wide as the variety of religious shades and groups. Secularity has a serious, austere, demanding program that makes it a rich moral, intellectual and existential option that has nothing to apologize for.</p> \n<p>In the context of an increasingly religious society dominated by religious institutions, Israeli seculars must claim that the empty cart belongs to those who use tradition in a mechanical way, those who are afraid of their own ability to probe their creativity, those who use the fear of others as a way to shape their identity. Secularity’s cart is as full as that of the religious, precisely because, over the static order of tradition, it prefers the energetic and chaotic movements of reason and human creativity.</p> \n<p>The secular mode of life is very far from being facile and hedonist. It is inherently complicated and ridden with crisis. And this perpetual state of crisis and the chaos it sometimes entails are precisely its glory, for they stem from a restless movement forward, from a consciousness without illusions, from a thirst for knowledge accompanied by an acute awareness of the fragility of that knowledge, and from the difficulties of building coherent selves in the face of our respect for other forms of life.</p> \n<p>The secular self is a fragile and difficult one, but that is because it confronts with wide-open eyes arbitrary power, ready-made thought, fancies and illusions, and the moral complexity and difficulty of pluralism.</p>",

        "text":["<p>On November 19, 1948, Natan Alterman, whose influential “Seventh Column” – an op-ed in poetry form – appeared every Friday in the daily Davar, the mouthpiece of Israel’s ruling Mapai party (forerunner of Labor), published a poem titled “About This.” Excerpts:</p> \n<p>Across the vanquished city in a jeep he did speed – A lad bold and armed, a young lion of a lad! And an old man and a woman on that very street Cowered against a wall, in fear of him clad. Said the lad smiling, milk teeth shining: “I’ll try the machine gun” and put it into play! To hide his face in his hands the old man barely had time When his blood on the wall was sprayed.  We shall sing, then, about “delicate incidents” Whose name, don’t you know, is murder. Sing of conversations with sympathetic listeners, Of snickers of forgiveness that are slurred.  For those in combat gear, and we who impinge, Whether by action or agreement subliminal, Are thrust, muttering “necessity” and “revenge,” Into the realm of the war criminal. (translation by Ralph Mandel)</p> \n<p>Extremely moved by the verses, David Ben-Gurion, then chairman of the Provisional State Council in the nascent Jewish state, wrote Alterman: “Congratulations on the moral validity and the powerful expressiveness of your latest column in Davar You are a pure and faithful mouthpiece of the human conscience, which, if it does not act and beat in our hearts in times like these, will render us unworthy of the great wonders vouchsafed to us until now.</p> \n<p>“I ask your permission to have 100,000 copies of the article – which no armored column in our army exceeds in combat strength – printed by the Defense Ministry for distribution to every army person in Israel.”</p> \n<p>What were the war crimes referred to in the poem?</p> \n<p>The massacres perpetrated by Israeli forces in Lydda (Lod) and in the village of Al-Dawayima, west of Hebron, were among the worst mass killings of the entire War of Independence. In an interview in Haaretz in 2004, historian Benny Morris (author of “The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949”) declared that the most egregious massacres “occurred at Saliha, in Upper Galilee (70-80 victims), Deir Yassin on the outskirts of Jerusalem (100-110), Lod (50), Dawamiya (hundreds) and perhaps Abu Shusha (70).”</p> \n<p>Lod was conquered in Operation Dani (July 9-19, 1948), which also targeted nearby Ramle. The political and military leadership viewed the capture of those two towns as crucial, because the concentration of Arab forces there threatened Tel Aviv and its surroundings. Specifically, the aim was for the fledgling Israel Defense Forces to clear the roads and allow access to the Jewish communities on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road – which remained under Arab control – and to take control of the hilly areas stretching from Latrun to the outskirts of Ramallah. This would mean a clash with units of Jordan’s Arab Legion, which were deployed – or supposedly deployed – in the area.</p> \n<p>Another goal of Operation Dani, which was led by Yigal Allon with Yitzhak Rabin as his deputy, was to expand the territories of the young Jewish state beyond the boundaries delineated by the UN partition plan.</p> \n<p>On July 10, Lod was bombed by the Israeli air force, the first such attack in the War of Independence. A large ground force had also been assembled, including three brigades and 30 artillery batteries, based on the army’s assessment that large Jordanian forces were in the area.</p> \n<p>To their surprise, the IDF units encountered little or no resistance. Even so, there are Palestinian and other Arab sources that allege that 250 people were massacred after Lod was taken. Claims about the scale of the massacre gain credence from Israeli historian Ilan Pappe, who maintains that the army killed 426 men, women and children in a local mosque and the surrounding streets. According to him, 176 bodies were found in the mosque, and the rest outside. Testimony of a Palestinian from Lod lends support to these estimates: “The [Israeli troops], violating all the conventions, shelled the mosque, killing everyone who was inside. I heard from friends who helped remove the dead from the mosque that they carried out 93 bodies; others said there were many more than a hundred.” Clearly, though, there are no agreed-upon, precise figures, and the estimates from both sides are tendentious.</p> \n<p>Israeli troops went from house to house, expelling the remaining inhabitants to the West Bank. In some cases, soldiers looted abandoned houses and stole from the refugees.</p> \n<p>Ben-Gurion’s intentions with respect to Lod remain a subject of debate. Years later, Rabin related how in a meeting with him and Allon, Ben-Gurion, when asked what to do with the residents of Ramle and Lod, gestured with his hand and said, “Expel them.” This version of events was to have been included in Rabin’s memoirs but was banned for publication in Israel, in 1979. His account did appear in The New York Times at the time, and caused a furor. Allon, who also took part in the meeting with Ben-Gurion, vehemently denied Rabin’s account.On July 12, an order was issued by the Yiftah Brigade “to remove the residents from Lod speedily They are to be directed to Beit Naballah [near Ramle].” .</p> \n<p>‘Only a few shots’</p> \n<p>With regard to Dawayima, some facts are clear. On October 29, 1948, during Operation Yoav (aka Operation Ten Plagues) in the south, the 89th Battalion, a commando unit, conquered the village. By then, more than three months after the Lod massacre, it was obvious that Israel was winning the war. Now, the goal was to add more territory, to empty the country of Arabs wherever possible and to enter armistice talks under convenient conditions. Extensive areas in the north, and perhaps even more in the south, were seized almost without a battle. The IDF swept through one village after another.</p> \n<p>A case in point was Dawayima, population about 4,000, situated on the western slopes of the South Hebron Hills in the Negev (today’s Moshav Amatzia). Many of the villagers, including old people, women and children, were murdered by the Israeli forces. The village offered no resistance – even those who have sought an explanation, or possible justification, for the crime acknowledge that the IDF encountered only light opposition and that the halftracks were subjected to “only a few shots, fired from four rifles,” according to Avraham Vered, one of the commanders of the operation.</p> \n<p>In his diary entry of November 10, Ben-Gurion quoted Maj. Gen. Elimelech Avner, commander of the military government in the area, as saying that “according to rumor, 70-80 people were ‘slaughtered’ [quotation marks in original] at Dawayima.” The perpetrators were “Yitzhak’s battalion,” referring to the 89th Battalion of the 8th Brigade, under the command of the legendary Yitzhak Sadeh, founder of the pre-state Palmach strike force. The news apparently shocked the top brass, including Sadeh himself and also Allon, who was in charge of the southern front. Several inquiries ensued. An investigation by Isser Be’eri, head of the Military Intelligence Directorate, was never completed and effectively ended in the wake of the general amnesty granted in February 1949 to persons liable to be charged with committing crimes during the war.</p> \n<p>Some officers testified that those executed were residents of Dawamiya who were found to be in possession of documents or objects looted during the massacre perpetrated against Jews in the Etzion bloc outside Jerusalem in May 1948. One IDF commander wrote, “We remembered 1929 [the massacre by Arabs of the Jewish community in Hebron] and the Etzion Bloc ... the blood of the slaughtered cries out for revenge.”</p> \n<p>Similarly, in an order issued on October 15, during Operation Yoav, Allon stated, “Tonight the brigade will take its revenge. Tonight all the nights of agony of the alliance of the besieged will be revenged.” What underlay the desire for revenge is not clear – probably the difficulty and cruelty of the battles against the Egyptian army in the early part of the war, which resulted in heavy losses on both sides.</p> \n<p>Embarrassment apparently ensued from the fact that the Dawayima massacre took place under the command of Sadeh, who was known for his moral sensitivity and insistence on “purity of arms” – i.e., the use of weapons solely for the execution of a mission, without harming noncombatants. Some left-wing sources maintained that the perpetrators of the mass killing in the village were members of the former ultranationalist underground organization Lehi (led originally by Avraham Stern and afterward by Yitzhak Shamir), which had been coopted to the 89th Battalion, much to Yitzhak Sadeh’s pride. But it is patently untrue that the massacre was carried out by former Lehi personnel. The massacres at Ein Zeitun, as well, near Safed, in early May 1948, and at Lod – and others, too – were perpetrated by Palmach units, by the finest of the fledgling state’s young generation.</p> \n<p>‘Court poet’</p> \n<p>The Dawayima massacre was discussed in at least two cabinet meetings. For his part, on November 19, Prime Minister Ben-Gurion asked the attorney general, Yaakov-Shimshon Shapira, later appointed justice minister, to investigate the event. This was the day Alterman published “About This.” Shapira’s report remains classified to this day – by dint of a decision by a special ministerial committee, and subsequently affirmed by the High Court of Justice. The details of Be'eri's investigation are also still classified.</p> \n<p>It has generally been assumed that Alterman’s poem refers to the events at Lod, which had occurred more than four months before it was published. However, jurist Menachem Finkelstein, in his book “The Seventh Column and Purity of Arms” (2011; Hebrew), argues that the column was written about the Dawayima massacre, which took place three weeks before its publication. According to Finkelstein, Alterman heard about the mass killings from his good friend Sadeh and knew a great deal more than what he recounts in the poem, but did not want to embarrass Sadeh or run the risk of intervention by the military censors.</p> \n<p>Still, not everyone interprets the column in Davar as an unequivocal condemnation of the massacre. Poet and essayist Yitzhak Laor, who considers Alterman a “court poet,” has speculated that the column may even have been commissioned, and that “it was written with a didactic purpose.” In the view of literary scholar Hannan Hever, Alterman’s poem reflects a Jewish, Zionist voice that condemns the brutal event but does not dare blame the political leadership or Ben-Gurion specifically, the poet’s friend, who spearheaded the policy of occupation and expulsion.</p> \n<p>In a 1996 book, “The Southern Front, from Sinai to Hebron” (in Hebrew), the former commander Avraham Vered mocks Alterman, who had been a soldier in the 8th Brigade but, Vered suggests, was relieved of combat duty because the war adversely affected his muse.</p> \n<p>“Maybe the stories that were floating around about the conquest of Dawayima reached Alterman in the brigade’s tents,” writes Vered, and, “shocked by the exaggerations overlaid on the stories, he found that the time was appropriate to publish a diatribe against the Palmach in connection with Operation Dani in Lod.”</p> \n<p>The poem was widely quoted and also drew high praise. Haaretz, reprinting it in full, wrote, “Alterman’s cry of alarm touches on the very essence of the war and its methods.” The philosopher Samuel Hugo Bergman, a member of Brit Shalom, the Jewish-Palestinian Peace Alliance, termed the distribution of copies of the column to soldiers “an extremely important event.”</p> \n<p>Mentioning also S. Yizhar’s short story “The Prisoner,” about the shooting, in cold blood, by Israeli troops of a Palestinian prisoner, published in November 1948, while the war still raged, Bergman noted, “The fact that such works can appear in our country in wartime is wonderful testimony to the freedom of spirit that prevails here.” (Yizhar’s short novel “Hirbet Hizeh” dealt with a similar theme.”)</p> \n<p>The first meeting of the Provisional State Council (which had legislative and executive authorities until a formal government was established) after the Lod massacre was held on July 14, 1948. Sixty-eight years later, large swaths of its minutes are still classified. In the unclassified section, Ben-Gurion relates that in some places conquered by IDF forces, such as the airport at Lod (as distinct from the city), “almost unbelievable things were done, things that on Thursday [July 8] were still in the realm of thought. An incredible reality was created.” He basks in the successes: “I learned something else – that war is not only wasteful. We acquired something that Israel would not have built in the coming 10 years: the airport at Lod [today Ben-Gurion International Airport] That airport is worth millions.”</p> \n<p>One of the most powerful condemnations of the events at Lod and Dawamiya came from the agriculture minister, Aharon Zisling. The language used on November 17 by the kibbutz member and representative of the left-wing Mapam party, is among the most damning ever heard in an Israeli cabinet meeting. Zisling told those present that after he received information about the events, he had not been able to sleep all night.</p> \n<p>“I felt that the things that were going on were wounding my soul, the soul of my family and all of us here,” he said. “I could not imagine where we came from and where we were going.” Noting that he had sometimes disagreed when British occupiers in Palestine were called “Nazis” – even though, he averred, the “British did commit Nazi crimes” – Zisling added: “But now Jews too have behaved like Nazis and my entire being has been shaken. We have to conceal these actions from the public, and I agree that we should not even reveal that we are investigating them, but they must be investigated.”</p> \n<p>That text appears in Tom Segev’s book, “1949: The First Israelis” (English translation: Arlen N. Weinstein). Segev and Morris (in “The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited”) cite a precise source in the archives of the Kibbutz Hameuchad movement. However, I was unable to find the document there. Nor is it likely that the meeting in question ended with Zisling’s remarks. Other ministers certainly spoke, but their comments are classified.</p> \n<p>There is no doubt in my mind that Zisling was referring to the Dawayima massacre. His information probably came from a letter sent by a soldier named S. Kaplan to Eliezer Peri, editor of Al Hamishmar, the Mapam newspaper, on November 8, about the Dawayima atrocity.</p> \n<p>In fact, another soldier, who was an eyewitness to the event related his experiences to his friend Kaplan, a fellow Mapamnik, who passed it on to Peri, who was also a member of the party’s political committee. In many respects, this letter, apparently written in real time, is of immense importance and significance. It remains relevant and germane today, and is published here in full for the first time. It was found in the archive, typewritten, with several minor corrections and handwritten proofreading, and reads as follows:</p> \n<p>Dear Comrade Eliezer Peri,</p> \n<p>I read today’s editorial in Al Hamishmar about procedure in our army, which conquers everything except its base instincts.</p> \n<p>Eyewitness testimony given to me by a soldier who was in Dawayima on the day after its capture. The soldier is one of ours, an intellectual, 100-percent reliable. He told me what was in his heart because of a psychological need to unburden his soul of the horrific awareness that our cultured and educated people are capable of achieving this level of barbarism. He told me what was in his heart, because not many hearts today are capable of listening.</p> \n<p>There was no battle and no resistance (and no Egyptians). The first conquerors [to enter the village] killed from 80 to 100 [male] Arabs, women and children. They killed the children by smashing their skulls with sticks. There was not a home without its dead. The second wave of the army was a company to which the testifying soldier belonged.</p> \n<p>Arab men and women who remained in the village were shut into houses without food or water. Then came sappers to blow up houses. One commander ordered a sapper to put two old Arab women into the particular house that was going to be blow up with them inside. The sapper refused, saying he took orders only from his commander. So the commander ordered his soldiers to shut the women in, and the horror was perpetrated.</p> \n<p>One soldier boasted that he had raped an Arab woman and then shot her. Another Arab woman who was carrying a newborn baby was made to clean the courtyard, where the soldiers eat. She did that service for a day or two, and in the end she and her baby were shot. The soldier relates that their cultured, polite commanders, who are considered upstanding members of society, turned into base murderers, and not in the heat and passion of battle but in a system of expulsion and destruction. The fewer Arabs that will remain, the better. That principle is the political driving force of the expulsions and atrocities, to which no one objects, either in the operational command or in high command. I myself was at the front for two weeks and heard tales of boasting by soldiers and commanders of how they excelled at hunting and “screwing.” To screw an Arab, just like that and under all circumstances, is an honorable mission and there’s competition for winning at this.</p> \n<p>We are in a bind. To issue an outcry in the press is to assist the Arab League, as our representative rejects their complaints out of hand. Not to react is [to show] solidarity with baseness of spirit. The soldier told me that Deir Yassin is not the peak of the wildness. Can we shout about Deir Yassin and remain silent about far worse?</p> \n<p>We must raise a scandal in the internal channels, demand an internal investigation and punish the guilty. And first of all the army needs to establish a special unit to restrain the army. I myself accuse the government above all – it has no interest in combating these phenomena and is perhaps also indirectly encouraging them. Inaction is in itself encouragement. My commanding officer said that there is an unwritten order not to take prisoners, and each soldier and commander interprets “prisoners” for himself.</p> \n<p>A prisoner can be an Arab man, an Arab woman or an Arab child. Only in display windows such as Majdal [Ashkelon] and Nazareth is it not done.</p> \n<p>I am writing you this so that the newspaper and the party will know the truth and take effective action. At the very least do not get swept up by false diplomacy that covers blood and murder. The newspaper, too, as far as possible should not remain silent.</p> \n<p>[signed]</p> \n<p>Kaplan</p> \n<p>The original of this letter, which was stored in the Aharon Zisling’s personal archive, has disappeared.

        "text":["<p>A picture is said to be worth a thousand words. Sometimes one video clip, or one scene, is worth a thousand scholarly op-eds. Anyone interested in learning something about Israeli politics in 2016 should look at the brief footage from this week’s cabinet meeting – the bit that’s been made available to the media. As Education Minister Naftali Bennett speaks movingly about the new school year, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman does something very politically incorrect. He interrupts Bennett’s speech and complains about the Tel Aviv municipality’s intention to close down a school in the city’s south that is attended mainly by the children of new immigrants from around the metropolitan area, and to turn it into an educational institution for the children of refugees and labor migrants.</p> \n<p>“Infiltrators! Infiltrators!” a voice rings out from the end of the cabinet table – that of Minister Without Portfolio Ofir Akunis, dripping with scorn.</p> \n<p>“It’s the wrong order of priorities, and I expect you to intervene,” Lieberman continues calmly, the cameras trained on him, as he gestures at Bennett. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declares the subject “very important” and says it will be dealt with at the meeting.</p> \n<p>And so it was. Bennett, stung by the lack of collegiality, accused Lieberman of populism and declared that this year the school in question, Shevah Mofet, would operate regularly. There’s plenty of time to solve the problem, he added.</p> \n<p>The next day, shortly before the evening newscasts, the Prime Minister’s Bureau issued a statement asserting that Netanyahu supports the school’s continued operation in its present format, “and is against its closure and its transformation into an educational institution for children of infiltrators.”</p> \n<p>The wily Netanyahu killed two birds with one stone. He won the gratitude of Russian-speaking voters, some of whose children attend the school, and their hatred of the Africans, and he rained on, not to say drenched, the parade of his abhorred education minister on his big day, wrecking the smooth opening-of-the-school-year show. Pretty good haul.</p> \n<p>Xenophobia is a multi-seasonal product without an expiry date. In every generation, there is the cynic or the racist or both of the above who harnesses racism to his vote-garnering chariot and gallops with it for all he’s worth. When Shas’ Eli Yishai left political life, he passed the reins to Likud’s Miri Regev. Now it looks as though Lieberman wants to take over, but he may find that someone even more senior is eyeing that prize.</p> \n<p>In his three months as defense minister, Lieberman has struck twice while the iron was hot. Once, when he ordered the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff to prohibit army units from doing community work in the “storerooms of children” in south Tel Aviv, where they had been taking the wretched toddlers out for some fresh air. The second time was at this week’s cabinet session.</p> \n<p>Lieberman, too, played the two-bird game. The issue of Shevah Mofet has fired up the local Russian-language media. Lieberman signaled to his constituency that he is attuned to its concerns, that national-security matters haven’t made him forget his voters’ plights. And along the way he embarrassed Bennett – who occasionally expresses himself about security issues – in prime time. Incursions into my territory will be responded to in kind, the defense minister made clear to the education minister.</p> \n<p>It’s perfectly legitimate for Lieberman, as leader of a party most of whose voters are from the former Soviet Union, to fight for the continued operation of the school in its present format. The institution is considered an educational success and is attended by children from many nearby cities, not only Tel Aviv. It’s also legitimate for Netanyahu to have his say, even if this is a micro-municipal subject. But both of them need to find a more respectable and proper way to talk to the education minister about an issue that’s in his bailiwick – not by grabbing microphones or issuing communiques. Not that we have any hopes or expectations from this bunch, but if this were a proper government, that’s how things would be done.</p> \n<p>What’s unnecessary and harmful is the desire of these two gentlemen to reap cheap political gains at the expense of children of refugees and labor migrants, children who were born in Israel and are entitled by law to proper schooling in their locale. Netanyahu and Lieberman echoed Miri (“the infiltrators are cancer”) Regev – and she, of course, this week couldn’t resist adding her acidic two cents.</p> \n<p>Another option is to use positive language: in favor of the school, immigrant children and preserving certain traditions. That’s how responsible, judicious leaders who aren’t driven by an impulse to fan the flames would behave. Netanyahu and Lieberman see a container of gas and a Knesset seat or two to be gained – and reach automatically for a lighter.</p> \n<p>In this context, we have to say good word for Bennett, tough as that may be. He is behaving responsibly and without bias, is not taking part in the rhetoric of hatred, not against the country’s Arabs and not against the foreign workers or their children. Some in his right-wing constituency would undoubtedly prefer him to take a different posture, but he’s not giving in to the rumblings of the masses. For that he’s liable to pay a political price.</p> \n<p>Huldai in high gear</p> \n<p>It doesn’t take much to get Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai going. He starts in third gear and within seven seconds, he’s in fifth. Netanyahu’s statement about Shevah Mofet elicited a reaction from Huldai that was uttered in a style probably never before used by a mayor in referring to a prime minister in this country: “Netanyahu is behaving like the lowest of the internet commenters,” he said.</p> \n<p>Not really the way to start the school year, but Huldai’s fuses blew for a few reasons. (A) Neither Netanyahu nor any of his aides bothered to call him and find out the background to the affair; (B) Netanyahu portrayed Huldai as someone who’s working against new-immigrant children and on behalf of the “infiltrators” – whereas it was actually the mayor, not the prime minister, who established the school; (C) Huldai, not Netanyahu, raised funds for the school, 75-80 percent of whose pupils are not from Tel Aviv proper, in an effort to boost integration; (D) Huldai, not Netanyahu, has to cope with an impossible and intolerable situation, in which tens of thousands of labor migrants and refugees have made their home in his city, and he, by law, has to provide their children with education within official institutions; (E) It’s the mayor, not Netanyahu, who is caught between residents of the city who feel, rightly, that foreigners have taken control of their neighborhood, and a government that doesn’t lift a finger to help, and whose leader blames the mayor for the situation; and (F) The mayor, not Netanyahu, has recently been working in a professional manner with the Education Ministry to solve the problem at Shevah Mofet, either by building new premises or by transferring its pupils and teachers elsewhere. And anyway, every child who started out in the school has been promised that he will be able to finish his or her education there.</p> \n<p>So, say what you will of Huldai, his outburst here was understandable. He feels, justly, that he’s been dragged onto the killing fields of the petty political squabbling among the leaders of the three right-wing parties: Netanyahu, Lieberman and Bennett. Huldai has no intention of letting Netanyahu either preach to him or ride roughshod over him, without responding. Not on the playing fields of Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>“Racism-mongers,” he said, when describing Netanyahu and Lieberman in private conversations. “They are trying to hurt me, to scramble for Knesset seats at my expense, to show that I’m in the wrong – and they think I’ll take it lying down?” He sees them as small-time politicos who are engaged in the foul politics of hatred and incitement. That’s what they do, that’s what they know.</p> \n<p>He tells a story about Kibbutz Hulda, where he grew up. His father, Ozer Huldai (the original family name was Obejanski), was principal of the kibbutz school. One day he heard his father giving a talk to the kibbutz members about which model of truck to buy. Afterward, he asked his father: What do you know about the subject? You wouldn’t know one truck from the other. To which his father replied, “That’s what they understand, you have to talk to them about what they understand.”</p> \n<p>The union forever</p> \n<p>On Wednesday afternoon, a group of dignitaries met in the Prime Minister’s Bureau: the three leaders of the Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox, parties – Arye Dery (Shas), Yaakov Litzman (Agudat Yisrael/United Torah Judaism) and Moshe Gafni (Degel Hatorah/UTJ) – the head of the national-religious party in the coalition, Naftali Bennett (Habayit Hayehudi); the directors general of the Transportation Ministry and Israel Railways; the chief of staff in the Prime Minister’s Bureau, Yoav Horowitz; and the director general of the Prime Minister’s Office, Eli Groner. On the agenda: the crisis with the Haredim over continued work on a railway station in Tel Aviv, planned again for this Shabbat, after work was done last Saturday as well.</p> \n<p>The atmosphere was unpleasant; the Haredim arrived livid. The technical experts stated that there was no choice but to work on Shabbat again, as if the work was to be done on a weekday, it would cause great chaos. Litzman stood up. “If work is done on the Sabbath, there is no government,” he declared, adding, “You all lied to us, you said it was a matter of life-and-death, and it wasn’t.” He then stalked out.</p> \n<p>Horowitz and Groner swallowed hard. Suddenly the fate of the coalition was in their hands. “It’s all very well that everyone is looking after his constituency,” Horowitz said, “but we have to look after the whole country, not just the Haredim.”</p> \n<p>UPDATE: Netanyahu freezes Saturday train infrastructure works amid pressure from Haredim </p> \n<p>Even before Gafni and Dery could come to Litzman’s defense, Bennett leaped into the fray. “How can you say that Litzman isn’t looking after the whole of Israel? No one has the state at heart more than he. He is totally committed to the country’s citizens, and you don’t have a monopoly on the nation,” the education minister told the civil servant.</p> \n<p>Professionally, it was decided to reduce the scale of the work as far as possible this Shabbat. Politically, Groner and Horowitz went back to Netanyahu with the following insight: The alliance between Bennett and Litzman (reported in this column two weeks ago), after Litzman turned down Netanyahu’s suggestion to backtrack from an agreement he had with Bennett and leave him without the coalition funds promised him (“Bennett and I are in an alliance of brothers,” he told Netanyahu), is stronger than ever.</p> \n<p>Outrageous fortune</p> \n<p>Throughout his long public career, Yossi Beilin has been considered one of the most brilliant, original and courageous figures of the Startup Nation. Cloying sentimentality and fierce passion have never been his trademark. The term “cold fish” might have been invented for him. He’s the paragon of rationality, the model of icy sarcasm. The Oslo Accords, of which he was one of the architects, became part of Israel’s political and diplomatic history, for good or for ill.</p> \n<p>His rivalry with Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, the veteran army commander and government minister who died this week, was well known, even if its roots are not fully clear: They were in opposing camps in the Labor Party – Beilin with Shimon Peres, Ben-Eliezer with Yitzhak Rabin. According to what I was told a decade ago by an informed source, Ben-Eliezer came across classified material while serving as defense minister in the Ariel Sharon government, which revealed that Beilin had bad-mouthed him viciously to Palestinian politicians.</p> \n<p>Be that as it may, a few months after leaving the Defense Ministry, ahead of the 2003 Knesset election, Ben-Eliezer vowed to remove Beilin from the Labor slate. He saw it as a life’s project, no less. Mustering all his troops in the party, and they were legion, he set out to annihilate Beilin. Every means justified the end. And in the end, Beilin found himself relegated to a place on the slate that was too low for him to be elected.</p> \n<p>Beilin was effectively booted out of Labor, his one and only political home, where he had gained iconic status. Subsequently, he joined Meretz, and led it for a time.</p> \n<p>Unlike others – Avraham Burg, Amram Mitzna, Amir Peretz – who also got a taste of Ben-Eliezer’s cruelty and meanness, which were second only to his affability and humanity (yes, he was a man of contradictions) – he and Beilin never buried the hatchet. The campaign of revenge that Beilin launched on radio, TV and the internet within hours of the announcement of Ben-Eliezer’s death on Sunday was one of the most bizarre and repellent spectacles seen in these parts. Viewers couldn’t help imagining that Beilin would soon take a toy clown’s trumpet out of his pocket and blow it while throwing confetti at the camera. Did he despise him that much? So much that an ardent passion no one knew he possessed unhinged him?</p> \n<p>Factually, Beillin was correct about some of what he said. Ben-Eliezer was a brutal politician of the old school, tainted by corruption, though he died with a presumption of innocence (in mid-trial). He did not depart while still in the thick of political activity: For the last two years of his life he was a sick, suffering individual, and he spent his last days between his home and dialysis units.</p> \n<p>What was so harrowing in Beilin’s series of media appearances was the laid-back, pseudo-academic analytical way he wreaked his revenge on the dead body. He lunged and stabbed, time and again, as though in a frenzy, to the point where even his own son expressed his objections (on Facebook).</p> \n<p>During his years in politics Beilin was considered a media wizard, much in demand for interviews, always original, interesting, clich&eacute;-free and a superb source for political and diplomatic correspondents. In this case, however, he tried to change the narrative and shift the dialogue from praise for the dead to the deceased’s less noble qualities. But he failed twice over. The slings and arrows boomeranged back at him at him, and the good words and sympathy for Ben-Eliezer, in the media and in his semi-state funeral, only increased.</p> \n<p>God’s deputy</p> \n<p>The criminal investigation against former IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi was closed eight months ago without charges being submitted, but with sharp criticism of his unworthy behavior and his compilation of slanderous material against the defense minister at the time, Ehud Barak. Since then, nothing has been heard from Ashkenazi, who had signaled earlier that he intended to enter politics.</p> \n<p>Ashkenazi was a frequent visitor in the Jaffa home of Benjamin Ben-Eliezer. About half a year ago, Ben-Eliezer told an interlocutor that Ashkenazi had abandoned his ambition to head a political party and run against Netanyahu. “Gabi understands that it won’t work,” Ben-Eliezer said. “It’s too short a track, and one that hasn’t proved itself in the past, to demand the premiership immediately without going through the Knesset, the cabinet, running a ministry, the security cabinet. He will agree to be No. 2.”</p> \n<p>In recent weeks, political and other sources have formed the impression that Ashkenazi is no longer ruling out the possibility of joining the Yesh Atid party as deputy to God. It’s possible that party leader Yair Lapid worked on him over the past year and convinced him. Maybe Ashkenazi is looking at the polls that give Yesh Atid 20 seats or so, and believes his presence on the slate will add another four or five, possibly drawing Lapid close to the premiership (though the chances of that are remote).</p> \n<p>As far as is known, Ashkenazi expects “full partnership” from Lapid, and to be appointed defense minister and acting prime minister in his government. For his part, as far as is known, Lapid is ready to promise him the sun and the moon. But people who know Lapid are telling Ashkenazi to watch his step, because God has no deputies.</p> \n<p>Ashkenazi declined to reply to my question of whether he is indeed on the way to joining Yesh Atid.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Rahel Streiff and Ohad Milstein met at a dog park in Tel Aviv. She’s Swiss and he’s Israeli. They fell in love and a few months later Rahel became pregnant. The couple were delighted and their joy increased when during the 10th week of pregnancy they were told they were having twins. Things changed in week 23, and Streiff described it in her diary.</p> \n<p>“Little peanut, this is the hardest time of my life. Last Thursday, we went to take a routine check, and pretty fast it became clear that something was not quite right,” she wrote.</p> \n<p>“The doctor explained to us that if one twin dies, it could have fatal consequences for the other twin because an imbalance in the blood pressure is created, which causes vessels to be damaged, especially in the brain, leading to severe brain damage. The specialists in the hospital unanimously recommended us to have an abortion as soon as possible because the risk of having a baby with a handicap is so high.”</p> \n<p>Ohad and Rahel’s fraught journey has been recorded by Milstein in his documentary “Week 23,” first screened at the Docaviv film festival. It will be shown Wednesday on the Yes Docu satellite channel and will later be screened at movie theaters across the country.</p> \n<p>Milstein is a respected documentary filmmaker, but this is the first time he has recorded his own life. His earlier movies include “Obsession” (2008), which features people plagued by obsessions, “Systema” (2010), which documents Israel’s Olympic synchronized-swimming team, and “Planets” (2014), which shows people choosing to live on the margins of society.</p> \n<p>As in all of Milstein’s movies, the visual aspects in “Week 23” are aesthetically pleasing. The artistic quality and cinematographic motifs are reminiscent of director Paolo Sorrentino and photographer Luca Bigazzi’s 2015 film “Youth.” Another common theme is that some of the plot takes place in Switzerland, with water a visual backdrop.</p> \n<p>Milstein recorded Rahel and him falling in love, not just the pregnancy. “I didn’t know where it would lead, and then we found out we had identical twins,” he says. “I come from a background of art as well as film, and the idea of identical twins sounded like a good concept for making art.”</p> \n<p>Unaccepting Israelis</p> \n<p>Milstein says there’s a disconnect between “parents’ gut feelings and female intuition, on the one hand, and medical procedures that don’t leave room for this. Moreover, Israeli society is wary of outliers. If you have an unborn child who may not be 100 percent okay and you want to have it anyway, that’s considered off the charts. Being weak and imperfect is shameful in Israel.”</p> \n<p>Streiff says that throughout the pregnancy she had the feeling the fetus was healthy.</p> \n<p>“I knew it, but the doctors kept telling me I was wrong. That made me doubt myself, and since there’s no way of measuring maternal intuition and there’s one for measuring medical knowledge, one tends to think they’re right and you’re wrong,” she says.</p> \n<p>“It’s important to understand that this isn’t an anti-abortion movie – we believe that each case should be considered on its own merits. It is, however, a film that tries to support maternal intuition.”</p> \n<p>In this case there was male intuition as well. There’s a dramatic moment where Milstein discovers that the doctors were wrong in calculating the size of the living fetus, and that the fetus was developing normally despite the predictions.</p> \n<p>“When I discovered their mistake I couldn’t understand how the picture they were painting was of something so distorted while the ultrasound looked fine,” Milstein says.</p> \n<p>“So I went over the numbers, made comparisons and discovered their mistake. They’d compared the size of the living twin’s head to the dead twin’s leg, which was obviously small, instead of to the living twin’s leg.”</p> \n<p>My conversation with the couple takes place in their Jaffa apartment. At the entrance I meet their son Alva, who’s almost 3. The idea that he might never have been born if his parents had listened to the doctors is inconceivable.</p> \n<p>Streiff says maybe there’s a cultural difference between Europe and Israel.</p> \n<p>“In Europe there’s more dialogue with the mother during the pregnancy. I’m from a family that’s connected to nature and to itself. I didn’t see many doctors when I was a child and my mother always taught us to listen to our bodies,” she says.</p> \n<p>“I’m grateful for that, otherwise I would have been terrified of the catastrophe they described and would have terminated the pregnancy. I felt egotistical in insisting on not having an abortion, since Ohad felt differently. He was very scared and I thought it wasn’t fair for me to do that to him.”</p> \n<p>Milstein says that if things turned out poorly, they would have moved to Switzerland so they could be helped by Rahel’s parents “and live in a society that’s more tolerant of differences.”</p> \n<p>One of the most difficult statements in the film is made by Rahel’s father, Patrick Streiff, a bishop. He wonders at the intolerance of Israelis toward the handicapped.</p> \n<p>He tells his daughter: “I’m very surprised by what you’re telling me. Don’t they have handicapped children there? Don’t people there know or can’t they see how happy these children can be, so capable of fully enjoying life?”</p> \n<p>Great sex scene</p> \n<p>In contrast, the readiness of Israelis to immediately abort fetuses when any suspicion of imperfection arises is represented by Milstein’s mother, Margherita.</p> \n<p>She tells the couple as they’re driving somewhere: “I’d have an abortion at once, as soon as I learned the fetus was deformed It’s the simplest and easiest thing to do in such a case, in contrast to the risk of having a handicapped child that could ruin your life and wreck everything. It can destroy a family, since a retarded child will always remain so, whatever his defect. For me, your fetus is not a living creature.”</p> \n<p>And yet, Milstein’s mother is the only character in the film who undergoes a change. Later in the movie she cries when she sees Alva’s ultrasound images, confessing that she’s “full of guilt feelings” for abortions she had when she was younger. “It’s killing something incomplete, something so calm and peaceful,” she says tearfully.</p> \n<p>Milstein says his mother is portrayed in an extreme light but actually represents the consensus in Israel. “Everyone we consulted with, including family and friends, said unequivocally that they wouldn’t take the risk and would have the abortion,” he says.</p> \n<p>“Everyone said ‘what’s the problem? Have an abortion and start over.’ Since I don’t like to talk a lot, especially not in my movies, my mother served as my voice. She represents what I thought. She went through a transformation, and so did I.”</p> \n<p>Either way, the sex scene at the beginning is beautiful. “I’m afraid my parents will see it, but otherwise I have no problem with it,” Streiff says. “I see this scene as the artistic part of the movie.”</p> \n<p>Milstein adds: “It was important for me to include this scene since it documents the event that led to all the rest. If there’s any reason to include a sex scene, this is it.”</p> \n<p>Streiff, a graphic designer by profession, works as a language expert (she speaks German, French, English and Hebrew) on a Google project. Her narration in the film is a driving force.</p> \n<p>“When I became pregnant I started writing things my future child could read when he grew up. I was then surprised that there were two, so I wrote them both about how I felt having them inside me,” she says. “When the problems appeared, writing fulfilled a need to get things out. It was my way of dealing with everything that happened.”</p> \n<p>So was it hard to read the diaries aloud?</p> \n<p>“It was extremely difficult because it constantly took me back to that situation,” Streiff says. “Some of it was very personal and hard to share.”</p> \n<p>As Milstein puts it, “I’m a tough director. I asked her to read it over and over until I was satisfied.”</p>",

        "text":["<p> The box said the game was meant for kids ages five and up. However, it took more than two hours for me to glue all the shards together so they resembled something like the ancient toy bird pictured on the instruction page. The young archaeologist in me did not turn out to be particularly talented, but the experience did teach me something important about Yaara Pelzig: As a child, she must have developed a lot of patience.</p> \n<p> Pelzig grew up in a home dedicated to archaeology and art. Her father, Arik, invented the shards game when she was little. She says that, as a child, she could assemble much more complicated objects than the little bird I tried to reconstruct. She was even photographed for the cover of the game, standing and spreading glue on a large jug a little blonde girl with a serious, calm and focused expression on her face.</p> \n<p> This inner quiet can be seen today as well. Although it seemingly doesn’t suit her chosen profession, it is apparently what enables her to stand out as one of the most intriguing and promising actors in Israeli cinema today.</p> \n<p> So far she has acted in three full-length films, with lead roles in two of them. The two films in which she stars do not exactly belong to mainstream Israeli cinema, and mark her out as an actress selected for bold, ambitious projects that at least while they were being made could seem like a crazy gamble on her part. But as a young actress and recent acting school graduate, Pelzig didn’t have much to lose. In Nadav Lapid’s “Policeman” (2011), she played Shira, the young leader of an underground leftist group. Along with cohorts, she kidnaps three billionaires at the wedding of one of the tycoon’s daughters, with the aim of starting a social revolution. Although not a big commercial success, the film was accepted at some important festivals around the world, won a number of prizes and is currently being screened in Europe and the United States.</p> \n<p> In Nony Geffen’s soon to be released “Not in Tel Aviv,” she plays Anna, a high schooler who is abducted by her teacher after he is fired from his job. Together with the teacher (played by the writer-director Geffen himself), she embarks on a journey of self-fulfillment, during which the main character dares to do everything he’s only ever dreamed about. Accompanying him, Anna helps him make his wishes come true while also learning something about life and her own wishes.</p> \n<p> The movie was produced for the minuscule sum of NIS 150,000. Half came from a grant from the Israeli film foundation, and the other half was put up by the director and producer (Itai Tamir). The entire crew, including Pelzig, worked for free. It’s hard to know what will become of the film in Israel if it will become a cult hit or be rejected by audiences but, again, the response from the wider world has been encouraging. Each of Pelzig’s lead roles is very different, and both films challenge the average filmgoer’s viewing habits. But both times her professional choice proved itself, with the two films each winning prizes at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland.</p> \n<p> Pelzig, 24, was born in Jerusalem and has two older sisters. Her mother, Michal, is a psychologist and her father is a sculptor “and a lot of other things.” When she was six, her parents divorced and she moved with her mother and sisters to Tel Aviv. Though at first glance she looks like a typical Tel Aviv girl, she insists that without seeing the house she grew up in in Jerusalem, one can’t really understand who she is. So off we go to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p> The way to her childhood home, where her father Arik still lives, twists and turns past the walls of the Old City, opposite the ancient cemetery on the Mount of Olives. The Mount Zion parking lot is jammed with tour buses bringing visitors to the Western Wall, and behind a red iron gate hides the old palace where the Pelzigs raised their three beautiful princesses.</p> \n<p> Yaara’s grandfather, Perli Pelzig, was a painter and amateur archaeologist who, in the late 1960s, was given a ruined Arab house by the Jerusalem municipality on the seam line a house that once belonged to the prominent Subhi Dajani family of Jerusalem. Along with his third wife, Yanni, he began renovating the house with the aim of making it a place that would combine art and cooking. Yaara’s father joined them in 1970 and decided to build for himself a house beneath the ruins so as “not to take the house of someone else who still hopes to return to it.”</p> \n<p> During the excavations a more ancient house was uncovered, dating back about a thousand years, in which, so the elder Dajani told Yaara’s father, a prostitute once lived. In 1972, Arik Pelzig brought his wife Michal to live with him in the house and their three daughters were born there. Over the years, the excavations continued in fact, they are yet to be completed and the house became filled with archaeological artifacts and artworks by Arik, paintings by Perli and Yanni Pelzig, and with tourists stopping in to get a glimpse of this unexpected palace where the door is always open. On the top floor of the house is a restaurant that serves food with recipes from biblical times. Arik named the house “David’s Harp” and his wish is to turn it into an “all-man’s-land”: a place where all are welcome.</p> \n<p> Wandering around the house that is filled with pottery shards, paintings of women, horses and the Jerusalem hills, mosaics, architectural models made of cardboard, and sculptures of various materials, one wonders how such an unusual environment influenced a little girl growing up here. “To me it’s the most beautiful place in the world,” Pelzig says. “This is where I was shaped, and it’s quite surreal. We didn’t have any connection with the neighbors because we’re surrounded by monasteries and yeshivas. I had a special childhood, an isolated and very creative childhood. All day long we would make things with our hands. There was a ton of clay here. I do love this house, but still I’m very happy we moved to Tel Aviv. Jerusalem is not the place I’d like to be every day, and I think that things would have worked out differently in my life had I continued living here.”</p> \n<p> Despite this unique upbringing amid so many ancient artifacts, Yaara always knew she would pursue acting, not archaeology or art. “I’ve always known that I would go into acting. I guess it started when my sister decided she wanted to be an actress. It’s who I am; I had no choice.”</p> \n<p> Yaara’s older sister, Tamar, is also an actress, but she chose to try her professional luck in New York, where she has lived for the past 10 years. “I’m working on my English, too, to open up more options,” says Yaara. “But I don’t have any concrete plans to move there at the moment.” The eldest Pelzig sister, Tali Ayalon, was a musician when she was younger and is today a graphic designer.</p> \n<p> Pelzig did national (civil) service in Bat Yam, at an institution for at-risk teenage girls. “It’s a house where they’re supposed to come for a limited time, and then return to school. It’s not school exactly, but a good place to be. They’re there from ten in the morning until six in the evening. Most of them can’t sit and learn in this time. I had to be like their friend and provide them with some sort of example, help them develop ambitions in life. It was very tough. When you’re in a place like that, you don’t feel like there’s a result to what you’re doing. There are no big successes. It’s a slow, careful climb, and I wasn’t given any guidance. They test your boundaries all the time, tell you all these awful things, and I didn’t know what to do with it. It was hard, but I got a sense of satisfaction from it. I’m still in touch with one of the girls. Now I can see that there were results. In any case, it seemed more logical for me to do national service rather than the army. I contributed there a lot, which I wouldn’t necessarily have done if I were in the military framework.”</p> \n<p> After her national service, she was accepted at the Nissan Nativ Acting Studio. Her class was the last one to be cast by Nativ himself, who died, in April 2008, when Pelzig was in her first year at the school. “We were the class they experimented on,” Pelzig says. “They had to use other teachers to try to fill the void after he died, and also to decide which plays we would put on in our third year, which was something that he’d always decided. It wasn’t easy being the first class without him. When I got there, my fantasy was shattered. I thought Nissan Nativ was the biggest and best place I would ever get to in my life and it is a good school but there were disappointments too.”</p> \n<p> Her class was considered a strong one, and included Jason Danino Holt, Liel Denir and Yael Eitan. While at the school, Pelzig got her first offer to act in a full-length film: Alon Zingman’s “Dusk.” The role was that of a cancer patient, and required her to have a completely-shaved head. This seemingly simple request almost led her to pass on the part.</p> \n<p> “I had ‘Samson Syndrome,’” she says. “I don’t even know what I was afraid of, but up to then I’d never cut my hair. It’s curly and doesn’t grow so much, so I’d never had a real haircut. I tried to persuade the director to just let me put on a bald wig, but they said it wasn’t an option. Either I went bald or they’d get someone else. For a week I didn’t know what to do. On the one hand, it was a first movie role, an incredible opportunity; but on the other, I was afraid my hair wouldn’t grow back the same and I wouldn’t recognize myself anymore. I consulted with my classmates at Nissan Nativ and in the end I decided to go for it. When I shaved my head, I really grieved for the hair and what it represented, but in retrospect it was an important part of the growing-up process.</p> \n<p> “It was a really big change in my life,” she continues. “I became accessible to more people. I’m dying to do it again, but it’s more complicated now because it could hurt my chances for future roles.”</p> \n<p> Pelzig is soft-spoken, gentle and very discreet, and certainly doesn’t make a big deal of herself. Yet her ambition is unmistakable. The most important thing to her, without a shadow of a doubt, is acting. This is her main passion, it’s what interests her in life right now. On their very first date, she made it clear to Ariel, her boyfriend of the past three years, that he better not think of trying to hurt her career. “Often it’s hard for the other member of the couple to understand certain things, like if I have to kiss someone in a scene. But right away Ariel told me not to worry. He’s very supportive, and for me that’s a real gift.”</p> \n<p> The only disappointment she’s found so far in acting is the discovery that some people treat the profession like an ordinary job. “I never say ‘I’m at work today.’ People ask if I’m working and I say, ‘No, I have a play today,’ or ‘I’m filming today.’ I don’t think I could ever think of this as work. All I want to do is act 24 hours a day. That’s where I blossom. At the moment, I don’t feel like I’m doing enough.”</p> \n<p> In “Policeman,” Pelzig’s Shira is the leader of a group of young revolutionaries planning an anticapitalist protest, but she isn’t going to be satisfied with erecting tents along Rothschild Boulevard. She is ready to go all-out, even to die on the altar of her cause. “Yaara Pelzig’s performance as Shira is terrifying. Like a cobra, she expresses the hypnotic power of extremists over their followers,” one reviewer wrote after “Policeman” was shown at the San Francisco Film Festival. Another critic said she was “as beautiful and unattainable as a figure in a Pre-Raphaelite painting.”</p> \n<p> For the role her first lead in “Policeman,” Pelzig auditioned relatively early in the casting process, but was asked to return again and again for more auditions. “Nadav [Lapid, the writer-director] said he thought straight away that I was right for the part, but he had a hard time accepting that he’d found someone so quickly because he thought it would take a long time. So he made me do more and more auditions, until he was convinced it was okay,” she says.</p> \n<p> “When casting for ‘Policeman’ started, it was clear to casting director Amit Berlowitz and I that the trickiest part to cast would be Shira,” explains Lapid. “Mainly because this is a very complex character a revolutionary who comes from a bourgeois home, a person who combines outward emotional coldness with inner emotional turmoil, passion and despair ... above all something that’s a riddle, that’s enigmatic. We were searching for someone who doesn’t try to be liked, who doesn’t make an effort to touch viewers. Cinema hardly deals with such characters. It was hard to think of an actress who could fill this model. We were bracing ourselves for a long and exhausting audition process, and then Yaara came into the room and, in a minute, it was obvious that she was the one and that the role was hers. I think what captured me so instantly, aside from her superb acting, was her matter-of-fact approach. Like the character she had to play, she didn’t try to be liked or curry favor. But at the same time there was no irony or self-defensive posturing. There was something very direct about her, something that is simple and profound all at once. Since then, I’ve come to see that Yaara is really like this. Seemingly direct and straightforward, but she also has this enigmatic depth to her.”</p> \n<p> Asked about Pelzig’s ability as an actress, Lapid raves. “Working with Yaara is a tremendous experience for any director. She has a rare musicality and perfect pitch. And a very deep understanding, down to the slightest nuances. Let’s say you tell her: ‘I want to see an inner trembling, something trembling inside that will never come out, a vibration that’s trapped between the stomach and the neck.’ I can say that, but it’s hard for me to know just how it will look. And then you sit down behind the monitor and say ‘Action!’ And you then see exactly what an inner trembling that never bursts out but stays trapped between the stomach and the neck looks like. There are hardly any bad takes. Her precision is amazing.”</p> \n<p> Working on the role required Pelzig to change in more than one sense since Lapid insisted that she avoid getting a suntan and also stop smiling. “For a few months before filming began, a group of us participated in demonstrations. We held a meeting once a week, as if we were really planning a revolution,” Pelzig relates. “The director’s instructon was that, at all of these meetings, I wasn’t Yaara, I was Shira. It was very challenging, because these were friends of mine, people I knew from before the movie came about.”</p> \n<p> Pelzig says that working on “Polceman” changed her, as did some of the responses she was exposed to in different parts of the world. “I went to a festival in New York and to a Jewish film festival in Brazil. In Brazil I was all alone. I took on the responsibility of representing the film, and it gave me confidence. I was proud of myself, I spoke clearly. People in the Jewish community were very angry about the film, because it didn’t provide good public relations for Israel, but I gave good answers, and the audience applauded. I never expected to find so much confidence. I became Shira. With each movie, I grow a little.”</p> \n<p> And did it also affect your political awareness?</p> \n<p> “The work on the film spilled over into my life. I went to Bil’in for the first time. I didn’t understand the issue the way I do now. Since then, I’ve become much more involved. The timing, too, just before the social protest, was very powerful.”</p> \n<p> But the revolutionaries in the film are rather ludicrous in the end, aren’t they?</p> \n<p> “And we’re not? We get laughed at too, we’re ridiculous too. What’s really changed since the protest? I agree quite a lot with the nihilism of the movie. It’s disheartening that there’s no hope. But that’s how it is. I don’t think that if we look ridiculous we need to stop. Even if you feel there’s no hope, you have to keep going, because maybe a few years from now we’ll look back and say, ‘Okay, we did something.’ In the movie ‘Not in Tel Aviv,’ there’s also a break with conventions, both in terms of how the movie looks and the things that the hero does; there’s a breaking of boundaries. We have a generation that is choosing life anew. I think it’s really the start of it now. Not everything has to be the way it has been up to now. We don’t need to be part of a couple all our lives; we don’t need to do Brit Milah. People are starting to think for themselves about what they need to do. That’s what I took with me from these films.”</p> \n<p> So these movies basically express hope?</p> \n<p> “It’s a statement of hope that could also lead to chaos, but it’s positive.”</p> \n<p> In contrast to the numerous auditions she went through to land the lead in “Policeman,” she was cast instantly for Nony +Geffen’s “Not in Tel Aviv.” However, she still had to then go through an arduous process of “matching auditions” with other actors. “I met Nony at another audition that he took part in as an actor. It was very quick, getting the part in his film, but then he did lots of experiments. He also made Romi Aboulafia, who’s also in the movie, do a lot of auditions. It was important to him that the relationship among the three of us work, that we should click.”</p> \n<p> Working on this film was a whole new experience, too, she says. “With ‘Policeman,’ everything was very precise and clear, but here I dealt with each scene separately. The script wasn’t clear from the outset, and I didn’t know what was going to happen. Everything was surprising. So I had to go step-by-step, and then I got into Anna’s plotline and her way of thinking. What motivates her is the will to live. She comes from a family of women who are disturbed, extreme and restricting. I think she wants to escape from there, to live, to break boundaries. And she also wants love, of course. I don’t see a separation between myself and what I’m acting. Even if it’s the farthest thing from me. As soon as I understand the logic of the character, then it’s me. I make the same choices as the character.”</p> \n<p> Geffen says he selected Pelzig for the part because he felt she really understood Anna. “Because the character is a teenager and Yaara is a little bit older than that, she brought a little more experience and humor and understanding to the role. She’s excellent at acting with partners. When she grasps a scene, she grasps the complexity of the two people together and not just of each one as an individual actor. It’s rare for someone so young to have so much focus and insight. It’s something I hadn’t thought of before. She brought to her character an accepting side that understands the teacher and doesn’t just ask, ‘What the hell does he want from me?’</p> \n<p> “I knew generally how I wanted the character to look,” Geffen continues. “I wanted a Lolita-type, something a little seductive but also innocent. Yaara has large, open eyes that want to take in the whole world, and she has sensual lips so her face already had that combination of innocence and seduction. I named the character Anna after Anna Karina, [Jean-Luc] Godard’s legendary actress. She, too, had big eyes and a special seductiveness.”</p> \n<p> The first and only time that Pelzig has seen the movie was at the Locarno Film Festival last month, along with a thousand other people. “In Locarno the audience was laughing hysterically,” she recalls. “There were a lot of things during the filming that we didn’t totally get, we didn’t know where it was going. But when I saw the movie, I saw that the sequence was very logical and I asked myself, ‘If Nony knew everything, why didn’t he tell us?’ It was also the first time I felt that maybe I could also be a comic actress. I’ve always felt that comedy was hard for me, but suddenly I felt that maybe it was possible. So now I’m opening up all options.”</p> \n<p> Geffen has an interesting observation about what makes Pelzig so intriguing and unpredictable compared to many of her contemporaries. “People my age didn’t grow up with this thought of, What does our life look like from the outside and how it should look? As something that gets into your daily routine. Yaara’s generation is totally into this. I’m referring to the sort of self-PR that happens on Facebook, for example. And I think that Yaara is straddling this line in which she is part of the Facebook generation, but also part of the generation that’s still searching for romance, that cares about discretion. I think there’s a dissonance in her as to which generation she is a part of and where she belongs.”</p> \n<p> Aside from movies and television (Pelzig sometimes acts in teen TV shows, like “Alifim,” and will soon appear in a series by Haim Buzaglo), she is also not giving up on theater. “As a teenager I always thought that I loved theater the most, but then I discovered cinema. For now, asking me to choose between them would be like asking who do you love more mom or dad.”</p> \n<p> She began her stage career outside of Nissan Nativ in the 2011 Habima production of Stella Feehily’s “Monogamy,” directed by Rami Heuberger. “I went there because there was an opportunity,” she says. “They were looking for a girl who knew how to play guitar, and my agent said that I would learn. I learned three chords, one song, and I came with that to the audition and told them that I’d learned it specially. They didn’t believe me, and I got the part. For the play I learned a few more songs, and all of a sudden I found I knew a whole bunch of chords and songs and could play the guitar. I’m proud of myself because I worked really hard on it. It was worth it. I played the teenage daughter of Rami Heuberger and Osnat Fishman. The family is falling apart and this girl is essentially the responsible adult, even though she is also the most rebellious. I really enjoyed the role and it also got me into the theater world.”</p> \n<p> Now she’s back at Habima again, in the production “If There is a Heaven” (aka “Beaufort”), based on the book by Ron Leshem. “I play a character who’s a kind of fantasy,” she says.</p> \n<p> At this stage in your career, do you basically take any part that’s offered to you?</p> \n<p> Pelzig smiles and, as usual, answers carefully. “I feel that the time has come for me to start being selective about roles, and not to do everything that’s offered to me. Suddenly I see the implications that all kinds of things can have. I was offered the chance to host events or television programs; I’m not sure I’ll do that.”</p> \n<p> Michael Aloni, who acted in “Infiltration” and “Policeman,” hosted “The Voice Israel.”</p> \n<p> “At the point Michael Aloni is at now, everyone knows he’s an amazing actor, so he can allow himself to be the presenter of ‘The Voice.’ But I’m not there yet. I’ve done much less. I’m only on the way there. It’s possible that if I do take a hosting gig, I won’t be offered more roles like Shira in ‘Policeman.’”</p> \n<p> Do you feel secure in your life here?</p> \n<p> “No. In terms of acting, it’s a constant chase after the next role. And in terms of Israel, too what will happen? I have no idea what will happen. But something still holds us here. There’s a connection. It may be possible to imagine a better life somewhere else, but I don’t see myself living anywhere else. I don’t see myself creating a whole new world for myself somewhere else. I feel like I’m in a constant state of ping-pong between despair and hope. You don’t give up, but meanwhile the blows keep coming. You keep hoping, and then the blow comes.” &nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Haaretz columnist Sayed Kashua asks Israeli Jews to imagine a situation in which they were the weak and conquered party. “Sometimes I wonder whether, if the Palestinians were capable of invading homes in Israel, of sending in soldiers to wrest people out of their beds in front of their families … what would things look like then? Who would behave a little more humanely in that case?” </p> \n<p>That’s actually a very important, if hypothetical question. But the one who asks it has to be prepared to hear an honest answer. Kashua apparently believes that Israeli Jews’ apathy to Palestinian suffering stems from the fact that they never ask themselves what would happen if the roles were reversed. But I think just the opposite is true: This apathy is to a great extent the result of dwelling on this question too much. Because the answer the Jewish public gives itself when it imagines a military defeat and Arab conquest is that in such a case there will no longer be two peoples in this land.</p> \n<p>Even among those who vehemently oppose and reject the Israeli occupation, only a few have any illusions regarding what an Arab occupation would be like. For this reason there is no point in asking what a mass house-to-house search would look like in the event three Palestinian teenagers had been kidnapped by a Jewish underground.</p> \n<p>The prevailing assumption is that if Israel would be defeated and conquered, the conquest would not lead to the establishment of a lengthy occupation regime, but to what is sung in the Hebrew video clip that recently appeared on the website of Hamas’ military wing: “Two parts, one will be returned/to its land of origin, if only it so desires/and the fool/who is stubborn/is fated/to end up beneath the dust.” The only question is what the proportion will be between the two parts.</p> \n<p>And when an Israeli Jew today ponders the internal disputes raging in the surrounding Arab world – and face it, there is no Israeli citizen, Jew or Arab, who doesn’t do this – there is no reason for him to be optimistic. We have to remember that in all those disputes, neither side sees the other as a foreign implant in the region or a colonialist invader. The situation here is different.</p> \n<p>Moreover, when a Jewish Israeli remembers what the Hamas takeover of Gaza looked like – even though in regional terms it was exemplary in its moderation – there’s no reason for optimism, either. If the Israeli right would defeat the Israeli left in a civil war and the leftists would flee for their lives to Gaza the way Fatah people fled to Israel, maybe then there would be a place to seriously ask “who would act in a more humane manner.”</p> \n<p>Is there in the entire Middle East an Arab fighter who wouldn’t prefer, if he could choose, to fall into the hands of the Israelis rather than into the hands of a rival Arab faction? In any case, that’s what the Fatah fighters of Gaza did, as well as the Fatah men in Jordan during Black September over 40 years ago. It’s hard to believe that this is in any way news to Kashua, who has been writing many honest, pointed, and courageous things about the Arab world. It’s too bad that just when he is inviting the Jews to display honesty and courage, those traits seemed to have abandoned him.</p> \n<p>None of this in any way contravenes the need to end the occupation and divide the land between the two peoples. That’s the just and proper thing to do, and is in Israel’s ultimate interest. Because if Israel ends up defeated in this conflict, it’s safe to assume that it won’t be a military defeat, but a diplomatic defeat that will result in the establishment of one state between the river and the sea. Such a state won’t be Israel. What’s ironic is that those who seek to impose this defeat on Israel call themselves the “national camp.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>After one Shabbat dinner this semester, a few of us gathered in Hillel’s common area for the traditional Friday night activity of singing zemirot&nbsp;—Jewish songs composed in Hebrew. Out of the blue, a visiting prospective student began to intone a lyrical Yiddish zemirah. Nobody was familiar with it, but we cut our teeth on it with captivated enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I’ve been in Jewish schools my entire life, and not once have I ever heard Yiddish used for anything but expressive slang. Not to kvetch about it, but this seems like a shame because just 70 or so years ago it was the dominant language of American-Jewry. At Brown, one of my friends told me he picked up some limited Yiddish during a flight of fancy and short-term romance with the language. He even proved it to me by deciphering a short headline in the Yiddish version of The Forward. That was the most Yiddish I had heard from anyone born after the Silent Generation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It seems like it would be worthwhile for me to know at least a bissel of Yiddish, especially when some precincts of American Jewry still proudly conduct their lives almost exclusively in the Eastern European tongue. Most prominent among them is the growing Hasidic community, whose members use Yiddish as a native tongue. &nbsp; Hebrew is taught in Jewish day schools because it is the language of modern Israel and Jewish scholarship. In the Jewish state, Yiddish was forgotten because it is not common to all Jews (Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews don’t speak Yiddish) and was viewed as a relic of Diaspora life—not relevant to the Zionist future. &nbsp;Indeed, Ben-Gurion actively sought to stamp it out and replace it with Hebrew. In the United States, Jews were lost from their Yiddish roots as successive generations shed the non-Anglo idiosyncrasies of the old world. Hebrew’s evolutionary advantage over Yiddish was presumably that it is the language of liturgy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But while Hebrew has become a language that is practical for young Jews to learn – both for understanding prayer and conversing in the modern Jewish state – Yiddish offers a powerful way to celebrate and connect to Jewish history. Yiddish connects people to their grandparents and to the flourishing Ashkenazi-Jewish culture that the United States was home to decades ago, as well as the bustling Jewish life of pre-Holocaust Europe.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There is no better way to rekindle awareness of American-Jewish culture than to rediscover the expressive language that sustained it. How many younger Jews are aware of the Singer brothers or &quot;The Brothers Ashkenazi,&quot; a Yiddish novel that once made it into the New York Times bestseller list? How many older Jews?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some scoff that Yiddish is a dying language and therefore not worth learning. Yet, it has in fact been making a remarkable comeback in the past few years. December was an auspicious month. Seth Rogovoy at The Forward pointed out ten different ways in 2015 that Yiddish made an appearance in American life. New York City recently inaugurated the festival Yiddish New York. And the National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene managed to secure a permanent home at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Battery Park.</p> \n<p>Yiddish studies programs are also cropping up throughout North America—at Columbia, Rutgers, UCLA, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the University of Toronto, for example. With these universities recognizing the value in teaching Yiddish in modern times, it makes sense that our Jewish schools would do the same. It need not be taught as frequently as Hebrew – Yiddish is, after all, for cultural edification, while Hebrew is for practical life – but with a couple of Yiddish classes being incorporated into elementary school curriculums, it could enhance the Jewish learning of the young members of our tribe.</p> \n<p>As the American-Jewish community becomes more and more American and less and less Jewish, it is more important than ever to latch onto those cultural peculiarities that offer some basis for togetherness. Indeed, it couldn't hurt to teach our community's children – and remind ourselves, the adults – of those aspects of Jewish life that existed before the State of Israel.</p> \n<p>In a short essay from 2013, Jordan Kutzik, then a fellow at the Yiddish Book Center, wrote, “Despite having a bar mitzvah, I never felt particularly Jewish or connected to the religion I was, in short, at risk of becoming the wicked son of the Passover Seder. The son who felt he understood his obligations but felt no duty to fulfill them or even to justify his lack of participation in the ceremonies. Then I learned Yiddish.” Kutzik found that Yiddish itself was Jewish education. Yiddish phrases draw inspiration from Jewish religious practices. “Learning Yiddish was, for me, a better course in Jewish history, culture, philosophy and, yes, religion, than I would have ever received in most Jewish day schools.”</p> \n<p>Jared Samilow is a student at Brown University and a member of Brown Students for Israel. He is a graduate of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs' fellowship program in Israel-Arab studies and of Yeshivat Eretz HaTzvi, Jerusalem.</p>",

        "text":["<p> The catalyst for the violent protests that brought thousands of Ethiopian Israelis out to the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv this week was a video that went viral — by now, around the world. The clip showed two policemen beating a young Ethiopian Israeli soldier who did not promptly obey their order to move away from an area they were clearing.</p> \n<p> It was not an isolated incident, though. Israelis of Ethiopian descent have been complaining for years about “excess policing” — a term they use to define law-enforcement officials’ tendency to harass them, detain them and put them behind bars simply because they don’t have white skin.</p> \n<p> It’s hardly coincidental, they say, that young Ethiopian men are overrepresented in Israeli prisons — an estimated one-third of the 200 or so teens in Israel’s juvenile prison are of Ethiopian descent.</p> \n<p> But it doesn’t account for all the pent-up anger that is suddenly boiling over. Rather, it should be seen as the latest in a string of indignities that Ethiopian Jews say they have been forced to suffer since arriving in the country three decades ago.</p> \n<p> The initial slap in the face came soon after Operation Moses, the first major wave of immigration, which brought roughly 7,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in 1984 and 1985. Although the Chief Rabbinate recognized them as Jews, it insisted that they undergo a symbolic immersion ceremony upon arriving in the country to put to rest any doubts about their Jewishness. Flabbergasted that they were the only community to be singled out for this ritual, many of the new immigrants took to the streets in protest.</p> \n<p> Ethiopian Israelis have often complained that they are made to feel like second-class Jews. The Falashmura, descendants of Ethiopian Jews who were forced to convert to Christianity and began arriving in Israel about 20 years ago, have been required to undergo actual conversion in Israel — not only the immersion ritual — to be eligible for citizenship.</p> \n<p> Questions have been raised not only about their Jewish credentials. About 20 years ago, it was revealed that Israeli hospitals were secretly discarding blood donations from Ethiopian immigrants out of fear they were HIV carriers. The disclosures sparked a public outcry, with community leaders reading this as yet another sign of racial discrimination.</p> \n<p> Adding to their grievances were reports several years ago that Israeli health officials had for many years actively encouraged Ethiopian woman to take long-term birth control injections. This happened in a country that values few things more than childbearing. Interviewed on Israeli television, several women testified in 2013 that they had been coerced into taking the injections while still in transit camps in Ethiopia.</p> \n<p> Socioeconomic gaps</p> \n<p> An estimated 126,000 Jews of Ethiopian descent live in Israel today, accounting for 2 percent of the population. After Operation Moses, the next big immigration wave came in 1991, when Israel airlifted more than 14,000 Ethiopian Jews to the country in a covert 36-hour operation that came to be known as Operation Solomon. This second operation overlapped with the huge immigration wave just getting under way from what was still the Soviet Union.</p> \n<p> The Soviet immigrants came in much larger numbers and from a very different culture. But that was not all that set them apart. Unlike the Ethiopian immigrants, the Russian-speakers integrated remarkably well into Israeli society, advancing quickly to leadership positions in all spheres of life.</p> \n<p> The latest Joint Distribution Committee report, published in 2012 by the Brookdale Institute in Jerusalem, shows that the Ethiopian Israeli community continues to lag behind in almost all socioeconomic indicators, although gaps have been narrowing in certain areas.</p> \n<p> The data show that Ethiopian Israelis are more likely to drop out of high school and less likely to attend university than Jews overall. They are less likely to be employed, and when they do work, they earn considerably less than their peers. Poverty rates are also dramatically higher among the Ethiopians. Although they enlist in the army in higher percentage than other Israelis, their early discharge rate is also considerably above average.</p> \n<p> When the Ethiopians first began arriving in Israel, they were overwhelmingly pushed into state religious schools and encouraged to embrace strict Orthodoxy.</p> \n<p> But if the Brookdale report is any indication, the new generation is showing signs of rebellion. Among Israeli-born Ethiopians, the report shows, just over 40 percent attend state religious schools. This is much higher than the 24 percent for the Jewish population overall, but well below the 76 percent for the previous generation of Ethiopians born in Africa.</p> \n<p> “In contrast to the past, many Ethiopian Israelis understand that they can choose where they want to go to school, and they are not afraid anymore to choose nonreligious schools,” says Shula Mola, chairwoman of the board of the Israel Association for Ethiopian Jews.</p> \n<p> This new generation of nonconformist Ethiopians was heavily represented at Sunday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv. Plainly defying the religious laws of modesty that are widely accepted in the community, many of the young women sported snug-fitting jeans and very short skirts.</p> \n<p> And there were also many bareheaded young men among the protesters, more than a few sporting dreadlocks. They seemed to characterize a new generation of outspoken hipster Ethiopians no longer wanting to be told what to wear and how to behave.</p> \n<p> “These are kids who were born here, who have been trying their entire lives to fit in,” says Mola, who spent most of the night with them at the demonstration. “But they now understand that they’re not the same. They feel they are Israeli, but Israelis with a big problem.”</p>",

        "text":["<p> Many participants in Israel’s social protest in the summer of 2011 offered a similar viewpoint in the wake of the recent demonstrations by Israel’s Ethiopian community: If the earlier protest had been conducted in the same way, with violence and an eruption of genuine fury – it would not have evaporated or been channeled into the twisted decision to vote for Yair Lapid.</p> \n<p> But the story here is not the violence. The story is the infuriating decision by the vast majority of the 2011 demonstrators to stay home, in front of the television, when Ethiopian Israelis made their way to Rabin Square.</p> \n<p> This division between members of the middle class and the disadvantaged groups in our society is what prevented the realization of the aspirations of the summer of 2011, and it will also prevent the possibility of creating a genuine change in the country’s attitude toward Ethiopian Israelis.</p> \n<p> Moreover, like participants at many protest events, Ethiopian-Israeli protesters did not formulate clear demands – the leading slogan at their demonstrations was “A violent policeman should be inside [prison].” But the attitude toward Ethiopian Israelis on the part of some policemen – a good number of whom are in the same boat as Israelis of Ethiopian descent in terms of social class – is only the symptom.</p> \n<p> What Ethiopian Israelis really want is to become integrated. To be part of the mainstream. Meanwhile, they are supported only by other outcasts. Joint Arab List leader MK Ayman Odeh did well to join their protest. By so doing, he is continuing to carve out his unique path: He maintains that Israeli Arabs are part of the struggle of all weaker elements in society, without making distinctions on the basis of religion.</p> \n<p> But in the present instance Odeh’s support won’t help, since the revolution for which he hopes is still a utopian dream. On the contrary: The fact that support for Ethiopian Israelis was offered by Odeh of all people – rather than by the broad base of summer 2011 protesters – only illustrates the severity of the Ethiopians’ predicament.</p> \n<p> But Ethiopian Israelis will not be the only losers as a result of the alienation toward them. Following the election last month, the left and center complained about the massive support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and wondered how to explain the disconnect from the so-called “ordinary people” of Israel. And now, when such people are reaching out and arriving in the very heart of Tel Aviv – very few are reaching out in return.</p> \n<p> The vacuum that was created was filled by extremist organizations, including members of Lehava (a racist, anti-assimilation group) and anarchists. It’s impossible to deny some of them their desire to help the disadvantaged. However, the connection between extremist left- and right-wing organizations and the present protest is liable to cause Ethiopian Israelis damage similar to that caused decades ago by the Black Panthers to the plight of Mizrahim (Jews originating in North Africa and the Middle East).</p> \n<p> The Panthers had justified reasons for fighting on behalf of the Mizrahim. But their battle failed, and even contributed to rejection of that community’s struggle in general, because the critical mass of Mizrahim didn’t want a revolution against the establishment – they wanted integration. Because of the activities of the Panthers, the Mizrahi struggle acquired an extremist image, and in retrospect their ideas contributed more to the theoretical discussion of the issue than to practical solutions.</p> \n<p> The story of Ethiopian Israelis is complicated. Basically, it embodies the enlightened aspects of Zionism and Judaism, because bringing these people to Israel reflects the ability of Zionism to ignore – at least when it comes to Jews – differences of race and color. While most European countries often prefer to open their gates to “strong” populations, the moral dimension embedded in the Law of Return turns Israel into a country of refuge for Jews, without making distinctions between them.</p> \n<p> But the immigrant-absorption process has once again proved the extent to which human beings are not as good as the ideas they support. Many groups can be blamed for the distress of Ethiopian Israelis, but true equality will not be brought about by the establishment alone. In order to achieve it the tens of thousands who demanded social justice must join Ethiopian Israelis in the next demonstration. Otherwise the only change in Israeli society will be in the degree of violence in the coming protests.</p>",

They were not becoming rich, nor were they adopting the ways of the sophisticated, cosmopolitan Jerusalemites. This socio-economic divide would play a decisive role in the following events.</p> \n<p>The rise of Antiochus IV</p> \n<p>In 175 BCE, Antiochus IV Epiphanes ascended to the throne of the Seleucid Empire, which at that point controlled Judea.</p> \n<p>Wanting to outdo his father and capture Egypt, and unite the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms into one superpower, Antiochus needed money. When a faction of Judean priests offered to pay him to replace the High Priest Onias III with his younger brother Jason, he took the money. Why not?</p> \n<p>But this created a dangerous precedent. Three years later, another rich priest, Menelaus, offered even more money and was appointed high priest by Antiochus. Jason went into exile.</p> \n<p>Menelaus however was not from the line of high priests and his appointment upset the conservative Judeans. Worse, he took treasures from the Temple to pay Antiochus, which was sacrilege – and on top of all that, he was a radical Hellenizer. His appointment was not popular, and had to be enforced by force.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile in Antioch, Antiochus decided it was time to make history. He led his army to Egypt to achieve what his father had not. Upon rumors of his death in battle there, civil war erupted among the Jews in Jerusalem as Jason reappeared from exile, and led a popular revolt against Menelaus.</p> \n<p>Reign of terror</p> \n<p>But Antiochus was not dead. He had been humiliated by the Romans and forced out of Egypt. Yet while retreating, he heard of the struggle in Jerusalem - and reinstated Menelaus.</p> \n<p>Once back in power, Menelaus led a reign of terror and set out to Hellenize the Jews. A statue of Zeus was placed in the Holy of Holies, among other violations of Jewish law.</p> \n<p>Many pious Jews resisted Menelaus' measures, some by martyrdom, others by escaping into the wilderness, and still others by active revolt.</p> \n<p>Most prominent of these rebels was the group led by Mattathias of Modiin and his five sons – of whom Judas Maccabeus proved to be the most able and drew the rest of the Jewish rebels into his camp.</p> \n<p>Judas and his band of rebels staged guerrilla warfare against Hellenized Jews; Menelaus in response summoned the Greek armies from neighboring Seleucid provinces.</p> \n<p>Judas crushes the Greeks</p> \n<p>The first army to arrive, from Samaria in the north, was led by Apollonius. Judas was tipped off, and crushed the small army on the road to Jerusalem. He was to take Apollonius’ sword and use it until his death.</p> \n<p>Next came a larger force, led by Seron, from Palestine in the west. Once again Judas ambushed them, and 800 enemy soldiers were killed.</p> \n<p>Alarmed, the Seleucids dispatched a real army, from Antioch, led by two generals, Nicanor and Gorgias. But once again, Judas proved his military prowess: he routed the army and seized its weapons.</p> \n<p>Even after this defeat, the Seleucid army remained bigger and badder than the small rebel force. There was real danger that it would press on and crush the rebellion.</p> \n<p>But at this point, the rebels caught a lucky break. In 167 BCE, King Mithridates I of Parthia attacked the Seleucid Empire and captured the city of Herat, in modern-day Afghanistan. Antiochus had to concentrate his forces on the Parthians.</p> \n<p>With the Seleucid army thus preoccupied, the rebels captured Jerusalem in 164 BCE, though the Akra Fortress overlooking the Temple Mount remained loyal to Antioch (within it, Assyrian soldiers and Hellenized Jews would remain steadfast).</p> \n<p>The Temple was rededicated and the eight-day holiday of Hanukkah was created, modeled on the eight-day holiday of Sukkot. The story of the miraculous oil lasting eight days&nbsp;is apocryphal: It would only appear centuries later in the Talmud (Shabbat 21b).</p> \n<p>Jerusalem under siege</p> \n<p>With his power base in Jerusalem firmly established, Judas began attacking gentile cities around Judea, though the purpose seems to have been not subjugation, but spoils. Then he returned to Jerusalem and laid siege to the Akra.</p> \n<p>By this time, following Antiochus' death in Parthia in 164 BC, the Seleucid Empire was ruled by Lysias, regent for the child King Antiochus V Eupator. Lysias set out to destroy Jerusalem and crush the Maccabean revolt once and for all.</p> \n<p>After beating Judas in battle south of Bethlehem, Lysias laid siege to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>The rebel Jews' situation was desperate. They lacked the supplies to withstand a lengthy siege, not least because that year was a shmita year.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Once again, luck intervened. Philip, one of Antiochus' generals, revolted and set out to storm the capital, Antioch. Anxious to return to the capital, Lysias reached terms with the Jerusalemites. Judea was restored to its former semi-autonomous state and Menelaus was replaced as High Priest by Alcimus, a moderate.</p> \n<p>But as soon as Lysias left, fighting broke out again between Judas’ rebels and the moderates who supported Alcimus. An army led by the Seleucid general Nicanor was dispatched to aid the moderates. In 161 BCE, Judas beat Nicanor’s army in the Battle of Adasa and Nicanor was killed.</p> \n<p>That same year, after defeating Philip, Lysias and Antiochus were killed by Antiochus’ cousin Demetrius I Soter, who ascended to the Seleucid throne. He dispatched another army, led by the general Bacchides.</p> \n<p>They faced off in the Battle of Elasa in 160 BCE. Judas' band was no match for that 20,000-strong army. The Jews were crushed and Judas was killed.</p> \n<p>Thus the revolt ended in tragedy. But some years later, changes in the geopolitical landscape would lead to Judas’ youngest brother Jonathan Apphus ascending to the high priesthood, and to the establishment of the Hasmonean Dynasty that would rule an independent Judea from 140 to 37 BCE.</p> \n<p>This article was originally published in December of 2014</p>",
