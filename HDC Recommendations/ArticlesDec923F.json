        "text":["<p>The Palestinian man who seriously wounded an Israeli soldier during a confrontation at a military post in the West Bank has turned himself in and is being interrogated by the Shin Bet, the Israeli army said on Saturday.</p> \n<p>Palestinian sources named the man Mohammed al-Halabi, a 19-year-old Ramallah resident. He turned himself in following heavy pressure on his relatives and threats to his life should he not do so.</p> \n<p>According to the army, a struggle ensued between the soldier and the Palestinian after the latter crossed the West Bank barrier, reached the outpost and attacked the soldier with a rock and a knife on Friday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After stabbing the soldier and hitting him with a rock, the Palestinian fled the scene and the soldier was evacuated to Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. According to the hospital, the soldier underwent surgery and his condition is moderate.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, several hundreds of right-wing activists congregated on Saturday evening in Tel Aviv for a demonstration in memory of&nbsp;Kim Yehezkel-Levengrond and Ziv Hajbi, who were killed in a shooting attack in the Barkan industrial park, west of Ariel,&nbsp;in October.</p> \n<p>Joined by family members of the two killed, protestors called for a large-scale military operation in retribution for recent attacks. One of the participants, Vladimir&nbsp;Lubarsky, father of&nbsp;Israeli special forces sergeant who was killed during a May raid in El Amari refugee camp in Ramallah by a Palestinian whose family home was demolished on Friday night, said that &quot;Israel must act forcefully to defeat terrorisom.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Israeli army said it operated in Ramallah on Thursday night as the manhunt continues for the shooters responsible for&nbsp;a deadly drive-by attack earlier that day in which two Israeli soldiers were killed and another two were wounded, and in which the perpetrator stole a soldiers' weapon before fleeing.</p> \n<p>The male soldier, who suffered severe head trauma and went through complex surgery, is in a coma in life-threatening condition. The condition of the wounded woman, Shira Sabag, improved on Friday.</p> \n<p>Israel Defense Forces spokesman,&nbsp;Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, said&nbsp;soldiers were canvassing the area in search of several assailants as well as setting up checkpoints, and that the army has sealed off roads leading Ramallah.</p> \n<p>The IDF is focusing mostly on Ramallah in its search efforts. An abandoned vehicle has been located and the military is inspecting whether it was used by the shooters.</p> \n<p>In addition, the Shin Bet security service is using its field agents and technological tools in its investigation in order to trace the shooters' tracks and their escape route.</p> \n<p>The deaths extend a violent week that began with a shooting outside a West Bank settlement on Sunday, resulting in the death of a baby who was delivered prematurely after the attack, and continued with the killing of two Palestinians wanted in that and another attack on Israelis in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>The military's West Bank Division is currently better staffed than usual due to the security situation, with 14 battalions in the West Bank alongside special units such as Duvdevan, border police's Arab-speaking undercover counterterror unit and the police's special anti-terror unit that has been working in the area in the past few days.</p> \n<p>Defense officials believe the recent attacks were committed by local cells possibly linked to Hamas. One senior official, responding to criticism voiced by former officials, stated that there had been no intelligence failure – but the attacks may place pressure on the military and Shin Bet security services to reassess methods of interpreting intelligence information.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The United States says it has sanctioned three people over their roles in South Sudan's civil war, including a retired Israeli major general, Israel Ziv.</p> \n<p>In a statement Friday, the U.S. Treasury said Ziv and South Sudanese businessman Obac William Olawo led entities whose efforts extended the conflict, while South Sudanese official Gregory Vasili took part in &quot;actions that have undermined peace, stability and security.&quot; Ziv has denied any wrongdoing.</p> \n<p>&quot;Ziv used an agricultural company that was nominally present in South Sudan to carry out agricultural and housing projects for the government of South Sudan as a cover for the sale of approximately $150 million worth of weapons to the government, including rifles, grenade launchers and shoulder-fired rockets,&quot; the Treasury said.</p> \n<p>&quot;Ziv has been paid through the oil industry and has had close collaboration with a major multinational oil firm,&quot; the Treasury added. &quot;While Ziv maintained the loyalty of senior government of South Sudan officials through bribery and promises of security support, he has also reportedly planned to organize attacks by mercenaries on South Sudanese oil fields and infrastructure, in an effort to create a problem that only his company and affiliates could solve.&quot;</p> \n<p>The United States also designated three entities in Israel that are owned or controlled by Ziv: Global N.T.M. Ltd., Global Law Enforcement and Security Ltd., and Global IZ Group Ltd.</p> \n<p>According to two diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks in 2011, the U.S. administration moved aggressively to curb activities by Ziv in Latin America between 2008 and 2010, threatening to cut ties with governments if they hired the services of Ziv’s security company Global CST. &nbsp; Global CST, a provider of security consulting and military training to security forces in Latin America and Africa, also made a pitch for civilian projects.</p> \n<p>According to the State Department cables released by WikiLeaks, U.S. diplomats reported on Ziv’s negotiations with the governments of Colombia, Peru and Panama, and even tried to undermine, sometimes successfully, dealings with Global CST. The cables appear to show that the hostility was prompted not only by financial interests but by concerns that Ziv’s activities posed a security risk to the United States.</p> \n<p>On Friday, the Treasury said Washington was targeting people who have &quot;provided soldiers, armored vehicles and weapons used to fuel the conflict,&quot; adding that the United States would continue to target those who &quot;profit off the misery and suffering of the South Sudanese people.&quot;</p> \n<p>The civil war has killed nearly 400,000 people in five years. There was no immediate response from South Sudan's government, which has bristled at rising U.S. criticism and pressure, including a threat to withdraw aid.</p> \n<p>Watchdog group The Sentry quickly praised the U.S. move. &quot;Today's sanctions clearly show the intersection between corruption and armed conflict in South Sudan,&quot; Joshua White, the group's director of policy and analysis, said in a statement. &quot;We need more of these designations to chip away at the violent kleptocracy.&quot;</p> \n<p>Ziv set up Global CST in 2006 after retiring as head of operations at Israel's General Staff. The company trained the Georgian army in the middle of the past decade, before the war with Russia prompted Israel to cut part of the military aid to Georgia.</p> \n<p>It was speculated that Global CST personnel helped in the release of FARC hostage and former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, and Ziv has signed a contract with the Colombian government to plan strategy against the underground.</p> \n<p>The company has also trained counterterrorism units in Togo, Guinea, Gabon and Nigeria, and won a $10 million contract to train the presidential guard of Moussa Dadis Camara, the leader of a short-lived coup in Guinea.</p> \n<p>Ziv &quot;was surprised and shocked&quot; to learn of the allegations, according to a statement on his behalf made on Saturday. &quot;These allegations are baseless.&quot; Ziv relayed that in recent years he has been involved in extensive agricultural projects in South Sudan, &quot;which generate income and food security for millions of residents of this miserable, conflict-ridden country.&quot;</p> \n<p>The statement went on to say that Ziv &quot;is a law-abiding person, who will cooperate with any international agency seeking to look into his activities in South Sudan with full transparency and no reservations. The decision of the [Treasury] stems from a grave error that has not even been examined, and Mr. Ziv is already holding contacts with it in an effort to rectify the error.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>“It was astonishing to hear the baron reciting this eulogy of manual labor – or rather not so astonishing, since the sacred character of manual labor is a specifically bourgeois invention.”</p> \n<p>– Henri de Montherlant, “The Bachelors”</p> \n<p>Progress, as everyone knows, is an excellent thing. And we, to our good fortune, live in a period of obvious progress. Rapid and dynamic, our progress extends its arms into diverse realms and gives them a good shaking up. The equipment surrounding us has greatly improved and become more efficient and convenient; impressive development has occurred in the realm of public mental life. Things are moving. The “MeToo” campaign can perhaps serve as a timely, agreed-upon example of that.</p> \n<p>One area, perhaps the most important, however, remains untouched by progress, undeveloped, forgotten back in the feudal era. The core agreement between people and society hasn’t changed for hundreds of years: Give the best of your time and energy, receive in return basic means of existence. That was and remains the arrangement.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, the abolition of work is apparently the hardest sell among the various agendas making the rounds internationally. Whether the listener is a conservative or a liberal, an insurance man, a poet, a burglar or a physiotherapist – talk of eliminating work will immediately awaken the economist in him and prompt him to say in a dry, businesslike, ostensibly rational tone of voice, that there’s no way, the idea is “unfeasible.” Simply because there will be nothing here if people stop working. Even the less drastic version of the idea – a workday that lasts a maximum of four hours – will elicit a guffaw, accompanied by an economics-based explanation of why that too is not possible.</p> \n<p>The idea of annulling work, a topic of discussion in fairly small circles of social thinkers, has won little exposure among the general public and is at the bottom of the list of social concerns, lower than religious, left-wing/right-wing or artistic ideas, notions of free sex, the coming of the Messiah, relationships with robots, trans-humanism. Even racial doctrines can be said to have been accepted with more understanding than the notion of abolishing paid work. It may be lacking in morality – the racial doctrine – but it’s not entirely lacking in logic, and might not generate such strong resistance if it were to remain an unrealized theoretical scientific idea unconnected to real life.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the idea of doing away with work remains pristine and ever-young (and ever-neglected), mainly because, in contrast to other ideas, it has never been applied, certainly not on a widespread scale. Almost every significant social idea possesses a certain beauty as long as it remains the preserve of only a few. The problem with many ideas lies in the uglification and crushing they undergo when they enter the realm of the collective – when they fall into the grubby hands of the masses and are put into practice.</p> \n<p>Communism, religion, one God, democracy, the free market, America, freedom of expression, liberation from hierarchies – these are all ideas whose gestational core bears a certain conceptual-creative beauty. How elegant “God” would be if it had only remained a mental concept, a subject for contemplation and dialogue and flights of imagination among poets, philosophers, metaphysicians; or if religion had been born in discussions between visionary anthropologists who deal with “social organization,” and had remained there; or if freedom of expression were the preserve of only a few. Even the idea of the settlements in the territories – a biblical-romantic notion – possesses a certain poetic-violent primeval beauty, capable perhaps of evoking scenes from Pasolini films. But in practice, it looks the way it looks. Which is to say, pretty much as bad as the realization of any of the other aforementioned concepts.</p> \n<p>As far back as the second half of the 19th century, Paul Lafargue, a French-Cuban thinker, wrote his monumental essay “The Right to Be Lazy” – a work that should be part of the high-school curriculum here, if only as a counterpoint to the education minister’s high-tech obsession. This is how the book begins: “A strange delusion possesses the working classes of the nations where capitalist civilization holds its sway. This delusion drags in its train the individual and social woes which for two centuries have tortured sad humanity. This delusion is the love of work, the furious passion for work, pushed even to the exhaustion of the vital force of the individual and his progeny. Instead of opposing this mental aberration, the priests, the economists and the moralists have cast a sacred halo over work” (translation by Charles Kerr).</p> \n<p>Lafargue believed that in the near future, in the wake of accelerated development of mechanization and industrialization, machines would do most of the work necessary for everyday existence, and human beings would sit back and be free. Given the fact that the text was written long ago, we can forgive him his naivete. But when the same idea pops up again – in our time – it looks strange. It comes off like some sort of inappropriate stubbornness.</p> \n<p>Yuval Noah Harari, in his most recent book, “21 Lessons for the 21st Century,” also envisions a future in which the working class will become superfluous thanks to the computerization and roboticization that are encroaching on ever-increasing realms of manufacturing and services. According to this vision, people will enjoy an abundance of leisure time, in which they will travel, sit with friends, paint and play musical instruments, hang out with family members and so forth. That forecast has already been proven to be outdated. Unrealistic. Technology wasn’t intended to increase available leisure time and in fact has not done so in the least. If anything, the opposite has happened. In any event, the prediction that technology will supplant the majority of workers has encountered a dual response. Some see it as positive (because it will generate new areas of employment and develop the leisure-time business); others as a recipe for disaster (people won’t work, won’t earn a living, will slide into poverty, and all of society’s systems will collapse).</p> \n<p>Herzl’s dystopia</p> \n<p>A message similar to Lafargue’s, albeit far less stylized and charismatic, can be found in a 1985 article, “The Abolition of Work,” by Bob Black, an American anarchist. “In order to stop suffering, we have to stop working,” Black wrote, and elaborated, “all the old ideologies are conservative because they believe in work. Some of them, like Marxism and most brands of anarchism, believe in work all the more fiercely because they believe in so little else. Liberals say we should end employment discrimination. I say we should end employment. Conservatives support right-to-work laws. Following Karl Marx’s wayward son-in-law Paul Lafargue I support the right to be lazy. Leftists favor full employment. Like the surrealists – except that I’m not kidding – I favor full unemployment. Trotskyists agitate for permanent revolution. I agitate for permanent revelry.</p> \n<p>“[All the ideologues] will carry on endlessly about wages, hours, working conditions, exploitation, productivity, profitability. They’ll gladly talk about anything but work itself. These experts who offer to do our thinking for us rarely share their conclusions about work, for all its saliency in the lives of all of us… Unions and management agree that we ought to sell the time of our lives in exchange for survival, although they haggle over the price. Marxists think we should be bossed by bureaucrats. Libertarians think we should be bossed by businessmen. Feminists don’t care which form bossing takes so long as the bosses are women. Clearly these ideology-mongers… want to keep us working.”</p> \n<p>One of Black’s arguments – aimed at those who reject the idea of resisting work and view it as puerile, anarchist nonsense – is that fewer than half the jobs in the modern world have genuinely productive, day-to-day value. All other types of work, meaning most of it, boils down to what’s termed, in typical American roughhouse style, “Bullshit Jobs,” which is the title of a book published this year by anthropologist David Graeber. He maintains that the vast majority of existing service and office jobs are unnecessary, and continue to exist by power of inertia and to preserve the structure of oppression. Furthermore, in the long term, they give rise to a strong feeling of uselessness, mental depletion and depression among the workers.</p> \n<p>Graeber refers to a broad spectrum of jobs. It would be difficult to specify what they have in common, it’s easier to say what they are not: They are not productive, certainly not in the old sense of the word, but also not in its modern sense.</p> \n<p>It might be argued that Graeber’s approach contradicts the rigid values of efficiency that seemingly characterize modern societies and are meant to screen out lazy and unmotivated or simply superfluous workers. But there’s no contradiction. We’re not talking here about “hidden unemployment” or a situation that anyone even sees as problematic. This is exactly how things ought to be. A review of the book in The New Yorker observed that Graeber sees the logic of increasing jobs in the services fields, ostensibly in order to make them more efficient, as “something nearer to feudalism.”</p> \n<p>What would a workless world look like – or at least a world in which work has a narrow, limited place? Who should or can prepare for such a development, and how? It’s possible that differences in the answers to these questions will depend more on the chance personal circumstances of the respondent than on his opinions on socioeconomic matters. It’s likely that those who have a theme running through their lives (art, a significant hobby, spiritual-religious practice or something else) will be optimistic and believe that people will thrive if freed from the burden of work, each according to his inclinations and skills: Lovers of wisdom will immerse themselves in Greek philosophy and conduct fascinating discussions, idiots will occupy themselves with computer games and with sports, lovers of horticulture and of dogs will hike through the fields. And vice versa: Those who have no interest either in their work, leisure activities or themselves will gaze at an empty, boring world in which people go insane for lack of activity.</p> \n<p>Theodor Herzl, who was also a writer, dealt with this scenario in one of his short stories, “Solon in Lydien.” Set in Greece in the sixth century B.C.E., the story describes an invention that makes it possible to produce an unlimited amount of food without the need for human labor, eliminating any worries about shortages. However, the marvelous invention makes people lazy, hedonistic and quarrelsome, and ultimately becomes a threat to the continued development of the human race.</p> \n<p>Unemployment as treason</p> \n<p>More than likely, those who will discover that life without work is a pleasure, will also seek liberation from other types of burdens as well, such as family life. As we know, the socioeconomic structure of most Western societies rests primarily on these two foundations: work and family. It can be said that the one obliges the other, and clear reciprocal relations obviously exist between the two. Undercut one foundation and it’s possible that the whole structure, in its familiar form, will collapse. Whatever is the case – a paradise of productivity, active and harmonious community life, entertainment and traveling; or, alternately, a hell of withering and degenerative boredom – it’s hard to believe that civilization, after having embodied and developed different forms of subjugation and social oversight throughout most of history, will suddenly be able to cast off all restraint and grant people freedom in the full sense of the word.</p> \n<p>In certain academic circles there’s much interest, even enthusiasm, for this vision – but not among the general public. Interestingly, it’s workers themselves who are the first to defend the structure and deride the idea of abolishing or reducing work; to be exact, it’s precisely the low- and mid-level workers who feel this way. No one understands better than they that even partial implementation of the idea would cause immediate global and personal destruction. And from a certain point of view – narrow and immediate – they’re right. Nearly every salaried worker at those levels knows that not getting paid for even one month is liable to hurl him into an abyss from which he might not be able to climb out.</p> \n<p>At the same time, it’s difficult not to see the uniformity of responses to the idea as the result of successful training. Workers’ vigorous justification of work is a variation on the Stockholm syndrome. It’s only from that angle that we can understand the declarations of people who have won the lottery and announce that they are not quit their jobs. “Tomorrow morning, I’m at work. Obviously. What else?” That’s tantamount to declaring proudly, “Yes, I’m a donkey! Please pile a load on me, and make sure it’s not light.”</p> \n<p>In Israel the fear of non-work is related mainly to the ultra-Orthodox communities. The most serious charge leveled against them is that they don’t work, and that’s apparently even worse than the fact that they don’t do army service. The average secular person feels something between wishy-washy tolerance and forgiving indifference (“accommodation,” in the local parlance) with regard to the peculiar and sometimes primitive customs of the Haredim, and even somehow swallows the burning of the flag and of soldiers in effigy. But the absence of this community from the army of workers – that’s unforgivable.</p> \n<p>This anti-Haredi fury is nourished by the solid (and baseless) assumption that if they don’t work, it means others have to take their places, and thus need to work more. Because we all have to lend a shoulder, each according to his skills, to fuel the sophisticated economic system that sustains us and – more particularly – that we sustain. Adamant refusal by one group to lend a hand in this effort is perceived as treason, as is refusal by an individual, too. By Yair Netanyahu, for example. It’s pathetic that the public’s problem with the prime minister’s son isn’t that he’s being thrust into politics by the back door, or even the unbridled verbal attacks on everyone who’s critical of his parents, but precisely the fact that he doesn’t work (he claims he does). A young man of 26 without a job is too much for the bourgeoisie to take in, a genuine disease.</p> \n<p>The United States, its crass mental deficiencies notwithstanding, has given rise to some interesting concepts. One of them is the early retirement movement. In Israel that banner is hoisted by the woman who writes a blog called “Hasolidit,” in which she sends workers the message that they can be liberated from the shackles of labor by means of a simple, economical way of life and investments in the capital market, if they will only implement an extreme and merciless form of capitalism in the style of Ayn Rand. To call this a movement would be farfetched, but the basic idea she is promoting is to quit work at the age of 40. That’s feasible only if a number of conditions are met: that during his working years, the worker earns enough to save a substantial portion of his salary each month; that he lives modestly before and after his retirement; and that he understands the working of the capital market, where he will invest intelligently and augment the savings he accumulated as a salaried worker. It’s a more refined idea than the abolition of work, and it contains possible mathematical logic, but it’s not applicable for the majority of salaried workers, much less for those with low salaries and families.</p> \n<p>Mass graves</p> \n<p>The obligation to work – work as a supreme value, as the foundation for everything – has taken such powerful hold that the concept of “work” has become established even in other realms, unconnected with earning a living. Raising children is work. Awareness of this appears to have increased recently to the point where some people are questioning whether that work is sufficiently rewarding and worthwhile; indeed, it’s no longer rare for people to quit that job and not have children at all.</p> \n<p>What has officially and implacably become work is the connection between a couple, the relationship. It’s become almost natural to hear people say/quote/declaim that a relationship is work. Hard work. Of course it’s hard; easy work is no big deal. Psychologists and other types of therapists even maintain that it’s not only onerous but a daily endeavor. A couple who report an easygoing relationship over time – that sounds suspicious. Not credible. There’s no doubt that those couples are afraid of the obligatory hard work and are in denial.</p> \n<p>The religiously observant public in Israel is also often heard to say that faith is hard work, also an everyday endeavor. If you don’t work continuously at your faith, it’s definitely liable – like one’s partner – to vanish and abandon you, or at the very least lose the bright freshness it must have possessed at one time. (It would appear that, as distinct from the monotheistic religions, in multi-theistic ones such as Hinduism, the work of faith is easier and generates fewer burning and debilitating misgivings.)</p> \n<p>In short, heaps of work. A pessimistic eye, should it happen to visit here, might see all those housing projects and neighborhoods of lower- and middle-class families led by people in their 30s and 40s as mass graves. Or at least as multi-storied labor camps. The worker finishes a morning-to-dusk day on the job, returns to the children at home – more work – and when they finally go to bed, there’s the partner to deal with and still more work.</p> \n<p>In conclusion, what’s being offered here for free is a social ideology that’s in good condition, fresh, with no signs of attrition or erosion, logical, defiant but optimistic, and it even smells pretty good – yet there are no takers. Only large-scale civil revolt, it would seem, can bring about a change in the perception of work, and that’s not currently on the horizon. Still, it’s possible that in the future this ideology will develop into a full-blown agenda: that is, it will accumulate enough concrete baggage of injury and insult for it to be able to seize control of the mental domain and influence it. It’s possible that the inflexible basic deal between the individual and society will undergo a substantive transformation and make things freer and more relaxed.</p> \n<p>A Finnish experiment</p> \n<p>One of the most talked-about experiments in connection with work is being conducted in Finland. A sample group of 2,000 citizens have been receiving 560 euros a month for the past two years, a period that ends this month. Members of the group were chosen randomly from among unemployed people aged 25 to 58. They received the allowance whether they looked for work or not. Even those who found a job continued to receive the money. The main purpose of the experiment was to see whether the unconditional grant would spur people to work even in undesirable jobs. Another goal, in light of the fact that the modern labor market is perceived as being unstable, was to examine whether the individual’s sense of economic – hence also of mental-civic – security would improve.</p> \n<p>The experiment has generated a good deal of interest and has been commented on outside the academic world as well. Left-wing circles have been delighted with the idea that the ordinary citizen was at last getting something from the state, instead of just being squeezed by it, as usual. Right-wing thinkers have also been favorably inclined, because a permanent and non-conditional allowance of this kind could reduce the load on the state’s welfare system and allow it to be significantly downsized.</p> \n<p>However, some of the experiment’s critics have maintained that it’s worthless in research terms, both because the sample was too small (it was originally to have consisted of as many as 100,000 subjects), and also because, according to researchers, including some who were involved in the experiment, a two-year period is just too short (the Finnish government has refused to extend it). Furthermore, the amount of money is too low; it’s impossible to get by without working for any length of time on 560 euros a month.</p> \n<p>Stronger critics of the project claim that its goal had nothing to do with liberating people from any sort of chains. On the contrary: Its aim is to “help” people become accustomed to a situation of boring work and a meager salary. In other words, under such conditions, those who work in low-paying jobs will become somewhat less bitter – the allowance will facilitate moving from the low standard of living permitted by their usual salary to a slightly higher standard. That seems to be a more realistic appraisal than others.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Australia has decided to formally recognize West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but won't move its embassy until there is a peace settlement between Israel and Palestinians, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Saturday.</p> \n<p>He said in a speech that Australia will recognize East Jerusalem as Palestine's capital only after a settlement has been reached on a two-state solution. The Australian Embassy won't be moved from Tel Aviv until such a time, he said.</p> \n<p>Israel's Foreign Ministry congratulated Australia and called the move &quot;a step in the right direction&quot; in a statement.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The Jerusalem embassy flop&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>&quot;Israel views the decision of the Australian government to open its security- economic office in Jerusalem as a step in the right direction. Israel congratulates the government of Australia for its stance regarding sanctions on Iran and also regarding its pro Israel position at the UN and against antisemitism,&quot; the statement read.</p> \n<p>A senior Israeli official, however, said Israel is &quot;disappointed that the Australian government decided to only recognize West Jerusalem as Israel's capital and that Australia has not withdrawn from the nuclear deal with Iran.&quot;</p> \n<p>While the embassy move is delayed, Morrison said his government will establish a defense and trade office in Jerusalem and will also start looking for an appropriate site for the embassy.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Australian government has decided that Australia now recognizes west Jerusalem, as the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, is the capital of Israel,&quot; Morrison said. He said the decision respects both a commitment to a two-state solution and longstanding respect for relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</p> \n<p>Morrison had earlier floated the idea that Australia may follow the contentious U.S. move of relocating its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, but it was seen by many Australians as a political stunt. Critics called it a cynical attempt to win votes in a by-election in October for a Sydney seat with a high Jewish population.</p> \n<p>The consideration had sparked backlash from Muslim-majority Indonesia and Malaysia, threatening a free trade deal which has now been delayed.</p> \n<p>Opposition leader Bill Shorten said Saturday that the decision to recognize west Jerusalem as Israel's capital but not move the embassy there was a &quot;humiliating backdown&quot; from the October by-election campaign.</p> \n<p>&quot;What I'm worried is that Mr. Morrison put his political interest ahead of our national interest,&quot; Shorten told reporters.</p> \n<p>Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move that is not internationally recognized. Israel considers east Jerusalem an indivisible part of its capital, while the Palestinians seek the area, home to the city's most sensitive holy sites, as the capital of a future state.</p> \n<p>President Donald Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May delighted Israel, infuriated Palestinians and upset the wider Arab world and Western allies.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Reuters contributed to this report</p>",

        "text":["<p>Iran is intervening in the foreign exchange market and threatening speculators to engineer a dramatic recovery of its rial currency, easing pressure on the oil-exporting economy as Tehran defies renewed U.S. sanctions.</p> \n<p>The rial jumped to 105,500 against the U.S. dollar Wednesday, from 117,000 at the end of the previous week and 152,500 at the end of October, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com.</p> \n<p>The Financial Tribune and some other Iranian media outlets reported Tuesday that the rial had risen beyond 100,000 to the dollar. The foreign exchange market, however, has no single, official set of prices and traders often quote slightly different levels.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis: From Lebanon to Iraq: Iran’s new, hybrid threat to Israel</p> \n<p>Rial weakness earlier this year disrupted Iran’s foreign trade and helped boost annual inflation fourfold to nearly 40% in November. The weak currency has been a complaint of sporadic street protests since late last year.</p> \n<p>If the government can support the value of the rial in coming months, it may be able to bring down inflation, improving living standards and reduce capital flight from Iran.</p> \n<p>“Because of the stronger rial, initial fears among many about the sanctions have eased somewhat, and fewer people are trying to buy dollars,” a Tehran-based economist told Reuters, declining to be named because of political sensitivities.</p> \n<p>Iranian businessmen and economists contacted by Reuters said Iran’s central bank was now supplying large amounts of dollars to the market, not only inside Iran but in foreign locations where the currency is traded, particularly Iraq and Dubai.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month, state news agency IRNA quoted central bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati as saying the bank would do everything in its power to obey an order from supreme religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to strengthen the rial.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, two men charged with economic crimes were executed last month, including Vahid Mazloumin, dubbed the “sultan of coins” by local media. He was accused of manipulating the currency market, according to Mizan, the news site of the Iranian judiciary. Thirty men were jailed this month for up to 20 years for economic crimes, the judiciary said.</p> \n<p>Iranian economists said the campaign against economic crimes, combined with Khamenei’s order to strengthen the rial, had made many traders more wary of bidding the currency lower.</p> \n<p>Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian economist who heads energy risk analysis at London’s Betamatrix consultancy, said Tehran had deliberately allowed at least part of the rial’s depreciation to occur earlier this year in order to meet its financial needs.</p> \n<p>Authorities were able to sell dollars earned from oil exports at ultraexpensive rial rates near 190,000, raising cash to recapitalize state-linked banks and pension funds, he said. Now that the exercise has been completed, they are moving the rial back to levels they consider more comfortable, he added.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, the rial remains 59% below its value of 42,890 at the end of last year, and Emadi said the currency could come under fresh pressure to fall in 2019, depending on the impact of the sanctions and oil price levels.</p> \n<p>In March, the International Monetary Fund estimated Iran was running a current account surplus and had over $100 billion of gross official reserves. Those numbers suggested Tehran might have enough reserves to defend the rial comfortably.</p> \n<p>However, the IMF also said Tehran was having difficulty accessing some of its reserves as its relations with foreign banks were constrained by the threat of sanctions. Meanwhile, sanctions could cut the current account surplus sharply.</p> \n<p>The rial’s rebound, from record lows around 190,000 hit in late September, is good news for a government that is struggling to prevent U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil, banking and other industries from pushing the economy deep into recession.</p> \n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed U.S. sanctions on Iran earlier this year after pulling out of the world powers’ 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran. Washington has vowed “maximum pressure” on Iran’s economy to force it to accept tougher limits on its nuclear and missile programs. Iran has ruled this out.</p>",

        "text":["<p>After a month strolling the gold market in Libya’s capital, retired public servant Milud Farhat was unable to find any jewelry he could afford for his daughter’s wedding.</p> \n<p>The 60-year-old is typical of Libya’s once well-to-do middle class, impoverished by high inflation and devaluation during years of conflict in what used to be one of the Arab world’s wealthiest countries.</p> \n<p>In contrast, armed groups whose commanders cruise Tripoli’s potholed streets in luxury cars have become rich by forcing authorities to hire them and grant them cheap dollars they can change on the black market for a premium.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Forgotten memories of Libya's vibrant Jewish community</p> \n<p>To tackle this “war economy,” Tripoli’s internationally recognized government in September effectively devalued the exchange rate to 3.9 dinars per dollar from 1.3.</p> \n<p>That cut the black market rate from 6 to 5.2, which shoppers and traders said had slightly eased prices for food and other goods, many of which are imported.</p> \n<p>But for Farhat, who lives on a pension of 400 dinars per month, it made little difference. The wedding of his youngest daughter, his seventh child, is coming up, and jewelry for the bride is a must in Libya.</p> \n<p>“I have been coming every day for a month hoping that [gold] prices go down,” he said. “Normal people are just suffering,” he said.</p> \n<p>Gold prices have dipped a little to around 180 dinars ($46) an ounce since the devaluation, but are still triple their level in 2014 when the dinar started diving due to volatile oil revenues, Libya’s lifeline.</p> \n<p>“The gold market is still very, very weak. Seventy-five percent of people coming are just asking,” said gold trader Abdelhamid al-Zawi, standing in front of his empty shop.</p> \n<p>Economic policies are distorted by rivalry between the Tripoli government and a parallel administration in the east that set up its own central bank in the aftermath of the NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gadhafi in 2011.</p> \n<p>Overall oil revenue is up: The Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation expects income from crude and oil product sales to hit $23.7 billion in 2018, a 73% jump from last year.</p> \n<p>But money in the banks can be scarce. Many keep cash at home as they do not trust banks or play the black market.</p> \n<p>To undermine street dealers based just behind the Tripoli central bank headquarters and gold merchants doubling as currency traders, authorities slapped a 183% fee on commercial hard currency deals in September, moving the rate to 3.9.</p> \n<p>They also stopped restricting credit letters for imports, which Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeg said would help end the liquidity crisis by early 2019.</p> \n<p>For a small and well-connected elite, money is still flowing as they keep a grip on business and oil revenues. In Tripoli’s upmarket neighborhoods, sleek stores sell international fashion brands and new restaurants and cafes are opening.</p> \n<p>But elsewhere in the capital, building projects halted during the 2011 uprising litter the skyline and rubbish lies uncollected. Many are still queuing at banks hoping to access their salaries but are unable to withdraw significant amounts.</p> \n<p>“Sometimes you get 150 dinars. What can you do with that?” said Mahdi Ali Makhfuth, another retiree shopping for food with two sons.</p> \n<p>Authorities have also allowed citizens to bring up to $10,000 from abroad with credit cards, which Maiteeg said was bringing down the black market rate.</p> \n<p>But Makhfuth dismissed the measure as benefiting the rich. “Do normal citizens have 40,000 dinars in their accounts? No,” he said, referring to the amount needed to access that maximum dollar allowance.</p> \n<p>After a series of raids on the black market since September, dealers who use black plastic bags to carry dollars and wheelbarrows for devalued dinars have simply shifted into the labyrinth of the old city.</p> \n<p>And despite new central bank measures to prevent currency scams, Alaeldin Elmasallati, commissioner at Libya’s audit bureau, said they would still be possible due to lack of enforcement capacity.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The investigation into the attacks near the West Bank settlements of Ofra and Givat Assaf this past week has revealed that a single terrorist cell is responsible for both incidents.</p> \n<p>The investigation revealed that Salah Barghouti was the shooter in the drive-by attack at a bus stop near Ofra on Sunday, while another man drove the getaway car. Barghouti was killed by police while attempting to evade arrest on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>It seems that another member of the group arrived on his own to Givat Assaf hours after Barghouthi was killed, killed soldiers Yuval Mor-Yosef and Yossi Cohen, and fled the scene with one of the soldier’s weapons. Another two people were seriously wounded in the Givat Assaf attack.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;West Bank spirals into violence as Hamas ups efforts to orchestrate attacks&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>In both cases, the shooting was carried out with an automatic weapon. Security forces are checking the possibility that these weapons were also used in other shooting attacks by Palestinians in the Ramallah area in recent months.</p> \n<p>The Hamas terrorist cell responsible for the attacks is made up of members of families that are very well known to security services. A senior officer in IDF's Central Command said, in response to criticism: &quot;We always ask ourselves if we could have discovered the cell earlier.&quot;</p> \n<p>The officer denied the interpretation that this represented an intelligence failure on the part of the IDF and Shin Bet security service. “This is not a failure at the level of having information and not taking action. We are examining if we should have known about the cell earlier, and what we can do to reveal similar terror cells in the early stages. We succeed in preventing hundreds of terrorist attacks a year, some at the last moment before the attack. This is the hard, daily work of the forces,” said the senior officer.</p> \n<p>The IDF uses advanced technological means and databases of possible suspects for intelligence on cases like these. The security forces realize that these suspects should have been identified in advance because the Hamas cell has been operating in the West Bank for quite some time.</p> \n<p>“We don’t today know whether we have arrested all the members of the cell. We are investigating the ones we have arrested to better understand what happened,” said the officer.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement that he plans to answer the latest round of terror attacks by legalizing thousands of homes in the territories and advancing plans to build 82 new housing units in Ofra and industrial zones next to Avnei Hefetz and Betar Ilit is a renewed admission that the settlements and their expansion are an Israel attack on the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>There is good reason these steps will be accompanied by punitive acts, including expediting the demolition of the homes of terrorists’ families, increasing troop numbers in the West Bank, detaining Hamas activists without charges and putting up roadblocks, as well as encircling El Bireh and revoking permits to enter Israel.</p> \n<p>“Our response to murderous terrorism must be sharp and clear,” said Tourism Minister Yariv Levin. “We will work to continue construction throughout Israel and to strengthen [existing] and new settlements.” Such remarks are nothing new. Netanyahu was not the first prime minister to use the weapon of settlement construction in answer to hostile actions — a “fitting Zionist response,” as it’s called.</p> \n<p>But the declarations about these steps, alongside Netanyahu’s saying “They think they can uproot us from our land. They will not succeed,” show that as Netanyahu and his government see it, Israel is in a war for the growth and expansion of the settlements. His remarks imply that the occupied territories are “our land” and the Palestinians will not “uproot us” from it.</p> \n<p>Thus the justification for the settlements can no longer be cloaked in the “security” guise. They have become flag bearers of punishment and revenge, so much so that in an absurd way, terrorism has become critical to their expansion and control of the territories. Settlement has become an act of punishment and revenge, creating a frightening equation in which the murder of Israelis is not terrorism but a building stone for the settlements.</p> \n<p>These are not just mere words. Immediately after they were spoken, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit officially approved “Marche ouvert,” the legal concept of property ownership, in which transactions conducted in good faith under certain conditions are considered valid — even if they have certain legal faults, such as in the case of the sale of stolen goods.</p> \n<p>This is expected to lead to the legalization of some 2,000 housing units in the West Bank, based on the dubious claim that “a sale conducted in good faith between the authority in charge of government property in the territories and another person, for any property the authority thought at the time of the sale was government property” is valid, even if the state did not in fact own the land.</p> \n<p>In addition, on Sunday the Ministerial Committee for Legislation is slated to discuss a bill sponsored by MK Bezalel Smotrich that would guarantee services to and prevent the demolition of communities whose status has not been formalized, until a panel has decided on their status.</p> \n<p>It is hard to avoid the worrying conclusion that the government has made strengthening and expanding the settlements its main goal, in preparation for annexing the territories.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz's lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

All the complaints have been referred to professionals.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; After this week's national protest against femicide, women in Israel can dream | Opinion ■&nbsp; Israeli women took to the street. But where are all the men? | Analysis</p> \n<p>The ministry hotline for which you dial 118, is open 24 hours a day, and available in Hebrew, Arabic, Amharic and Russian. Complaints are referred immediately to the relevant authorities.</p> \n<p>Sa’id Teli, director of the ministry’s domestic violence unit, said they have noted an increase in calls from men and women feeling freer to discuss their situations. “The dialogue and protest against violence have raised awareness about the issue and many more women are asking for help, or to receive information about what aid would be at their disposal and also seeking to be listened to. We are also seeing a rise in the number of men calling in asking for help and discussing their circumstances.”</p> \n<p>Initiators of the women’s protests told Haaretz that “one of the direct influences of the historic show of unity among women in the past week has been that women see they are not alone and that there’s a significant change in public discussion and awareness of violence toward women.”</p> \n<p>They added that “without the addition of budgets and real steps by decision-makers the public system will not adequately address the complaints. That’s why we have taken to the streets and will continue to do so until our demands have been met.”</p> \n<p>Teli called on men and women facing difficulties to approach the ministry. “The office has 113 centers for violence prevention around the country providing sensitive responses to men, women and children,” he said.</p> \n<p>“We urge that all those suffering from violence to approach us or come to the centers near their homes.”</p> \n<p>The association assisting sexual assault victims reported an increase of 50% in complaints of sexual assault since the #ididntcomplain campaign began and that many who described a sense of being inundated by the intensive exposure to stories of assault.</p> \n<p>The number of men complaining has risen substantially. The association said that in the past they would get 40 to 45 complaints a month from men, but since the campaign began they receive 60 to 70 complaints a month.</p> \n<p>Last week saw nationwide protests, including roads blocked, in response to the murder of 25 women in the past year. Protesters have been demanding 250 million shekels for domestic violence prevention programs. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that funds would be found to finance the programs within two weeks. Meanwhile, the government is weighing specific budget cuts from other programs to finance this one.</p> \n<p>The latest wave of protests was sparked by the murder last Tuesday of Iman Awad, 29, who was stabbed to death in her home in Acre. Her husband, Mohammed Lebavidi, was arrested as a suspect in the case but he has denied any involvement. They married recently and Awad was pregnant.</p> \n<p>An inter-ministerial committee on the issue of domestic violence was set up in 2014, and issued recommendations in 2017, most of which have not as yet been implemented.</p>",

A thobe, or thawb, is a traditional ankle-length garment worn throughout the Arab world and some countries in East and West Africa, while &quot;yama&quot; is Arabic for mother.</p> \n<p>The embroidery on Palestinian dresses varies per city, village or region and is a way for the wearer to show pride in one's origins. Tlaib's mother is from Beit Ur al-Fauqa, outside Ramallah, and her father from Beit Hanina, an East Jerusalem neighborhood.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Tlaib made history in November, when her victory in Michigan's 13th Congressional District made her the first female Muslim to be elected to the House of Representatives. She was followed shortly later by fellow Democrat Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who won the seat formerly occupied by Keith Ellison.</p> \n<p>Tlaib has made headlines regarding her position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on several occasions. Before winning her primary in August, her campaign represented her as supporting a two-state solution and aid to Israel. But since her victory, she has explicitly endorsed a one-state solution and called for an end to aid to Israel, prompting the pro-two-state-solution lobby group J Street to officially withdraw its support for her.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month, Tlaib told The Intercept that she plans to lead a delegation of lawmakers to the West Bank. Tlaib said the delegation's goal is &quot;to humanize Palestinians, provide an alternative perspective to the one [the American Israel Public Affairs Committee] pushes, and highlight the inherent inequality of Israel’s system of military occupation in Palestinian territories, which Tlaib likens to what African-Americans in the United States endured in the Jim Crow era.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Demonstrated loyalty. Political savvy. Personal rapport.</p> \n<p>And, as a bonus, a decent golf game.</p> \n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump had long made clear the qualities he was looking for in his next chief of staff. And when his first pick turned him down, sparking a frantic search, the president turned to the man he’d already tapped for two previous jobs in his administration: Mick Mulvaney, a blunt, fast-talking former South Carolina congressman turned budget chief who had told Trump months ago he wanted the job.</p> \n<p>After Mulvaney was choosen, a video from 2016 resurfaced of him calling Trump a &quot;horrible human being.&quot; ABC, which ran the video, noted that Mulvaney and the White House were aware of the tape and called it &quot;old news.&quot;</p> \n<p>It was an obvious choice to many outside the administration that reflects the challenges ahead: Trump will soon be fighting for re-election as he contends with a House controlled by Democrats eager to use their new subpoena power to investigate his administration and business dealings. And the Russia investigation continues, with the drip-drip of new allegations mounting daily.</p> \n<p>But for Trump, a notoriously mercurial president who has already cycled through two chiefs of staffs in as many years, the decision was as much about current appearances as future negotiations: Spurned by several front-runners and angry over the growing narrative that he couldn’t find someone to take the job, Trump made the offer Friday afternoon at a meeting that had originally been scheduled to discuss the ongoing budget showdown that threatens a holiday shutdown. Mulvaney accepted — and even kept his current position as director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p> \n<p>Trump had made clear to confidantes that, for his third chief of staff, he wanted someone that he liked personally and who would not try to rein him in as John Kelly had during the first months of his soon-to-sour tenure. Trump missed the more freewheeling feel of the Oval Office under his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and wanted someone he could get along with — someone he could trade gossip with, who would complain along with him about his favorite subject, the “fake news,” as well as someone with the political savvy he felted Kelly lacked.</p> \n<p>But Mulvaney was not always fond of Trump. At a November 2016 event in South Carolina, Mulvaney said “Do I like Donald Trump? No” but added that he was a better choice for president than Hillary Clinton.</p> \n<p>The then-congressman, who was captured on video unearthed by The Daily Beast on Saturday, added that he was backing Trump “as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact that I think he’s a terrible human being.”</p> \n<p>Mulvaney “will let Trump be Trump,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who knows both men well, said in an interview Saturday. While other top advisers in the administration have tried to steer the president’s policies, Paul said, Mulvaney gets Trump and shares some of his instincts on both domestic and a non-interventionist foreign policy.</p> \n<p>Mulvaney’s “not going to squash” Trump’s instincts, said Paul, who welcomed the congressman as an early supporter of his own libertarian-leaning presidential bid in 2015.</p> \n<p>Though Mulvaney had sent mixed public signals in recent weeks as to whether he wanted the chief of staff position, he previously expressed to Trump that he wanted the job. Over a dinner last summer during a bout of deliberations about Kelly’s future, Mulvaney told Trump that was interested and vowed to manage the staff and not the president, an answer Trump liked, according to a White House official and a person familiar with the dinner who were not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations.</p> \n<p>Having grown increasingly weary of aides who would tell him no, Trump felt aligned with the man he had appointed OMB director. He also had become personally fond of Mulvaney as the two met to discuss budget matters and played golf together. The president, who has little patience for lengthy briefings, also appreciated the colorful maps and graphics the budget director would use to highlight his presentations. And he considered Mulvaney a natural on television.</p> \n<p>During one particularly memorable televised Cabinet meeting, Mulvaney discussed his efforts to overhaul government regulation by explaining, in dramatic exasperation, that the Food and Drug Administration regulates cheese pizza, but not if one adds pepperoni, and that an open-face roast beef sandwich comes under different jurisdiction than one with two slices of bread.</p> \n<p>“This is stupid,” said Mulvaney at the end of his colorful monologue.</p> \n<p>Trump loved the performance.</p> \n<p>“That was incredibly said,” Trump marveled, telling the assembled press, “I think you should put that on television, not what I said.” For Trump, who rarely likes to cede the spotlight, it was an especially notable comment.</p> \n<p>Mulvaney, who was elected to Congress in the 2010 tea-party wave, had also shown a willingness to put aside his own, long-held principles in service of Trump. In Congress, he had been a staunch fiscal conservative who helped found the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and railed against deficits. But at OMB, he presided over a growing federal deficit as Trump boosted defense spending and pushed steep tax cuts.</p> \n<p>Indeed, in February Mulvaney told a congressional committee that, as a member of Congress, he probably wouldn’t have voted for the budget proposal he was presenting.</p> \n<p>“But I’m the director of the Office of Management and Budget,” he said, “and my job is to fund the president’s priorities, which is exactly what we did.”</p> \n<p>After he was announced as budget director, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called Mulvaney a “radical” who had consistently voted to cut Medicare benefits and was a supporter of government shutdowns in 2013 and 2015 over spending for the health care law and Planned Parenthood.</p> \n<p>Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill added, “It sends a clear message that at this critical time the President would choose to elevate the architect of the last Republican government shutdown.”</p> \n<p>Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer on Friday said in a tweet that Trump’s decision to elevate Mulvaney to the chief of staff role was “Very troubling (but not surprising!)”</p> \n<p>But Jonathan Slemrod, who ran Mulvaney’s outreach to Congress, said Mulvaney has the ability to work on Capitol Hill and was a skilled manager who could run a large organization.</p> \n<p>“Mick has stronger relationships on the Hill than the press wants to write,” Slemrod said. “He’s willing to compromise. He’s willing to work with both sides.”</p> \n<p>Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, another founder of the House Freedom Caucus, also downplayed any friction between Mulvaney and rank-and-file Republicans, saying there has been nothing that needed smoothing over.</p> \n<p>“Mick is a great pick,” Jordan said, and will “do an outstanding job.”</p> \n<p>It is unclear how extensively Mulvaney plans to reorganize the White House. In a letter to OMB staff Saturday afternoon obtained by The Associated Press, Mulvaney said that four staffers — including his chief of staff, Emma Doyle — would be moving over to the West Wing when he begins, effective Jan. 2.</p> \n<p>“When I got here almost two years ago, I told everyone that I had one goal, one motto, one sort of mission statement for OMB: quiet competence. That is, after all, what OMB is all about,” he said in the letter. “I plan to take this motto with me as I work to fill the shoes of General Kelly, who provided an outstanding service to the President and the American people.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>In ordinary times, the appointment of an Israeli historian to a top position abroad would be a source of pride in Israeli academia. But in recent weeks, Prof. Daniel Blatman of Hebrew University has had to deflect criticism for becoming the chief historian at the Warsaw Ghetto Museum, which is being built in the Polish capital.</p> \n<p>“Some of the critics are my colleagues who once were my friends and maybe no longer are,” Blatman, a member of Hebrew University’s Jewish History and Contemporary Jewry Department, said this week.</p> \n<p>The Warsaw Ghetto Museum is due to open in 2023, 80 years after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. It will be housed in a building that served as a Jewish children’s hospital and operated inside the ghetto.</p> \n<p>“It sounds very strange, but it will be the first Polish museum dealing with the Holocaust, even though Poland has an endless number of Polish commemoration sites,” Blatman notes.</p> \n<p>Privately, Blatman’s critics are hurling accusations at him. In Polish, English and Hebrew they talk about his appointment as serving as a fig leaf, or, using another metaphor, they say he has sold his soul. The more moderate critics suffice with the view that he’s simply naive and being used by the Polish government.</p> \n<p>In recent years, critics have viewed with concern the right-wing government’s efforts to shape Poland’s national memory, an effort centered around a new narrative that draws parallels between Polish and Jewish suffering in World War II. It also exalts the role of Poles in saving Jews and minimizes their responsibility in the persecution of Jews.</p> \n<p>Those critics, who were shocked this year by Poland’s new “Holocaust law” – which condemns the claim that the Polish nation was involved in the Nazis’ crimes – are now worried that this government line will also be reflected in Poland’s first Holocaust museum.</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv University’s Hava Dreifuss, the history professor who heads Yad Vashem’s Center for Research on the Holocaust in Poland, rebuffed the Polish museum’s efforts to court her last summer.</p> \n<p>“They requested my help as an expert on the history of the Warsaw Ghetto,” she says. “I didn’t want my name to serve an enterprise led by officials distorting the Holocaust and attacking historians, and I didn’t want to help a museum being established to further goals that aren’t necessarily related to history.”</p> \n<p>Dreifuss, whose Hebrew-language book on life in the ghetto, “Warsaw Ghetto – the End,” was published this year, fears that the new museum will obscure events from the past that the Poles would prefer to forget.</p> \n<p>“The Polish government is trying to advance research and commemoration of the Holocaust as long as it involves Jews who were killed by the Germans,” she says. “But during the period of the Holocaust there were also many Jews who were lost as a result of direct or indirect Polish involvement. And an exploration of these matters is something the regime is trying to limit, despite the existence of a great deal of documentation and research.”</p> \n<p>‘Mutual love’</p> \n<p>Blatman says he has been granted full academic freedom in his new post. “I haven’t encountered the slightest hint of political involvement,” he says. “I wouldn’t have agreed to work as a historian in a place where I’d be required to bend my professional approach to political considerations.”</p> \n<p>Polish Culture Minister Piotr Glinski articulated the “spirit of the museum” at the beginning of this year. “I would like this institution to speak of the mutual love between the two nations that spent 800 years here, on Polish land. Of the solidarity, fraternity, historical truth too, in all its aspects,” he told reporters.</p> \n<p>Dreifuss doesn’t like this. “From statements by the current Polish government, one can infer that the new museum has aims beyond the presentation of life in the ghetto and the treatment of the Holocaust of Polish Jewry,” she says.</p> \n<p>“The statement about strengthening 800 years of Jewish-Polish fraternity and closeness is fundamentally ahistorical. The ghetto wasn’t in existence for 800 years, there wasn’t any Jewish-Polish fraternity there, and there's a suspicion that the new museum will be subordinated to just such a narrative.”</p> \n<p>As she puts it, “It must be remembered that the current administration in Poland is promoting what is called a ‘historical policy,’ and in that context it’s trying to shape a narrative different from what’s emerging in the current research.”</p> \n<p>Her qualms join those of other historians, who note, for example, commemorations of Poles who saved Jews while endangering or sacrificing their own lives. The most important of these is a museum established in 2016 in the southeastern town of Markowa dedicated to the Ulma family – Polish farmers who were killed by the Germans after they hid Jews.</p> \n<p>“The museum at Markowa is devoted to an important topic, Righteous Gentiles,” Dreifuss says. “But actually it blurs the issue because it attributes to Polish society as a whole the help that was given by these noble Poles, who acted in a way that was counter to the social norms.”</p> \n<p>The establishment of the World War II Museum in Gdansk, which opened in 2017, also stirred controversy. At its height, the director was fired and a new one was appointed “to give greater emphasis to the Polish narrative.”</p> \n<p>Blatman isn’t the first Israeli to take part in a Polish commemoration project in the heart of Warsaw. He was preceded by Israel Prize laureate Dani Karavan, who is currently at work on a monument honoring the Polish Righteous Gentiles being built next to the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews. That museum was dedicated in 2013, marking the 70th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.</p> \n<p>There has been criticism of the site chosen for the monument – the neighborhood where the ghetto stood. Critics say the monument to Poles who rescued Jews shouldn’t be in a place where so many Jews were killed.</p> \n<p>Warsaw under the Nazis</p> \n<p>When asked about the vision for the new museum, Blatman presents a view that some historians find controversial. “The Holocaust of Polish Jewry should be located in the Polish historical space, not in an exclusively Jewish space,” he says.</p> \n<p>In other words, Blatman wants to tell the story of the Warsaw Ghetto in the local context, including “the city of Warsaw and the Polish population, which were under the same Nazi occupation and were also subjected to the terror.”</p> \n<p>He’s aware of the inflammatory potential of the comparison between the sufferings of the two peoples during World War II. “I’m not saying that their fate was similar or identical, but they lived under the same occupation and not on some other planet,” Blatman says.</p> \n<p>“We tend to forget a bit that the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto continued to see themselves as Polish citizens who belonged to the place where they lived. Very often they were disappointed with Poland or were hurt by the attitude of Polish society toward them, but they still were Polish. Only after the war did we turn them solely into Jews.”</p> \n<p>Albert Stankowski, a Polish Jew who previously worked at the POLIN Museum in Warsaw, has been appointed director of the new museum. “As I took the position of the Warsaw Ghetto Museum director, I was granted complete autonomy in the recruitment of the museum team,” he says. “We are open to cooperation with everyone who can assist us in ensuring an objective presentation of the facts.”</p> \n<p>When he began his new job, he tried to recruit Polish historians to work at the new museum, but they declined.</p> \n<p>As Dreifuss puts it, “Precisely in light of the Polish researchers’ refusal, it seems to me that the approach to foreign historians isn’t a technical matter. As I see it, this was a way of trying to acquire international approval, and perhaps even more importantly, Jewish and Israeli approval for the museum and its narrative, at the expense of the Polish researchers.”</p> \n<p>Some of Blatman’s articles for Haaretz show that he presents a complex picture of the Polish government. He believes that in recent decades historical research has focused on Polish aggressiveness toward Jews while ignoring the suffering of the Poles.</p> \n<p>“The historical picture is not complete if one tells about the killing of Jews by their Polish neighbors without also mentioning, for example, the labor camps that were in operation in those same areas, and in which many Poles found their deaths,” he wrote in 2016.</p> \n<p>“The new museum,” he says now, “will try to grapple with issues that have been neglected in various exhibitions, both at Yad Vashem and in other countries. We’re definitely thinking about incorporating a reminder about other victims of the Nazi genocide.”</p> \n<p>That said, Blatman’s articles also reveal that he hasn’t gone easy on criticism of the Polish government in recent years; he has often linked it to his harsh criticism of the Israeli government.</p> \n<p>As he wrote in April, what he calls National Zionism “is a branch of European neo-fascism, which contains elements of xenophobia and ultranationalism, subordinating democracy to other values and restricting individual rights and the freedom and independence of the law.”</p> \n<p>This week, he disagreed that there was something improper about taking a top position at a museum being established by a Polish government that he has criticized so severely.</p> \n<p>“Following that line, I also mustn’t cooperate with Yad Vashem because it’s under the aegis of a minister whose policy I’m very critical of,” he said, referring to Education Minister Naftali Bennett.</p>",

It was untouched and unlooted, Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters at the site. He described the find as &quot;one of a kind in the last decades.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The tomb dates from the rule of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;Egypt, economic miracle or basket case on the Nile?&nbsp;■&nbsp;Archaeologists find mummified sacred beetles and cats in ancient Egyptian tombs</p> \n<p>Archaeologists removed a last layer of debris from the tomb on Thursday and found five shafts inside, Waziri said. One of the shafts was unsealed with nothing inside, but the other four were sealed. They are expecting to make discoveries when they excavate those shafts starting on Sunday, he said. He was hopeful about one shaft in particular.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;I can imagine that all of the objects can be found in this area,&quot; he said, pointing at one of the sealed shafts. &quot;This shaft should lead to a coffin or a sarcophagus of the owner of the tomb.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The tomb is 10 metres (33 ft) long, three metres (9.8 ft) wide and just under three metres high, Waziri said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The walls are decorated with hieroglyphs and statues of pharaohs.

        "text":["<p>Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein criticized the Australian prime minister on Sunday for saying that Australia would only move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem after Israel and the Palestinians reach a peace agreement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to Edelstein, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's statement could indirectly encourage Palestinian violence.</p> \n<p>In an interview with Army Radio, Edelstein also commented on Australia's recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying: “We expected more from a friendly country like Australia.”</p> \n<p>Israel annexed East Jerusalem following the 1967 Six-Day War and considers the entire city as its capital. The Palestinian Authority, however, said East Jerusalem should be the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p> \n<p>&quot;[Australia's stance] sets us back several years, years when the world tried to give the keys to a future solution to irresponsible entities such as the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization and nothing came of it,&quot; Edelstein said.</p> \n<p>Referring to the Oslo peace agreements of the 1990s that established the Palestinian Authority, Edelstein said Australia's stance is an example of an approach requiring both sides to agree. &quot;These things not only don’t help stability in the region, but in fact it might be said that they certainly work indirectly to [encourage] Palestinian violence and [to encourage] more of their dreams.”</p> \n<p>Edelstein said there was nothing new in Morrison’s statement and he hoped Israel’s “cool reaction” would make it clear to Australia that this was not what Israel had hoped for. Army Radio host Efi Triger suggested in the interview that perhaps the very fact the Australian announcement angered the Palestinian means &quot;we need to be satisfied, to which Edelstein replied: “If I were in the Palestinians' position, I wouldn’t be too angry.&quot;</p> \n<p>Referring to the terrorist attacks this month against Israelis in the West Bank, the Knesset speaker said they had been inspired by Palestinian Authority, who he said is &quot;fully responsible&quot; for them. &quot;If I were in their place, I would keep quiet,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>An investigation by Israeli security forces into terrorist attacks last week near the settlements of Ofra and Givat Assaf found that they were the work of a single cell affiliated with Hamas, the Palestinian Authority's Gaza-based rival.</p>",

At least seven Palestinians were said to have been killed during a gun battle that ensued with Israeli forces, including a Hamas military commander. The clash was followed by a massive barrage of rocket fire into Israeli border communities.</p> \n<p>Haniyeh also said Iz al-Din al-Qassam knows exactly where the Israeli forces were entering and leaving the Gaza Strip, what was happening during the disrupted operation and how long the force had been in Gaza. He warned the IDF not to send any more troops into Gaza and that any soldiers that entered would be either executed or held prisoner.</p> \n<p>Haniyeh added that the mass of people at the rally he was addressing “proves that the Palestinian people support the forces of the resistance.” He promised the organization would continue the struggle to release Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.</p> \n<p>Haniyeh also said that the Palestinian marches along the Gaza border had conveyed three messages: That U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace plan would not be accepted; that the younger generation would continue the fight for the “right of return”; and that the blockade of Gaza was on the international agenda and the process of breaking it had begun.</p> \n<p>The West Bank, he said, was “an inseparable part of the struggle,” and that any attempt to make it the basis for Trump’s peace deal would fail. Haniyeh also called on the Palestinian Authority to halt its security cooperation with Israel and not to gamble on trying to negotiate with it. He said he was prepared to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at any time to advance the reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah and to hold elections within three months.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Iz al-Din al-Qassam announced that it had managed to operate Israeli-made drones that crashed in Gaza because of technical problems. A statement claimed that engineers successfully repaired some of the drones and made them operational, using&nbsp; some of them to film Sunday's rally.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Palestinian Authority fears the rise in clashes with the Israel Defense Forces is further undermining its standing with Palestinians in the West Bank and increasing support for Hamas. That, at least, is the conclusion that can be drawn from protests in Nablus, Hebron and Ramallah the PA forcibly dispersed Friday.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t the first time in the past decade that PA police officers have clashed with Palestinian protesters in the shadow of IDF attacks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but it came at a political low point for the PA, at home and abroad, and at a time of economic crisis for the PA and its Palestinian inhabitants.</p> \n<p>No wonder the Palestinian National Initiative — a relatively young political force with an important role in the intra-Palestinian reconciliation efforts — has warned against turning “heroic and brave confrontation with the occupation and its criminal settlers into fighting among Palestinians that only serves the Netanyahu government and its policies.”</p> \n<p>The Nablus and Hebron protests on Friday were held to mark the 31st anniversary of Hamas. The official reason for the violent breakup of the protest in Nablus — PA police fired into the air and beat demonstrators, among other actions — was that participants had raised a Hamas flag and refused to wave Palestinian flags. The official reason for dispersing the Hebron demonstration, in part by hitting female protesters with batons, was that in a premeditated provocation they had slandered the PA.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian public views the incidents in which Israeli soldiers and civilians were shot near the Givat Assaf outpost and the entrance to the settlement of Ofra as legitimate acts of heroism against the endless encroachment of settlers in the area. Associating the shootings with a Hamas cell reinforces the patriotic-nationalist image of the Islamic resistance movement, in contrast to the PA’s image as the “subcontractor of the occupation.”</p> \n<p>It’s difficult not to notice, especially at a time of continuous, intensive military raids, how the Palestinian security forces are deployed: No Israeli soldiers are in evidence whenever armed and uniformed Palestinian troops are about. The reverse is also true: There are no Palestinian police in sight whenever Israeli soldiers raid a neighborhood, breaking into shops and homes, confiscating security camera footage and shooting at young people who throw stones at them.</p> \n<p>The disappearance of Palestinian police from the streets follows warnings issued by the army. To many, this is an absurd situation, enshrined in the Oslo Accords, that prevents the Palestinian National Security Forces from defending their compatriots from Israeli military attacks.</p> \n<p>Last week the residents of Ramallah experienced military raids of extraordinary proportions, compared to recent years. There were continuous raids, gunfire aimed at stone-throwing protesters, roadblocks at city exits and the takeover of homes, in addition to settlers attacking cars and homes.</p> \n<p>When the Palestinian security forces attack their own people rather than protecting them, contempt for them grows. Then, when the ruling party, Fatah, calls for protests against the occupation (for example, on village lands that settler violence prevents farmers from accessing), the calls are met in the best case with pity and in the worst with scorn.</p> \n<p>IDF forces have killed five Palestinians since Wednesday. In each case, Palestinians believe these were extrajudicial executions, carried out instead of arrests: Ashraf Na’alwa, the perpetrator of the attack in Barkan over two months ago; Saleh Barghouthi, the suspected shooter at Ofra; Majd Mteir, of the Qalandiyah refugee camp, who stabbed police officers in the Old City of Jerusalem; Hamdan al-Arada, 67, a businessman who, after encountering soldiers in the El Bireh industrial zone, panicked and lost control of his vehicle. Soldiers assumed he was perpetrating a car-ramming attack. The fifth was Mahmoud Nakhleh of the Jalazun refugee camp. According to residents, soldiers shot him in the abdomen Friday and delayed his evacuation to a hospital.</p> \n<p>The third protest that was quelled was by Nakhleh’s friends in Jalazun, north of Ramallah. On Friday they marched through El Bireh, planning to demonstrate at the grave of Yasser Arafat. After being forcibly dispersed they headed to Ramallah’s Manara Square. On the way, they set garbage bins alight and rolled them onto the street. They broke security cameras and demanded shopkeepers shut their doors in mourning for Nakhleh. A journalist accompanying them in a live feed and who was careful not to focus the cameras on their faces, told viewers they were expressing outrage at their friend’s death.</p> \n<p>But by daring to disrupt life in these ostensibly calm, more complacent cities, they exposed an old social rift between the refugee camps and the rest of society and its official leaders. These tensions have risen in a period of economic decline and a sense of hopelessness about the future. In a conciliatory effort, a partial day of mourning was declared on Saturday, while Nakhleh was buried. At the same time, the Palestinian intelligence service arrested the journalist for broadcasting their protest by video link, according to his relatives. The direct broadcast had obviously exposed too many internal problems and social tensions that could be interpreted as weakness of the PA, a lack of solidarity and growing alienation.</p> \n<p>Fear for the PA’s fate was hinted by the official news agency Wafa’s report of a visit by Egyptian intelligence to the presidency in Ramallah Thursday. The official reports said Egypt expressed support for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the PA and the Palestinian people. Between the lines one could detect concern that the Egyptian authorities had accepted Hamas rule in the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>Attending the meeting were Abbas, the heads of Palestinian intelligence and preventive security and a senior Fatah and PA official, who enjoys the most direct access to Israeli authorities: Hussein al-Sheikh, the head of the administration for civilian affairs (the counterpart of Israel’s coordinator of government activities in the territories). The delegation couldn’t enter or leave Ramallah without Israel’s permission. If giving its permission means that Israel also accepts Egypt’s message, the signal on the ground is the opposite.</p> \n<p>At midnight Friday, around 20 activists of the popular resistance committees against the settlements and the fence gathered at the home of Islam Abu Hmeid, in the Amari refugee camp in El Bireh. Abu Hmaid killed a soldier in Israel’s Duvdevan special forces unit in May, throwing a marble slab onto him from a balcony during a military raid on the camp.</p> \n<p>The protesters knew the army would soon arrive to destroy the house, and said they intended to prevent that from happening. Indeed a large contingent of troops arrived at the scene early Saturday morning and clamped a curfew on the area and the surrounding neighborhoods.</p> \n<p>As this story was being written Saturday morning, the house was blown up. About 60 people were injured in ensuing clashes, including journalists the Palestinians said were attacked by the soldiers.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said 300 Palestinians were wounded in confrontations throughout the West Bank in the past 24 hours. Palestinian security personnel were not present, at least not armed or in uniform. Their absence may have been regarded as natural and perhaps logical and understandable, had they not on so many previous occasions violently suppressed their own people’s freedom of expression and rights to organize and demonstrate.</p>",

A third man was moderately wounded. Two other men were killed in unrelated criminal incidents in northern and central Israel.</p> \n<p>The woman and one of the men, her husband, were both in their 40s and members of a crime family known to police. Aminah and Jadua&nbsp;Azbargeh were&nbsp;driving near the headquarters of the police's anti-fraud unit, Lahav 443, when they were shot at close range from a passing vehicle.</p> \n<p>They both sustained wounds to their upper bodies. After being shot, Jadua lost control of the car, drove over a traffic island and crashed into a pole. Medical teams pronounced them dead at the scene.</p> \n<p>Police are searching for the shooter or shooters.</p> \n<p>About two hours after the first shooting, as police forces were gathered around the crime scene, another round of fire was heard nearby. Two men, aged 47 and 22, were wounded. The older man, later identified as Ramle resident Ali al-Asam, was taken to the hospital in serious condition and was later pronounced dead. The younger man sustained moderate wounds.</p> \n<p>The police are looking into a possible connection between the two cases and assess al-Asam was caught in a crossfire, when an unidentified gunman allegedly attempted to retaliate for the&nbsp;Azbargehs' death.</p> \n<p>Investigators are also looking at security camera footage of the scene, which should be well-documented due to its proximity to the police headquarters.</p> \n<p>Al-Asam's relatives said on Sunday they're convinced he wasn't actively involved in the shooting. His brother, Ahmed, added he was shot upon returning from collecting a payment from his employer. Al-Asam was never involved in criminal activity, the brother said.</p> \n<p>Also Saturday night, a 22-year-old man was shot to death in the Arab Israeli city of Yafia, near Nazareth. Muhammed Abu Diak was found in the street seriously wounded. He was evacuated to a hospital in Nazareth, where he was pronounced dead an hour later.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Police are investigating the incident, and said the background for the shooting remains unclear. The Nazareth Magistrate Court filed a gag order on publishing details of the investigation.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Ashraf Abu Kaud, a 43-year-old resident of Jaffa, sustained a fatal gunshot wound to the head in the neighberhood's Yefet street. Another man was moderately wounded in the shooting. Police are investigating the matter.</p> \n<p>Abu Kaud was known to police, but was said to have moved away from criminal activity and worked in construction.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The most important political struggle in Israel over the past decade centers on the Jewish majority’s relations with the Arab community. With the support of his alternating coalition partners, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put most of his effort into suppressing the aspirations of Israel’s Arab citizens’ to social equality and political freedom of speech. That is the motivation behind a series of laws that have tainted Israeli democracy with racism and exclusion, starting with the so-called Nakba Law and reaching a peak with the so-called nation-state law.</p> \n<p>It also drives the concerted effort of right-wing politicians and media outlets, supported by “centrists” like Yair Lapid, who portray the Arab community’s leaders as enemies. All these were preceded by the abortive attempt to reduce the Arabs’ political representation by raising the electoral threshold.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu and his partners rely on the racism that is prevalent among Israeli Jews, but instead of tempering it and encouraging civil equality and a shared Israeli identity, they foster racism and exclusion in order to perpetuate their rule. This is because the Israeli “left” — that is, the camp that supports dividing the land — will have difficulty retaking power and carrying out its goals unless they collaborate with the Arabs’ elected representatives. That was the political foundation for the Oslo Accords, and the Arab voice in the Knesset has only grown since then.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu understands this well, and is acting to thwart any attempt of rapprochement between Arab and Jewish politicians in Israel. That is the background for the right’s battle against Raja Zaatry, the head of the Hadash party in the Haifa city council, becoming deputy mayor of the city, on the pretext of remarks he has made against the state.</p> \n<p>Haifa's mayor, Einat Kalisch Rotem, gave in somewhat to the pressure, asking Zaatry to retract his comments (he chose to turn down the position), yet insisted on upholding the agreement with Hadash. The mayor’s move inspired Labor Party and Zionist Union Chairman Avi Gabbay to voice support for her. We can only hope that this marks a turning point in Zionist Union, which refused to take part in a demonstration against the nation-state law for fear of being accused of anti-Zionism.</p> \n<p>The positions of Arab politicians such as Zaatry are strident to Zionist ears, even in the left. The opposition’s challenge will be to present a vision of equality and openness in the face of the right’s racism and exclusion, as a foundation for Jewish-Arab cooperation that will lead to a change of government.</p> \n<p>One may assume that if Arab community leaders were to be invited to a partnership through the front door, their remarks will become less oppositional.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The U.S. Senate backed a resolution on Thursday to end U.S. military support for the Saudi Arabian-led war in Yemen, defying President Donald Trump with a historic vote that underscored lawmakers' anger over the murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The votes were largely symbolic because to become law the resolutions would have to pass the House of Representatives, whose Republican leaders have blocked any legislation intended to rebuke the Saudis.&nbsp; In a historic move, Senators voted 56-41 to end U.S. military support for the Saudi Arabian-led campaign in Yemen.</p> \n<p>It was the first time either chamber of Congress had backed a move to withdraw U.S. forces from a foreign military engagement under the War Powers Act.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That law, passed in 1973 during the Vietnam War, limits the president's ability to commit U.S. forces to potential hostilities without congressional approval.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Seven of Trump's fellow Republicans joined Senate Democrats to back the measure.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Immediately after the Yemen vote, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi's murder and insisting that Saudi Arabia hold accountable anyone responsible for his death.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump has said he wants Washington to stand by the Saudi government, and the prince. He promised to veto the war powers resolution.&nbsp; But backers of the resolution and of action against the Saudis, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans, promised to press ahead.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This comes after the U.S. State Department said on Sunday that the U.S. wants to continue support to the&nbsp;Saudi-led coalition in Yemen's war and will remain engaged in efforts to combat Iranian influence and Islamist militancy in the Arab state.</p> \n<p>Earlier Thursday the United Nations secretary general said Yemen's warring sides have agreed after&nbsp;week-long peace talks&nbsp;in Sweden to a province-wide cease-fire in Hodeida and a withdrawal of troops from the contested Red Sea port city.</p>",

Members of his family said he suffered from hearing loss that they thought he must have failed to hear soldiers' warnings. They added that he likely veered off course when he was surprised by the soldiers' presence. According to witness, troops fired dozens of bullets at al-Arda.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of people participated in a Fatah-organized march on Thursday evening in Araba, the town where al-Arda lived, to protest the killing.

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday he would legalize thousands of Jewish homes in the West Bank, hours after two Israeli soldiers were killed and two others were wounded in a shooting attack.</p> \n<p>After Netanyahu's statement, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit formally approved the so-called &quot;market amendment,&quot; which is expected to lead to the legalization of some 2,000 housing units in the West Bank, at the pressure of Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked.</p> \n<p>The amendment is based on an order pertaining to government property in the West Bank, stipulating that &quot;a transaction made in good faith between the custodian of the government property in the territories and another person, regarding a property the custodian believed at the time of the deal to be government property&quot; is valid, even if in fact the land did not belong to the state.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;West Bank spirals into violence as Hamas ups efforts to orchestrate attacks&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This principle was the basis for the Jerusalem District Court ruling in August, which stipulated that the outpost of Mitzpeh Kramim must be legalized. Although this was a singular case, jurists specializing in property law in Israel and the West Bank believe that courts can interpret the ruling to enable mass legalization of homes in the settlements.</p> \n<p>Mendelblit believes this clause can be used to legalize construction on land that was believed to belong to the state when it was allocated to the settlers, even if in fact it didn't. The clause refers to a &quot;transaction,&quot; although in most cases nobody paid for the land.</p> \n<p>The Prime Minister's Office said it would promote the construction of 82 new housing units in the settlement of Ofra, as well as two new industrial zones near the settlements of Avnei Hefetz and Betar Ilit.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu did not specify which buildings the order applies to; that is, whether they are built on state land. Nor did he discuss how he intends to legalize them. The Justice Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office are looking into ways to legalize outposts and existing structures in settlements.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, the Ministerial Committee for Legislation is expected to discuss a bill to legalize a series of outposts and settlements. The proposal seeks to supply settlements whose status has yet to be confirmed with services that would prevent their demolition until they receive official status. The committee, headed by a former head of the Yesha Council of settlements, Pinchas Wallerstein, was set up last year but has yet to meet.</p> \n<p>The bill, proposed by MK Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi), would let government ministries examine budgets and infrastructure needs such as water and electricity. The bill would also permit the construction of schools and other public buildings in unrecognized outposts in settlements that are already recognized. The bill refers to settlements that have been established over the past 20 years.</p> \n<p>&quot;Our response to murderous terrorism must be sharp and clear,&quot; said Yariv Levin, acting head of the ministerial committee and tourism minister. &quot;We will work to continue construction throughout Israel and to strengthen settlements and new settlements.&quot;</p> \n<p>Levin added: &quot;The residents of the settlements are entitled to all municipal services just as any other citizen in Israel, including water and electricity infrastructure, budgets and everything necessary to maintain a normal life.&quot;</p> \n<p>It is not clear what the full implications of the bill would be. Most established outposts are already connected to water and electricity, largely via nearby settlements. The authorities refer to such outposts as recognized localities; budgets from both ministries and West Bank regional councils are transferred to them on an ongoing basis.</p> \n<p>Amid the recent string of terror attacks, the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi party wants the committee to approve a bill that would allow the expulsion of members of terrorists' families within the West Bank. The party's chairman, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, said the debate on the bill, which was originally due to take place weeks ago, was postponed at the request of Netanyahu, who promised to take steps to deter terrorism.</p> \n<p>Bennett, however, intends to move the legislation forward. &quot;Legalization paralyzes the defense establishment,&quot; he said, adding that he would push the bill &quot;despite the opposition by lawmakers close to Netanyahu.&quot;</p> \n<p>The committee is also scheduled to discuss a bill to imprison for one year anyone who flies the flag of the Palestinian Authority at a demonstration. According to the proposal by MK Anat Berko (Likud) “at least three people who publicly rally and raise the flag of an enemy state, entity or body that’s unfriendly to Israel or doesn’t let the Israeli flag be raised in their territory can be imprisoned for up to one year.”</p> \n<p>The bill defines such a perpetrator as someone who does not recognize Israel as a &quot;Jewish and democratic state.&quot;</p> \n<p>Berko added: &quot;Israel, as a democratic state, allows its citizens to protest issues in which they disagree with the authorities' decisions, but the bill draws a line between a legitimate protest and a protest in which there are flags of someone who doesn't recognize Israel, or who doesn't allow Israel to raise its own flag in its territory.&quot; The punishment of such acts would be the prohibition of protests</p>",

According to Meirav, Cohen’s mother Adele struggled with her son’s decision to enlist, worrying about its efrafect on the rest of the family. Meirav, however, being a former pilot who embraced religion after his military service, supported Cohen’s decision.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Meirav established a religious seminary in Tirosh, a small, cooperative farming community near Beit Shemesh. His institution teaches students to go out and work. “He studied with us for a while, and then he wanted to enlist,&quot; the rabbi said of his stepson on Thursday. &nbsp;&quot;I supported that and sent him happily and with love. Last Saturday Yossi told us that he thanked God for giving him the privilege of defending the people of Israel with his body. He was a pure soul.”</p> \n<p>Following Cohen's murder, reports claimed that mother had already mourned him when he enlisted, and that the family had turned its back on him. Many ultra-Orthodox Jews oppose members of their communities entering the army.</p> \n<p>In a conversation with Haaretz, Cohen's mother denied the reports, stating that last Saturday he ate at home with his family as usual. “These rumors are unspeakably evil and low,” she said. “I don’t know if I can forgive anyone for that. It never happened. I’m amazed at how brazen people can be, lying and inventing things that give people a bad name. I don’t know how anyone could devise such a thing.”</p> \n<p>She said there had been no friction regarding her son's decision to join the military. “The reality was that we had embraced religion and he followed another path, and it didn’t suit us,&quot; she said. &quot;But a mother is a mother, loving and protective. Recently he did start coming home, just like he did last Shabbat. He was a pure soul, a holy one. He was all good, giving with endless love.”</p> \n<p>'He was supposed to come home'</p> \n<p>Mor-Yosef’s uncle, Sammy, said that his nephew had been waiting at the bus stop on his way home when he was killed. “It’s hard to grasp,&quot; he said. &quot;An evil person murdered him and we demand that the government find and kill him. The terrorist’s death won’t console the parents. We pray that God gives us strength. He insisted on joining a combat unit despite the situation here. This morning, his father spoke with him. He said that he’d finished a night shift, after which he was supposed to come home.”</p> \n<p>Omer Negev, a close friend of Mor-Yosef, said the soldier had volunteered for a combat role, even though he wasn’t supposed to be a combat soldier. “He was supposed to come home today after completing his duties, but he was murdered just before going home,&quot; his friend said. &quot;This morning he sent a recorded message saying that he was at the junction, and that he loves us.” A family friend added that “he never hurt anyone. He was modest and shy. Enlisting was important to him. He wanted to be a combat soldier. When I asked him, he said: only a combat role.”</p> \n<p>Witnesses of Thursday's attack said the terrorist came out of a car, opened fire, and fled. Army spokesman Brig. Gen. Ronen Menelis said that a preliminary in a car before opening fire at soldiers and civilians waiting at a hitchhiking station. The military has been conducting an extensive manhunt since Thursday at around noon to find the perpetrator or perpetrators. A preliminary investigation indicates that the car escaped towards Ramallah, leading the army to close off the city.</p> \n<p>Defense officials believe that the squad that carried out the attack at the entrance to Ofra earlier in the week was also responsible for Thursday’s attack.</p> \n<p>Yotam Berger, Yaniv Kubovich, Jack Khoury, and Ido Efrati contributed to this article.</p>",

Yossi Cohen took place in Jerusalem, where he will also be buried. Staff Sgt. Yuval Mor-Yosef was brought to rest in the military cemetery in Ashkelon.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cohen’s stepfather, Rabbi Eliyahu Merav, who lost his son-in-law in a terrorist attack in the West Bank nine years ago, eulogized Cohen. “I never believed I would reach this moment. You were totally good, completely pure. Not even 20 years old. You are one of the martyrs. I raised you for a few years, you were all giving and soul. You reached the highest places. Dear Yosef, now you see the senseless hatred that is raging here .... Pray for us from above,” said Merav.</p> \n<p>Cohen’s commander in the army, Mati Shevah, said: “You fell on the mission you were sent on. You were a true warrior. You overcame a great deal of difficulties and all of it with joy and a smile. You were always ready to help everyone, even when everyone was tired.”</p> \n<p>Rabbi Moshe Amar, the chief rabbi of Jerusalem, said that those “who are killed while sanctifying the name of God, no creature can withstand them. Someone who is killed protecting the lives of Jews, we can never understand the level to which he has risen.”</p> \n<p>Cohen grew up and was educated in the Haredi city of Bnei Brak in central Israel. He moved with his family to Beit Shemesh a few years ago, and a few months ago they moved to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Six years ago, he was orphaned from his father, and later his mother remarried. Adel, Cohen’s mother, found it difficult to accept his decision to enlist in the army and was worried about its influence on the rest of the family, said Merav, who served as a pilot before becoming religious after his military service. Merav said he supported Cohen’s decision to enlist in the IDF.</p> \n<p>Merav is the founder of a yeshiva in Moshav Tirosh near Beit Shemesh, which he says teaches its students to go out and work. “He studied with us for a period of time, and after that wanted to enlist. I reinforced [his desire to enlist], supported it and sent him on his way with happiness and love,” said Merav.</p> \n<p>“Last Shabbat, Yossi told us: ‘I thank [God] for granting me to protect the people of Israel with my body.’ A pure soul.”</p> \n<p>Mor-Yosef’s uncle, Sami, said that his nephew had been waiting at the bus stop on his way home when he was killed.</p> \n<p>“It’s hard to grasp,&quot; he said. &quot;An evil person murdered him and we demand that the government find and kill him.

The soldier, 21, suffered severe head trauma and is in life-threatening condition. The woman's condition is improving and she is expected to be moved to a regular ward later on Friday.</p> \n<p>Earlier Friday, an Israeli soldier was seriously wounded during a confrontation with a Palestinian in a military outpost near the West Bank settlement of Beit El.</p> \n<p>According to the Israeli army, a struggle erupted between the soldier and the Palestinian after the latter crossed the&nbsp;West Bank&nbsp;barrier, reached the outpost and attacked the soldier with a rock and a knife.</p> \n<p>After stabbing the soldier and hitting him with a rock, the Palestinian fled the scene and the soldier was evacuated to a hospital for medical care. He is currently sedated and intubated. Israeli security forces are canvassing the area for the assailant, who is also believed to have been wounded in the exchange.</p> \n<p>Forty suspects were arrested Thursday overnight, according to the Israeli army, with 37 said to be Hamas activists.

The authorities refer to such outposts as recognized localities; budgets from both ministries and West Bank regional councils are transferred to them on an ongoing basis.</p> \n<p>Amid the recent string of terror attacks, the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi party wants the committee to approve a bill that would allow the expulsion of members of terrorists' families within the West Bank. The party's chairman, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, said the debate on the bill, which was originally due to take place weeks ago, was postponed at the request of Netanyahu, who promised to take steps to deter terrorism.</p> \n<p>Bennett, however, intends to move the legislation forward. &quot;Legalization paralyzes the defense establishment,&quot; he said, adding that he would push the bill &quot;despite the opposition by lawmakers close to Netanyahu.&quot;</p> \n<p>The committee is also scheduled to discuss a bill to imprison for one year anyone who flies the flag of the Palestinian Authority at a demonstration. According to the proposal by MK Anat Berko (Likud) “at least three people who publicly rally and raise the flag of an enemy state, entity or body that’s unfriendly to Israel or doesn’t let the Israeli flag be raised in their territory can be imprisoned for up to one year.”  The bill defines such a perpetrator as someone who does not recognize Israel as a &quot;Jewish and democratic state.&quot;</p> \n<p>Berko added: &quot;Israel, as a democratic state, allows its citizens to protest issues in which they disagree with the authorities' decisions, but the bill draws a line between a legitimate protest and a protest in which there are flags of someone who doesn't recognize Israel, or who doesn't allow Israel to raise its own flag in its territory.&quot; The punishment of such acts would be the prohibition of protests.</p> \n<p>Manhunt zeroes in on Ramallah</p> \n<p>The Israel Defense Forces is focusing largely on Ramallah in its search for Thursday's assailants, who fled the scene. An abandoned vehicle has been located and the military is inspecting whether it was used by the shooters.</p> \n<p>Also, the Shin Bet security service is using its field agents and technology to find the gunmen. Defense officials had no intelligence pointing to a planned attack –  the latest shooting attack that the security forces failed to prevent.</p> \n<p>&quot;There was massive fire, bullet after bullet, but not in bursts,&quot; said one witness, adding that the shooting lasted several seconds.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The deaths extend a violent week that began with a shooting outside a West Bank settlement on Sunday, resulting in the death of a baby who was delivered prematurely after the attack. The violence continued with the killing of two Palestinians wanted in that and another attack on Israelis in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>The IDF's West Bank Division is currently better staffed than usual, with 14 battalions in the West Bank alongside special units such as the Duvdevan unit, the Border Police's Arab-speaking undercover counterterror unit. Also deployed is the police's special anti-terror unit.</p> \n<p>The IDF spokesman,&nbsp;Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, said a man left a vehicle on Route 60, opened fire and fled.</p> \n<p>Manelis said soldiers were checking the area in search of several assailants, and were setting up checkpoints. Also, the army has sealed off roads leading Ramallah.</p> \n<p>One of the Israelis killed was 20-year-old Staff Sgt.Yovel Mor Yosef. He served in the&nbsp;Netzah Yehuda Battalion in the Kfir Brigade and is survived by his parents and three sisters.</p> \n<p>The two wounded, a male soldier and a woman, were treated by emergency services and taken to hospitals in Jerusalem. The man suffered a gunshot wound to the head and is in severe condition, a hospital said. The woman's condition remains serious but has stabilized, doctors said, adding that her life was no longer in danger.</p>",

        "text":["<p>SAN DIEGO – A small, high cabin with three large windows stands in a green grove. On the raised platform outside the entrance, an old but clean metal pitcher is perched on a portable gas burner. Flip-flops lie in a corner. I, too remove my shoes and enter the small, 9-square-meter room. Quite a few books and four photo albums are hidden behind curtains; on the floor, a thin mattress. Hanging on the wall are three pictures of Buddhist monks, anonymous to me, and another photograph whose subjects I know very well: my parents. The monk who lives in this modest cabin in Southern California is my brother.</p> \n<p>I’ll never forget the day when Yam announced that he was leaving. He’d begun to prepare us a year in advance, and all I could think of then was that I had a year to set things right, a year in which to understand what I had done wrong as a sister and what we had done wrong as a family. The difficulty the decision entailed was still written on his face. He felt responsible, perhaps even guilty, for having ostensibly disappointed us.</p> \n<p>Now, almost two years later, I found a tranquil, sound man. He fits in well in the commando of monks in the Metta Forest Monastery north of San Diego. Like him, the other monks excelled in whatever they did previously, but elected to switch their Western ways for the life of a Buddhist monastic. My brother was a computer programmer at the age of 19 and did his army service in an elite technological unit of the Israel Defense Forces. After his release, companies in the civilian market fought for him, and at the age of 22 he was earning as much as senior high-tech people.</p> \n<p>Like him, most of the other monks here left impressive careers early on. The group includes a physicist, a pilot, two lawyers, a paramedic who was about to complete medical school – and that’s just a partial list of the robed intellectual elite here. And if you’re imagining a withdrawn bunch who, though displaying higher-than-average intelligence, are deficient in human-relations skills, let me say that, like my brother, these young men exude charisma. My brother was always surrounded by friends, and at the time he decided to become a monk he’d been in a years-long relationship with a marvelous woman (he thought so, too, even when he made the decision).</p> \n<p>These monks left a life of material abundance to spend their nights in a sleeping bag, and for one meal a day, humdrum work 12 hours a day and a spiritual cornucopia that, they say, fills them with happiness. Happiness, not euphoria. There is no euphoria in the Metta Forest Monastery. Nor is there any sense of a mission among a community that’s “seen the light,” as one might have expected. People here aren’t eager to explain to others why this is the best thing that ever happened to them. There are no spiritual activities, there’s no invitation to intellectual philosophizing, no Buddhist romanticizing, and above all, no flattering of the Western palate.</p> \n<p>Begging for alms</p> \n<p>The Metta Forest Monastery, which is based on the Thai Forest Tradition of Buddhism, is surrounded by mountains, lying amid avocado groves, and overlooking a never-ending verdant landscape. There are 11 monks, 10 of them Westerners, led by the abbot and meditation teacher Thanissaro Bhikkhu, more popular known as Ajahn Geoff. In addition to the monks, there are a few permanent residents – people who chose to live the religious tradition to the full but are unable to become monks for one reason or another. There’s an overwhelming Western majority in this group, too. Also present are guests, some of whom have come for a few days, others for a few months. Statistically, most of them will be back.</p> \n<p>Members of a vibrant, local Thai community arrive mainly on weekends and enable the monastery to thrive thanks to their donations. (Contrary to my fears, the monastery did not take my brother’s savings, or those of any of the other monks.) In accordance with Buddhist tradition, the community and the monastery have a reciprocal relationship: The community provides the essential material needs for the monastery’s existence (the monks are prohibited from coming into contact with money or using it; they are also barred from owning property), and the monastery supplies the community with what it needs spiritually. This relationship is interesting, even amusing at times, in light of the fact that most of the monks are blue-eyed redheads.</p> \n<p>Visitors to Metta Forest are integrated into its regular schedule, which repeats itself seven days a week. The first meditation begins at 5:30 A.M. and lasts an hour. From 6:45 until 8:30, all the monks, guests and residents perform the morning tasks. Those who aren’t monks usually help prepare the large and magnificent breakfast, made with donated food, in the spick-and-span kitchen. There’s only one daily meal here; for the rest of the day, the monks abstain completely from food or drink, other than water and tea.</p> \n<p>At 8:30, a daily ritual begins in which the monks arrive with their food bowls (monks are prohibited from cooking or preparing food themselves and are dependent on the community’s generosity), into which the eager believers deposit a symbolic portion of rice as alms. The ritual concludes with everyone walking up the hill to the sala, the central meditation hall, where the splendid repast that has been prepared is served. During the monks’ meal, an hour-long ceremony of chanting is conducted, based on Buddhist prayers in the ancient Pali language; translated texts are distributed to those present. The emphasis here is on the principle that every person is responsible for his own fate through his actions, and a wish is recited for all people to be happy and free of suffering. After this daily ritual, residents and guests partake of their meal.</p> \n<p>A cleanup period follows, after which, until 4 P.M., guests are invited to engage in contemplation and meditation, to stroll in the lovely grove, and to read and study. At 4 in the afternoon, everyone returns to the sala for a session of questions and answers with the abbot. Although the questions are naturally spiritual in character, there is no hairsplitting here. In fact, there aren’t always questions. The atmosphere in the Metta Forest Monastery doesn’t encourage chitchat.</p> \n<p>Following the gathering, the guests again donate their time and energy to everyday tasks. At 7 P.M., there is another meditation session with chants, to which everyone comes clean and washed. Bedtime is 8:30.</p> \n<p>All the residents of the monastery are required to follow eight precepts. The five basic Buddhist precepts prohibit taking life, stealing, engaging in forbidden sexual activity, telling lies and consuming alcohol or intoxicating drugs. Those who live in the monastery follow an additional three precepts: They refrain completely from all erotic and even flirtatious activity; from listening to music and dancing; from using cosmetics; from eating more than once a day, and from eating between midday and dawn.</p> \n<p>The 11 monks are committed to observing 219 additional rules, which ensure their material life only to the point of survival. Talking to them is almost impossible. They wander about the grounds, immersed in their world. While striving to achieve control over their thoughts and actions, they must give up notions such as desire, ego and need. The other residents are more amenable to conversation, though all of them are hyper-modest and they are sparing in their words.</p> \n<p>Asfen is a good-looking young Norwegian who is about to take the vows and become a monk. His period of candidacy (a year or so is the standard period) has been studded with physical and mental difficulties intended to test his devotion and commitment to the path. In particular, the question of whether he will be able to wear the robe honorably is put to the test. During this period, candidates live in a remote cabin, learn the Pali language, in which the Buddhist holy texts are written, and also clean, wash, sweep, carry, build and do whatever else is needed.</p> \n<p>Like everyone else here, Asfen is reticent about what he did in his life before coming to sweep the monastery. His fluent English and intelligent comments suggest a past filled with possibilities. Asked what brought him to the monastery and why he decided to become a monk, he replies simply and straightforwardly: “Because it makes me happy.” Everyone here responds in those exact words.</p> \n<p>All options were also apparently available to Tan Tim (“Tan” is an honorific for monks), who grew up in San Diego. He studied physics and was involved with laser systems, his brother is an officer in an elite unit of the United States armed forces, and his father runs a successful business that supplies equipment for solar energy. His parents are an exceptionally warm couple. When I met them, on the morning of my brother’s ordination ceremony, they told me very openly that two years earlier, they’d felt as though Tim’s ordination day was their doomsday. Despite their support, their feeling was that they were attending their son’s funeral.</p> \n<p>“I had expectations for my children from the day they were born,” his father told me the next day. But all those expectations – for him to own a home, have a good job, father children and grandchildren – vanished on the day Tim was ordained as a monk. Still, he said, by the end of that day he was able to understand something else: that he no longer needed to bear the heavy burden of concern for his son.</p> \n<p>“What do I want?” the father continued. “For him to be safe, happy, for him to have it good. So I understood that he’s in a place where he’s looked after, that he looks after himself, that I can be a lot less worried about him. Since then, I’ve felt good about his choice.” He visits his son frequently, he said, at least once every two weeks.</p> \n<p>One happy discovery I made about the monastery – particularly as a relative of someone who has chosen to adopt this foreign world – is that it preserves a place for the monk’s former life for his family, even for his name. Visiting relatives are received with respect and love, and apparently the few objects that remain in the monks’ possession are photos and albums from the past. There’s no penitence, no remorse for past sins, no rebirth names, no erasure of history.</p> \n<p>Danielle, an articulate woman in her early 40s, has lived in Metta Forest for three years. The holder of an MBA from Harvard, she encountered meditation during her undergraduate years, when she studied political science and international relations in preparation for a career in politics. Gradually she drew closer to the tools that Buddhism provides for a life of reduced stress, until finally she decided to forgo a family life and a career, and moved to California in order to learn directly from the master whose talks she had listened to online. Danielle cannot be ordained, because the tradition practiced here does not accommodate female monastics. “But I’d be happy to be a nun if I could,” she told me.</p> \n<p>The gender separation is due to reasons of modesty. According to Buddhist tradition, a group of at least five people is needed in order to maintain a monastery and only a man is allowed to train male monks. The last female nunnery disappeared in the 13th century, and only men now wear the orange robe.</p> \n<p>Edie also gave up a family and a successful career as a family doctor to devote her life to spiritual practice in the monastery. She felt that her work was detracting from her ability to meditate, “and in fact was detracting from my goal of leading a happy life free of tension.” As she had grown up in an American family of Thai origin, her decision to give up her career was perceived as a noble one. She doesn’t live full-time in the monastery, because it’s important for her to be with her parents, too, but she has forsaken the idea of raising a family of her own.</p> \n<p>Forgoing a family is a meaningful point, perhaps the most meaningful. I know my brother wanted children and anticipated that event. Everyone in the family looked forward to the day when he and his partner, who looked like perfect future parents, would have children. I asked him whether he didn’t think it was a waste for someone like him not to have offspring. He smiled the familiar smile that means he doesn’t wish to go into the matter. He was not interested in convincing me how worthwhile his decision was.</p> \n<p>John, a tall American with smiling eyes who retired not long ago, was washing dishes energetically. It’s not his first time here and certainly won’t be his last, but now that he’s retired from his managerial job, he can come for a month at a time. Becoming a monk is out of the question, because he has a family, a wife and children whom he loves, but at the monastery he follows all the rules rigorously. While he scrubs pots, he relates that while Buddhism wasn’t alien to him, growing up in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, it had never especially attracted him. He doesn’t consider himself a spiritual person, but he’s always been drawn to the beauty and simplicity of nature. When he started to meditate and discovered the talks by Ajahn Geoff, however, he found himself enthralled by Buddhism.</p> \n<p>Distorting mindfulness</p> \n<p>Almost everyone in the monastery has one thing in common: They came here after looking for online tools to improve their meditation practice and discovered Ajahn Geoff’s internet talks. It is clear after a conversation with the abbot what has drawn his listeners to California to meet him personally. He has a true radio voice – quietly charismatic, soft yet assertive, with rapid inflections. His speech generates a tranquil, meditative atmosphere.</p> \n<p>Geoff, who’s also blue-eyed, was born Geoffrey DeGraff in 1949, on a ranch in the northern United States. He father was a farmer, and his mother a writer. The Christian spirit and religion, including the value of manual labor, pervaded his home. He was first exposed to Eastern thought as a teenager when a new neighbor who’d moved from California brought over a book titled “Cosmic Consciousness.”</p> \n<p>He took a course in Buddhism when attending Oberlin College and was introduced to meditation. After graduation, he responded to an ad for a teaching position in a university in Thailand, where he began to pursue meditation more seriously. When his mother died, he spent a few months in a monastery in northern Thailand, which he says helped him cope with his bereavement.</p> \n<p>When he got back to regular life, he says, he looked around and realized that no one was as happy as his meditation teacher. “I wanted to be happy, so I went on learning from him until his death.” In 1990, he was invited to join a project to establish a monastery in California. The American monk accompanied the abbot mainly as an interpreter, and when the abbot died, in 1993, Geoffrey became the head of the monastery – Ajahn Geoff.</p> \n<p>From the day of its inception, he says, Metta Forest has avoided all missionary activity, but he doesn’t deny that its popularity is soaring. In the past few years, probably thanks largely to the internet, “the monastery has become truly international,” Ajahn Geoff says. In addition to Americans, there are people who come from France, New Zealand, South America and Scandinavia, “and now we even have an Israeli,” he notes with a smile.</p> \n<p>Following my stubborn effort to understand why people are flocking to his monastery, Ajahn Geoff replies, “I try to maintain the teachings as close as possible to what the Buddha taught, what my teachers taught, without trying to change things to fit with American culture. Some of my analogies are drawn from everyday life in America, but the basic principles are ones I learned over there.”</p> \n<p>Beyond the veneration for monks that exists in the Thai tradition, he explains, Western monks are held in even greater respect. “A young Thai man who has reached a certain age will be encouraged at home to embark on this path,” he says. The respect and prestige that accrue to the monk’s family, and the belief that life in a monastery will endow the young man with important values for life, can encourage a mother who feels that her son is leading a very protected life. “Young women may even urge their potential partner to become a monastic for a few years, and their value in society will rise. Consequently, the motivation of a young person from Thailand might be very different from that of someone from some other culture, who will usually go through the opposite process with his family.” Indeed, this man knows whereof he speaks.</p> \n<p>Does a person have to give up all superficial pleasures in order to achieve happiness?</p> \n<p>“You don’t have to give up all superficial joy; the Buddha said that you don’t have to abandon any pleasures that are in accordance with the dharma [“cosmic law and order”; also, the teachings of Buddha] but it’s going to be an individual matter in many cases, what kind of pleasures those will be. Some people can live in a relatively comfortable environment and strain their mind very well. Other people find that they have to go through more hardship before the mind is willing to settle down. There are certain pleasures, I mean the pleasures that would come from breaking the precepts of killing or stealing or illicit sex, alcohol, lying, those are out. But simple physical pleasures, it would really depend on the individual. It’s useful for a potential practitioner to deny himself something every now and then, to see if he can get along without it.”</p> \n<p>It is the tremendous popularity of meditation and yoga in the West that is bringing people to his monastery, but Ajahn Geoff has mixed feelings about this. “On the one hand,” he notes, “I think it’s good that the Buddhist tradition is made available to other people for them to use. The question is to what extent do these teachings give their best results when they’re taken out of their original context. There are some people who wouldn’t want to come to the original context, people who, you would have to drag them to come to a monastery, but they’d have to go down to a meditation or mindfulness center. But then what’s happened to mindfulness is that it’s become denatured; the Buddha never taught mindfulness as simply being accepting or nonjudgmental about what things happen. Mindfulness for him is the ability to simply keep something in mind, the distinction between the kind of mind states: skillful or unskillful ... if it’s something skillful then how do you nurture it in a skillful way. And this is getting missed.”</p> \n<p>When someone wants to sell something, he observes, “The concern is ‘How do we package it so people will buy it?’ I see many [places] that were originally strictly Buddhist centers moving more and more in that direction, out of concern that the center’s not going to be able to survive unless they ... change the product, basically. And I think this is the reason why the Buddhists set up a monastic order, so that you’d have a tradition where people were living by the original principles as much as possible without any pressure to have to sell.”</p> \n<p>His monastery, the abbot adds, is based on the original tradition. They don’t sell retreats – people are simply invited to come if they’re interested. “This is one of the reasons why it’s always been tradition that dharma is given for free. The books are given for free, the teachings are always made available for free, so if people don’t like it… well, they don’t take the gift, that’s all.”</p> \n<p>After a week of sleeping on the floor, making do with one meal a day, cleaning pots and pans, and very few stimuli, I wondered why it was that despite the criticism I sometimes had (some of the Thai customs, for example, looked to me like a different version of a religious ritual I’m familiar with) – I wanted to return to the monastery. Cynicism doesn’t blur my awareness that, thanks to my brother, I’ve been applying some of the principles of Buddhism and it has improved the quality of my life.</p> \n<p>Concrete changes occurred in my relations with my brother. From the moment he was ordained as a monk, we could no longer hug him, because every form of physical contact is forbidden him. But we’re just as close as we were. Although the honorific “Tan” has been added to his name, our phone calls haven’t changed. We still talk about all the things that are happening in my life – and very little about what’s happening in his.</p> \n<p>We talk a lot about matters of spirit and society, as we always did, and we still laugh at the same jokes. The attempt to understand and to look for a rupture that possibly made my brother and the other monks choose the path they did, didn’t work.</p> \n<p>I ask Ajahn Geoff one last question.</p> \n<p>Do you think there are non-Buddhists who are happy? From your perspective, does everyone suffer?</p> \n<p>“A journalist friend in Bangkok once asked me, ‘Why does Buddhism talk so much about suffering? I don’t suffer in my life.’ And I said, ‘Do you feel any stress?’ He replied, ‘Oh yes, lots of stress.’ And that’s what we’re talking about. You don’t have to be miserable to experience lots of stress in your life, or pressure, and a lot of that is self-inflicted. That’s one of the reasons we meditate: to find out why the mind inflicts these pressures on itself.”</p> \n<p>Maybe people who think less, suffer less?</p> \n<p>“They’re going to get old and they’re going to get sick and they’re going to die at some point. And at that point, you need something to fall back on. This is what meditation provides you with: the skills that are needed not to suffer in situations like that.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>BROOKLYN – New educational requirements issued by New York State’s Education Department for nonpublic and religious schools have the local ultra-Orthodox community up in arms.</p> \n<p>School leaders and prominent rabbis are promising resistance and war if the new rules – dictating secular oversight of Haredi schools, known as yeshivas – are not changed.</p> \n<p>The new regulations, issued by the state’s education department last month, require that students in religious schools be taught subjects such as math, science, English, social studies, art and music for a total of about 34 hours a week.</p> \n<p>That would mean roughly eight hours of secular instruction four days a week. This is widely regarded as impossible, particularly for ultra-Orthodox boys’ yeshivas, which at the high school level currently offer zero or at most 1.5 hours of secular studies a day.</p> \n<p>The new rules will also have public school inspectors visiting yeshivas, beginning next February, to assess compliance.</p> \n<p>If schools refuse to meet the new requirements, they will lose the public funding they currently receive for record-keeping, school meals, computer systems, and the like. If a school is deemed not to be meeting the new rules, parents will have 30 to 45 days to put their children in another school. If they don’t, they could – at least in theory – be arrested for truancy, according to the state.</p> \n<p>Though the issue of enforcing secular studies on Haredim has long been a hot-button issue in Israel (critics argue that a lack of proper education leaves the ultra-Orthodox dangerously unequipped for the modern world), it has only become an issue in the United States in the last two years, with New York City serving as the key battleground.</p> \n<p>Sounding the alarm</p> \n<p>Over the summer, a nonprofit group, Young Advocates for Fair Education, filed a lawsuit against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the education department’s top two officials, saying a recently amended law that relaxed academic standards at ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools would ensure that their students would continue to receive “a sub-standard secular education.”</p> \n<p>The first hearings in the suit will take place in January, Naftuli Moster, Yaffed’s founder and executive director, tells Haaretz.</p> \n<p>The suit certainly seemed to sound an alarm bell with the education department. Initially, it was investigating just 30 ultra-Orthodox yeshivas, compared with now pledging to examine all of them.</p> \n<p>Defenders of the yeshiva system say parents have the right to send their children to schools that provide a Jewish education consistent with their beliefs and traditions. There are nearly 275 Orthodox Jewish yeshivas in New York State, but some are Modern Orthodox schools that provide a full secular curriculum alongside religious studies.</p> \n<p>Although the schools are private, they are not entirely free of government oversight, as a state law requires that instruction in nonpublic schools be substantially equivalent to the instruction given at public schools.</p> \n<p>The current guidelines expand that oversight and Haredi leaders are furious, with at least one describing it as “war.”</p> \n<p>In a speech late last month at a warehouse packed with Hasidim in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Satmar Rebbe Aharon Teitelbaum vowed that “the Jewish people will not surrender to the wicked, whoever they may be, even the state education commissioner. … We will not comply and we will not follow the state education commissioner under any circumstances.</p> \n<p>“A great battle awaits us, a difficult war, a long war, until we are able to correct it all,” he continued. “We must speak to the leaders of the Democratic Party, who are now at the head of the leadership in New York State. … It wouldn’t pay for them to start a war with all God-fearing Jewry in New York.”</p> \n<p>The state’s education department did not respond to requests for comment about Teitelbaum’s statements and other strong responses from the ultra-Orthodox community.</p> \n<p>A petition started by the head of a yeshiva on Change.org, titled “Yeshiva Parents Tell the State: Don’t Try to Bully Us or Our Schools!” has already garnered nearly 20,000 signatures.</p> \n<p>The Flatbush Jewish Journal, which serves the Haredi communities in New Jersey, New York and Rockland County, has a box on its cover this week declaring: “Crisis Update: State Ignoring the Yeshivas’ Request for Clarification, and Yeshiva Tuition Will Go Up!”</p> \n<p>Other Haredi authorities are taking a more diplomatic approach, calling out the guidelines for being unrealistic.</p> \n<p>In a November 27 letter to MaryEllen Elia, New York State’s education commissioner, rabbinic advisory board members of the Haredi education organization Torah u’Mesorah wrote that the materials provided by the Education Department “seem to impose a rigid set of requirements that no yeshiva in New York can satisfy.” Rabbi Yisroel Reisman, the head of Yeshiva Torah Vodaath, co-signed the letter with Rabbi Eliyahu Brudny of Mirrer Yeshiva.</p> \n<p>In a video published by Agudah News, Reisman called the new rules a threat. “It’s immediate, and we must wake up to it before we wake up one morning and the yeshivas are being closed down. … Many thought they would start only with the weaker schools, the schools that don’t teach any English at all. Well, the news is that the goyim see us all in the same light. We’re all ultra-Orthodox fanatics, we all deprive our children of a proper education – never mind the fact that most of our yeshivas score far higher on the public tests than the 60 percent proficiency rates of the … public schools. This all doesn’t matter,” he said.</p> \n<p>‘Government overreach’</p> \n<p>Agudath Israel of America also requested more information about the new requirements from the education department, but has yet to receive a response, its chief of staff and associate director of education, Avrohom Weinstock, tells Haaretz. The new regulations “are government overreach,” he says. “This is new ground and abridging our ability to function as Jews.”</p> \n<p>The updated requirements even proved too much for the person who has pushed for increased secular education in yeshivas since 2012. Moster, who was raised a Belz Hasid in Brooklyn, says he set up Yaffed after realizing he had finished yeshiva high school without a basic education in things like math and English.</p> \n<p>Moster says six or seven hours of secular studies in yeshivas “is unrealistic,” adding: “But state should have at least three or four hours a day.”</p> \n<p>The Agudah, which represents Haredi interests to government officials, as well as providing guidance directly to schools, concurs.“While we don’t have an issue at all with health and safety requirements,” says Weinstock, “here the state went one step further – more like three steps further. They’re saying not only do you have to comply with statutory requirements, but we will also proactively go into your schools. With 34 or 35 hours a week, it appears to be even more onerous requirements than public schools have. We’re scratching our heads. How could any Jewish school function?” he asks.</p> \n<p>Weinstock says many people are not thrilled when the education department says it wants to become so heavily involved in the running of yeshivas. “Should the state be telling nonpublic schools this many hours or that many hours? It’s a slippery slope, and we’re going down it,” he warns.</p> \n<p>Most Orthodox yeshivas are located in the New York boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, with some in Manhattan and Staten Island. Others are in Rockland County, which is home to Haredi strongholds Monsey, Kiryas Joel and New Square.</p> \n<p>New York State law has long required religious schools to offer instruction that is “substantially equivalent” to the secular education offered in public schools. But the education department has permitted Haredi yeshivas to self-certify that they are doing so. The yeshivas have long claimed that talmudic study offers that “substantial equivalency” and actually provides a superior education to the one public school students receive.</p> \n<p>Yaffed published a 90-page report last year, “Non-Equivalent: The State of Education in New York City’s Hasidic Yeshivas,” detailing the secular studies offered at a range of Haredi high schools. At Bais Yaakov in Borough Park, for instance, girls are taught English, math, science, social studies, physical education and art. However, at the Belz, Satmar, Pupa and Lubavitch boys’ yeshiva high schools, they get none, the report says.</p> \n<p>Non-Hasidic Haredi institutions, like Brooklyn’s Torah Vodaath and Mirrer Yeshiva, tend to provide more secular studies to students than their Hasidic equivalents, many of which teach only in Yiddish. Haredi girls of both streams are generally offered far more secular classes since, unlike men, they are expected to find work and generate income for their future households.</p> \n<p>In fact, students at Haredi girls’ high schools receive enough of a secular education to score well on the New York State Regents Exams – a series of tests that are given at all public high schools. On Wednesday, the Jewish Press touted them as evidence of the effectiveness of Haredi education, though the Orthodox newspaper did not mention the fact that nearly all the high-scoring Haredi schools teach girls.</p> \n<p>Goy with a yarmulke</p> \n<p>Another aspect of the new guidelines will ensure that teachers of secular studies in yeshivas are qualified educators – something many of the present teachers in boys’ yeshivas (Haredi ones in particular) are not.</p> \n<p>Just ask Yitz Finkelstein. While he was a college student, he was also teaching secular subjects at the Satmar boys’ yeshiva United Talmudical Academy, Williamsburg. The lessons were at the end of the school day, which is when secular topics are always scheduled.</p> \n<p>“I taught first grade from 3:30 to 4:40 P.M. and fourth grade started at 5 P.M. I was not in any way qualified to do this,” Finkelstein said, speaking as a panelist at a Yaffed event in Brooklyn on Monday. “There was no real support or talk of lesson plans, and children were openly disdainful,” he added.</p> \n<p>“They called me goy and shegetz right to my face,” he said, even though he is Jewish and wore a yarmulke while teaching there. Secular education at the school was so bad, Finkelstein added, that “I had fourth-graders who couldn’t spell their own names in English.”</p> \n<p>It’s not just the ultra-Orthodox&nbsp; community that is angry, though. Catholic schools said this week they will not let state inspectors through their doors and are willing to lose the government funding they receive.</p> \n<p>Moster praises the direction New York’s education department is taking, even if he feels it has for now set unrealistic expectations.</p> \n<p>“For so many decades yeshivas basically operated outside the law, and don’t understand why someone is now demanding a basic standard,” he says. “But we’re just asking for basics. We’re not asking they prep kids for Harvard, but that they give kids a basic education.”</p> \n<p>But Weinstock warns that the Haredi community is ready to fight the education department over these guidelines, no matter how long it takes.</p> \n<p>“We don’t use the word war, but at the same time we have to make sure our religious freedoms and way of life are preserved,” he says. “We won’t walk away from that. It would be un-American to think otherwise.</p>",

        "text":["<p>An Israeli soldier sustained serious wounds during a confrontation with a Palestinian on Friday in a military outpost near the West Bank settlement of Beit El.</p> \n<p>According to the Israeli army, a struggle ensued between the soldier and the Palestinian after the latter crossed the West Bank barrier, reached the outpost and attacked the soldier with a rock and a knife.</p> \n<p>After stabbing the soldier and hitting him with a rock, the Palestinian fled the scene and the soldier was evacuated to a hospital for medical care. He is currently sedated and intubated. Israeli security forces are canvassing the area for the assailant, who is also believed to have been wounded in the exchange.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;West Bank spirals into violence as Hamas ups efforts to orchestrate attacks&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Netanyahu's two greatest fears have suddenly materialized | Analysis</p> \n<p>Also Friday, the Israeli army said it operated in Ramallah on Thursday night as the manhunt continues for the shooters responsible for a deadly drive-by attack in which two Israeli soldiers were killed and another two were wounded, and in which the perpetrator stole a soldiers' weapon before fleeing.</p> \n<p>The man, who suffered severe head trauma and went through complex surgery, is still in intensive care and in life-threatening condition. The woman, Shira Sabag, is improving and expected to move to a regular ward later on Friday.</p> \n<p>Forty suspects were arrested Thursday overnight, according to the Israeli army, with 37 said to be Hamas activists. In a joint operation with the Border Police, Shin Bet and Israel Police, the suspects were detained for suspected involvement in terrorist activity and rioting.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Hamas on Thursday that Israel won't have a Gaza cease-fire if terrorism in the West Bank continues, a senior official said.</p> \n<p>The military has sealed off Ramallah and set up roadblocks throughout the area. Most of the activity was centered around Ayoush Square, near the entrance to Ramallah.</p> \n<p>Israeli defense officials increasingly believe that the Hamas cell responsible for last week's attack near the West Bank settlement of Ofra is also behind today's attack.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu&nbsp;also said he would legalize thousands of Jewish homes in the West Bank, hours after two Israeli soldiers were killed and two others were wounded in a shooting attack.</p> \n<p>The Prime Minister's Office said it would promote the construction of 82 new housing units in the settlement of Ofra, as well as two new industrial zones near the settlements of Avnei Hefetz and Betar Ilit.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, who is also defense minister, ordered the military to expedite the demolition of terrorists' homes to within 48 hours after an attack.</p> \n<p>&quot;Our guiding principle is that whoever attacks us and whoever tries to attack us will pay with his life,&quot; Netanyahu said. &quot;Our enemies know this and we will find them,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;we will settle accounts with whoever did this.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu also ordered an increased presence of Israeli forces in the West Bank, the detention of Hamas operatives in the area, the placement of roadblocks and the denial of permits for terrorists’ families to stay in Israel.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu did not specify which buildings the order applies to; that is, whether they are built on state land. Nor did he discuss how he intends to legalize them. The Justice Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office are looking into ways to legalize outposts and existing structures in settlements.</p> \n<p>Strengthening the settlements</p> \n<p>On Sunday, the Ministerial Committee for Legislation is expected to discuss a bill to legalize a series of outposts and settlements. The proposal seeks to supply settlements whose status has yet to be confirmed with services that would prevent their demolition until they receive official status. The committee, headed by a former head of the Yesha Council of settlements, Pinchas Wallerstein, was set up last year but has yet to meet.</p> \n<p>The bill, proposed by MK Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi), would let government ministries examine budgets and infrastructure needs such as water and electricity. The bill would also permit the construction of schools and other public buildings in unrecognized outposts in settlements that are already recognized. The bill refers to settlements that have been established over the past 20 years.</p> \n<p>&quot;Our response to murderous terrorism must be sharp and clear,&quot; said Yariv Levin, acting head of the ministerial committee and tourism minister. &quot;We will work to continue construction throughout Israel and to strengthen settlements and new settlements.&quot;</p> \n<p>Levin added: &quot;The residents of the settlements are entitled to all municipal services just as any other citizen in Israel, including water and electricity infrastructure, budgets and everything necessary to maintain a normal life.&quot;</p> \n<p>It is not clear what the full implications of the bill would be. Most established outposts are already connected to water and electricity, largely via nearby settlements. The authorities refer to such outposts as recognized localities; budgets from both ministries and West Bank regional councils are transferred to them on an ongoing basis.</p> \n<p>Amid the recent string of terror attacks, the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi party wants the committee to approve a bill that would allow the expulsion of members of terrorists' families within the West Bank. The party's chairman, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, said the debate on the bill, which was originally due to take place weeks ago, was postponed at the request of Netanyahu, who promised to take steps to deter terrorism.</p> \n<p>Bennett, however, intends to move the legislation forward. &quot;Legalization paralyzes the defense establishment,&quot; he said, adding that he would push the bill &quot;despite the opposition by lawmakers close to Netanyahu.&quot;</p> \n<p>The committee is also scheduled to discuss a bill to imprison for one year anyone who flies the flag of the Palestinian Authority at a demonstration. According to the proposal by MK Anat Berko (Likud) “at least three people who publicly rally and raise the flag of an enemy state, entity or body that’s unfriendly to Israel or doesn’t let the Israeli flag be raised in their territory can be imprisoned for up to one year.”  The bill defines such a perpetrator as someone who does not recognize Israel as a &quot;Jewish and democratic state.&quot;</p> \n<p>Berko added: &quot;Israel, as a democratic state, allows its citizens to protest issues in which they disagree with the authorities' decisions, but the bill draws a line between a legitimate protest and a protest in which there are flags of someone who doesn't recognize Israel, or who doesn't allow Israel to raise its own flag in its territory.&quot; The punishment of such acts would be the prohibition of protests.</p> \n<p>Manhunt zeroes in on Ramallah</p> \n<p>The Israel Defense Forces is focusing largely on Ramallah in its search for Thursday's assailants, who fled the scene. An abandoned vehicle has been located and the military is inspecting whether it was used by the shooters.</p> \n<p>Also, the Shin Bet security service is using its field agents and technology to find the gunmen. Defense officials had no intelligence pointing to a planned attack –  the latest shooting attack that the security forces failed to prevent.</p> \n<p>&quot;There was massive fire, bullet after bullet, but not in bursts,&quot; said one witness, adding that the shooting lasted several seconds.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The deaths extend a violent week that began with a shooting outside a West Bank settlement on Sunday, resulting in the death of a baby who was delivered prematurely after the attack. The violence continued with the killing of two Palestinians wanted in that and another attack on Israelis in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>The IDF's West Bank Division is currently better staffed than usual, with 14 battalions in the West Bank alongside special units such as the Duvdevan unit, the Border Police's Arab-speaking undercover counterterror unit. Also deployed is the police's special anti-terror unit.</p> \n<p>The IDF spokesman,&nbsp;Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, said a man left a vehicle on Route 60, opened fire and fled.</p> \n<p>Manelis said soldiers were checking the area in search of several assailants, and were setting up checkpoints. Also, the army has sealed off roads leading Ramallah.</p> \n<p>One of the Israelis killed was 20-year-old Staff Sgt.Yovel Mor Yosef. He served in the&nbsp;Netzah Yehuda Battalion in the Kfir Brigade and is survived by his parents and three sisters.</p> \n<p>The two wounded, a male soldier and a woman, were treated by emergency services and taken to hospitals in Jerusalem. The man suffered a gunshot wound to the head and is in severe condition, a hospital said. The woman's condition remains serious but has stabilized, doctors said, adding that her life was no longer in danger.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Health Ministry issued new regulations to make it easier to identify the use of a “date-rape drug” in cases of sexual assault.</p> \n<p>The new rules, distributed to hospital directors and the division heads of HMOs last week, for the first time lay out clear and obligatory procedures for conducting the tests to identify the presence of such drugs in women who have complained of sexual assault under the influence of such incapacitating substances.</p> \n<p>Traces of such drugs are difficult to find because they usually disappear from the body in less than 12 hours.</p> \n<p>Until now, testing for date-rape drugs was at the discretion of the medical staff involved. The new rules require medical staff to take blood and urine samples in every case of a report of suspected sexual assault that may involve alcohol or any other suspected substances. Even in cases in which the victim feels paralyzed or unable to respond, it is now required to take blood and urine samples immediately.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Not just Weinstein: The year #MeToo shocked the Jewish world</p> \n<p>“Over the years, many hundreds of complaints were recorded of women who were sexually assaulted through the use of ‘date-rape drugs,’” said Dr. Ronny Berkowitz, the director of the Health Ministry’s division of Enforcement and Inspection, who is behind the initiative for the new regulations. But it was impossible to verify in the laboratory the vast majority of the claims of the use of the drugs, said Berkowitz.</p> \n<p>“The reason is related to the speed in which these substances dissipate from the body, in a period of hours, but also because of the lack of an established procedure that describes the order of immediate actions that must be taken the minute cases of this type reach the medical system” added Berkowitz.</p> \n<p>Lacking such official procedures, the decision to take blood and urine samples to identify the use of date-rape drugs was at the discretion of the medical staff treating the specific victim. “Even in cases in which urine samples were taken within f hours, they were not frozen and in practice they were useless even before they reached the lab,” said Berkowitz. Until now, the Health Ministry has received only a few samples of date-rape drugs for testing every year.</p> \n<p>Because the drugs dissipate so quickly, the new regulations require freezing samples immediately. “Freezing the sample is critical and has not been required by any procedure until now,” said Berkowitz. “It enables dealing with the sample over a period of six months.”</p> \n<p>The group of date-rape drugs includes substances with a sedative or sleep-inducing effect such as ketamine, Gamma-hydroxybutyrate&nbsp;(GHB) and gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL). It also includes strong tranquilizers, hypnotics and central nervous system depressants such as flunitrazepam and nitrazepam, along with many others.</p> \n<p>“Remnants of date rape drugs disappear from bodily fluids in eight to 10 hours, when we are talking about GBL, and up to a day or two in the case of Ketamine or Flunitrazepam,” states the new regulations. “Recently, we have witnessed an abundance of cases of the victims of sexual assault who were possibly exposed to a ‘date-rape drug,’ but remnants of the substance were not found in their bodies. This fact makes it difficult to continue treatment from the clinical aspect, and from the aspect of legal evidence.”</p> \n<p>The new procedures also stipulate that the Health Ministry will bear the costs of sending the frozen samples to the only lab in Israel that now carries out the tests for date-rape drugs, at the Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer, near Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>It is also worth noting that scientific possibilities exist to identify remnants of the drug much later, sometimes even up to six months after the incident. But no laboratory exists in Israel that conducts such tests, and only a few such labs exist anywhere in the world – including in Italy, France and the United States. In light of the existing difficulties in identifying the presence of the drug immediately, Israeli hospitals often send hair samples from the complainants for testing outside of Israel, but these tests are relatively expensive.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The tear gas still burned the eyes on Saturday, four hours after Israeli army troops blew up the Abu Hmeid family’s home in the small Amari refugee camp at the entrance to the West Bank town of El Bireh. One of the family's sons, Islam Abu Hmeid, is accused of killing an Israeli soldier, Ronen Lubarsky, by dropping a marble slab on him during an army raid on the refugee camp in May.</p> \n<p>At the eastern entrance to the camp, stones were strewn on the road, evidence of a nighttime confrontation with the army, but one less harsh than might have been expected. Along the narrow main road that leads up a hill, there were no signs of a clash or of any extraordinary anger or shock. The demolished home was on the top of the hill, next to the main road leading from Jerusalem Street, passersby said matter-of-factly, as if they had been asked where the local picture framer's shop was. The street is under the jurisdiction of the town of El Bireh and the military force used it to deploy in the area at around 1:20 A.M. on Saturday.</p> \n<p>No official notice was issued in advance of the demolition of the house, but members of the anti-settlement popular committees had ensconced themselves on the top floor in an attempt to physically delay the demolition.</p> \n<p>For his part, Bassem Tamimi from the Palestinian village of Nabi Saleh was convinced that the army wouldn’t violate the Sabbath, so he didn’t join his colleagues at the Amari camp. But Abdullah Abu Rahmeh of Bil’in and Munzir Amira of the Aida refugee camp, both activists of the popular committees, were correct in their assessment that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would seek to fulfill his promise and speed up home demolitions and have them carried out within 48 hours.</p> \n<p>Supreme Court Justices Yael Willner and Daphne Barak-Erez had already backed the military commander’s order to destroy Abu Hmeid’s home. The third justice on the panel, Justice George Karra, had supported the destruction of only two floors — the first floor, where Abu Hmeid’s mother, Latifa, lived with her son Islam along with another son who is currently being held in Israeli administrative detention; and the fourth floor, which was still being built and had been intended to serve as a home for Islam. Another of Islam's brothers, who is serving a life sentence, had lived on the second floor of the house. The third floor was rented out to another family.</p> \n<p>Justice Karra had thought it would be physically possible and appropriate from the standpoint of proportionality to leave the second and third floors standing, but his two colleagues ruled that the aim of the demolition order was deterrence. They therefore also supported an expropriation order that would bar any rebuilding of the home, despite its location in Area A, the portion of the West Bank where the Palestinian Authority is allowed to exercise civil and policing functions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As reflected in the information provided to the court, deterrence hadn’t worked with the Abu Hmeid family in the past. Four of the family's sons are serving life sentences in prison for murders that they viewed as part of the opposition to the Israeli occupation. The Israeli army destroyed their house for the first time in 1990. After it was rebuilt in 1996 and other sons were convicted of other crimes, the army demolished it again in 2003.</p> \n<p>Following the third demolition on Saturday, several members of the Abu Hmeid family, joined by other individuals who came to show support, sat in a large tent on the sidewalk across the street from the site of the home. Islam Abu Hmeid's 72-year-old mother, Latifa, had gone to rest at her brothers’ home, but a number of media outlets had quoted her as saying that, even though this was the third time that the Israelis were destroying her home, they were mistaken if they thought it would frighten her or her family,</p> \n<p>Considerable force was used to remove Abu Rahmeh and the other members of the popular committees who had tried to hole themselves up in the house. “I’ve been beaten up before by soldiers,“ said the former teacher, who over the past decade has been trying to revive unarmed popular opposition to the occupation. “But this time it was more painful than usual.”</p> \n<p>The soldiers assembled the popular committee members and neighbors of the Abu Hmeid family home in the playground of a nearby school and left them out in the cold for several hours. The soldiers took the women to a building belonging to the Red Crescent emergency medical service.</p> \n<p>Two sisters living in a house near the Abu Hmeids said they thought the explosives used to demolish that house would also destroy a portion of their own home. Masked soldiers had bursted into their house around 1 A.M., they said, breaking down a door, rummaging through their closets and breaking some items. “You know how they behave,” one of the two girls said.</p> \n<p>They said they were then led to the schoolyard. When they returned, they were pleasantly surprised to see all the walls of their home still standing, although there was some damage. A window had been blown out by the force of the blast. The water tank on the roof had broken open and water was leaking from it into the hallway. Windows' glass had been broken and furniture and bed linens were covered with dust, “but the main thing is that none of the books were damaged,”&nbsp;said one of the two, who was studying for her high school matriculation exams</p> \n<p>“She spoke in English to the soldiers who had burst in and that calmed them down,” her mother said proudly.</p> \n<p>Earlier Palestinian media had reported that there were clashes between the soldiers and armed Palestinians in the course of the army's operations, but the reports were not true.</p> \n<p>“What good does shooting do?” Abu Rahmeh, of the popular committees, asked. “Maybe somebody gets a moment of satisfaction, but it would just provide the army with an excuse to destroy the entire camp.”</p> \n<p>Trying to head off another home demolition</p> \n<p>Abu Rahmeh, who faces a possible four months in prison if his appeal is denied on Tuesday for riding a bicycle in his village while it was declared a closed military zone, quickly moved on to his next mission — organizing people to barricade themselves inside the home of the Barghouti family in the West Bank village of Kobar. The home is slated for demolition, people assume, based on Netanyahu's declarations. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>On Wednesday afternoon, residents of the West Bank village of Surda near Ramallah called Omar Bargouthi to say they had seen people shooting at his son Saleh’s car from a taxi while he was on his way home from work in Ramallah. Omar Barghouti, who is 67, was released in a 1985 prisoner exchange with Israel, but later spent about 11 years in administrative detention without trial.</p> \n<p>“They saw that Saleh had been taken out of his taxi alive,” his mother, Suheir, recounted on Friday, her eyes red. People who had disguised themselves as vegetable salesmen had bundled him into their car and disappeared with him, it was said.</p> \n<p>Word of the incident spread and neighbors and relatives began to gather at the family’s home in Kobar. Later the army notified the family that Saleh was suspected of carrying out the shooting attack near Ofra on Sunday of last week. They said he had been killed while trying to flee. Seven Israelis were wounded in that shooting attack, including a woman who was pregnant. Her premature baby was later delivered but died in the hospital.</p> \n<p>At around 8:30 P.M., the army broke into the Barghouti home, separated the men from the women and held them in separate rooms for several hours. Explosions from stun grenades could be heard throughout the large village. After midnight, the soldiers arrested Omar Barghouti and his eldest son. A lawyer who visited the father and son informed her that they were taken to Jerusalem's Muskobia detention center for interrogation.</p> \n<p>In anticipation of the demolition of their house in Kobar, the Barghouti family has emptied it of most of its contents, including door frames and light bulbs. Some furniture remained in the living room, including chairs on which dozens of women sat grieving on Friday.</p> \n<p>“God, give us the patience to bear the pain,” one of the elderly women said. In addressing God, she added: &quot;Revenge is up to you, not us.&quot; Life on earth is a laboratory, a younger woman remarked, meaning that Saleh Salah’s life in eternity in the next world is what is important. Allah wanted him, he was God’s favorite, said other women, their sobs and tears proving that the separation is difficult even if you believe in God’s will.</p> \n<p>Referring to the Israelis, Suheir Barghouti said: &quot;You’re the terrorists. That’s what I told Captain Diab who came with the soldiers,” Captain &quot;Diab&quot; being an officer from the Shin Bet security service. She is experienced with tthis kind of conversation with Shin Bet officers who have broken many times into her home to arrest or warn her husband in the past.</p> \n<p>About a year and a half ago, after another such visit, Omar Barghouti told Haaretz: “I told the captain that I retain the right to hate the occupation and you, and to continue saying that I hate the occupation.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Raja Za’atry, the leader of Haifa’s Palestinian communist party Hadash, basked in a moment of glory after the ill-advised decision by Haifa’s newly-elected mayor, Einat Kalisch-Rotem, to appoint him as deputy mayor. She was under the impression that he represented Haifa’s Arab population and that they shared his support for the terrorist organizations Hamas and Hezbollah who have pledged to bring about Israel’s destruction. He eagerly accepted this role as representative of Haifa’s Arab population, though as he well knows this is not the way he is seen by most of Haifa’s Arab residents.</p> \n<p>Most communist parties have disappeared from the world stage in recent years, but the Palestinian communists continue to hold on, well-organized and manipulative. They support Palestinian terrorism, as well as Bashar Assad in Damascus and his allies, Hezbollah and the Iranian ayatollahs.</p> \n<p>Is there any reason to believe that the majority of Haifa’s Arabs support these views and that the local communist leader should therefore be Haifa’s deputy mayor? Or that many of them would like to see Haifa turned into another Beirut or Damascus?</p> \n<p>Twenty percent of Haifa’s population is Arab. It is a city famous for years for peaceful co-existence between its Jewish and Arabs residents. About a third of Haifa’s Arab residents are Muslims and are unlikely to be counted among the supporters of the Haifa Front, the communist-led party cobbled together by Raja Za’atry for the municipal elections. It attained 6.7 percent of the municipal vote, or approximately one third of the votes cast by Arab citizens in the Haifa elections. The rest obviously rejected the communist-front organization led by Za’atry, and do not look to him or his associates to protect their interests in the city.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Haifa Residents Can Die of Pollution, as Long as There’s No Arab Deputy Mayor&nbsp;| Opinion ■&nbsp;Mayor of Haifa, Don’t Give In&nbsp;| Editorial</p> \n<p>What happened in Haifa is typical of the success the Palestinian communists are having in creating the impression that they represent Israel’s Arab citizens and that they all share their radical views. It is making a negative impression on many of Israel’s Jewish citizens and can only increase tensions between Jews and Arabs in Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The latest increase in the parliamentary threshold gave them a great boost, allowing them to present contrasting Arab ideological positions (communist, Nasserist, Islamist) under one roof, giving the impression that these positions were somehow shared by all Arab citizens. It was the law of unintended consequences at work again.</p> \n<p>What was advertised as a move to increase the stability of Israel’s parliamentary system created the most unstable coalition government in Israel’s political history. And worse by far, it created the impression that Israel’s Arab citizens had only a single choice when it came to voting for the Knesset. The possibility of a moderate Arab party making it into the Knesset has come close to zero.</p> \n<p>The recent municipal elections in the Arab sector seem to indicate that Balad, the most extreme anti-Israel component of the (Arab) Joint List, is losing ground and may disappear from the Israeli political scene, and thus possibly contribute to the dissolution of the Joint List.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The contrast between the successful integration of many of Israel’s Arab citizens in the Israeli economy and society and the anti-Israel rhetoric of the Arab political parties that claim to represent them seems too great to last. In time it is bound to affect the Arab representation on the Israeli political scene.</p> \n<p>Two-thirds of Haifa’s Arabs rejected the communist-front party led by Raja Za’atry, and didn’t want him as deputy mayor.</p>",

Gen. Roni Ritman. Ritman, before resigning amid sexual harassment allegations, had headed the prestigious police unit Lahav 433, which had been investigating the corruption allegations against Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>The case Mudrik is hearing against T. involves not observing clocking-in regulations and for conduct unbecoming a police officer when she said of other policewomen that “they’re stupid and don’t understand anything about life.” According to the police, the conflict of interest exists because some of the officers scheduled to testify to the tribunal were involved in the Netanyahu investigations.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Recently there were media reports hinting that the prime minister’s associates might have been behind T.’s earlier struggles against Ritman. As a result, Mudrik asked both sides, the police and T., if they saw any problem with him continuing as head of the disciplinary tribunal.</p> \n<p>T. last week told the tribunal that reports hinting that the prime minister was somehow behind the battle she had waged against Ritman were false. “These insinuations have no grain of truth and constitute a serious libel,” she said. Removing Mudrik would disrupt the proceedings, she contended. T. also asked for the police to clarify that “there’s no grounds for linking Supt. T. to the prime minister.”</p> \n<p>But the police refused to do this. In the response submitted Sunday the police wrote that it was true that, “Representatives of the prosecution are not involved in the investigations of the prime minister and are not exposed to the materials collected by them, so they cannot express a firm position on the question the head of the tribunal has asked them.”</p> \n<p>However, the police also said that during the disciplinary hearings, there will be witnesses for the plaintiff [the police] that are involved in the prime minister’s investigations, “Which could raise a concern of conflict of interest, if only seemingly,” given that the presiding jurist is now the prime minister’s lawyer. The police also argued that in previous hearings T. and her commander had indicated that they planned to summon both former Police Commissioner Roni Alsheikh and Ritman himself to testify. This would certainly pose a conflict of interest, given that Ritman had headed Lahav 433 during the Netanyahu investigations.</p> \n<p>T. on Sunday called the whole disciplinary procedure “a vengeful pursuit against her.”</p> \n<p>At a conference two weeks ago Mudrik said that since he started working for the prime minister, he was examining all his activities to avoid being involved in anything that would pose a conflict of interest or be otherwise inappropriate.</p>",

The law also allows the finance minister to guarantee mortgages given for the purchase of apartments in these outposts.</p> \n<p>The bill was approved unanimously by the committee, which also decided that these steps would be followed until a special task force would decide on the question of legalizing the outposts.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;I feel no sympathy for the settlers&nbsp;■&nbsp;Settlers embrace new strategy in bid to achieve million-resident vision&nbsp;■ Editorial:&nbsp;Israel has weaponized the settlements&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The law, even if approved, will have marginal effects, since enforcement in these outposts is already suspended, pending High Court of Justice decisions on petitions opposing the so-called&nbsp;land-grab law&nbsp;that would enable the legalization of outposts even if these were built on private Palestinian land. In the meantime, the sides agreed that the Civil Administration would not demolish any illegal structures that may come under the proposed law.</p> \n<p>It should be noted that most of the established outposts are already hooked up to water and electricity, usually via adjacent settlements. The authorities see these outposts as recognized settlements and budgets are routinely transferred to them, both from the government and local West Bank councils. In some cases, the local councils erect illegal public buildings, as revealed several times by Haaretz, with no one enforcing the law against them.</p> \n<p>The new bill aims at forcing the government to make a decision regarding these outposts within two years, but since the government has a majority in the Knesset, even if no decision is made in two years, the deadline could be extended.</p> \n<p>In any case, a High Court of Justice ruling on the law’s constitutionality is also required. If the new proposed law regarding settlement authorization is deemed unconstitutional, as believed by the attorney general, it will not be possible to resolve the status of these outposts.</p> \n<p>At the cabinet meeting, Deputy Attorney General Ran Nizri expressed vehement opposition to this bill, saying it was unconstitutional. He believes that passing this law would cause a sweeping violation of property rights and cause many problems related to equality before the law and the rule of law. He said the law could have international ramifications that would expose Israel to significant risks.</p> \n<p>Ministers Naftali Bennett, Ayelet Shaked, Zeev Elkin and Yariv Levin welcomed the law's approval. “It’s time to stop treating settlers as second-class citizens. We’ll repair a long-lasting wrong,” said Bennett.</p> \n<p>Shaked said they had changed the discourse from one of evacuation to one of regulation. “There’s no reason these people have to live under a constant threat of evacuation. Terrorists will know we’re here to stay, and attacks will not deter us.”</p> \n<p>“Strong settlements are the best answer to terror and murder,” said Levin. “These settlers deserve all municipal services like any other citizen.”</p> \n<p>Elkin expressed his hope that the law would pass quickly. “It’s our moral duty to help settlements which were established with the state’s help, and return them to a normal life. We’ll continue with resolve to develop these communities.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>According to Israel Television News, communications mogul Shaul Elovitch, who is suspected of bribery in Case 4000, the Bezeq-Walla affair, called Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon “the Arab.” And it is true that for me as an Arab, it is not easy to live in a society in which my national origin is just a derogatory term used by its leaders. </p> \n<p>But as a long-suffering person, I adopted the words of the poet Abu al-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi, who, unluckily, was an Arab too: “And if the insults against me were said by a pitiable soul, then this is the testimony that I am perfect.”</p> \n<p>Of course, al-Mutanabbi exaggerated a bit in what he wrote. After all, an Arab, like any other mortal, is not perfect. But nonetheless, compared to Elovitch, who is up to his neck in serious accusations of corruption, is absolute perfection. In any case, and because up to now Kahlon has not responded, I, as a proud Arab, recommend that he respond, in a way that’s perhaps surprising but also necessary, in these words: “Yes Mr. Elovitch, I am a proud Arab Jew.” What do you have to say, Kahlon?</p> \n<p>Why am I saying this, you ask? Because if you say you are not an Arab, and make an effort to prove it, they will only continue to chase after you with the insult, “the Arab is coming,”or “the Arab said.” But if you say you’re an Arab, and that does not cause you embarrassment, the racists will stop their campaign. The poet Tawfiq Ziad once said that the evil man who is hounding you is like a dog that barks a lot: If you run away from it, it will continue to chase you. But if you stand up tall and face it with courage, it will back down. </p> \n<p>After all, what haven’t you done, Moshe Kahlon, in order to prove that you are faithful to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his policies that exclude Arabs. You supported almost al the laws intended to destroy the legal system, whose entire goal is to save his skin; you backed up Culture Minister Miri Regev on the horrible “cultural loyalty law” she came up with; you did not oppose the anti-democratic laws of the ministers of Habayit Hayehudi at all, whose entire goal was to destroy civil society. And now in the end you find yourself, how embarrassing, an Arab!</p> \n<p>But even more than that, Kahlon – how long will you continue to be embarrassed about your roots? After all, the fact is you are an Arab, an Arab Jew. True, you are a good Arab, as they called the Arabs who toed the line with the authorities in the first days of the state. But it is important for you to know that the behavior of the Arabs then was the fruit of the hard times – the sword of expulsion hovered over their heads in those days. Today the situation of the Arabs in Israel has changed and they are filled with confidence in the righteousness of their path and their ability to challenge the policy of discrimination and exclusion, and to stop being good Arabs.</p> \n<p>The situation of the Mizrahim, too, whom your community is a part of, has changed. Has the time not come for you too, one of the outstanding leaders of the Mizrahim, to stop being a good Jewish Arab that the Israeli right wants to serve as a scourge against the Arabs, on one hand, while on the other hand wants to use as a scourge against the Ashkenazi democrats? </p> \n<p>But mostly they want for you to remain captive in the blind nationalism of the leaders of the far right, with Netanyahu at their head. Here is another role they are planning for you in Likud – to serve as the scourge for repressing culture, too, mostly Western culture, and you are dancing to the music of their flutes. And at the same time, I have no doubt in my heart that in the backrooms they are disgusted with you. After all, all you are to them is an Arab, and not just a plain Arab but a pet Arab, who does their dirty work.</p> \n<p>I recommend that you, Kahlon, remember your late mother and her Libyan Arabic. To remember the cultural setting in which she grew up – and to take pride in it. Without your being at peace with your mother’s culture, and even to be an enthusiast of it, you will not be able to rid yourself of your bad habit of imitating the Ashkenazim, without understanding the essence of Western culture, in all its depth and charm.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“In the 70th year in the month of Kislev the king of Akkadia mustered his soldiers and marched into the land of the Hittites and laid siege to the city of Judea. In the month of Adar on the second day he occupied the city and captured the king. He installed a king after his own heart, imposed a harsh tax and sent [it] to Babylon.”</p> \n<p>This Akkadian chronicle of the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II from the year 598 B.C.E. is a major piece of extra-Scriptural evidence of the first Judean exile – the Jehoiachin exile. In 2 Kings 24:8-17, we learn that Jehoiachin was the king who was taken captive and sent into exile along with “all the commanders and all the warriors — ten thousand exiles — as well as all the craftsmen and smiths… and the king’s mother and the king’s wives and officers and the notables of the land were brought as exiles from Jerusalem to Babylon.”</p> \n<p>Eleven years later, the same Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem and its Temple, killed King Zedekiah – the one “after his own heart” – and exiled a large part of the population of Judea and Jerusalem, in what is known as “the Babylonian Exile,” which put an end to more than 400 years of rule by the House of David in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Unlike the Babylonian Exile, which is deeply etched in the national consciousness, the Jehoiachin Exile earned little literary mention in Scripture and was not commemorated at all. And it turns out that this national ignoring of that exile also infected the world of scholarly Bible criticism: Until recently, those 11 years of exile were not studied in any comprehensive and systematic way.</p> \n<p>A new study has revealed, however, that the Jehoiachin exiles established a social, economic, religious and literary infrastructure for Jewish life outside the homeland, upon which was built the Jewish national existence in the Diaspora over the generations. They proved that even far from the homeland, without a Temple and without a royal establishment, it was possible not only to survive without losing their uniqueness but also to lay foundations for the existence and nurturance of a creative ethno-cultural entity that would not be cut off from its roots, and would be able to grow and be culturally productive, even on foreign soil.</p> \n<p>This infrastructure became a shock absorber for the exiles of the destruction of Jerusalem. It is with good reason that in Jeremiah 24:2 the Jehoiachin exiles are compared to “very good figs” as opposed to those who remained behind and were not sent into exile along with them – the “very bad figs.”</p> \n<p>Who were these Jewish settlers?</p> \n<p>Newly deciphered epigraphs in Akkadian cuneiform on clay tablets that have been published in recent years (the most comprehensive collection is by Laurie Pearce and Cornelia Wunsch, 2014) underline the need for scholarly attention to the Jehoiachin Exile. Some of the documents were displayed in an exhibition at the Bible Lands Museum and published in Hebrew translation in 2015 in the book “Al Naharot Bavel” (By the Rivers of Babylon: Cuneiform Documents from the Beginning of the Babylonian Diaspora,” by Wayne Horowitz, Yehoshua Greenberg and Peter Zilberg, in conjunction with Pearce and Wunsch).</p> \n<p>These tablets suggest that in the area of Nippur, on the banks of the Euphrates, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast of the capital Babylon, there were agricultural settlements with Hebrew names like Beit Nesher, Ir Yehuda, Beit Avi-Ram and Beit Toviyahu. The people of these settlements also had Hebrew names, such as Neria, Jehoezer, Ovadiah, Nadaviah and Shemaiah.</p> \n<p>Most of the texts are from the Persian period but there are also some from the time of Nebuchadnezzar II, 26 to 28 years after the exile of King Jehoiachin. The texts reflect the everyday life of the settlers, who engaged in agriculture, grew dates, traded, took and gave loans and made marriage contracts. Some of them, it emerges, were of high economic status, some engaged in commerce even with the capital Babylon, some brewed beer and more.</p> \n<p>Who were these Jewish settlers? It would appear that they aren’t those who went into exile upon the destruction of the First Temple, but rather were the Jehoiachin exiles, who by 589 had been living there for 11 years and had adapted economically and socially. Among those mentioned in the texts from later years there were also apparently some who did arrive after the Temple’s destruction, whom the earlier exiles took in as brothers, easing the crisis of refugeehood and exile they had to endure.</p> \n<p>According to the Bible, the Jehoiachin exiles settled in two areas. The members of the elite among them settled in Babylon, the capital, where King Jehoiachin himself was imprisoned under quite good conditions (documents from Nebuchadnezzar’s palace indicate that there were food allowances for the family and even caregivers for the king of Judea’s children). Information about this community can be found in the Book of Jeremiah. The second concentration of exiles was in the Nippur area, in proximity to the Jewish locales mentioned above. According to the Book of Ezekiel 3:15, the prophet lived with this group: “And I came to the exile community that dwelt in Tel Avib by the Chebar Canal, and I remained where they dwelt. And for seven days I sat there stunned among them. “</p> \n<p>The Jerusalem elite brought to the capital was for the most part anti-Babylonian, and according to the Book of Jeremiah, its leaders, together with some of their counterparts who remained in Jerusalem, preached revolt against Babylon, promising that it was God’s will that within two years the exiles would return to their own country. These illusions encouraged the exiles to see their exile as a temporary and transient phenomenon, rather than as a national catastrophe.</p> \n<p>Jeremiah himself, however, back in Jerusalem, preached acceptance of the Babylonian yoke and challenged rival prophet “Hananiah the son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon” (28:2), who supported rebellion. Not only did Jeremiah try to convince King Zedekiah and his ministers not to revolt, he also sent letters to the exile community in Babylon, warning then that salvation was not near and calling upon them to adapt to life in exile. All this occurred in the thick of a polemic with prophets in Babylon itself, who like Hananiah in Jerusalem preached revolt against Nebuchadnezzar.</p> \n<p>Survival strategy</p> \n<p>Thus the survival strategy of the exiles in Babylon, the capital, was dialectical: hope for swift salvation, on the one hand, along with adaptation to life in exile, should salvation not come so quickly. From the very fact of the exchange of letters between Babylon and Jerusalem, along with critical analysis of the Book of Jeremiah, it emerges that there was a literate class among the exiles in the capital, which engaged not only in writing letters but also in redaction of sacred texts, and in writing their own texts, which they then inserted into the former. There is evidence of this in the books of Deuteronomy, the Early Prophets, Jeremiah, Micha and Psalms – and I will relate to some examples below.</p> \n<p>Thus literacy, which in Jerusalem was an exclusive possession of the elites of the Temple and the royal court, underwent a process of democratization among the Jehoiachin exiles: learning to read and write was an option available to all the exiles, with the possibility of studying in home schools for the training of scribes, like the ones that existed in Mesopotamian culture.</p> \n<p>Our source of information about the Tel Avib exiles is the Book of Ezekiel, whose work as a prophet began, “On the fifth day of the month — it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin” (Ezekiel 1:2). Apparently it was only after five years of unsettled existence that these exiles arrived at what would be their permanent dwellings. The Tel Avib community’s survival strategy was different form that of the one in the capital. It didn’t boast an elite there that supported a revolt and nurtured illusions of return, there was no tension between two opposing views of how to adapt to exile, and subversion was rejected in favor of acclimatization to the diaspora.</p> \n<p>However, on the matter of fostering literacy, there was no difference between the two communities. Ezekiel held writing in especially high esteem as a means of preaching and teaching. It is with good reason that he is the only one among the Prophets for whom the primary image of his calling to deliver the word of God was not verbal (as was the case with Moses, Isaiah and Jeremiah) but rather written: ”...a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein” (Ezekiel 2:9) – and he was commanded to eat it. The writing of his book is clear evidence of literacy and there is no doubt that he had disciples who copied his prophecies and even added text to the Five Books of Moses (for example Leviticus 26:33-65) and other texts (about which, more below), which reflected the exiles’ situation and eased their survival.</p> \n<p>One of the most severe problems facing the Jehoiachin exiles was their distance from the Temple in Jerusalem. Worship through sacrifice was almost the only way of communicating with the gods in all religions during the First Temple period. What could the exiles do without an accessible temple? Here too each of the two communities developed a survival strategy of its own.</p> \n<p>The sins of Jerusalem</p> \n<p>In Babylon the city, the hope for a swift return to Judea eased the difficulty of the distance from the Temple, since they believed the separation to be temporary. Later these exiles developed a unique theology regarding the Temple and its distance from them, the expression of which is the major part of Solomon’s prayer at the Temple’s dedication (1 Kings 8), which the exiles compiled and inserted into the Book of Kings.</p> \n<p>According to this theology, the Temple is not God’s home, and therefore he does not require sacrifices (a symbol of God’s food). The Temple is a house for the name of God, and its role is to be a house of prayer, although the worshipper is not even required to come to the Temple! If the people is carried “off to an enemy land, near or far... pray to You in the direction of their land which You gave to their fathers, of the city which You have chosen, and of the House which I have built to Your name… give heed in Your heavenly abode to their prayer and supplication, uphold their cause” (1 Kings 46-49).</p> \n<p>That is, the importance of the Temple is that it is a conduit for the transmission of believers’ prayers, wherever they may be, and remove from it need not be a problem for exiles. This theology can be understood only in the context of the Jehoiachin exile, and not in any other context of the history of the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>The Tel Avib community dealt with the absence of a temple in an entirely different way. Basically, they saw no need to regret the distancing from the Temple, which for a long time hadn’t been the house of God! Ezekiel saw Jerusalem as a sinful city and its Temple as a source of syncretistic idolatry: “… all detestable forms of creeping things and beasts and all the fetishes of the House of Israel were depicted over the entire wall.… the women bewailing Tammuz …about twenty-five men, their backs to the Temple of the Lord and their faces to the east; they were bowing low to the sun in the east.” (Ezekiel 8:10 – 16).</p> \n<p>Hence, says Ezekiel, the Honor of the Lord of Israel has departed the Temple in Jerusalem and moved to the Chebar Canal (Chapter 10), where He revealed himself to Ezekiel (Chapter 1). The sins of Jerusalem and the Temple must lead to total destruction and additional exile, and only after that salvation will come.</p> \n<p>This perception improved the self-image of the Tel Avib exiles. They are better than the residents of Jerusalem, and in contrast to them, they themselves are closer to God and his place of honor. This outlook also immunized the Tel Avib exiles against the shock of the destruction to come, because it was anticipated, and was planned by God, and was a sign of the salvation that would follow. Instead of a temple and sacrifices, Ezekiel nurtured an ethos based on two elements: First of all, individual morality and mutual responsibility, and secondly, strict observance of a relatively small number of commandments that distinguished the exiles from their surroundings – avoidance of idolatry and observance of the rules of women’s purity and the Sabbath. This ethos greeted the exiles of the destruction and for them too it was something of a response to Jewish life in the wake of a destroyed Temple.</p> \n<p>Sheep in a fold</p> \n<p>I mentioned Solomon’s prayer as an example of a pseudepigraphic text that was written by Jehoiachin exiles in the city of Babylon and integrated into the Book of Kings. Its authors were writers and editors from the Deuteronomistic school that dominated Jerusalem beginning in 621 B.C.E., the year the Book of Deuteronomy was published (2 Kings 22,23). This was how the scribes of that school put things they themselves had written into the mouths of exemplary figures from the past. This also applies to the Book of Deuteronomy, which is attributed to Moses, as well as to various speeches by such personages as Joshua (for example in 24:10–27), the angel of God (Judges 2:1–3), Samuel (1 Samuel 8:11-20) – and many more.</p> \n<p>Among other things, the scribes of the community in the Babylonian capital added to the version of the Book of Deuteronomy they had in their possession passages interpolated for the purpose of updating Moses’ speech: Moses foretells the exile that will come and the redemption that will follow it (e.g., Deuteronomy 4:25–31; 28:63-68 and more). Ezekiel and his disciples in the Tel Avib community did much the same. One example of such a text in the Torah is Leviticus 26:33-45, on the subject of exile and destruction, followed by salvation, as in Ezekiel’s thinking and in his style.</p> \n<p>Exiles in the community of the capital, Babylon, also wrote prophecies they interpolated into the books of earlier prophets. The later authors were those who preached rebellion, whom Jeremiah considered to be false prophets. An example is the prophecy in Micha 2:12-13. It promises an ingathering of the exiles when they, who are compared to sheep in a fold, break through the gate, with the king at their head: “I will assemble Jacob, all of you; I will bring together the remnant of Israel;… One who makes a breach Goes before them; They enlarge it to a gate And leave by it. Their king marches before them...” There’s only one possible historical context for this militant prophecy: the community of the Jehoiachin exiles in Babylon, among whom there were some who were preaching rebellion, and who had a king in their midst, the imprisoned Jehoiachin, who is said to have emerged at their head.</p> \n<p>The Jehoiachin exiles laid the foundations of national and religious life in the exile. Thanks to them the refugees from Jerusalem could be absorbed into their place of exile without having to relinquish their heritage, without giving up the hope of returning to their land, even as they aimed for a life of economic prosperity and social acclimatization into their environment. In this way continuity between the two developed, with a continuum of religious and national creativity in a literate society. Were it not for this, it is doubtful that the Babylonian exiles, who experienced the trauma of the prolonged siege of Jerusalem, the destruction of the city and its Temple, and exile would have been able to rehabilitate themselves upon arriving at their place of exile.</p> \n<p>Infrastructure for a life of national creativity</p> \n<p>In 538 B.C.E., King Cyrus of Persia issued that proclamation that ends the Hebrew Bible, in which a call is made to the nation of Judah in exile to return to Jerusalem and rebuild its Temple: “Thus said King Cyrus of Persia: The Lord God of Heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and has charged me with building Him a House in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Any one of you of all His people, the Lord his God be with him and let him go up” (Chronicles II 36:23 and Ezra 1:2-3).</p> \n<p>Had the Jehoiachin exiles not established the infrastructure for a life of national creativity, no nation of Judea would have remained in existence in the days of Cyrus, and the king of Persia would have had no reason to issue his proclamation. In its wake, the Second Temple period began, and it lasted for more than 500 years. During this period, just as in the brief duration of the Jehoiachin exile, the Jewish people lived and was creative in two centers: Jerusalem and its Temple, and the community of exiles in Babylon, far from the Temple.</p> \n<p>The Midrash, with amazing intuition, writes: “He (the Lord our God) did right by us... when he brought forward the early exile of Jechoniah [Jehoiachin] to Babylon… and made an academy for the Law [Torah], for had this not been so the Law would have been forgotten in Zedekiah’s exile” (Midrash Tanhuma, Parashat Tazria, Siman Tet).</p> \n<p>The research shows how very true these words are.</p> \n<p>Yair Hoffman is professor emeritus of Bible studies at Tel Aviv University. His most recent book is “The Good Figs: The Jehoiachin Exile and its Heritage,” was published this year (in Hebrew) by Tel Aviv University Press.</p>",

        "text":["<p>An international observatory task force established two decades ago to monitor the divided West Bank city of Hebron has produced its most exhaustive and damning internal report on Israel’s actions in the city, according to people with access to the report who spoke with Haaretz on condition of anonymity. This is the first time a report by the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) is revealed in the press.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The confidential report by TIPH, long regarded as toothless by the Palestinians, cites numerous violations of international law by Israel and seems to confirm Hebron’s status as a city torn by both a civilian and military occupation. Twenty years after the monitoring force was set up to help instill a sense of security and ensure prosperity for Palestinians, the report warns that the city is more divided than ever due to the actions of the Israeli government and Israeli settlers.</p> \n<p>According to the report, Israel is clearly in “severe and regular breach” of the right to non-discrimination as well as the obligation to protect the population living under occupation from deportation. The Israeli settlement in Hebron is a violation of international law and “radical Israeli settlers” make life in the Israeli-controlled area difficult for its Palestinian residents.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion: The new capital of Israel&nbsp;■ Editorial: Israel has weaponized the settlements</p> \n<p>TIPH was established in 1997 as part of the Oslo Accords’ Hebron Protocol, which allowed the partial redeployment of Israeli military forces to the part of the city that remained under its control. The force was later expanded as part of the Wye River Memorandum, signed in 1998 by Benjamin Netanyahu, then serving his first term as premier, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Some of the people Haaretz spoke to for this article voiced concern that the publication of the report’s findings may result in Israel refusing to renew TIPH’s mandate to operate in the city, which comes up for renewal every six months.</p> \n<p>During a visit to Paris in November, Netanyahu said he would take a decision in December “with regard to the continuation of TIPH.” Netanyahu has been facing increasing pressure from the right to cancel the observers’ mandate.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In recent months TIPH has been at the center of negative attention, following two incidents involving the group’s employees, one in which a TIPH worker was filmed, according to the police, puncturing the tires of a vehicle belonging to a settler living in the city, and another in which a Swiss observer was deported from Israel after allegedly slapping a settler boy. Following those incidents, Netanyahu summoned the mission’s chief in July for a meeting.</p> \n<p>The near-100-page-long report was commissioned to mark the 20th anniversary of TIPH. An earlier iteration of the international presence was formed after Baruch Goldstein murdered 29 Muslim worshippers at Hebron’s Tomb of the Patriarchs in February 1994. The force currently features 64 international mission members from five contributing countries, which also fund the mission: Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, after Denmark pulled out. The mission only submits its reports to its home countries and to the Palestinian and Israeli authorities, and does not share them publicly.</p> \n<p>TIPH’s reputation is controversial. A common joke in Hebron is that its initials stand for “Two Impotents Patrolling Hebron.” However, while its power is limited, TIPH still has greater standing than many other external organizations operating in the area. Human rights and nonprofit groups operating in Hebron are usually slammed by Israeli officials as anti-Israel, left-wing groups. TIPH is different: Members of the group routinely meet with Israel Defense Forces representatives and officers from Israel’s Civil Administration; they enjoy free access in a city known for its restrictions on movement; and, most importantly, the group has been operating in Hebron with Israel’s permission for over 20 years.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Their mission is also supposed to assist in the promotion and execution of projects initiated by the donor countries, and to encourage economic development and growth in Hebron.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>‘Severe and regular’&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Late in 2017, TIPH produced one of the most significant pieces of work since its establishment: A report looking back on its 20 years of work, highlighting problems and patterns its members have identified.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The report is based, among other things, on over 40,000 “incident reports” compiled over the years by TIPH’s team.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>TIPH’s report concludes that Hebron is moving in the opposite direction to the one agreed upon by Israel and the PLO in the Hebron Protocol.</p> \n<p>The protocol was signed in 1997 and divided Hebron into two parts: H1, the Palestinian Authority-controlled area comprising about 80 percent of the city and home to about 175,000 Palestinians; and H2, the Israeli-controlled area where some 500 to 800 settlers live alongside 40,000 Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Israel is violating the right to non-discrimination as stated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Israel in 1991, according to the report. Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled area of the city lack of freedom of movement and the right to worship, clear breaches of this right, the report says. In addition, TIPH says, Israel is constantly in breach of Article 49 of the Geneva Convention (IV), forbidding the deportation of protected persons (those living under occupation who are not citizens of the occupying country) from occupied territory.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A diplomat who has seen the report told Haaretz that it says “this basic human right is breached regularly and more and more severely for the Palestinians in Hebron – and particularly for those living in H2 – relating to lack of freedom of movement and the right to worship.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Normal life,” especially in Hebron’s Old City area in the Israeli-controlled area of H2, is nowhere to be found, the report says, referencing the TIPH mandate that states that the mission “assists in monitoring and reporting efforts to maintain normal life in the city of Hebron.&quot; Furthermore, the old Palestinian vegetable market has become an Israeli military zone, often occupied by settlers and a playground for their children, according to the report.</p> \n<p>The report also disputes land ownership claims in Hebron’s Old City made by settlers who say they represent previous Jewish owners who fled or were murdered during the 1929 Hebron massacre. Today’s settlers, the report says, have no family ties with previous owners of the property, and the question of ownership of land that had been inhabited or used by Jews prior to 1929 has still not been answered clearly. Regardless of these ownership claims, TIPH says the presence of any Israeli settlement in Hebron is considered a violation of international law.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The report also notes the exodus from H2 of those Palestinians who can afford to move to Palestinian Authority-controlled H1, where they face fewer restrictions. Those who can’t or don’t want to leave H2 have to confront “radical Israeli settlers” who are supported by the Israeli government and Jewish foundations abroad, the report claims.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The division of security responsibilities in H1 and H2 works in contradiction to the Hebron agreement and is hindering the movement of people, goods and vehicles within the city, the report warns. Obstacles and barriers between the two areas have developed into a military fortification consisting of numerous closures and checkpoints manned by Israeli security forces, especially controlling the city’s Palestinian inhabitants.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The report highlights Shuhada Street, which is probably Hebron’s most famous thoroughfare. Once a thriving Palestinian market, today it is devoid of Palestinians and its shops are shuttered. Palestinians are still not allowed to drive on the street and can’t access parts of it on foot, the report notes, adding that, over the past 20 years, TIPH has witnessed how these tight movement restrictions for Palestinians on Shuhada Street have spread to other parts of H2.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In contrast, Israeli drivers are granted access to all of H2’s roads. Gradually, the report says, settlers have been given the right to build and extend their settlement activities, including on Palestinian land. Infrastructure construction and maintenance for roads, water and access have also been prioritized for Israeli settlers, the report says.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>TIPH also says it has seen land in the settlement of Tel Rumeida, rented by Palestinians for more than a generation, being closed by Israeli military orders and used for archaeological excavations, seeking to prove a Jewish presence there from the first century B.C.E.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Simultaneously, the TIPH report says, freedom of movement for the Palestinians living in Tel Rumeida has been seriously curtailed. Over the years, it has been enclosed and surrounded by several checkpoints – with dire consequences for its Palestinian inhabitants. They are not allowed to receive visitors who are not registered on a list held by the checkpoints guards. TIPH notes that Palestinians are often harassed at these checkpoints, and that the only way to bring food and other provisions to their homes is by foot. Studies, work and family relations are also very challenging for these residents, it writes.</p> \n<p>TIPH also witnessed how paths and roads have been established on Palestinian farmland over the years, in order to create exclusive routes for Jewish worshippers heading from the settlement of Kiryat Arba to downtown Hebron. In addition, old Palestinian houses from the Ottoman era situated along this path were demolished in order to widen it.</p> \n<p>The observatory mission also notes that Palestinians face numerous obstacles trying to access the Ibrahimi Mosque – which is an important religious site to both Muslims and Jews (the Tomb of the Patriarchs is also situated there). There are now only two access points to the Muslim holy site and worshippers have first to pass several Israeli-manned checkpoints. Worshippers are searched and sometimes required to lift up their clothes. The muezzin, TIPH notes, is not allowed to call worshippers for prayer on Friday evenings and Saturdays due to the Jewish Shabbat. The group adds that while some 1,600 Palestinian worshippers were counted attending the mosque on a given Friday in 2003, that number had been halved by 2017.</p> \n<p>Although the report is highly critical of Israel, it does not lay out any demands or calls for action from either the Israelis or Palestinians. It was handed to the foreign ministers of the five contributing member states and was presented to diplomats visiting Hebron recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Haaretz asked TIPH to comment on the report and whether any actions were taken based on its findings. In response, a spokesman said that their mandate “states that TIPH assists in monitoring and reporting efforts to maintain normal life in the city of Hebron, and in accordance with the Hebron protocol and the agreement between the parties. Regular reports are shared with the Palestinian and the Israeli authorities as well as the five contributions countries. As requested by the parties, all information produced by TIPH is strictly confidential. TIPH has a regular dialogue with both parties.”</p> \n<p>Haaretz requested the Prime Minister’s Office comment on the report and its findings, but was referred to the Foreign Ministry, which said in response: “TIPH reports are not for publication. They are transferred to both sides based on the understanding that they will not be passed on to other parties, certainly not the media. Therefore, we have no intention of commenting on partial information or any other publications about this issue.”</p>",

The New York Times ran a statement from Rush which said&nbsp;Stone's allegations were &quot;incorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context&quot;.</p> \n<p>&quot;I sincerely and deeply regret if I have caused her any distress,&quot; Rush said in the statement. &quot;This, most certainly, has never been my intention. When we performed in The Diary Of A Madman eight years ago, I believe we engaged in a journey as artistic comrades.&quot;</p> \n<p>Stone's agent in Australia, Lisa Mann Creative Management, told Reuters the actor declined to comment further and she stood by her public statements.</p> \n<p>The actress gave a television interview to the Australian Broadcasting Corp., to air on Monday evening. In previews of the interview,&nbsp;Stone&nbsp;said, &quot;I immediately put myself at the bottom of the ladder. I didn't advocate for myself.&quot;</p> \n<p>The allegations coincide with a defamation lawsuit Rush has filed against News Corp's Australian arm over articles it published after another actress allegedly filed an internal complaint about his actions during a production of King Lear in 2015 and 2016.</p> \n<p>Hearings in that defamation action have concluded and the judge is due to deliver findings in early 2019.</p> \n<p>Media commentators and academics argue Australia's tough defamation laws make it difficult for people in the country to speak out about allegations of sexual misconduct by public figures in the same way they have in other jurisdictions.</p>",

For example, 1.6 billion shekels go towards loans for buying private vehicles, which serves 3 percent of people with severe limitations. In contrast, assistance with public transportation, which serves 33 percent of such people, gets only 47 million shekels.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel's disabled deserve better than this from government&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>There are almost 1.5 million people with disabilities in Israel, 704,000 of whom are defined as having severe disabilities, including having a health or physical problem for over six months, one which interferes with daily activities. The report notes that the degree of their mobility greatly impacts their ability to integrate into the labor market. Only 45 percent of people with severe disabilities work, in contrast to 80 percent among people with no disabilities. Moreover, one third of people with severe limitations earn less than 5,000 shekels ($1,325) a month. Their low rates of employment, says the report, costs the economy 5 billion shekels a year.</p> \n<p>One third of the budget allocated to enhancing the mobility of these people, amounting to 770 million shekels, is devoted to transportation networks, operated by three government ministries – health, welfare and education. The three operate separately, without any coordination. 585 million shekels go to the Education Ministry, for the transportation of 63,000 children with disabilities; 13 million shekels go to the Ministry of Health, which helps move 11,000 people, and 176 million shekels go to the Welfare Ministry, which helps transport 25,000 people to work or to other welfare-related activities.</p> \n<p>“This is a typical example of good intentions, some of which end up assisting people, while others crash into reality, due to lack of efficiency or coordination,” says Shira Ruderman, the Foundation’s CEO. “The findings of this report should set off alarms and lead to a comprehensive reform, at the center of which should be the establishment of a national center for mobility, with a total change in the way government ministries address legislation, enforcement, professional training and allocation of budgets.”</p> \n<p>The report’s writers listed a host of recommendations for improving the mobility of people with restricted capabilities, including the launch of a national project promoting independent mobility and enhanced accessibility for people with disabilities; the launch of a pilot for ten better inter-urban bus lines which will serve communities where there is no alternative to train service; the launch of a one-stop service for ordering transportation so that people with disabilities can choose how to travel – by disabled-accessible cars, public transportation, busing service; accessible taxis, and more); a tripling of the number of disabled-accessible taxis (there are currently 950 around the country); providing escorts for the disabled and training them towards independent mobility as part of the basket of social services the state grants people with disabilities.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The last week has been the most difficult ever for Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon since he took office in 2015. The wave of price hikes have been focused in the public sector – namely, electricity, water and municipal taxes. That, in turn, has given the business sector the freedom to raise its prices. After all, if the government is allowing itself to raise prices, why can’t we?</p> \n<p>On the other hand, Kahlon had one ray of light to savor: The Central Bureau of Statistics reported that income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, has been getting better. It’s not only getting better, it’s at its lowest in the past 20 years. The Gini index fell to 0.351 last year from 0.359 in 2016 and a record high of 0.390 in 2006 (on a scale of 0-1, with 1 being the most unequal).</p> \n<p>There are many reasons for the decline, some of them connected with government efforts that Kahlon accelerated when he became finance minister. They include raising the minimum wage, expanding the negative income tax program and bringing more Haredim into the labor force (although the last year has seen the trend plateau).</p> \n<p>Kahlon was also responsible for the cap on salaries of 2.5 million shekels ($660,000) for executives in the financial services industry.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Cost-of-living protest leaders target Osem</p> \n<p>The good news on income inequality, however, is limited: Israeli still has the biggest gap of any developed economy and very high levels of poverty. To change that requires a big increase in the percentage of ultra-Orthodox men and Arab women in the labor market.</p> \n<p>You can reduce income inequality with government allowances, but government policy over the last two decades has been to cut such allowances in order to encourage more people to get jobs. That has not only succeeded - it has succeeded at the same time that the unemployment rate is at a low of 4%.</p> \n<p>Some people would argue that the jobless rate is misleading because it includes many people who are working part time. If they manage to stay above the poverty line, it’s just above the line and no more. The recent spate of price rises could undermine one of Kahlon’s chief accomplishments by pushing many of those marginal households below the poverty line.</p> \n<p>The November consumer price index fell 0.3%, but it reflects the trends of the past. The next few months will show something different after decisions were made to raise prices for power, water and municipal taxes as well for many food products.</p> \n<p>A discussion about how to moderate or roll back the price rise in the public sector, where electricity rates are due to go up as much as 8% and water rates by 4.5% starting in January, won’t help Kahlon.</p> \n<p>He is trying to convince the Electricity Authority to avoid a rate hike, arguing that in 2021 the contract Israel Electric Corporation, the government-owned electricity monopoly, to buy natural gas from the Tamar field can be re-opened (the IEC is trying to re-open it even earlier). At that point it will be possible to lower the price IEC pays for gas by 25%, meaning rates for consumers will go down.</p> \n<p>In the meantime the treasury is exploring ways to prevent the rate hike from happening in 2019 and compensating IEC for this in subsequent years’ tariffs. In other words, in 2019 the IEC will absorb the increase in costs and the following year, when gas is hopefully cheaper, rates will remain the same. If he succeeds, Kahlon will have moderated the price pain.</p> \n<p>The problem for Kahlon with the inequality figure is that no one really cares about it. They do care about the cost of living. It can even spur protests as it did last week. Kahlon has no authority over electricity prices, but he may be able to use the protests to pressure the Electricity Authority.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The decision by the Australian government to recognize West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and wait to move its embassy until there is an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is good for Israel. It’s also a reality check for the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which mistakenly believes that the world is in its pocket.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>It was U.S. President Donald Trump who insisted that the American decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to move its embassy there was no more than an acknowledgement of reality. But despite the fact that the embassy is situated in the West part of the city, and although Trump declared that recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital did not constitute a taking a position on the borders of Israel’s sovereignty in the city, the decision had a decidedly one-sided whiff to it – so much so that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has since been boycotting the Americans and refuses to return to the negotiating table.</p> \n<p>In contrast to the American move, which only recognized the Israeli reality and ignored the Palestinian reality, the remarks by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison reflect reality more reliably. On the one hand, the Australians recognize what is self-evident about West Jerusalem. “The Australian government has decided that Australia now recognizes West Jerusalem, as the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, is the capital of Israel,” Morrison said, and promised to establish a bureau in the city to deal with security and trade issues. At the same time the Australians see as self-evident that East Jerusalem is slated to be the capital of Palestine, and promised to recognize it as such when the time comes.</p> \n<p>It’s no surprise that, according to political sources, “There was disappointment with the recognition of West Jerusalem.” Netanyahu and his government, the peace resisters, have been misleading the public to think the world has come to terms with throwing the two-state solution into the dustbin of history and is even willing to ignore Israel’s continued military control over the Palestinians. The Australian government’s decision is an important reminder that, with the exception of the Israeli right, there is an international consensus that there is no solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict other than the two-state solution.</p> \n<p>“We expected more from a friendly country like Australia,” said Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein, who went even further and claimed that the decision encourages Palestinian violence, as if the Palestinian areas of Jerusalem haven’t been inflamed almost nonstop since the U.S. declaration. One hopes that the Americans will follow Australia’s lead, recognize East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state, bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table and press the two sides to sign a two-state agreement.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz's lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

The&nbsp;Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, better known as the Claims Conference, reached the agreement on the payments with the German government.</p> \n<p>Nearly 10,000 children, almost all of them Jewish, were sent to Britain on the Kindertransport from Nazi Germany, including Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia annexed to Germany, starting in December 1938 and until just before World War II broke out in Europe in September 1939.

Driving on their roads is frightening, the violent opposition to their presence is growing – and I feel no sympathy for their tragedy, nor do I feel any compassion or solidarity.</p> \n<p>They are to blame, not I, for the fact that I cannot feel the most humane sense of solidarity and pain. It’s not just that they’re settlers, violators of international law and universal justice; it’s not just because of the violence of some of them and the settling of all of them – it’s also the blackmail with which they respond to every tragedy, which prevents me from grieving with them. But beneath the veil of sanctimonious and hypocritical unity, and the media’s fake show of national grief to advance its own commercial goals, the truth must be told: Their tragedy isn’t ours.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; I have a serious problem with leftists who are okay with the murder of settlers | Opinion ■ Co-opting a fetus for their land grab | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Their tragedy isn’t ours because they’ve brought the tragedy upon themselves and the entire country. It’s true that the main blame goes to the governments that gave into them, either eagerly or out of weakness, but the settlers cannot be absolved of blame, either. The extorter – and not just those who have given into extortion – is also to blame. But they are there, generations born on stolen land, children raised in an apartheid existence and trained to think it is biblical justice, and with government support. Perhaps we cannot blame those who are sitting on land usurped by their parents. But their tragedy is not ours because they exploit every tragedy to advance their aims in the most cynical of ways.</p> \n<p>When a baby dies they install trailer homes, when soldiers are killed defending them – they do not seek forgiveness from the families of these soldiers, despite their blame for the lives that have been cut short – they only present demands so as to whitewash their crimes. And with these demands the appetite for revenge grows: to imprison even more of their neighbors, to destroy their homes, to kill, to arrest, block roads and exact more revenge. And if that, too, is not enough, their own wild militias raid the Palestinians, throw stones at their vehicles, set their fields on fire and wreak terror on their villages. They are not satisfied with the collective punishment imposed by the army and the Shin Bet security service, exercised with cruelty and sometimes criminality. The settlers’ lust for revenge is never satisfied. How is it possible to identify with the grief of people who behave like that?</p> \n<p>It’s impossible to identify with their bereavement, because Israel has decided to avoid looking at all that is done there in the land of Judea. When you are capable of being indifferent to the execution of a psychologically impaired young man by soldiers, you can also be indifferent to the shooting of a pregnant woman by Palestinians. When you ignore the goings on at the Tulkarm refugee camp, you can also ignore what takes place at the Givat Assaf junction. It’s moral blindness to everything. Yesha isn’t here, that’s the price being paid for the lack of interest in what is going on in the territories and for ignoring the occupation, under whose sponsorship the settlements are based. Giant budgets are poured out there without any public opposition – so there is also indifference to the fate of the settlers and their tragedies. The piece of land they have taken over doesn’t interest most Israelis living in the land of denial, and that’s the price.</p> \n<p>We have no reason to apologize for the lack of interest and identification. The settlers have brought it on themselves. Those who have never shown any interest in the suffering of their Palestinian neighbors, which they have caused, those who preach all the time that the iron fist must always be tightened, to torture them even more – don’t deserve to be identified with, not even in the hour of their grief. I take no joy in their suffering but I have no sympathy for their pain. The real pain is borne by their victims, those who moan submissively and those who take their fate in their hands and try to resist a violent reality violently and sometimes also murderously. The Palestinians are the victims deserving of pity and solidarity.</p>",

        "text":["<p>An initiative aimed at reforming Israel’s controversial conversion system appeared headed back to the deep freeze on Monday.</p> \n<p>Facing mounting opposition from the ultra-Orthodox parties, the government requested and received permission from the non-Orthodox movements to put the initiative on hold for yet another six months. It was the latest indication that the government has little, if any, desire to follow through with the plan that would have stripped the Orthodox-controlled Chief Rabbinate of its power over conversions in Israel.</p> \n<p>This six-month freeze still requires the final approval of the Supreme Court, which has withheld ruling on the matter of the legality of non-Orthodox conversions in Israel waiting to see what would happen with the initiative. It is expected to grant its approval within the next few days.</p> \n<p>The initiative was drawn up in the form of a draft bill prepared, at the request of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, by Moshe Nissim, a former Israeli justice minister and longstanding member of the Likud. The Nissim bill called for the creation of a state-run authority, outside the auspices of the Rabbinate, that would oversee all conversions in Israel. All conversions performed by this new authority would abide by Orthodox rules.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 'Ivanka's rabbi' makes the cut: Israel caves and reveals lists of recognized overseas rabbis&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israelis may be fed up with Orthodox establishment, but few are joining reform and conservative congregations</p> \n<p>As soon Nissim presented the draft bill in June, and government requested that it be put it on hold for six months so as not to shake up the coalition, which relies heavily on the support of the ultra-Orthodox parties. That six-month period ended Monday.</p> \n<p>The reason the High Court was required to intervene was that while the Nissim initiatives was being drafted, the Reform and Conservative movements in Israel had agreed to temporarily suspend a petition they had submitted demanding that conversions performed by their rabbis in Israel be recognized by the state.</p> \n<p>The non-Orthodox movements agreed on Monday to a further delay of six months on condition that about a dozen of their converts, who have been waiting years to obtain legal status in Israel, be allowed to stay in the country and receive social benefits for the next year. Their request was granted.</p> \n<p>The Reform and Conservative movements have also expressed reservations about the Nissim initiative because it would not recognize conversions performed by their rabbis in Israel.</p> \n<p>The legislation has drawn criticism from other fronts as well, most notably a private initiative known as “Giyur K’Halakha” (Conversion according to Jewish law), founded by a group of prominent religious Zionist rabbis who have performed more than 600 conversions in the country, about 18 percent of the total each year. Within the Orthodox movement, the Giyur K’Halakha rabbis are known to be relatively liberal and their conversion requirements are considered less stringent. Were the Nissim bill approved, all such private conversions would be outlawed.</p> \n<p>Each year, about 1,000 conversions are undertaken in Israel outside the state-run system – roughly half Orthodox and half non-Orthodox. The overwhelming majority of these converts are citizens of Israel – most of them immigrants from the former Soviet Union and their children, who are not considered Jewish by religious law because they do not have a Jewish mother, as well as adopted children and children delivered by surrogate mothers.</p> \n<p>The Nissim bill is the latest in a series of attempts in recent decades to reach a compromise on the thorny issue of conversion that would be acceptable to the majority of Jews around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In June 2017, the Ministerial Committee for Legislation was scheduled to vote on another bill that would have denied recognition of all conversions performed in Israel outside of the existing Rabbinate-sanctioned state system.</p> \n<p>Facing backlash from Jewish leaders abroad, Netanyahu assigned Nissim with the task&nbsp;of drafting an alternative bill.</p> \n<p>Reform and Conservative leaders have expressed fears that the government could return to the original conversion bill that is far more drastic than the Nissim alternative.</p> \n<p>Responding to the decision to put the Nissim bill on hold for another six months, Rabbi Gilad Kariv, executive director of the Reform movement in Israel, said: &quot;Our condition was a clear commitment by the government to refrain from any legislative acts during this period and to upgrade the status of our converts, in whose name we brought the petition to the High Court.&quot;</p> \n<p>He said the Reform movement did not want to open another front between the government of Israel and world Jewry &quot;at such a sensitive time.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;At the same time,&quot; he said, &quot;we made clear to representatives of the government that we will not agree to any act that involves granting a monopoly on conversions to the Rabbinate, which is so hostile to our converts and creates so many difficulties for them.&quot;</p> \n<p>Rabbi Seth Farber, the founder and executive director of ITIM, an organization that advocates for converts, said in response: &quot;The decision is a wise one for all involved. It prevents conversion legislation that might decimate private conversions, on the one hand, but resolves the Jewish status issues of individuals whose civil rights were being violated, on the other. It is the best decision at this moment in time.&quot;</p> \n<p>Farber is an active member of the Giyur K’Halakha initiative.</p> \n<p>Yizhar Hess, executive director of the Conservative movement in Israel, said there was no reason the converts who had petitioned the Supreme Court had to wait this long to receive legal status in Israel. “The minister of interior could have decided this month, if not years, ago,” he said. “But apparently he was scared the Supreme Court might deliver a ruling that would confirm yet again that there is more than one way to be a Jew.”</p> \n<p>Addressing the annual conference of the Jewish Federations of North America in October, Netanyahu warned participants that he did not have enough political clout to push through the Nissim bill.</p> \n<p>&quot;I think it’s a good compromise, but I don’t know if I have the ability to pass it,&quot; he told them.</p>",

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – New York University continues to be at the center of a storm after its student government passed a resolution earlier this month supporting divestment from businesses with financial ties to the Israeli military.</p> \n<p>The institution rejected the student body’s move last week, declaring, “The university will not move forward with these measures” – despite over 60 organizations and 30 faculty members expressing support for the December 6 resolution.</p> \n<p>That resolution called on the university to divest from companies that “play an active role in funding and perpetuating Israel’s illegal occupation and its violation of human rights, making NYU complicit in these crimes.”</p> \n<p>Last Wednesday, the Bronfman Center for Jewish Life at NYU was temporarily closed due to “several public online postings by an NYU student which were anti-Semitic in nature and potentially threatening,” it explained in an email.</p> \n<p>The student, Alejandro Villa V&aacute;squez, then posted on Twitter that his account had been suspended “just because i [sic] expressed my desire for zionists to die.” He had apparently posted other anti-Zionist and anti-Semitic posts as well.</p> \n<p>His statements were condemned by the student newspaper where he had worked as an editor, as well as by Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, who had penned the resolution. They said he was not a member of either organization.</p> \n<p>After the incident, Vasquez wrote that his tweets were against “Zionists“ because they “believe in the genocide of ethnic and religious minorities.” However, he also added an apology, writing: “To anyone that genuinely feels scared, I’m sorry – I would have done things differently had I known it would actually instill fear in innocent people.” His Twitter account has since been deleted.</p> \n<p>The Bronfman Center reopened Thursday following consultations with the New York police and security experts. The university then informed NYU students it had reviewed its security practices, stating: “In October, we tightened our security protocol. We will be pursuing additional measures, including modifications to our building and active shooter trainings. Better safe than sorry.”</p> \n<p>The administration also announced its intention to establish a special task force to combat “hateful comments, micro-aggressions, and many forms of harassment [that] continue to intimidate students of many backgrounds.”</p> \n<p>Rose Asaf, the Israeli-American Jewish student who co-authored the student resolution, denounced V&aacute;squez’s statements. “An individual who is not affiliated with the BDS movement at NYU in any capacity had been tweeting unacceptable wishes for ‘zionists to die’ and disturbing messages that carry clear anti-Semitic undertones,” the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement activist tweeted.</p> \n<p>She added, “This type of behavior hurts all of us and puts us all in danger. We in the general BDS movement at NYU unequivocally condemn this. As many of us are Jewish, we, too, are directly targeted by this individual’s hateful conduct.”</p> \n<p>The student resolution will next be reviewed by the University Senate, which will then provide its recommendation to the university’s administration and board of trustees. However, the administration has told the student body its resolution is dead on arrival, saying it is “at odds” with the board of trustees’ “well-understood position that the endowment should not be used for making political statements.”</p> \n<p>The resolution is still expected to be voted on in the Senate next semester.</p> \n<p>Boycotting NYU’s Tel Aviv campus?</p> \n<p>The dispute has also reached Tel Aviv. Last October, over 30 NYU student groups – including Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace – pledged not to participate in or apply to “study abroad” programs hosted at NYU’s Tel Aviv campus (one of the university’s 12 overseas campuses). Michael Bearman, a spokesperson for JVP, told Haaretz via email that the student groups wanted to “encourage the university to rethink their investment in an apartheid state with their Tel Aviv campus.”</p> \n<p>But some students who spoke with Haaretz at the Tel Aviv campus don’t agree with the stance. Sussan Garcia, a third-year NYU student who considers herself “very pro-Palestinian” and is involved with SJP on the university’s Abu Dhabi campus, said she spent every weekend in the West Bank last semester.</p> \n<p>However, Garcia, who is finishing her second semester at NYU’s Tel Aviv campus, said she was pleased the BDS resolution passed by the student government. “It’s a great direction for NYU and the rest of our generation to recognize and condemn Israel’s violations of human rights,” she said.</p> \n<p>Another NYU student studying in Tel Aviv, Krista Burton, concurred. “A person can support a divestment from the occupation in the West Bank and still support Israel’s existence,” the third-year student said. “It is an outdated and radical view to force an individual to choose one side or another.”</p> \n<p>Burton added that she spent a lot of time mulling whether to study at the Tel Aviv campus because of the conflict, but ultimately decided to attend because “you can’t have a discussion about the politics of this region without being on the ground.”</p> \n<p>Ann Arbor native Mia Hamermesh, meanwhile, said students can support the resolution without supporting a boycott of the Israel campus. She said that unlike the Jewish gap year programs she considered participating in, the university’s Tel Aviv campus offered her a diversity of community and opinion.</p> \n<p>Leen Dweik, the president of NYU New York’s SJP chapter, disagrees. A Palestinian born in Jordan, she deplored the fact that having lived in America for 20 years, she doesn’t believe she would be allowed into Israel to study there.</p> \n<p>Benjamin Zinevich, an NYU student in New York and a member of SJP, said, “I think I can trust the voices of Palestinians on the internet, on campus, people that I meet at the SJP conference. I trust those Palestinian voices for saying that this is not something ... that is worth discussing in Israel with Israelis.”</p> \n<p>In an emailed statement to Haaretz last October, university spokesman John Beckman said, “NYU disagrees with the declaration by student groups about NYU Tel Aviv. The university has a clear, long-standing policy opposing an academic boycott of Israel.”</p> \n<p>Cameron Taylor Oakes contributed additional reporting from Tel Aviv.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be an art lover – nobody knows – but it’s clear, for example, that he doesn’t want Yael Bartana, a wonderful video artist, to participate in an exhibition on the subject of Jerusalem at the Jewish Museum in Berlin. As was recently reported on the German website TAZ, and has been denied since by Netanyahu, an official Israeli document was sent to the bureau of Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a demand that her government stop supporting the Jewish Museum in Berlin and 12 nonprofit organizations with ties to Israel.</p> \n<p>By what right is Israel, and its head Netanyahu, making demands of the German government concerning an art museum on its territory? It’s a distorted claim based on the ultra-right strategy of Netanyahu and his government to present artists, preferably Israelis, as disloyal to the nation.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>According to Netanyahu, the exhibition “Welcome to Jerusalem,” which is now on display at the museum and examines the city as a space and capital city shared by Arabs, Jews and Christians, leads in the end to the persecution of Israel Defense Forces soldiers. In other words, the exhibition in Berlin is not faithful to the Israeli narrative.</p> \n<p>“I don’t recall such a thing specifically,” replied the prime minister in response to a question on the matter this week. “I did speak to Merkel in general about discontinuing government funding for groups that call to boycott Israel and support terror.” If Netanyahu thinks that the German government, which subsidizes submarines for Israel, has to ask its permission to support cultural activity (which has never killed anyone, as opposed to military activity), let him sue it for supporting terror. But clearly that’s not the issue - the ultranationalist Netanyahu wants to show his base that he is fighting even against the Jewish Museum, since there’s nothing like a few “traitors” among us.</p> \n<p>After all, by turning to Merkel he isn’t, God forbid, warning her intelligence services about exploding video art; he is voicing a worldview. The Jewish Museum in Berlin, which responded to the report by saying it believes in freedom of speech, is one of the organizations mentioned in the document.</p> \n<p>But what does the prime minister have to do with art? As a concept, as a means of expression, of sublimation, of relating to reality? It’s hard to recall an exhibition, a play, an installation or a dance performance that Netanyahu enjoyed publicly or supported. The only thing Netanyahu expresses about art in the broad sense seems to be related to one question: Is there a nest of “lefties” here, and can he use it to portray himself as a patriot who protects the Jewish people (since there are no longer any “citizens” in Netanyahu’s country) from messages and ideas to the effect that there are other people in the world aside from Jews, and that they have rights too?</p> \n<p>The demand made of Germany, that it rein in the Jewish Museum there because of an exhibition that describes the issue of Jerusalem as an unsolved question, or as a place of importance to Muslims and Christians as well as Jews – is an infuriating, absurd, cynical step. The model that has been imitated here is that of the Polish government, which is devoting tremendous efforts, legal and otherwise, worldwide, to suppressing any narrative that it considers anti-Polish.</p> \n<p>In one sense the request made of Merkel is encouraging: By inciting so strongly against artists, he is strengthening the power of art as a significant activity that should be protected. For example, Yael Bartana’s work “Trembling Time,” which is participating in the exhibition. This is a video film shot in Tel Aviv in 2001, which depicts the siren signaling the moment of silence on Memorial Day. This is a wise, heartrending work, about one of the most significant Israeli rituals – which should and must be thought about every year. And the question is: Doesn’t Netanyahu stand at the siren? Of course he does. And if Bartana wants to observe and ponder this standing at the siren – isn’t she allowed to do so?</p>",

        "text":["<p>Benjamin Netanyahu is holding talks with Hungarian leaders on the character of the soon-to-open Hungarian Holocaust (denial) museum. The prime minister of Israel is giving his blessing – once again – to the design of a nationalist narrative that makes a substantive alteration of the story of the Holocaust in general, and the story of the annihilation of Hungarian Jewry specifically.</p> \n<p>Against this background, it is worth trying to gain a better understanding of the motives driving the protagonists. Every few years there arises a new generation of similar leaders, local and global, who reflect and echo one another. Joseph Stalin and Adolph Hitler; Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt; Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Yitzhak Rabin; Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Menachem Begin.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Will Israel abet Hungary’s whitewash museum? | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In our generation, these are the leaders of paranoia and phobia: Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, Recep&nbsp;Tayyip Erdogan, Viktor Orban and Vladimir Putin. There is no conspiracy theory that is alien to them. As far as they are concerned, no external threat, imaginary or harebrained as it may be, does not grow to become a powerful bitter enemy, one that compels the emergency mobilization of forces needed to save the nation. And who, if not they, can be the savior from the demon they have just now created?</p> \n<p>In the U.S., they talk about “white supremacy,” in Hungary about “Hungary for Hungarians” and in Israel about “the Jewish state.” It is a global phenomenon that crosses all boundaries, ethnic, racial or religious, gathering into a tribal ghetto that is smaller than the modern state, which is diverse and inclusive of all its citizens. Their fierce antagonism to the foundations of democracy, and the attempt to do detriment to as many accomplishments and benefits of the open society as possible are evidence of inherent weaknesses and real existential fears. Each of them is building a separation wall and is interested in isolating his people and his race from the rest of the world. The highest wall of all encompasses the new Jewish ghetto that has been established in the Land of Israel.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, Erdogan, Trump and Orban have joined forces against a formidable and strong common enemy who is not at all afraid of them and who fights back using tools against which they are incapable of defending themselves. The unholy coalition of several Christian leaders and one Muslim leader, who are clearly tainted by anti-Semitism, together with a Jew, a prime minister of Israel who is steeped in auto-anti-Semitism, has taken a united stand against another Jew – George Soros – and declared all-out war on him.</p> \n<p>What is it about Soros that is so threatening to them? What is it that generates hope among so many people around the world who refuse to accept the yoke of this generation’s leaders? What are they afraid of?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Why Netanyahu hates George Soros so much | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The state most familiar to us, the nation-state, is a relatively new conception, only a few centuries old. A sociopolitical consensus that succeeded in fostering a delicate equilibrium of rule and government that balances several constituent elements: territory, language, culture, heritage and at times also a shared religion.</p> \n<p>The nation-state had a good run, up until two immense forces began the process of weathering and erosion of the state that had grown fatigued. From below it is being eaten away by sub-state forces and organizations. For example, the civil society and the division of the general corpus into sub-sections of discontented sub-identities (genders, skin colors, religious belongings, sexual preferences). And from above, globalization is gobbling up increasingly more authorities and powers that were once the sole province of the nation-state (tax shelters, worker mobility, shipping of goods and transfer of knowledge, migration and mobility of means of manufacture, among others).</p> \n<p>The aforementioned heads of state feel hunted, and are digging in behind their lines of defense, reducing to a minimum the democratic and civil arenas. “Illiberal democracy” is how Netanyahu’s anti-Semitic Hungarian friend described it. Anyone who is exactly like us is on our team, and anyone who is different is an adversary and an enemy.</p> \n<p>In order to reinforce and isolate the Jewish ghetto in Israel, Netanyahu is prepared to concede everything, including the memory and the lessons of the Holocaust, and will join forces with present-day adherents of the racial doctrine. Words cannot describe the abject shame of it all: An Israeli prime minister associates himself with some of the worst Holocaust deniers of our generation in Poland, Hungary, Turkey and the U.S., and became the leader who places the international seal of approval on the global coalition of ghetto builders. At the cost of declaring open season on Soros the Jew – the “Jewboy” as his opponents would label him – while engaging in total abandonment of the world of values and concepts of historic Judaism, its magnificent conception and its greatest sons and daughters.</p> \n<p>True, they have governments and power, armies and efficient mechanisms for the spread of darkness. But nothing can stop the world that has no borders. In part because the coalition standing before them is a coalition of openness, of which Soros is the primary global mainstay. His vision, of an open and equal society and state, is threatening to the conservatives seeking to maintain their freedom to be different, privileged and the keepers of all manner of discrimination. Each of them may possess a solution to his own problems – maybe – but has an utter lack of interest in the fate of the rest of humanity. They are like the man in the boat in the Jewish parable, who is drilling a hole in the floor beneath him. “What are you doing?” shout his friends. “What concern is it of yours?” he counters. “Am I not drilling under my own spot?”</p> \n<p>The partners in the coalition of walls and phobias – Jews and Jew-haters who have joined forces – are drilling so many holes in the floor of the human ship that they are threatening to sink it. Soros, conversely, is attempting to plug holes and save the human commonality for the benefit of us all.</p> \n<p>He has girded his loins for a war, and has become the greatest of all global builders of the dream of an open human society. He is a worthy and powerful opponent to all of the aforementioned bullies of nationalism. No longer fragments of organizations and abstract utopian ideas, but a courageous individual harboring concrete ideas for a more enlightened world, with capabilities, commitment and resoluteness.</p> \n<p>And the battle is being waged. At this juncture, they are the attackers and he the attacked. But at some point in the near future, freedom, as it always does, will win out. Openness will envelop and include even those who seek to deny it. And Soros himself will be the revered alternate symbol to the contemporary world and its miseries.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israeli jazz pianist Tom Oren last week won the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in Washington, D.C., the most prestigious prize for emerging jazz talent in the world.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t really understand how big a thing this is until after winning, and just as well,” says Oren, the first Israeli ever to win the prize. “If I’d grasped it earlier I might have been stressed.”</p> \n<p>“A moment before I started playing, I heard somebody cough,” says Oren. “I was supposed to start the piece alone, and this opening is critical – it brings in the other players, it sets everything. And at that dramatic second suddenly someone coughed. I don’t know if it was one of the musicians or someone in the audience. As far as I’m concerned it was a wonderful thing. Instinctively I played something like that cough. I sort of imitated it. It was funny. It was fun, and after that nothing mattered anymore. I just played.”</p> \n<p>Oren, 24, performed a rendition of Cole Porter’s “Just One of those Things” and “Just as Though You Were Here,” a song recorded by Frank Sinatra in 1942.</p> \n<p>“It’s an insane achievement,” says saxophonist Eli Degibri, who once took part in the competition, known as jazz’s most influential showcase for emerging talent, and didn’t past the semi-final stage. The biggest achievement by an Israeli musician in the Thelonious Monk Competition before Oren’s triumph was trumpeter Avishai Cohen’s coming in third in 1997.</p> \n<p>Some of the greatest jazz stars of our time – saxophonist Joshua Redman, trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, singer Cecile McLorin Salvant, pianist Tigran Hamasyan – came first in the competition in the past. The judges who gave Oren first prize – worth $25,000 and a recording contract with Concord – included some of the world’s best jazz pianists, such as Monk Institute chairman Herbie Hancock, Danilo Perez, Joanne Brackeen, Cyrus Chestnut, Monty Alexander, pianist Renee Rosnes and Jason Moran.</p> \n<p>“When he first started his intro on his first tune, you could hear that he was actually going to try something new but wasn’t sure if it was going to work out. But his ideas seemed to keep working out,” Moran told Downbeat magazine.</p> \n<p>“You could hear him on the edge. He just kept taking these unexpected turns. At some point, I just closed my book and said, ‘Here’s a kid who is really trying to reach within the music right now,’” he said.</p> \n<p>Oren was born in Tel Aviv and started playing jazz at 11. He graduated from Thelma Yellin High School of the Arts in Givatayim, Arison Campus of the Arts in Tel Aviv and the Israeli Conservatory of Music in Tel Aviv. His first jazz piano teacher was Amit Golan, one of the most important jazz instructors in Israel, who died in 2010 at 46.</p> \n<p>“I learned the second piece I played in the competition, “Just As Though You Were Here,” from Amit,” says Oren. “And I used all kinds of things he taught me. Later I found that the competition date, December 3, was the date Amit died.”</p> \n<p>After high school Oren studied at the Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music. Rimon president Yehuda Eder says that when the president of Berklee College of Music, Roger Brown, visited Thelma Yellin in 2012, he was excited to hear Oren play and invited him to Berklee any time he wanted. A year and a half ago Oren went to Berklee with a four-year scholarship.</p> \n<p>About two years ago, before going to Boston, Oren joined the Eli Degibri Quartet. “I was auditioning pianists at home and the moment Tom started playing it was clear he was the one. He’s a musician who’s all soul. When he plays there’s a feeling that the sounds bursting from the piano are attached to a parachute that leaves them in the room and in your soul a long time until they fall to the ground,” he says.</p> \n<p>Oren didn’t want to enter the Monk competition. “The thought of winning seemed totally imaginary,” he says. But his mother, musician Dorli Oren-Hazon and his teacher Gilad Ronen persuaded him to enter. Thirteen out of numerous pianists were chosen for the semi-final (the judges didn’t know the musicians whose recordings they heard).</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Yad Vashem museum currently has in its temporary exhibitions pavilion a fascinating exhibition titled &quot;Flashes of Memory – Photography during the Holocaust.&quot; The idea behind the exhibition is to tell the story behind the footage of the Holocaust, who stood behind the cameras and what their motives were.</p> \n<p>In our collective historical minds, the visual images we have of the Holocaust are blurred into one continuing narrative, but their sources are disparate.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Secretly photographing the Holocaust: A rare exhibition of photos taken by Jews in the ghetto</p> \n<p>There are photographs and films made by German Nazis, in some cases official propaganda units who informed the public back in the Fatherland how the parasitical Jews were finally being put to good use. Other photographs were taken privately by German soldiers and sent home to their families, and in some cases sent to anti-Semitic newspapers like &quot;Der Sturmer,&quot; which paid cash for fresh photographs of degenerate Jews.</p> \n<p>The Jews themselves were forbidden from owning cameras, except in the ghettoes, where the Judenrats were allowed to employ their official photographers. Eager to prove to the Germans that the ghetto population was an economic asset, the Judenrats prepared albums to show their inhabitants busy working. In many cases, the official Jewish photographers also made their own unstaged pictures, showing a more authentic side of ghetto life. Some of these secret collections have survived and are in the exhibition.</p> \n<p>The third source of Holocaust footage is from the camps themselves made by the liberating armies who arrived there in 1945. These were made for a variety of reasons – as evidence for the planned war-crimes trials, for news bulletins back home, to show the local German population, now under occupation, what had been done in their name, and for various other propaganda purposes. The Soviets even had the survivors of Auschwitz reenact camp life under the Nazis for their film-makers.</p> \n<p>I’ve been twice to Flashes of Memory. It takes time to absorb the background to the images, many of which I’ve seen before, and to understand the ways they’ve formed our awareness of the Holocaust, and I’m not sure I can put it into words. But I can’t help admire the way Yad Vashem, which has a mandate to create the official Israeli version of the Shoah, is prepared to shed light on the complexities of the narrative and provoke us to think how we should regard images that were staged for propaganda.</p> \n<p>If you’re in Jerusalem, do make the effort to see Flashes of Memory and in general, it’s worth visiting Yad Vashem soon, even if you have been there many times before, because as things are looking now, the institute may not be able to safeguard its integrity in the future.</p> \n<p>For the third time in four years, Yad Vashem’s historians find themselves at loggerheads with Benjamin Netanyahu. Back in 2015, they publicly corrected him on his breathtaking assertion that it had been the pro-Nazi Palestinian Grand Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini, and not the Germans, who had come up with the idea of wholesale extermination of European Jews.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, they spoke out again, sharply criticizing Netanyahu’s joint statement with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, that whitewashed the role played by Polish citizens in persecuting Jews during the Holocaust, that they said contained &quot;grave errors and deceptions&quot; which “contradict the existing and accepted historical knowledge in this field.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The Shame of&nbsp;Netanyahu’s Whitewash of Hungary’s anti-Semitism, Poland’s Holocaust Revisionism</p> \n<p>And now they find themselves opposed to the prime minister again, as he plans to establish a &quot;consensus narrative&quot; of the Holocaust in Hungary, together with the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, which is planning to inaugurate its own &quot;House of Fates&quot; Holocaust museum in Budapest.</p> \n<p>The Hungarians already have form on this. The narrative established by Orban’s court historians basically exonerates the fascist wartime Horthy regime and places the blame on the deportation of Hungarian Jews to their deaths in Auschwitz solely on the Germans, with sly hints at Jews who collaborated with the killers.</p> \n<p>Yad Vashem opposes the entire House of Fates project, but they’re not even part of the talks with the Hungarians.</p> \n<p>Israel is, for now, not one of the countries where historians do as they’re told by the politicians. But one wonders how long a government-funded body like Yad Vashem, whose biggest private donor is Netanyahu’s patron Sheldon Adelson, can maintain its independence, while the narrative of the Holocaust presented by the prime minister has been modified to serve his political and foreign policy goals.</p> \n<p>Over the last 70 years there have been many narratives of the Holocaust. Some reflect the different approaches of historians, the availability of source material and eye-witnesses, the gradual opening of official archives and the changing fashions of museum curating. Some of the narratives have served political purposes. In all cases, to understand the narrative, you need to ask two questions. Who are the perpetrators and who are the victims?</p> \n<p>For example, in the Soviet narrative of the Holocaust, there were no Jews. Only &quot;victims of fascism.&quot; And any political faction in occupied Europe not directly aligned with the Communist party are portrayed as collaborators. This Judenrein Marxist historical narrative serves today as a base for those who accuse Israelis of treating the Palestinians as latter-day Nazis.</p> \n<p>While it’s okay nowadays in Vladimir Putin’s Russia to talk about how Jews were specifically exterminated, some of the Soviet narrative persists, for instance in regard to the dates of WWII, which Russia insists officially began only in 1941, airbrushing from history the fact that for the war’s first two years, the Soviet Union were allied with Germany and partners in partitioning Poland - their armies even holding a joint military parade to mark the demarcation line they’d agreed.</p> \n<p>Russian historians can be sent to prison for “defaming” their country’s war record. Poland now also has legislation establishing one national narrative, and woe betide the Polish researcher who writes about how their countrymen committed pogroms of their own.</p> \n<p>No one in Israel has yet tried to force historians to toe the line, but Netanyahu, a historian’s son, has tried to build his own manipulated narrative: he started by christening the father-figure of the Palestinian national struggle as co-author of the Final Solution (granted, al-Husseini was a rabid anti-Semite) and by exonerating any nation from the sin of collaboration – if their current government is amenable to his policies.</p> \n<p>This new Netanyahu Holocaust narrative shouldn’t surprise us. It is on par with his redefinition of what a Jew is ( = uncritical pro-Likud nationalists) and of anti-Semitism ( = criticism of Israel). It is no less pernicious than the radical-left narrative that tries to detach the Holocaust from its Jewish character and put it in the same category as the &quot;crimes of Zionism.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>The rate of hospitalization of Haifa’s children for asthma is 2.32 times higher than the national average, according to a new Ministry of Health report released on Thursday.</p> \n<p>The report covered the number of hospital admissions for asthma, for children under 14 years of age, over a 20-year period. It points to “environmental factors” as one reason for the higher number of admissions in the Haifa area. The report also shows that hospitalization for asthma is 4.13-fold higher than the national average in the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) region, with the Golan Heights also showing a 2.12-fold higher rate of admissions. The lowest rate, according to the report, is in the Jerusalem area.</p> \n<p>The report documented the number of hospitalizations for at least two nights, between 1996 and 2015, for three age groups. The rates in Haifa are the highest in the 1-4 and the 5-15 age groups, and second-highest for the 0-1 age group. The highest incidence of hospitalization of babies was registered in the northern part of the country.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Haifa residents can die of pollution, as long as there’s no Arab deputy mayor | Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israel significantly lowers its polluting emissions since 2012</p> \n<p>“This is the first study we’ve done regarding the development of asthma in the Haifa region, spanning a period of 20 years,” says Dr. Isabella Karkis, the head of the Department of Environmental Epidemiology at the Health Ministry. “Over these two decades, changes were made and laws passed to reduce air pollution, yet Haifa still shows high rates of this disease, which lead to high rates of hospitalization.”</p> \n<p>The researchers assume that the high rates near the Kinneret and on the Golan Heights owe to a shortage of specialists in respiratory medicine, which leads to high admissions following uncontrolled asthma. “We assume that due to a shortage of specialists and a poor infrastructure of care facilities in these communities, there is less primary immediate care, which ultimately leads to more severe expression of the disease and to more hospital admissions,” explains Karkis. The Health Ministry also points to environmental factors as a possible cause.</p> \n<p>Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman said the report yet again proves that conditions in the Haifa region negatively affect the health of the area’s residents. “We need real action by all relevant agencies, including the Haifa municipality, the Energy Ministry and the Ministry for Environmental Protection, which, along with the Health Ministry, will enforce regulations that will prevent the harm inflicted on Haifa residents,” said Litzman.</p> \n<p>The ministry’s deputy director-general, Prof. Itamar Grotto, said that these numbers show a clear correlation. “The excess asthma morbidity in the Haifa region has been there for many years,” he said. The ministry’s director-general Moshe Bar Siman-Tov said that these results require the upgrade of pollution monitoring. “Haifa residents, like the rest of the country, are entitled to enjoy their right to good health,” he said.</p> \n<p>In 2016, the Health Ministry published a document that linked excessive morbidity in Haifa to air pollution coming from transportation and industry sources. “The Haifa region has a higher-than average number of people with cardiac and respiratory diseases, including an aggravation of childhood asthma and cancer,” said that document.</p>",

Police are investigating the incident.</p> \n<p>The name of the intelligence officer, a chief superintendent in the Israel Prison Service, was not released. His duties include thwarting attempted criminal activities by members of criminal organizations held at Rimonim.

He said no arrests had been made in connection to the previous incidents, adding that the agency was not aware of new developments in the investigations “of any of the attempts to harm Prison Service officials. Despite the explosions, shootings and fires, no one has been held accountable, and that worries me.”</p> \n<p>Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said Thursday that the Israel Prison Service is &quot;at the forefront of the fight against crime families.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;These gangs are under great pressure, even in prison,&quot; he said. &quot;Their bosses are behind bars and they are trying to show signs of life, carrying out operations which for us constitute a crossing of red lines.

When all those involved are caught, and they will be, the indictments and penalties will be the severest we can bring forward, so that we can effect better deterrence.”</p> \n<p>Qutair’s organization has operated for some years in central Israel and in Arab communities in the Sharon region. It is considered one of Israel’s most violent crime organizations. He and 20 members of his organization were detained a year ago.

In the past few months his relations with the prison authorities have deteriorated. Two months ago, one of his brothers died; Qutari’s requests to attend the funeral or visit the grave were denied. In response, Qutair burned a mattress, damaged a surveillance camera and assaulted a guard. Associates say the tension is a result of the refusal of the prison’s new superintendent, who was appointed two months ago, to meet with him.</p>",

Such decrees theoretically apply to Israelis as well, but they have been enforced only against Palestinians.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;West Bank spirals into violence as Hamas ups efforts to orchestrate attacks | Analysis&nbsp;■ &nbsp;Netanyahu's two greatest fears have suddenly materialized | Analysis</p> \n<p>Following several attacks on Israeli forces and civilians in the West Bank over the past week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would legalize thousands of Jewish homes in the area. The Prime Minister's Office said it would promote the construction of 82 new housing units in the settlement of Ofra near Amona, as well as two new industrial zones near the settlements of Avnei Hefetz and Betar Ilit.</p> \n<p>After Netanyahu's statement, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit&nbsp; approved the so-called market amendment that is expected to lead to the legalization of some 2,000 housing units in the West Bank. Mendelblit was also responding to pressure from Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, the No. 2 in the Habayit Hayehudi party behind Education Minister Naftali Bennett.</p> \n<p>The amendment is based on an order pertaining to government property in the West Bank. It says &quot;a transaction made in good faith between the custodian of government property in the territories and another person, regarding a property the custodian believed at the time to be government property,&quot; is valid, even if the land did not belong to the state.</p> \n<p>This principle was the basis for a Jerusalem District Court ruling in August, which stated that the Mitzpeh Kramim outpost must be legalized. Although this was an exceptional case, experts in property law in Israel and the West Bank believe that courts can interpret the ruling to allow a mass legalization of homes in the settlements.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, the Ministerial Committee for Legislation is expected to discuss a bill proposed by Smotrich to legalize a series of outposts and settlements.</p> \n<p>The proposal seeks to supply settlements whose status has yet to be confirmed with services that would prevent their demolition until they receive official status. The committee, headed by a former head of the Yesha Council of settlements, Pinchas Wallerstein, was set up last year but has yet to meet.</p>",

        "text":["<p>After a week of meetings with government and rebel officials in Rimbo, Sweden, the special UN envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, admits that his job is no walk in the park.</p> \n<p>Houthis don’t trust the distinguished 67-year-old diplomat, who was appointed in February. As a well-connected former British diplomat, he’s viewed by the rebels as someone who sells weapons to the Saudis for slaughtering them. Yemen’s government, meanwhile, suspects Griffiths of being too indulgent with the Houthis and of backing their impossible demands.</p> \n<p>All the same, he has the sides negotiating after a two-year break, and he has just pulled off a prisoner-swap deal that might be implemented within days.</p> \n<p>The Houthis are holding about 8,000 prisoners, including the brother of Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, former Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi and a senior member of the Reform Party ruling Yemen’s south. The government is holding about 7,500 Houthi prisoners who were captured during the last four years of war.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Is Saudi Arabia repaying Trump for Khashoggi by attacking Linda Sarsour? | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Both sides say prisoners have been severely tortured in covert prisons, and The Associated Press has published an expos&eacute; in which people held prisoner by the Houthis recount their torture. This includes being hung by their wrists for days, food and sleep deprivation, beatings with clubs and rape threats. Similar descriptions come from Houthi prisoners in government prisons.</p> \n<p>Both sides say the number of prisoners about to be exchanged is much smaller than the overall number. The organization set up by prisoners’ mothers has documented 18,000 arrests, including about 1,000 torture victims at more than 30 black sites.</p> \n<p>The prisoners’ condition is a small part of the tragedy experienced by Yemen’s 29 million or so people; the United Nation says they are suffering “the greatest human tragedy” going on in the world. More than 10,000 people have been killed in this long war, and 40,000 to 50,000 have died from famine and disease.</p> \n<p>Unlike Syria, where some 560,000 people have been killed according to the last count, in Yemen starvation is the greatest enemy; around 20 million people are suffering from it. In Syria, even during the worst fighting, people managed to obtain humanitarian aid, but in Yemen the routes for aid convoys are blocked.</p> \n<p>The state’s most important port, Hodeidah, through which 90 percent of aid shipments are supposed to pass, is ruled by the rebels. Part of the city of Hodeidah, where some 600,000 people live, is ruled by the Arab coalition. From the north there are no safe routes for aid convoys, and in the south, one part of which is ruled by the regime and the coalition, and the other by Al-Qaida, it’s impossible to transfer food and medicine to the people besieged in the north.</p> \n<p>Indeed, if the parties’ hugs and kisses when they signed the prisoner-exchange deal are translated into acts, it will mark an optimistic opening to a long, complex diplomatic campaign scheduled to last until Friday and resume at the beginning of next year. At the moment the goal is to agree to open the capital Sanaa’s airport and reach a joint-control arrangement on Hodeidah with UN supervision, to enable at least aid shipments.</p> \n<p>Shi’ites and Sunnis</p> \n<p>But the diplomatic moves could be thwarted. The war has morphed from a tribal-religious struggle between the Zaidi sect of the Shi’ites, led by the al-Houthi family representing some 40 percent of the population, and the Sunni administration, to an international war.</p> \n<p>It’s not necessarily a religious war. The tribes that joined the al-Houthi family in north Yemen demanded political and economic rights based on their percentage of the population. A similar demand was made by the southern, mostly Sunni, tribes, which want their part in the oil revenues from the southern oil fields.</p> \n<p>Theoretically, the deprived groups, both Sunni and Zaidi, could have formed an alliance of the kind that launched the Arab Spring in 2011, which led to the ousting of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The ousted president, who conducted a violent campaign against the Houthis already before the revolution, switched sides to regain power. Last December he was assassinated by rebels because he tried to switch sides again and join the Saudis, who probably promised him a considerable part in the government if he withdrew his forces from the alliance with the Houthis.</p> \n<p>This tribal war developed into a regional war for hegemony in 2015. In January that year, when Salman was crowned Saudi king, he launched the Arab coalition; key members are the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt and Sudan. The goal is to subdue the Houthis, who are seen as Iran’s allies.</p> \n<p>The coalition chalked up a few important achievements like taking over the port of Aden and blocking the Houthis’ expansion southward. But despite this and the coalition’s American backing, the coalition failed to achieve a decisive victory. Brokerage attempts by Kuwait and the United Nations failed due to the Houthis’ refusal to withdraw from all the territory they conquered and hand over their weapons to the government.</p> \n<p>Khashoggi’s ghost</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia’s efforts to set up a recognized government in Yemen headed by President Hadi turned into a farce when Hadi moved to Saudi Arabia, from where he’s “running” the affairs of a nonexistent state.</p> \n<p>Around two months ago the body of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi rolled into the Yemeni swamp, as it were, placing Saudi Arabia and the Yemen war’s architect, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, on a collision course with Washington.</p> \n<p>This also caused a confrontation between Congress and President Donald Trump. In March the Senate discussed halting U.S. weapons sales to the Saudis because of the high casualties in Yemen and its refusal to let humanitarian aid reach civilians in besieged cities. Mohammed went to Washington in a bid to persuade senators to drop the proposal, claiming that if Saudi Arabia can’t fight in Yemen, then Iran, Al-Qaida and the Islamic State will take its place.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel's Iron Dome defense of Saudi Arabia aims to avert collapse of Trump and Netanyahu's entire Middle East strategy&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>That was also Trump’s argument, and the legislation got delayed to this month. Trump explained to members of Congress that if the United States doesn’t sell arms to Saudi Arabia, European countries will step in. This&nbsp; made sense in view of Riyadh’s arms deals with France and Britain.</p> \n<p>After Khashoggi’s murder, a few Republican and Democratic senators renewed the debate on the proposal, and this time it could pass, though Trump might veto it. Mohammed, who knows he’s persona non grata on Capitol Hill, hasn’t come to Washington for the recent debates.</p> \n<p>Five large lobbying firms that worked for the kingdom have cut their ties with the royal family due to the murder. The Washington Post, where Khashoggi worked, made it clear to one lobbyist for the Saudis, Ed Rogers, that he’ll have to choose between writing his pieces for the paper or sticking with Riyadh. Congressmen say the lobbying firms have stopped sending them requests about arms sales to the Saudis.</p> \n<p>Only Trump is still convinced that he can block the legislation. But judging by the speed in which senators and House members are moving the process forward (on Thursday, the senate voted to end aid), it appears that at least part of it will pass by the end of the year before the recess, with the more significant part passed at the beginning of the next session.</p> \n<p>In Trump’s opinion, punishing Saudi Arabia is tantamount to rewarding Iran and harming a vital ally in the anti-Iran alliance. Here also lies the Israeli connection. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has actively participated in shaping Trump’s response to Khashoggi’s murder. According to the Israeli strategy, to block Iran, the Houthis have to be subdued, and only Saudi Arabia can do that.</p> \n<p>Iran, for its part, supports negotiations between the sides, because it too isn’t capable of generating the victory for its side, the Houthis. And any diplomatic solution will yield political achievements for its prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, who have been mired in financial and military difficulties. Griffiths, who holds the ends of all these threads, must now weave the arrangement that will stop the killing.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Anti-Defamation League has emerged as a supporter of controversial legislation targeting boycotts of Israel. But internal ADL documents obtained by the Forward show that the organization’s own staff believed the laws could actually harm American Jews.</p> \n<p>In the summer of 2016, ADL staff wrote an internal memo arguing that legislating against the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement was a really bad idea. “Simply put, ADL does not believe that anti-BDS legislation is a strategic way to combat the BDS movement or defend Israel and is ultimately harmful to the Jewish community,” the memo reads. It calls anti-BDS laws “ineffective, unworkable, unconstitutional, and bad for the Jewish community.”</p> \n<p>Yet in the two years since the memo was written, the ADL has vigorously supported anti-BDS legislation, including one&nbsp;bill&nbsp;currently moving through the U.S. Congress, and some of those that have passed in statehouses across the country.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: At ADL summit in New York, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Cory Booker confront anti-Semitism ‘plague’</p> \n<p>Civil liberties groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have called the proposed legislation, the “Israel Anti-Boycott Act,” unconstitutional. The ADL, on its website, asks supporters to lobby their representatives to support its passage.</p> \n<p>The memo from the summer of 2016 reveals a stark division within the ADL between the analyses provided by the organization’s professional staff, and the path taken by its board and CEO.</p> \n<p>It also illustrates the delicate balance the organization has struggled to strike since the departure of former national director Abraham Foxman between&nbsp;critics on the right&nbsp;who accuse it of liberal bias, and critics on the left who condemn what they see as an&nbsp;insufficient commitment&nbsp;to civil rights.</p> \n<p>“My impression is that it’s designed to bolster their credentials among the Jewish right,” said Joshua Shanes, a professor of Jewish studies at the College of Charleston, of the ADL’s support for some anti-BDS legislation. “I’m assuming that it’s a combination of concern about losing donors on the right, and some level of sympathy.”</p> \n<p>The ADL did not respond to multiple requests for comment on two internal ADL documents obtained by the Forward, the texts of which the Forward provided to the ADL. It also did not respond to questions about its current positions on anti-BDS laws.</p> \n<p>The anti-BDS bill moving through Congress appears to be close to passing. Technically an update of 1970s-era legislation that bans U.S. companies from participating in a boycott imposed by another country, the new act would ban participation in boycotts fostered by international organizations. It is particularly intended to target efforts from the United Nations Human Rights Council and other groups to boycott companies doing business in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Its supporters are trying to get it through before the end of the year as part of a spending bill, according to a report in&nbsp;The Intercept.&nbsp;First introduced in 2017, the bill has been a&nbsp;major legislative priority&nbsp;for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and other Jewish groups, including the ADL, have added their support. It has faced&nbsp;opposition&nbsp;from civil libertarians.</p> \n<p>Local anti-BDS laws, meanwhile, have passed in 26 U.S. states. These measures generally seek to keep state governments from doing business with companies that participate in a boycott of Israel. Federal courts have overturned a handful&nbsp;of the laws, amid challenges brought by civil liberties groups that say they restrict First Amendment rights.</p> \n<p>The two internal ADL documents obtained by the Forward were drafted by staff members in the summer of 2016, at a time when ADL regional offices were fielding requests from other Jewish groups to work together on passing state-level anti-BDS laws. ADL was also&nbsp;under criticism&nbsp;from right-wing Jewish groups, particularly the Zionist Organization of America, for opposing some of the anti-BDS bills.</p> \n<p>The documents attack the anti-BDS laws as unconstitutional, bad policy, and generally bad for the Jews. The first document, titled “ADL’S POSITION ON ANTI-BDS LEGISLATION,” says that the anti-BDS laws are bad for American Jews, diverting “community resources to an ineffective, unworkable, and unconstitutional endeavor instead of investing in more effective multi-layered strategies.” It says that bills raise the profile of the BDS movement while giving “the appearance that the Jewish community exercises undue influence in government.”</p> \n<p>The memo argues that the model many state-level laws have followed, of identifying companies that boycott Israel and then banning financial ties between them and state governments, was unworkable, since it would be difficult to prove why a particular company wasn’t doing business with Israel.</p> \n<p>It says that government investigation into the reasons why a particular company isn’t doing business with Israel “would represent a significant government intrusion.”</p> \n<p>It goes on to argue that a decision to boycott a country, “as despicable as it may be in the case of Israel,” is constitutionally protected as a form of political speech.</p> \n<p>“Anti-BDS bills often are portrayed as ‘McCarthyistic’ attacks on free speech and democratic values,” the document reads. “In turn, they give more attention to BDS supporters and turn them into First Amendment martyrs.”</p> \n<p>A person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named to protect relationships, said that people from a number of ADL departments collaborated together on the documents, which were intended to provide internal guidance to ADL staff. The person said that the ADL’s national director, Jonathan Greenblatt, was unhappy with the documents’ conclusions, and the person does not believe the documents were ever circulated.</p> \n<p>At the time they were drafted, the ADL’s public posture on anti-BDS bills was changing dramatically.</p> \n<p>In 2015, when the push for anti-BDS bills first picked up steam, the ADL was a staunch opponent of the efforts. Foxman, the organization’s former national director, in an&nbsp;op-ed&nbsp;published in his last months at the helm, publicly condemned anti-BDS laws.</p> \n<p>“The appeal of such legislation is understandable,” Foxman wrote of the anti-BDS bills. “Magic wands, however, are just that — magical. They give one the feeling of control and power, but they are not real.”</p> \n<p>Greenblatt substantially changed the organization’s approach to the issue. In the summer of 2016, just as the internal memos were drafted, the ADL’s public position on the legislation had turned&nbsp;confusing&nbsp;and&nbsp;self-contradictory.</p> \n<p>On the one hand, Greenblatt, told the Forward that summer that he believed that some anti-BDS legislation enacted recently on the state level was vulnerable to First Amendment challenges.</p> \n<p>At the same time, in June, he&nbsp;praised&nbsp;New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for his anti-BDS executive order, which was condemned by civil liberties groups.</p> \n<p>“We simply have made it clear that ADL will not stand in the way of anti-BDS legislative efforts, and will praise lawmakers who stand up to defend Israel,” Greenblatt told the Forward&nbsp;at the time.</p> \n<p>Yet the documents indicate that inside the organization, key staff members were not on board.</p> \n<p>The second 2016 document obtained by the Forward, written as an internal FAQ on the ADL’s position on BDS, says that politicians should be told that anti-BDS legislation is “harmful to the Jewish community.”</p> \n<p>“ADL believes that you can applaud legislators or other elected officials for standing with Israel and condemning BDS efforts,” it reads. “However, anti-BDS legislation is ultimately harmful to the Jewish community. Efforts should be made to educate legislators and others about why anti-BDS legislation is harmful to the Jewish community and undermines efforts to meaningfully combat BDS.”</p> \n<p>Since his ascension to Foxman’s post, Greenblatt has battled allegations from right-wing groups and conservative Jewish critics that he was steering the ADL in a partisan liberal direction. Greenblatt has been unsparingly critical of the Trump administration, and made criticism of Trump policies a hallmark of his leadership.</p> \n<p>Yet on anti-BDS laws, he has fallen in line with some of his conservative critics.</p> \n<p>In September 2017, Greenblatt co-authored a Washington Post op-ed supporting the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, arguing that it would not restrict free speech. In his op-ed, Greenblatt wrote that concerns about the bill were “unfounded.”</p> \n<p>The ADL did not respond to a request for comment on its current position on the act. On its website, it encourages supporters to send their senators an email that ends: “Your support for the Israel Anti-Boycott Act would send a clear message that internationally-motivated boycotts against Israel are unacceptable to the United States.”</p> \n<p>Yet civil liberties groups, led by the ACLU, have raised consistent concerns about the bill, even after it was rewritten earlier this year to remove the possibility of jail time for those who broke the law.</p> \n<p>“When boycotts are politically motivated, they are protected as free expression under the constitution, and that’s why the ACLU opposes this bill,” Kate Ruane, senior legislative council at the ACLU, told the Forward. “The government is just not permitted in the U.S. to disfavor one side in a political debate.”</p> \n<p>For more stories, go to www.forward.com.

        "text":["<p>Israel has proved more than once that it’s capable of taking a pragmatic, utilitarian approach to solving controversial problems. Examples include accepting reparations from Germany and withdrawing from Sinai in exchange for generous U.S. aid that has since reached tens of billions of dollars. Even prisoner exchanges meet the criteria for choosing pragmatism over principles.</p> \n<p>But there are issues on which pragmatism, logic and morality give way to populism and ulterior motives. And not just populism, but the kind that causes economic and social harm and may even damage public health.</p> \n<p>That is the case with Israel’s treatment of asylum seekers. Since April, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reached an agreement with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, then withdrew from it less than 24 hours later, the government has had no plan for addressing this issue.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Murder of 12-year-old girl shows human rights in Israel are only for Jews | Analysis&nbsp;■ New UN refugee representative: If Israel doesn't act now, it will fail this generation</p> \n<p>The UN agreement involved resettling 16,250 asylum seekers in Western nations and giving around the same number temporary residency status within Israel. An additional 6,000 or so were to leave the country.</p> \n<p>That would have required the state to provide health, welfare and education services for some 16,000 asylum seekers and to allow them to work in Israel. The arrangement would have decreased state spending on asylum seekers, but none of it was implemented.</p> \n<p>The ethically, economically and socially responsible position is that for as long as they are here, the asylum seekers’ basic health, welfare and employment needs must be met. If the moral argument doesn’t sway right-wing cabinet members, perhaps the economic ones will.</p> \n<p>The economics of public health rests on practices such as investing in preventive medicine and treating problems while they’re still small. That is both healthier and cheaper. But when basic health services aren’t available to asylum seekers, the chances that their problems will worsen, and perhaps even harm those around them, increase. The state would then have to enter the picture in any case, and bear the costs.</p> \n<p>The same principle applies to social services. If problems are addressed in a timely fashion, crime and violence can be significantly reduced. But neglect encourages crime and violence and is liable to increase morbidity and worsen social and economic problems. The right-wing ministers understand this, but nevertheless promote a policy of neglect in the hope that this will kill the asylum seekers’ desire to be here.</p> \n<p>An interministerial committee headed by the director of the Interior Ministry’s Population, Immigration and Border Authority, Prof. Shlomo Mor-Yosef, has recommended providing health and welfare services to asylum seekers, especially the most vulnerable among them. The Finance Ministry has approved the plan, which will cost 28 million shekels ($7.5 million), but the interior and social affairs ministers haven’t yet approved the committee’s proposals. It’s not a burning issue for them.</p> \n<p>What the cabinet did approve was bringing in some 2,000 workers from India and the Philippines, instead of taking advantage of the fact that the asylum seekers are already here and in need of work, and would be able to take care of themselves if they got it, instead of relying on state funding.</p> \n<p>Tourism Minister Yariv Levin, who strove to get the migrant workers brought over, feared that if these jobs were given to asylum seekers, it would undermine the government’s position: If they can’t be deported, their lives should be made miserable in the hopes that they’ll leave. Pragmatism, morality and economic logic lost.</p> \n<p>The vehement opposition on the right (partly from politicians, but mainly from social media users) has led Netanyahu to decide not to decide and simply to perpetuate the asylum seekers’ unregulated situation. The price of this neglect is to worsen the asylum seekers’ distress and potentially increase friction and tension between them and their Israeli neighbors. Netanyahu must bring his interior and social affairs ministers into line and demand that they implement the Mor-Yosef committee’s recommendations, even if this tension benefits him.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the 1980s, when the West Bank settlement enterprise took off, the leading slogan to attract home buyers was “five minutes from Kfar Sava.” The ads promised spacious single-family homes in a rural setting for a low price. In addition to towns such as Ariel, Betar Ilit, Efrat, Immanuel, Ma’aleh Adumim and Modi’in Ilit, small communities were established in which each buyer received a half-dunam (around 5,450 square feet) plot on which to build their dream home.</p> \n<p>There’s a new slogan now, “East Gush Dan.” The Yesha Council of Settlements has for some years been marketing the settlements of the West Bank as being near major roads and transportation arteries and job hubs — 10 minutes from Route 6 and not too far from both Jerusalem and the Tel Aviv area. Now, large apartment complexes are being built to attract new residents across the Green Line.</p> \n<p>One example of this trend can be seen in Kedem. Harei Zahav, a developer with projects in 20 West Bank settlements, is aggressively marketing a 900-unit project here. Ads for the project, aimed primarily at young religious families, describe Kedem as a new community. But Kedem is not really a separate community; it is a new densely-built neighborhood of Avnei Hefetz, a settlement of 500 families in private homes, 4 kilometers southeast of Tul Karm and 15 kilometers from Tzur Yitzhak. When the new neighborhood is fully occupied, it will change the character of the entire community.</p> \n<p>“The city plan that was suitable 20 or 30 years ago included one- and two-family homes. That won’t work anymore,” says Harei Zahav CEO Shlomi Vermstein. “There isn’t a lot of land for building, and people understand the need for high-quality, high-density housing. This is also what draws new residents to the area.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Co-opting a fetus for their land grab | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some Palestinian communities, contending with the expansion of the Jewish settlements and outposts, have also begun to build higher.</p> \n<p>“Boundaries were set for the village beyond which you can’t build, so we’re building up,” says A. of Al-Luban, a village near Beit Arye, where three-story buildings are visible. “We’re farmers, we like to live on the ground, but there’s no other choice.”</p> \n<p>Lessons of the disengagement</p> \n<p>The Kedem project is one of several high-density construction projects in the West Bank that have gained broad support from the Yesha Council, the administrative body for Jewish communities in the West Bank. It also receives massive aid from Amana, the Gush Emunim settlement movement, which has similar construction projects of its own. The two organizations shifted their focus after the 2005 disengagement and the evacuation of settlements in the Gaza Strip and in northern Samaria. A year later, Yesha Council leaders began putting together an alternative plan and new vision: 1 million residents in Judea and Samaria.</p> \n<p>Building in the West Bank often comes up against problems, such as the government’s construction freeze policy and legal battles over homes built on Palestinian-owned land, that led to the evacuation of Amona and of buildings in Netiv Ha’avot and Beit El and led the Yesha Council to seek to comply with approved master plans and to maximize construction possibilities.</p> \n<p>Once this vision was consolidated, the Yesha Council set out to convince two audiences, the government and the Israeli public. In June 2017, the Knesset Interior and Environment Committee held a special session marking the 50th anniversary of the Six-Day War and of settlement in Judea and Samaria. Only a very small number of MKs attended: then-committee chairman David Amsalem (Likud), Eitan Broshi (Zionist Union) and Housing Minister Yoav Galant (Kulanu).</p> \n<p>Present in much greater numbers were Yesha Council officials and the heads of West Bank communities, who came prepared with new thesis: Rather than talk of territories and settlements, talk about the new Gush Dan. Gush Dan East.</p> \n<p>The plan was backed up with economic data. The Yesha officials commissioned a study based on the average price of a four-room apartment in Greater Tel Aviv at the time, 1.7 million shekels ($451,500). The average price of a four-room apartment in the area bounded by Karnei Shomron, Ariel and Modi’in Ilit was 1.3 million shekels. According to the Yesha Council’s calculations, 67,000 new housing units, for 340,000 people, could be built in a belt east of the Sharon, Gush Dan and Modi’in.</p> \n<p>“If we just look eastward, we’ll find the solution just a 10-minute drive from Gush Dan,” Yesha Council deputy head Yigal Dilmoni said after the meeting. “Western Samaria has a diverse population and is suitable for religious, secular and ultra-Orthodox Jews, and without any special effort, but just by advancing building plans, tens of thousands of housing units could be built. An eastward-looking planning approach is what the government needs to adopt.”</p> \n<p>Opposition at home</p> \n<p>Early signs of this change in approach can be seen in Leshem, a religious community next to Alei Zahav, an old and largely secular settlement in southwestern Samaria near the Palestinian village of Deir Balut. Leshem has some one-family homes, but consists mainly of terraced apartment buildings, unlike Alei Zahav and Peduel. Ariel is about 15 kilometers to the east, approximately the distance between Herzliya and Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>“There’s great momentum here,” says Vermstein. His company, Harei Zahav, is also in charge of this project. “People are moving to Leshem for the quality of life, and because it’s just 10 minutes from the main traffic arteries. Other communities in Samaria are also not far from Route 6. Kedem is 10 minutes from Route 6 and even Mevo Dotan, which is considered more isolated, is just a 20-minute drive from Route 6.”</p> \n<p>Leshem is filling up fast, as are other towns and communities between Leshem and Ariel to the north and around Modi’in Illit, which are all in the process of shifting to high-density building. One of these places is Beit Arye-Ofarim, where the high-rise construction was not warmly welcomed.</p> \n<p>In September, signs were posted at the entrance to Beit Arye and on the roads to it announcing the construction of a new neighborhood, Nofei Dan. Some 515 housing units are planned for this new neighborhood, south of Ofarim, including one-family homes and terraced apartments. The project is slated for inclusion in an upcoming Mehir Lamishtaken lottery, with 20% of the apartments earmarked for young people from settlements in the area. The project was one of the main campaign issues in November’s mayoral election in Beit Arye. The winner, Yehuda Elbaum, who unseated Avi Na’im, promised to change the mix of the project and not allow high-density construction that would change the community’s character.</p> \n<p>The change in community character is a significant challenge for the Yesha Council. It launched an information campaign in settlements and media outlets associated with the right and the settlers. In a column in the newspaper Makor Rishon in February, Yesha Council Chairman Hananel Dorani wrote: “Looking ahead, the patterns of thinking and action in the settlement movement need to be changed in two main areas: high-rise construction and doing away with admission committees. The available land for building is not plentiful. Until now, we’ve been used to rural communities with a one-family home on a half-dunam plot, but the goal from now on should be to build as many housing units as possible on that same land. High-density construction — building up or in a terraced fashion, depending on topography — will change the balance in the area and also require a new approach to infrastructure development to suit the number of residents in the future.”</p> \n<p>The Yesha Council wants to eliminate the admission committees, believing they slow down building projects. “We’re trying to convince communities to accept everyone,” says one council member, who asked to remain anonymous. “It’s not easy, and there’s opposition, but settlements need not be limited to religious and right-wing [people]. It should be opened up to all.”</p> \n<p>Vermstein agrees. “Most of the people who buy a home in a settlement ... live between Hadera and Gedera,” he says, referring to the towns that traditionally marked the northern and southern boundaries, respectively, of central Israel. They “are looking for a place with a high quality of life and good prices. They’re looking for a community. A small portion are from Judea and Samaria. We sold 150 three-room apartments at 690,000 shekels. These are apartments that have the potential for the addition of two rooms, so young couples can break walls and enlarge the apartment. The sales were very successful.”</p> \n<p>According to the Yesha Council, the Jewish population in the West Bank is 435,000, with a large portion in the big towns. There was 3.4% growth in 2017 — down 0.5% from 2016, but significantly above the 2% growth of Israel as a whole. In the past decade, the Jewish population in the West Bank rose 4.5%. Some of this growth is attributable to the ultra-Orthodox population in places like Immanuel, Betar Ilit and Modi’in Ilit. A smaller part comes from families joining new projects.</p> \n<p>Infrastructure problems and traffic</p> \n<p>The developers, community heads and Yesha Council officials want to guarantee that the high-density construction is accompanied by open spaces and large parks. Yet, as with communities within Israel proper with accelerated development (such as Rosh Ha’ayin, where traffic became a serious problem before Route 444 was widened), infrastructure is also a problem in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>The main issue is traffic. The vast majority of Israelis living in the West Bank work in Jerusalem, Greater Tel Aviv or the Sharon, just north of Tel Aviv. At peak traffic hours, they join the tens of thousands of others all headed for these places. By 6:30 A.M., the major roads in the West Bank are pretty clogged.</p> \n<p>Yesha Council officials say they are working with the government on the infrastructure problems, adding that there are plans to build “bypass roads,” such as a detour around the Palestinian town of Hawara, and to widen the “tunnel road” from Gush Etzion to Jerusalem. “It will take time of course, but we certainly won’t be able to get far without major attention to infrastructure.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the week just passed, two major evils reappeared –&nbsp;terror in the West Bank&nbsp;and the high cost of living. Two shooting incidents took the lives of three people – the newborn Amiad Israel, who was delivered prematurely via an emergency operation on Sunday after his mother, Shira Ish-Ran, was seriously wounded; and two Israel Defense Forces soldiers who had been guarding a settler’s hitchhiking stop north of Ramallah.</p> \n<p>A series of hikes in the prices of such commodities as water, electricity, subsidized bread and other foods landed on Israelis, making it clear that 2019 will be a cruel year for their bank balances. At least they can commiserate with each other by means of conversations on their cellphones, whose rates remain relatively low.</p> \n<p>A wave of terror and a wave of price hikes – those are the very last things&nbsp;a prime minister would wish to see in headlines&nbsp;in advance of what is emerging as the death throes of the battle over the 20th Knesset. The deterioration of the security situation in the occupied territories does not present a real electoral threat to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party. The public is mature enough to understand that to terror attacks like those we saw this week, there is no solution. Even in any future “diplomatic solution,” there will be no good tidings when it comes to organizations like Hamas and Islamic Jihad.</p> \n<p>The danger that lurks for Netanyahu in the wake of the escalation of violence is related to the coalition. The Tekuma faction of Habayit Hayehudi, led by Minister Uri Ariel and MK Bezalel Smotrich, is weighing future moves if a series of demands that it intends to make of “the prime minister and the defense minister” are not positively received. Their resignation could drag with it in its wake other parts of Habayit Hayehudi – and that’s the end of this government.</p> \n<p>Avigdor Lieberman is no longer in the Kirya defense compound in Tel Aviv, there is no one on whom to cast responsibility, to accuse of weakness – something that Likud and Habayit Hayehudi used to love to do with Lieberman. The “address” this time is someone else, the one seen this week in flattering photos with smiling soldiers, drinking steaming coffee.</p> \n<p>From Netanyahu’s point of view, preserving the government means some sort of surrender in the face of the Tekuma demands. Heaven forbid that falls apart before the decree from on high – the so-called Gideon Sa’ar law – is passed by the Knesset.</p> \n<p>The protests against the high cost of living that have returned to the streets of the country’s largest cities Friday, replete with fluorescent vests, in the wake of the success of such demonstrations in France, have hit the soft belly of Likud. When social justice and economic issues seep into the agenda, when young couples and elderly people and single parents fill up the television screens during the main evening newscasts – Netanyahu begins to sweat. And when he panics, all the demons burst forth from Balfour Street: Soon we’ll be hearing the Akunises and the Regevs, the Bitans and the Zohars and all the rest of the handservants attacking the protesters, insinuating that they are out to topple the government and accusing them of receiving assistance from foreign NGOs.</p> \n<p>Yair Netanyahu will write that they are traitors. The premier’s inner circle will point fingers at&nbsp;George Soros, the financier and troublemaker. The entire apparatus will be at full throttle, 24/7.</p> \n<p>“Netanyahu is not responsible,” one Likud minister said on Thursday. “We have a full-time minister of finance. He requested and received all possible tools. Please address all complaints to him.”</p> \n<p>If the prime minister has any luck, it’s thanks to the opposition. The heads of the center-left parties and their other senior representatives aren’t identified in public opinion as champions of social causes. The primary issues keeping Avi Gabbay, Tzipi Livni, Yair Lapid and Ofer Shelah busy at present are in the diplomatic-security realm. A sudden turnaround on their part won’t be credible.</p> \n<p>Lapid, head of Yesh Atid, was first to make a misstep. On Wednesday he posted a social-media selfie of himself in a bright-yellow vest on the well-tended street where he lives in northern Tel Aviv. He’s been working hard for three-and-a-half years to make everyone forget his stint as a failing finance minister who raised taxes. Early in the current Knesset term, he announced that he would try to save the country’s foreign relations, which is why he intended to serve as a type of alternative foreign minister. It was artificial and it didn’t really stick, but at least it was a strategy.</p> \n<p>The moment the first inklings of a social-economic movement emerged, Lapid shed his diplomatic tailcoat, put on the vest and returned to the roots that gave him 19 Knesset seats in the 2013 election.</p> \n<p>Time to woo</p> \n<p>A blurry photo this week showed Lapid and&nbsp;Benny Gantz, novice politician and former Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, sitting together in a caf&eacute; on the roof of a Tel Aviv high-rise. Apparently, the courting season is underway.</p> \n<p>About a month ago, maybe a bit more, when the political arena was tensing up for the possibility of an early election, Lapid confronted Gantz with a type of ultimatum: Decide now – yes or no. I can’t wait any longer, Lapid explained to his close circle. Unruffled, Gantz replied that he was in no hurry and that from his point of view the conditions weren’t yet ripe to make a statement about his political path. In retrospect, he was right. The election is on hold. The next date that looms for dissolution of the Knesset is the second half of January, and that’s not carved in stone, either.</p> \n<p>Despite the assertive, military-style “nyet” that Lapid heard, and notwithstanding the prevailing assumption that Gantz is busy forming a party of his own and has no interest in joining any other faction as a second fiddle – and rightly so, from his perspective – contacts between the two have continued.</p> \n<p>There’s nothing to conclude from this other than the obvious: Gantz is the wild card in the pack in the 2019 election. In polls, he is predicted to steal four to five seats from Lapid and thus reduce Yesh Atid to a projected 12-13 seats. When Lapid sits across from him, what he sees is an affable executioner. His desire to know as soon as possible where Gantz is headed is understandable.</p> \n<p>It would be interesting to know whether Gantz shared with Lapid the frank response he recently gave someone else who asked him about his intentions – not with respect to functional-practical questions but in terms of substantive principle. “I will take right-wing positions,” Gantz replied in all simplicity.</p> \n<p>That’s an important statement, the most important to date, coming from a candidate who’s been perceived as the great white hope of the center-left camp, which is scouring the horizon desperately for a knight in shining armor. (The response to a request for a reaction to Gantz’s quote was that he didn’t wish to respond.)</p> \n<p>Given the electoral situation, there’s nothing more logical. Without three or four seats shifting from the right/center-right parties (mainly Likud and Kulanu) to the other side of the river, the other camp can forget about ascending to power. Its leaders will be doomed to wander in the opposition wasteland in the next Knesset, too – or, alternately, to squabble among themselves for portfolios in Benjamin Netanyahu’s fifth government.</p> \n<p>Since at this fairly early point in time Gantz is the only figure on the political map capable of delivering the very valuable goods, it’s clear that he has to talk rightward, even if deep down he inclines leftward. Every greenhorn political consultant would advise him to take that path. The question is: What are “right-wing positions”? How far will he go? Against the two-states-for-two-peoples principle? Against the evacuation of isolated settlements by agreement? Against the Clinton Plan? Those are Likud’s positions. Where is the rather slippery point, down the line, at which where Gantz will begin to look like an imitation of a Likudnik?</p> \n<p>This sort of comportment could certainly change the rules we’ve become accustomed to in election campaigns. If the strategy bears fruit, Gantz would be able to dislodge Netanyahu from his comfort zone as the sole security wiz and as the undisputed leader of the right, including the soft right. On the other hand, Gantz could lose support among the camp that’s looking in his direction with fervently pleading eyes. Left-wingers are known to be quick to be disappointed. This isn’t what we were hoping for, they will grumble bitterly before returning resentfully to their mother parties. He’ll be caught in a crossfire from right and from left. He could lose everything.</p> \n<p>To get out of complicated situations like these unscathed, one needs to be endowed with first-rate political skills. Moderate ambition, a winning smile and blue eyes won’t cut it.</p> \n<p>Holiday for democracy</p> \n<p>About three weeks ago, Joint Arab List MKs Ahmad Tibi, Talab Abu Arar and Jamal Zahalka were in the Knesset, discussing the possibility of the election being advanced to May, in line with widespread speculation at the time. The holy month of Ramadan begins on May 5 and ends June 4. The Muslims fast during the day; they’re tired and prefer to stay home. The electorate shrinks.</p> \n<p>The trio approached Netanyahu. “We can’t have an election in May,” they said to the prime minister. “That comes out in Ramadan. Better March or April. Netanyahu replied, “What’s wrong with November?” That remains his declared position: an election on the date scheduled, namely November 7, 2019, or close to it, maybe at the end of September.</p> \n<p>The only obstacle at the moment to such an outcome is the pesky law involving conscription of the ultra-Orthodox, which won’t leave the prime minister in peace. The extension granted by the High Court of Justice for the completion of the legislative process ends on January 16, a month from now. If the bill proposed by the Defense Ministry, which was approved during a first vote (of three) in the Knesset, is enacted into law, Agudat Yisrael (which, with Degel Hatorah, constitutes the United Torah Judaism party) will bolt the coalition, and the coalition will lose its majority. They will also resign if no new legislation is enacted.</p> \n<p>In Netanyahu’s circle they’re already pondering the shape of the next coalition. A few months ago, this column reported that the prime minister had said privately that he would seek as broad a government as possible, to be based on the right wing but with at least one party from the other camp – Yesh Atid or Zionist Union (Labor plus MK Tzipi Livni’s Hatnuah party). Since then, a Benny Gantz-led party has been factored into these calculations, and not necessarily as the third choice.</p> \n<p>Such a broad-based scenario got a further boost this week from a person very close to Netanyahu, who said in a private conversation that a coalition based not on 61 or 66 but on 80 MKs would be more stable. Its leader would be free from blackmail and other pressures. None of the coalition partners would feel strong enough to make threats or put forward conditions and demands. The two nemeses from Habayit Hayehudi, Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked, would be reduced to tolerable and less dominant proportions.</p> \n<p>What will happen when an indictment is filed against the premier? We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, said the source. If it doesn’t include bribery, but “only” fraud and breach of trust, we might be able to survive that Pharaoh too.</p> \n<p>Midfield game</p> \n<p>In the meantime, one Pharaoh has already been dealt with. On Wednesday, in a preliminary vote, the Knesset approved the bill that would reduce the president’s powers, aka the “Gideon Sa’ar law” – although it’s actually the “paranoid Bibi Netanyahu” law. The proposal stipulates that the president will be obliged after an election to entrust formation of the new government to a party leader only and not to “any MK who so agrees,” as the current law reads.</p> \n<p>The Sunday meeting of coalition-party leaders at the Prime Minister’s Office discussed this draft bill, which is sponsored by coalition whip MK David Amsalem (Likud). In the middle of the meeting, Justice Minister Shaked knocked on the door. She wanted to draw the attention of the participants to an issue that had come up in the Ministerial Committee for Legislation, which she heads, where the proposed legislation was being considered. Someone from the Justice Ministry cited the Ehud Olmert-Tzipi Livni precedent of 2008: Prime Minister Olmert was forced to resign, and Livni, who was foreign minister and vice prime minister at the time, got the nod from the president. Livni tried to form a government but was derailed and failed. Only then was an election called.</p> \n<p>If the “Sa’ar law” is enacted and there’s a situation where Netanyahu resigns the premiership voluntarily or is forced to do so by the High Court in the wake of being indicted – no Likud minister would be able to take up the reins and form an alternate government.</p> \n<p>Imagine such a scenario coming to pass during the first year of the next government. Say Likud has 35 seats, the second-largest party only 15. The political circumstances obligate the government to continue in power, led by Likud. However, the law stipulates that only a party leader is qualified to form a government. The result would be a superfluous election, as legal advisers have cautioned.</p> \n<p>This is why Archimedes proclaimed “Eureka!” after discovering the principle of buoyancy. This is why Homer Simpson says “Duuuhhh!” when he hits his forehead. After all, this is exactly what the poet from Balfour Street was getting at. It’s not legislation for the start of a term of office, post-election. In that situation, it’s obvious that&nbsp;the president will entrust the task of forming the government to the leader of the party that get the nod from the largest number of MKs. What this is, is a law for the middle of a term of office. It’s intended as a safety net for a prime minister who’s charged with criminal wrongdoing against any attempt by his party’s cabinet ministers to oust him. They will not rebel and demand that he resign if as a result, there is either an election or the formation of a government by the leader of a different party. That’s what’s so clever about the bill. It has more than the eye sees at first reading. Like a poem.</p> \n<p>Back to the meeting of the party leaders, where Shaked described the Gordian-knot scenario of a non-Likud party leader forming the next government. Netanyahu’s marionette, Amsalem, was flabbergasted. He never thought of that.</p> \n<p>“Hang on, that’s right,” Amsalem said, flustered. “There’s a problem here. It could cause serious damage to Likud!”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, according to several members of the forum, assumed a grim visage. “Yes,” he said. “We’ll have to consider this.”</p> \n<p>Amsalem was still agitated: “What do we do in that event?”</p> \n<p>“No problem,” Netanyahu replied. “We’ll give it to Moishe,” referring to Kulanu leader and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon. According to another version of what happened, he said: “To Moishe or to Bennett.”</p> \n<p>Amsalem looked at him, appalled. The ministers chortled.</p> \n<p>“Fine, these are things we really hadn’t thought of,” Netanyahu said, wrapping up the interlude of comic relief. “We’ll pass the bill in a preliminary vote and see what we do afterward.”</p> \n<p>It was a tremendous performance by Bibi, someone present averred, adding: If we didn’t know him, we would have believed it.</p> \n<p>The proposal passed its first Knesset hurdle by a vote of 60-55. But a tough fight lies ahead. Since it’s a Basic Law, a majority of 61 will be required to pass the bill into law. The coalition numbers 61 MKs, including Oren Hazan (Likud), who didn’t attend the parliamentary sessions this week due to illness. Every MK from the coalition who is absent for the first, second and third votes will cause the bill to fall.</p> \n<p>We should mention the senior Likud MKs, whom Netanyahu is again grinding into the dust. The suffering slobs pressed the vote buttons with frozen faces, ignoring the mocking smiles from the opposition benches. They looked as though someone had stuck a pistol to their gut under the table.</p> \n<p>A first for the Lady</p> \n<p>The farce – some would say the ongoing tragedy – that is our life in the Netanyahu era this week chalked up pathetic new lows. The prime minister’s firstborn son, Yair, showed us again who and what he is: a problematic young man with a filthy mind and a dirty mouth (who makes Likud MK Oren Hazan appear refined) who, from the residence of the prime minister funded by the Israeli taxpayer, published a post asserting that “All the leftists, politicians and media people are traitors.”</p> \n<p>Dad issues a lame qualification accompanied by the inevitable “but.” He doesn’t mean it, though: Young Netanyahu is his father’s alter ego. He complements him. The premier warns against Arabs who are streaming in droves to the polling places, and the son strips down and crassly turns a supposedly political statement into everyday language. Sewer talk – language the young, nationalistic, racist and anti-Semitic right-wingers whom he represents, understand well.</p> \n<p>This week, dime-store psychologists detected elements of pain and distress in the “boy.” They think he needs help, he’s stressed out, he feels persecuted. God have mercy.</p> \n<p>If Yair needs a child psychologist, let him call Guatemala. When&nbsp;the premier’s wife traveled there this week&nbsp;at the invitation of the local first lady to inaugurate a humanitarian project, the trip was presented as just that, a “humanitarian” mission. When she landed, she changed gears. “I am on an important diplomatic mission,” she announced, and her husband quickly tweeted, “Good luck to my wife on her important diplomatic mission.”</p> \n<p>To placate the Lady, who is insatiable when it comes to respect and honors, and to lend this marginal outing a “diplomatic” semblance, she was joined by cabinet secretary Tzachi Braverman and by Foreign Ministry officials. No one was taken by surprise when Braverman went on the air from Guatemala City, praised and lauded the guest he was accompanying, and sycophantically described the locals’ delight at her arrival, as though the queen of England herself had come for a visit to one of the empire’s colonies.</p> \n<p>He opined that it was time to enshrine “the status of the prime minister’s wife” in law, and didn’t spare his listeners his two-cents-worth about the demonstrators who cursed Yair Netanyahu in the Tel Aviv court where hearings began this week on the slander suit he filed. You could almost hear Sara huffing and puffing alongside Braverman as he declaimed the dictated text.</p> \n<p>The phenomenon of Braverman – a former Likud activist – is another of the ills of the Netanyahu era: the prostitution of the civil service. “Civil servants,” such as the cabinet secretary or the head of the National Security Council, Meir Ben-Shabbat, have become gofers.</p> \n<p>Ben-Shabbat, for example, was dispatched by the prime minister to Rabbi Haim Druckmam to ask him to dissuade Naftali Bennett from resigning in the wake of the defense portfolio crisis last month. Asked to explain his behavior, Ben-Shabbat said he was happy the government hadn’t fallen.</p> \n<p>Braverman is a small-time activist who grew into a big-time functionary. Like Ben-Shabbat, he too is shaming his high position, one of the most important and sensitive in the public service. He’s behaving like a hotel concierge. Family secretary. In the past, Sara Netanyahu was always accompanied by the bureau chiefs, such as Natan Eshel or Gil Sheffer, whose main purpose was to fulfill her endless demands. With time, her expectations and demands grew. On her next trip she’ll insist that the prime minister accompany her.</p>",

The more you look at it, the more the political arousal – in his opponents.</p> \n<p>“No,” you mumble to yourself when you see it, and you instinctively look away. You look again in disbelief, to check if you really saw what you think you saw. Because it’s impossible. He already stole one political protest, the 2011 social justice protest, but at least that one took place in Israel.</p> \n<p>This is too much even for this political plagiarist. It can’t be that he really had himself photographed in north Tel Aviv’s Ramat Aviv Gimel neighborhood – that is, against the background of urban villas – with an iPhone in his hand. He was wearing a yellow vest, a glowing Danny the Yellow.</p> \n<p>“No,” you mumble again, first in a whisper and then in a louder and louder voice. “No, no, no. He didn’t really do it.” Your cheeks get red and a few moments later you’re ready to tear your hair out. There’s something in Lapid’s class chutzpah, his aesthetic; that is, his ethical vulgarity. To steal just like that, in your face, the symbol of another country’s courageous struggle, only because it’s cool, draws your eyes back to the picture.</p> \n<p>“How dare he?” you shout. Where does he get the chutzpah to appropriate a revolution that isn’t his just because he feels like it? To appropriate a struggle without any justification or affinity, whether biographical, genetic, socioeconomic, cultural, linguistic or historical?</p> \n<p>In not one facet of reality are Lapid and the Yellow Vest protest partners. This is such a blatant deception even by this serial copycat that there are no words to describe it. That picture is like a light-reflecting strip in the dark. Your eyes can’t escape it; it’s impossible to look away from the prince of kitsch and Israeli provincialism.</p> \n<p>Maybe this is the reason he posted it. As far as I can remember, his genius idiocy hasn’t received attention for a long time. He must have learned from Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump. The more they raise their opponents’ ire, the greater their supporters’ sympathy. The more they’re derided, the more seats their side wins in the Knesset or Congress.</p> \n<p>This is actually the simplest explanation for the picture. Lapid wants to be accosted with a flood of invective. “If only this government took care of the people the way it takes care of itself,” he wrote under the picture. “It’s expensive here.”</p> \n<p>Yes, he’s right. It’s expensive. But not for him. And not for his friends. It’s highly doubtful whether it’s expensive for most of his voters. But popular protest is cool, and you can’t buy that with money. His voters also want a cool vest like that, they want to feel the vitality of people who are really fighting for their lives, not merely pretending to.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Interior Ministry's Population and Immigration Authority has admitted to the High Court of Justice that its examination of requests for asylum in Israel by asylum seekers from the Darfur region of Sudan has not been sufficiently thorough. The authority said it would reexamine some 1,500 requests from applicants in Israel from Darfur.</p> \n<p>The asylum seekers have already been interviewed but professionals at the authority have found that the interviews “still require supplemental information, because they were not in-depth enough for the purposes of making a decision on a request for political asylum,” the court was told. Immigration Authority officials also found that not enough attention was paid “to changes in circumstances over time.”</p> \n<p>In requesting asylum, applicants must show a well-founded fear of persecution if they were to return to their home countries. Sudan has been wracked in recent years by war, including civil war, and the Darfur region has been one of the most severely affected. In October, the UN News website reported that security had improved in Darfur, but citing the head of a peacekeeping mission, it noted that intercommunal tensions were still high amid clashes over land and livestock.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'It’s as if you Israelis forgot what you went through and where you came from'&nbsp;■&nbsp;How not to treat asylum seekers | Opinion</p> \n<p>Acknowledging that supplemental interviews are required to make a decision on asylum requests from applicants from the Darfur, Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile regions of Sudan, this is the first time the government has openly admitted that interviews conducted previously with the asylum seekers were inadequate. The Population and Immigration Administration said that it has filed a request with the court this week for an extension of time to complete its work and would provide an update when new information is available.</p> \n<p>In 2015, the government told the High Court of Justice that it would decide on most of the asylum requests, including all of those submitted before February 2015, by February 2016, but it did not meet its commitment. In October of this year, the High Court held a hearing on the petitions in which Supreme Court President Esther Hayut&nbsp;gave the state 30 days to submit a timetable and work plan for examination of the asylum requests of applicants from Darfur. At the hearing, Hayut criticized the state’s claim that there wasn’t enough manpower to examine the requests, and commenting: &quot;It’s impossible to continue with this endless waiting.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In October, as a result of a decision by Prime Minister&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu, Interior Minister Arye Dery and Justice Minister&nbsp;Ayelet Shaked, the government also informed the High Court that it would no longer grant special humanitarian status to Sudanese asylum from the Darfur region. In mid-2016, Israel had begun allowing about 800 Sudanese asylum seekers to work in Israel and receive social service benefits such as health insurance, as well as permission to leave Israel and then come back into the country. But in October of this year, the government said it had changed its policy and would examine every asylum request individually. In response, the High Court ordered the government to present a detailed timetable within 30 days over its plans to examine the Darfuris' asylum requests. The issue is before the court as a result of two petitions, one seeking to have the state rule on all asylum requests by Darfuris and the other seeking to grant them residency status in Israel, at least until their asylum requests are ruled on.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, the government informed the court that to examine all of these asylum requests, it had established a six-person, specially trained Population Authority team that would examine asylum requests from Sudanese from the Darfur, Nuba Mountain and Blue Nile regions. Of 35,000 pending asylum requests before the Population Authority, about 3,400 are from asylum seekers from these areas. With the exception of a single asylum request that was granted, no rulings have been issued on any of the 3,400 requests. Most of the Darfuri asylum seekers have been waiting for a response for years.</p> \n<p>Despite the High Court’s request, the government has not yet provided a timetable for examining the asylum requests. According to the government’s statement to the court, it was only on Sunday of this week that the team began conducting interviews with the asylum seekers. The Population and Immigration Authority said it thought for the first six months, the team members would each be able to handle one claim per day, noting that the interviews themselves generally takes a number of hours. After a few months, the time needed to evaluate the requests was expected to decline. The government said it will first examine some 100 to 150 asylum requests with the goal of “establishing a broad factual foundation for the guiding principles in deciding on the asylum requests of this group.&quot; That, the state said, should take about 45 days.</p> \n<p>The government asked for 60 days before briefing the court on its progress. In addition, the state said it would continue to examine whether the situation in Sudan has changed. If it has sufficiently improved, it could provide the basis for deporting thousands of asylum seekers back to their native country.</p> \n<p>One of the lawyers who filed the High Court petition, Michal Pomerantz, called the state’s announcement &quot;a farce,&quot; noting that the state had already violated its prior commitments to the court. &quot;Now they are informing us that they do not have any time estimate for dealing with the requests, that they intend to reconduct all the asylum interviews they had held and that asylum seekers will be forced to continue to wait,&quot; and lack the benefits they are seeking while they wait. The state, she said, is quick to deny asylum requests but not to grant such requests, which take years.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s request to let tycoons fund his legal defense would violate the law that bars public officials from accepting valuable gifts, the legal adviser to the Prime Minister’s Office said on Monday.</p> \n<p>The State Comptroller’s Office, which has a permits committee that considers such requests, recently barred Netanyahu from accepting such donations. But Netanyahu apparently wants this decision reconsidered.</p> \n<p>He is seeking to raise money from Spencer Partrich, a businessman who testified in one of the cases against him, and his cousin Nathan Milikowsky. Police have recommended indicting Netanyahu for bribery in three separate cases, all of which involved receiving benefits from tycoons.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Netanyahu’s played the victim so long, he’s forgotten it’s an act | Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Netanyahu’s 61 partners in crime | Opinion</p> \n<p>The legal adviser, Shlomit Barnea-Farago, was addressing the Knesset’s State Control Committee. She said while the Gifts Law allows officials to accept gifts in exceptional circumstances, the exceptions don’t apply to Netanyahu’s case.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu had argued that Milikowsky has been a close friend since the age of 7, while Partrich has been a good friend for the last 19 years.</p> \n<p>During the police investigations of Netanyahu, Barnea-Farago gave them statements in which she said she encountered hostility from the prime minister whenever she refused to approve expenditures by him or his family, which happened frequently.</p> \n<p>The permits committee’s decision said it was “inappropriate” for tycoons to finance Netanyahu’s legal defense. Its legal adviser, Prof. Yoram Rabin, told the State Control Committee on Monday that the prime minister also hadn’t provided important information, such as how much he expects his legal defense to cost, how much money he seeks to obtain from the two donors and the exact nature of his relationship with them.</p> \n<p>He added that Netanyahu hasn’t yet asked the permits committee to reconsider its decision, but would presumably provide more information if he did.</p> \n<p>Rabin said Netanyahu would presumably argue that Milikowsky was his cousin, and accepting money from him to cover legal costs was “no different than a very close relative helping a minister with his mortgage,” while Partrich was “such a close friend” that no suspicion of a quid pro quo relationship arose. “These are claims he’ll have to prove,” Rabin added.</p> \n<p>Amichai Shai, a senior adviser to the state comptroller, said he had no intention of offering suggestions to Netanyahu’s lawyer on how to make his application more palatable to the permits committee. In response to a question from State Control Committee chairwoman, Zionist Union MK Shelly Yacimovich, he added that the permits committee doesn’t take applicants’ financial situation into account in making its decisions.</p> \n<p>Rabin said that three other ministers had also asked the permits committee for permission to accept donations, but all were refused. He also noted that the Knesset Ethics Committee allows Knesset members to accept up to 5,000 shekels ($1,300) from a single donor for medical or legal expenses, but that rule doesn’t apply to ministers and deputy ministers.</p> \n<p>Ministers can also ask the state to help fund their legal expenses. Justice Ministry data show that in recent years, three ministers received such assistance – Likud's Yisrael Katz, Habayit Hayehudi's Uri Ariel and Yisrael Beiteinu's Avigdor Lieberman.</p> \n<p>At the end of the meeting, the State Control Committee urged Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit to prohibit tycoons from funding Netanyahu’s defense.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved a bill Sunday that would facilitate the expulsion of assailants’ families from their homes to other areas of the West Bank.</p> \n<p>After a heated debate, and despite the objection of the attorney general, the head of the Shin Bet security service and the IDF Chief of Staff, the security cabinet approved the bill before passing it on to the ministerial committee for its approval.</p> \n<p>According to the bill, within seven days from the date of an incident, the&nbsp;IDF Central Command chief will be able to expel the families of assailants&nbsp;who perpetrate or try to perpetrate a terror attack .</p> \n<p>Shin Bet director Nadav Argaman said his agency opposes the bill, according to senior officials who were present at the security cabinet debate. Argaman said it's a bill &quot;that cannot be implemented,&quot; explaining that &quot;we are unable to go into Hebron and Nablus every day and see who lives where and whether the family has returned to their residence.&quot;</p> \n<p>Argaman warned that the bill would &quot;bring about a result that is the opposite of deterrence since its implementation would create tensions,&quot; adding that it would make it more difficult to interrogate family members while investigating terror attacks. The Shin Bet chief is also worried the bill, if it becomes a law, will harm his organization's ability to use administrative detention as a tool in investigations since courts will rule that administrative detention is unnecessary if expelling the family is an option.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Argaman apparently led the charge against the bill, supported by the military Chief of Staff&nbsp;Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot.</p> \n<p>A senior security official said the bill is a result of public pressure, not operational need, asking: &quot;How exactly are we supposed to do this? Take families and throw them in the Hebron Hills? And then what? Watch them so that they don't move? Chase them each time they go back to their village and then throw them out again?&quot;</p> \n<p>Last month, defense establishment officials told a Knesset committee that it is legally impossible to expel assailants' family members to other areas of the West Bank unless they are themselves suspected of engaging in terrorist activity.</p> \n<p>Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked of the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi party were the main forces behind the pressure to pass the bill.</p> \n<p>Bennett said the debate on the bill, which was originally due to take place weeks ago, was postponed at the request of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who promised to take steps to deter terrorism. Bennett said, however, that as the bill hasn't been promoted, he decided to move the legislation forward.</p> \n<p>Bennett said he was &quot;happy&quot; that the bill was approved &quot;despite the vigorous opposition by the jurists surrounding Netanyahu.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Likud said in response that the party &quot;supports the law to expel terrorists' families&quot; and intends to bring it to the Knesset floor for the first round of votes out of the required three.</p> \n<p>There have been numerous bills submitted over the past several years to allow the deportation of assailants’ families, but none of them have gotten anywhere.</p> \n<p>Current law enables&nbsp;the interior minister to strip noncitizen assailants or their families of their Israeli residency rights. A 2008 amendment to the Citizenship Law allows the interior minister to revoke the citizenship of persons involved in terror activities, among other circumstances. The move must be approved by a court and by the attorney general.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A parallel military order allows the army’s Civil Administration to expel assailants or their families from Israeli-controlled to Palestinian-Authority-controlled areas of the West Bank.</p> \n<p>This is possible largely because the law granting the minister this power was enacted prior to the 1992 Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty. Since the Basic Law contains a grandfather clause, protecting preexisting legislation from judicial review, the High Court of Justice can’t overturn the existing law on the grounds that it contradicts the Basic Law, as it could with any legislation passed after 1992.</p> \n<p>A new law would almost certainly face High Court scrutiny and might be overturned.</p>",

After the announcement, Erdan, the point-man in the government to combat pro-Palestinian boycotts, also called for a boycott of Airbnb and promoted one of its rivals.</p> \n<p>“I call today on all those who support Israel and oppose discriminatory boycotts: they should cease using Airbnb and turn to other services,” Erdan told a diplomatic conference hosted by the Jerusalem Post newspaper. “By the way, Booking.com is a great service,” Erdan added.</p> \n<p>There are 200 Airbnb listings in West Bank settlements. Airbnb has more than 22,000 hosts in Israel.</p> \n<p>Airbnb never said it intends to remove Jewish homes in East Jerusalem, territory Israel annexed in a move not recognized abroad and which the Palestinians want for a future capital, or the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>",

It’s not clear which, if any, of these Palestinians signed the sale document.</p> \n<p>Finally, this isn’t the first time settlers have submitted documents ostensibly proving that land in Amona was legally purchased from its Palestinian owners – and the earlier documents proved to be fraudulent.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, the Binyamin Regional Council didn’t await the administration’s decision before moving two prefab homes into Amona and providing basic infrastructure such as water tankers.</p> \n<p>Defense sources said the settlers didn’t coordinate with either the army or the Civil Administration. Thus by placing the homes there, they violated not only the planning laws, but also a military order declaring the area a closed military zone.</p> \n<p>It’s not clear why the army didn’t prevent them from doing so, since it does prevent Palestinians from entering the area.</p> \n<p>The left-wing organization Yesh Din responded to the move by asking Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit to open a criminal investigation for illegal squatting against Israel Gantz, the chairman of the Binyamin Regional Council. It also asked the head of the army’s Central Command and the army’s legal advisor in the West Bank to issue demolition orders against the homes.</p> \n<p>Both the army and the Civil Administration have confirmed that the homes are breaking the law. Nevertheless, neither has yet issued the demolition orders.</p> \n<p>The army’s coordinator of government activities in the territories said merely that “The Civil Administration is aware of the issue and it is being examined professionally.”</p>",

It follows the resolution in June of a defamation suit that Klein filed against Amsalem, who is the chairman of the governing coalition in the Knesset.</p> \n<p>In Case 1000, Prime Minister Netanyahu is accused of improperly accepting lavish gifts from Milchan and others. In the suit filed on Sunday, Amsalem is seeking monetary damages from Ben Zur, who purportedly claimed on Army Radio in June that Amsalem had apologized to Hadas Klein, Milchan’s assistant. Amsalem asserts that he had not apologized to Klein.</p> \n<p>According to media reports, Klein acted as an intermediary between Milchan and the Netanyahu family for the gifts that are at the center of Case 1000, gifts said to have included expensive cigars and champagne. In an interview with the Yedioth Ahronoth daily in February, Amsalem is quoted as saying the newspaper’s reporting on Klein’s testimony constitutes “obstruction of justice.” He accused Klein of leaking her testimony to the daily and called the actions of the police “an attempted coup.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;What's at stake for Netanyahu after police recommend bribery charges&nbsp;| Explained&nbsp;■&nbsp;For Netanyahu's supporters, bribery recommendations only serve to support his narrative | Analysis</p> \n<p>Klein had filed her own defamation suit against Amsalem. The case was referred to mediation and settled, after which Amsalem said in June that he had not intended to say that Klein had obstructed justice and under the circumstances didn’t see a reason to apologize over what he had said. “To the extent that my remarks were understood differently, I regret the mental anguish caused to Klein as a result,” he said.</p> \n<p>After the settlement of Klein’s defamation case, Ben Zur allegedly told Army Radio: “Amsalem apologized for what he had said. If he continues to make disparaging remarks, a suit will [again] be filed. He will apologize time and again, heaven forbid.”</p> \n<p>Amsalem then demanded that Ben Zur apologize, but on June 20, Ben Zur said he did not intend to do so. Amsalem accused Ben Zur of “acting knowingly and with a single clear intent to vilify me and to advance a political agenda that he is seeking to advance through improper means” when Ben Zur claimed that he had apologized to Klein.</p> \n<p>“Ben Zur had singled out a target to destroy Amsalem’s good name and reputation. The damage caused Amsalem following Ben Zur’s actions and those acting on his behalf is huge,” Sunday’s lawsuit claims in the suit, which seeks 142,000 shekels ($37,600) in compensation.</p> \n<p>For his part, Ben Zur called the new lawsuit “ridiculous” and claimed Amsalem knows that he will lose in court. “[Amsalem] has given interviews to various media outlets spreading lies and conspiracy theories about ‘coups’ and ‘attempts to influence the political and social systems in the country.’”</p> \n<p>“The pinnacle was the remarks over Ms. Klein, after in a radio interview, Amsalem claimed that Ms. Klein had obstructed justice by allegedly leaking what was said in her [police] questioning to Yedioth Ahronoth,” Ben Zur said. “But it turns out that such an article never appeared either in Yedioth Ahronoth or in any other media outlet. Against that backdrop, a defamation suit was filed against Amsalem and ultimately Amsalem declared in court that he ‘regretted the emotional aguish caused to Ms. Klein.”</p>",

Within three months there was a sharp rise in the rate of kids aged 13 to 18 who reported trying JUUL, from 0.4 percent in August to 5.3 percent in November. There was also a 50 percent jump in the proportion of teenagers trying rolled cigarettes, from 10.9 percent to 15.5 percent. During this period there was an increase in teens’ use of all smoking products except for pipes and cigars.</p> \n<p>The percentage of teenagers who reported trying JUUL is still relatively low, but these were only the first months of the product’s introduction. In the United States, where JUUL has been marketed for three years, 20.8 percent of teenagers are using it, including an increase of 78 percent in high schoolers’ use in only one year, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control. The use of JUUL and other electronic cigarettes by teenagers has already been termed “an epidemic” in the United States.</p> \n<p>Shira Kislev, the director of Smoke Free Israel, said, “If the rate of increase of 5 percent in three months doesn’t change, within a year 20 percent of teenagers will have had experience with it, and within three years, 60 percent.”</p> \n<p>“In my class and my grade level more than half the pupils smoke JUUL and also cigarettes,” said a 12th grader at the Alliance School in Ramat Aviv. “Many of us were smoking by age 15, and JUUL is something new – it started at the beginning of the [school] year and by after Sukkot vacation there was a strong wave [of use] in our school.</p> \n<p>“Recently we went to Poland and a lot were smoking JUUL in the bus, in the hotel, at the airport,” she continued. “At any point of weariness or difficulty, they ran straight for the JUUL. That’s because it’s not like a cigarette and you can use it in public places, so they would pass it around without the teacher noticing.”</p> \n<p>Two 10th-grade girls from Tel Aviv said that many boys and girls in their class smoke cigarettes and JUUL. “You see JUUL in school, outside school and on Instagram stories, for example. There was even a boy in our class who smoked JUUL during a lesson when the teacher wasn’t looking.”</p> \n<p>The JUUL company said, “Our mission is to offer a satisfactory and effective alternative to cigarettes to adult smokers throughout the world, without tobacco and without combustion, which dramatically reduces the damage from smoking. Since activity began in Israel we’ve taken a series of steps to block young people’s access to our products. Young people and those who do not consume nicotine have no need to try our product.”</p> \n<p>The Knesset Economic Affairs Committee on Tuesday will be holding its last hearing on the bill to restrict the advertising and marketing of tobacco products. The bill includes a ban on advertising smoking products in any medium except for the print press; a requirement to conceal smoking products at sales outlets; uniform cigarette packaging without logos, and the application of all the current restrictions on regular cigarettes to electronic cigarettes.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Once again the “neither right nor left” protest is returning: Once it was against the price of cottage cheese, once against the natural gas robbery, once against corruption and now against the overall rise in prices. No politics, the organizers reproach those who raise anti-government signs at the demonstrations. This is a protest against the rich who profit at our expense, and we’re not leftists.</p> \n<p>Thanks to its apolitical image, the protest that has been developing since 2011 has attracted hundreds of thousands of people who sought an outlet for their despair over the news. Sometimes such protests even chalk up a success.</p> \n<p>Now, for example, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon has decided to extend the tax exemption on home electronic devices, cell phones and products for babies. The public pressure has an effect. That’s a fact. An imaginary, harmful success, like the comparison to the “yellow vest” protest in France. Not only because of the tremendous difference between us and them regarding the history and the nature of the protest.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel’s Yellow Vest wannabes are rebels without a cause, for now&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>The French protest against the hike in fuel prices erupted mainly in the outlying areas, where dependence on private cars is critical for earning a living. The truth is that it is neither right nor left, it’s both, and mainly very political and characterized by solidarity, and it’s protesting against the president who is cut off from the poor and the working class.</p> \n<p>Ostensibly, that is also the claim of those protesting here against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kahlon. In effect, they are protesting only against the price hikes.</p> \n<p>But these price increases are only one aspect of the policy that is crushing the citizens and society here. It was preceded in the hierarchy by the elimination of public services (education, health, housing, welfare and more), the erosion of wages and the tax burden. That’s without even mentioning the order of priorities that puts the settlements and military control of the neighboring population first.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How Putin and the far right played the Paris Yellow Vests protests | Opinion</p> \n<p>Wages in Israel are relatively low and are constantly being eroded, a high percentage of workers earn the minimum wage and less, while the indirect tax is far higher than that of the OECD countries, at 39 percent of all taxes, compared to the OECD average of 33 percent. Indirect taxes are regressive, as we know. The lower the income, the larger the percentage used for consumption.</p> \n<p>For years they have been drumming into our heads that opening the market to competition among importers would bring down prices and life would be beautiful. And then what? Suddenly we’ll manage with our eroded salary, unattainable housing, parents’ payments for education, and privatized medicine, and we will find consolation in the cell phone, the easy (and lethal) loan from the credit company and the cheaper airline ticket? That is a pathetic illusion, which exempts the government from responsibility and enables it to continue to crush the middle class, increase the gaps and throw working people into the cycle of poverty.</p> \n<p>A protest that is focused on the “cost of living” is not simply apolitical. It collaborates with a cruel policy of inequality that damages social fortitude and in the end affects economic growth as well. This is the desired policy of the Netanyahu government, which strikes at basic civil rights and distributes perks only to those who prove their loyalty.</p> \n<p>To combat this type of politics there is a need for a political protest that not only rises up but also demands a totally opposite policy. As long as the opposition is headed by two millionaires, one who became rich by turning public service into a private monopoly and the other by an aggressive television channel, and both are competing with the government and between themselves over who is more right-wing, the task of forging this political protest remains the responsibility of the citizens.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Benjamin Netanyahu is rapidly approaching the record for longest term in office as prime minister, set by David Ben Gurion.</p> \n<p>Both served in this office for a similar duration of 13 years. During his term, Ben Gurion was involved in historic decisions that determined the nature of the country and its society. These included the demand that West Germany pay reparations, a decision that roiled the public but salvaged Israel’s economy; the decision to turn the Israel Defense Forces into a state-oriented army, subordinate to one single authority, the elected civilian government; the decision to develop nuclear weapons and the decision to open the country to massive Jewish immigration, a move that shaped its future character despite the enormous cost to the new and fragile state.</p> \n<p>In examining those decisions today, the question arises: How many important decisions did Netanyahu make in his long years in office? He was involved in one decision – to bomb Iran’s nuclear reactor – a decision that was not implemented and which led to the waste of billions of shekels.</p> \n<p>Beyond that, Netanyahu was not involved in any significant decisions – not ones related to the diplomatic process, not ones regarding making peace or war and not any regarding relations between the Orthodox and secular parts of society. The reason for this is that any such decision could endanger his standing as prime minister. He’s not interested in – and is emotionally incapable of – paying the price for making such momentous decisions.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu, art critic&nbsp;| Opinion ■&nbsp;How Benjamin Netanyahu became a Holocaust revisionist&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All previous prime ministers saw a dual significance in their role – an objective in itself, but also a means for fulfilling a dream or realizing an ideal. Menachem Begin signed a peace treaty with Egypt; Ehud Barak took IDF forces out of Lebanon; Ariel Sharon carried out the disengagement plan and Yitzhak Shamir opted for a policy of restraint in deciding not to retaliate against Iraq’s missile attacks during the first Gulf War, in contrast to positions held by Defense Minister Moshe Arens and military commanders.</p> \n<p>Every one of them was willing to risk their status and office. All except Benjamin Netanyahu. He is the only one who views his office as the ultimate goal. It’s an objective that needs to be constantly protected, and at any cost, day and night.</p> \n<p>Another explanation for his survival is his talent for drying up and emasculating the entire political system and party apparatus surrounding him. Most prime ministers nominated a group of senior cabinet members, with whom he shaped government policies.</p> \n<p>An example is Yitzhak Shamir, who managed affairs together with his close associates Moshe Arens, Moshe Nissim and three young and brilliant ministers – Dan Meridor, Ehud Olmert and Roni Milo. Shamir never worried that one of them would undermine him.</p> \n<p>Even Netanyahu had a serious, significant cabinet in his second term, between 2009 and 2012. It included people with stature such as Ehud Barak, Dan Meridor, Benny Begin and Moshe Ya’alon, and they never hesitated to voice independent positions and to oppose the prime minister’s positions. This was clearly evident in the decision regarding Iran. Most of them objected to bombing Iran, and their role in preventing the catastrophe which would have followed such action was decisive.</p> \n<p>But now, in Netanyahu’s current cabinet, this is non-existent. There is something like a governing cabinet, but it mainly deals in pathetic turf wars and claims of credit, as well as cheap gossip.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s aim is to dwarf cabinet members from his own party so as to prevent the rise of a political figure who could overshadow him and threaten his perennial rule, figures such as Moshe Kahlon or Gideon Saar. This dictates his behavior – as in not appointing a deputy prime minister and in ousting Moshe Ya’alon as defense minister, since these roles have hefty public weight and people holding them could pose a potential threat.</p> \n<p>Anxiety about a successor explains his two-pronged treatment of his cabinet members. On one hand, he is generous to ministers from other parties such as Habayit Hayehudi, a tiny party with only eight Knesset members which received prestigious portfolios – the education and justice ministries – with members of the Kulanu party receiving the two main economic ministries, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy and Industry.</p> \n<p>In contrast, he is tight-fisted when it comes to ministers from his own party, not giving them even one significant ministry. He continues to hold the foreign affairs portfolios, with ministers such as Yisrael Katz and Gilad Erdan eyeing this post eagerly. He threw some scraps to his ministers with some mid-level portfolios such as the Ministry for Environmental Protection, or non-existent ones such as the Ministry for Jerusalem Affairs and Heritage.</p> \n<p>For this, they have to express deep appreciation and gratitude to their master. The reason for all this is his sense that his successor will come from within his party, which is why its ministers must be humiliated daily, leaving behind scorched earth.</p> \n<p>Benjamin Netanyahu roams the world with the image of an omnipotent emperor. But behind this specious image hides a frightened and beaten child living a terrible nightmare: that one day someone will manage to steal his priceless toy. A toy called Balfour Street, the prime ministerial residence.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When Benny Gantz and his representatives conducted the negotiations about his joining the cybersecurity firm Fifth Dimension, they had an unusual condition: Nobody was allowed to publish things that would harm the image of the former chief of staff. It’s logical that Gantz was concerned about his good name; it’s less common to try to include that as a condition in commercial negotiations.</p> \n<p>Now, with the company closing, it’s likely that some of the dirt will adhere to its chairman. Only four months ago, Gantz spoke with pride about the company and his contribution to it in an interview with the Globes financial daily: “I can tell you what it does to someone who is a professional in that world. He says: Wow! … You don’t spend time here only in order to earn money – this story will result in fewer criminals and fewer terrorists. It’s very simple.” What’s your contribution? “Directions of activity, connections, exposure to the world and to investors. The money that was invested didn’t get here by chance.”</p> \n<p>What appears to be a business failure only confirms what most of those who know Gantz well think of him: an excellent man, decent, honest, but he has difficulty making decisions. He’s not made of the stuff that we’re used to in our prime ministers.</p> \n<p>A retired major general said of Gantz: “The last person that I would think could succeed in politics.” I spoke to many of Gantz’s colleagues. Virtually all of them respect him, admire him and doubt whether he is the man who can challenge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Netanyahu's two greatest fears have suddenly materialized | Analysis</p> \n<p>On this matter I’m in the minority. In my opinion, if a public opinion poll were to be conducted today among center-left voters, asking them to rate their 10 most important considerations in the decision about whom to choose, I think No. 10 would be “anyone but Bibi,” No. 9 would be “anyone but Bibi” as would No. 8, No. 7 and so on up to No. 1. The occupation, the social gaps, the incitement and all the rest are important, but wouldn’t make it to the first 10 spots.</p> \n<p>In the previous election this camp gave 24 seats to Isaac Herzog. A few weeks before the election I asked Reuven Adler, Herzog’s strategist: Aren’t you somewhat afraid to run someone like Bouji, a talented politician, but not really someone who has proven Herzog leadership potential? Adler replied that if we were to throw a stone now from the window, whoever it hit would be preferable to Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>Those words largely reflect the energies of the center-left camp. Anyone portrayed as any kind of challenge to Netanyahu will go places. The rest will sink. Gantz – with all his shortcomings as a potential leader – has many advantages as a candidate: a resum&eacute;, vague viewpoints, he looks great, really believes in reconciliation and unity, and, no less important, he’s brand new.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Despite his recent triumphs, Netanyahu is terrified of elections | Analysis</p> \n<p>Gantz has a real chance of picking up momentum and leading the largest party in the center-left bloc. That would cause the shrinking of Yair Lapid and the semi-elimination of Avi Gabbay. Yesh Atid and Zionist Union voters, according to several in-depth polls, are simply not all that committed to their parties. At the moment they don’t have anything more attractive. If for a brief moment Gantz looks like a threat to Netanyahu, they’ll race to him.</p> \n<p>Gantz is the target of considerable criticism, and rightly so, for being a incessant hesitator who has conducted talks with too many parties – but that’s very smart on his part. An associate of his told me that he knows he has to jump in only at the last moment, so there will be as little time as possible for his attraction to fade.</p> \n<p>This entire analysis depends on Gantz not making any embarrassing mistakes, as Yossi Verter wrote in Haaretz over the weekend. The left-wing base is tired of all the various masqueraders.</p> \n<p>Gantz, at the moment, is the only one who can transfer five to seven seats from the right-wing bloc to the left.

        "text":["<p>Bezeq to take NIS 512 million charge for job cuts, slashing 2018 profits</p> \n<p>Bezeq said on Monday it expected 2018 annual profit would fall sharply after approving a plan to give early retirement to 337 workers at a cost of 512 million shekels ($136 million). That would come on top of the 90 million shekels set aside in the first and second quarters for early retirement, reducing 2018 net profit by 464 million shekels, it said. The job cuts will be in Bezeq’s parent company, which operates its core landline telephony business. But Barclays analyst Tavy Rosner said he expected further cuts to follow. “We estimate that there is significant room to decrease the workforce at Bezeq’s three other divisions,” said Rosner, who estimated the company can cut 19 percent of its workforce. The cutbacks come amid growing competition and management chaos at Bezeq, which is at the center of government investigations for security and other violations. Bezeq shares ended down 1.85% at 3.88 shekels. (Nati Tucker and Reuters)</p> \n<p>Gazit Globe and Norstar recover, but worries persist</p> \n<p>Shares and bonds of the property company Gazit Globe and its parent Norstar recovered on Monday after a big sell-off a day earlier on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Gazit shares ended up 1.8% higher at 28.64 shekels, with its bonds gaining as much as 1.28%, while Norstar stock advanced 1.7% to 48.50 and its bonds up to 1.2%. Nevertheless, Gazit is still down 20.5% and Norstar by 34% so far in 2018. Relating to Sunday’s drops, controlling shareholder Haim Katz said, “We don’t see any reason for the declines. There has been no unusual event in the group. We are doing business as usual and implementing our strategic plans.” Since the start of the year, Gazit has moved to hold its real estate directly, rather than through subsidiaries, and is reducing its debt. But investors appear to be worried about climbing interest rates and the impact of growing online shopping on Gazit’s malls. Short sellers have added to the pressure. (Guy Erez)</p> \n<p>Yes says it’s breaking off contract to use Spacecom’s Amos 8 satellite</p> \n<p>Spacecom, the trouble operator of the Amos satellites, was dealt another setback on Monday when Yes said it would not use Spacecom’s planned Amos 8. Yes, the satellite television unit of Bezeq, said it didn’t believe Spacecom would be able to put Amos 8 into orbit by the deadline set in a contract between the two companies. Spacecom has accounted for 40% of Spacecom’s annual revenues from its use of the Amos 3 and 7 satellites. Launch of Amos 8 has been delayed after Spacecom was forced to break off a contract with America’s Space Systems/Loral to build the satellite. Spacecom is expected to award the work to Israel Aerospace Industries, which won’t be able to complete the satellite as quickly. Like Bezeq, Spacecom was controlled by telecoms tycoon Shaul Elovitch until he lost control of his businesses due to debt and police investigations. Spacecom shares ended down 3.8% at 7.11 shekels ($1.89).

The result was the TA-35 index finished 0.25% lower at 1,560.98 points, while the TA-125 loss nearly 0.3% to 1,411.78, on turnover of 1.23 billion shekels ($330 million).

Jakelin developed a high fever while in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and died two days later at a hospital in El Paso, Texas.</p> \n<p>MSNBC reported Saturday, in footage that has since gone viral, that children waiting to cross into the U.S. from Mexico have numbers written on their arms - recalling the Nazi practice of tattooing prisoner numbers. The numbers are being used by Mexican officials, not the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The treatment of migrant on both the U.S. and Mexico side of the border has become a major topic of policy makers and media personalities after Jakelin's tragic death.</p> \n<p>&quot;The girl said when she was grown up she was going to work and send dough back to her mom and grandma,&quot; said her mother Claudia Maquin, who has three remaining children, speaking in the Mayan language Q'eqchi and betraying little outward emotion.</p> \n<p>&quot;Because she'd never seen a big country, she was really happy that she was going to go,&quot; she added, explaining how her husband had gone to the United States to find a way out of the &quot;extreme poverty&quot; that dictated their lives.</p> \n<p>Corn stood behind her palm-thatched wooden house and a few chickens and pigs scrabbled in the yard as she spoke, dressed in a traditional blouse with a 6-month-old baby in her arms.</p> \n<p>A family photograph at the house showed Jakelin smiling and looking up at the camera, wearing a pink T-shirt with characters from the cartoon series &quot;Masha and the Bear.&quot;</p> \n<p>Deforestation to make way for palm-oil plantations has made subsistence farming increasingly hard for the 40,000 inhabitants of Raxruha municipality, where the family's agricultural hamlet of San Antonio de Cortez lies in central Guatemala, local officials said. That has spurred an exodus of&nbsp;migrants.</p> \n<p>Setting out on Dec. 1, Caal and his daughter traveled more than 2,000 miles (3,220 km) so Jakelin's father could look for work in the United States, said her mother, who learned of the girl's death from consular officials.</p> \n<p>Almost 80 percent of Guatemala's indigenous population are poor, with half of those living in extreme poverty. The mayor of San Antonio de Cortez described the Caal family as among the worst off in the village.</p> \n<p>Mayor Cesar Castro said in recent months more and more families were uprooting to try to reach the United States, often selling what little land they owned to pay people traffickers thousands of dollars for the trip.</p> \n<p>&quot;It's not just the Caal family. There are endless people who are leaving,&quot; Castro said. &quot;I see them drive past in pickups, cars and buses.&quot; He said most of them came back in the end, often penniless after being dropped off by traffickers, caught by authorities and deported.</p> \n<p>Jakelin's death has added to criticism of U.S. of President Donald&nbsp;Trump's hard-line immigration policies from&nbsp;migrant&nbsp;advocates and Democrats in the U.S. Congress.</p> \n<p>The U.S. government defended Jakelin's treatment, and said there was no indication she had any medical problems until several hours after she and her father were taken into custody.</p> \n<p>The father, speaking through a representative in Texas, agreed with that account, saying the girl exhibited no sign of distress at the border. The family, in a statement issued by their attorneys in El Paso, disputed as erroneous media reports that the girl had gone for days without food or water or became severely dehydrated.</p> \n<p>INSEPARABLE</p> \n<p>Domingo Caal, Jakelin's grandfather, said she had gone on the journey because she did not want to leave her father.</p> \n<p>&quot;The girl really stuck to him. It was very difficult to separate them,&quot; said Domingo, 61, wearing muddy boots and a faded and torn blue shirt.</p> \n<p>Jakelin's uncle, Jose Manuel Caal, said he had heard she was ill before she died, but had expected her to recover. &quot;The girl's death left us in shock,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>The family hope the girl's father can remain in the United States.</p> \n<p>&quot;What I want now is for Nery to stay and work in the United States. That's what I want,&quot; said his wife.</p> \n<p>A Guatemalan consular official told Reuters on Friday that Caal told him he had crossed the border planning to turn himself in to U.S. authorities, and will try to stay.</p> \n<p>Record numbers of parents traveling with children are being apprehended trying to cross the U.S. border with Mexico. In November, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers detained 25,172 members of &quot;family units,&quot; the highest monthly number ever recorded, the agency said.</p> \n<p>Parents with children are more likely to be released by U.S. authorities while their cases are processed because of legal restrictions on keeping children in detention.</p> \n<p>Caal remains in the El Paso area, where his daughter died after being flown by helicopter to a hospital there for emergency treatment when she stopped breathing.</p> \n<p>A brain scan revealed swelling and Jakelin was diagnosed with liver failure. She died early in the morning on Dec. 8, with her father at the hospital, a CBP official said.</p> \n<p>U.S. authorities are investigating the death.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The results of the recent mayoral election in Jerusalem, which were very close, proved to the few remaining skeptics something that was clear to almost every Jerusalem resident: The capital is not a Haredi city. The victory was in the hands of the city’s general population – if only they had bothered to come out and vote.</p> \n<p>Even without the promises of the new mayor, Moshe Leon, that he would be everybody’s mayor, and even though the mayor has a great deal of influence on the shaping of the city’s identity – the forces at work on the ground are more powerful. It seems the situation, as far as the non-Haredi community is concerned, is not as bad as people like to think.</p> \n<p>Research about the identity of home buyers in Jerusalem conducted by Dr. Eitan Regev, a research fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, supports this conclusion. The data show that the growth in the number of ultra-Orthodox Jews among home buyers in the capital has almost completely stopped, and the percentage of Haredim buying homes in Jerusalem is similar to their share of the overall population. Regev’s research is based on data from the Central Bureau of Statistics which provides details of the schools where home buyers' children attended.</p> \n<p>Regev, one of the leading experts on the economy of Haredi society, found that from 2000 through 2006, the percentage of Haredim among those who bought homes in the capital rose from 22 percent to 32 percent. But this figure rose by only another 2 percent to 34 percent between 2006 through 2017.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Haredi poverty: The same threat in both New York and Israel | Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israel's economic future Is wasting away in Israel’s yeshivas | Analysis</p> \n<p>The real percentages are even lower, says Regev: “If you add in the data about those in the Haredi community who leave religious life, it is possible to say that the standstill is almost total.” While no precise data exist on the numbers of Jews leavnig the Haredi fold, estimates are that about 1,000 such people leave the community in Jerusalem every year.</p> \n<p>The data mostly reflect the housing problem of the younger generation of ultra-Orthodox society, particularly in Jerusalem. “Many leave Jerusalem because they cannot afford the high housing prices,” says Regev. The Jerusalem district has lost 8,500 Haredim in the 18-to-35 age range over the past decade.</p> \n<p>Inequality is growing</p> \n<p>One of the most important factors affecting the ability of young Haredim to buy a home is wages. While the average annual wage of ultra-Orthodox buyers has remained almost unchanged over the years studied – it only rose from about 80,000 shekels ($21,200 at today’s exchange rates) in 2017 to about 90,000 shekels in 2017 – wages rose significantly for secular home buyers, from 120,000 shekels in 2000 to 160,000 shekels a year in 2017. Their parents’ wages showed a different pattern – for the Haredi parents of home buyers, wages rose from 120,000 shekels in 2000 to 160,000 shekels in 2017, while for the nonreligious the figures were 170,000 shekels in 2000 and 260,000 shekels a year in 2017.</p> \n<p>This distress is reflected in other data Regev presents: The apartments bought in general by Haredim are cheaper. If the prices of homes bought by Haredim and the nonreligious were once similar, today the differential is in the range of 200,000 shekels – with the nonreligious buying more expensive homes. This difference exists even though Haredi families have more children on average, and the difference in the size of the home per family member has grown greatly over that period.</p> \n<p>Today, nonreligious families buy larger and newer homes, and in more expensive areas, says Regev. In addition, Haredim buy at a much younger age, 33.6 on average both in the early 2000s and today. For secular residents of the capital, the average age they bought a home was 37.7 in 2000. Today it is 44.1.</p> \n<p>“The rise in housing prices has changed the profile of the secular buyer, who is older and better off, and only then manages to have their own home,” says Regev. “While for the Haredim, the goal is still to buy an apartment for a young couple is still important, the age profile has not changed. This is in addition to the Haredim simply going and buying less expensive apartments.”</p> \n<p>For Jerusalem residents, the story of the so-called “Haredization” of the city was exposed in its full strength in recent years by the friction between the nonreligious and Haredim in the city’s mixed religious-nonreligious neighborhoods. Many residents see this issue as the most burning one on the capital’s agenda. When we examine Regev’s data, one can understand why.</p> \n<p>In addition to the number of Haredim leaving the city for cheaper housing, more and more of them are buying homes in the city outskirts. For example, the percentage of home buyers in the soutwestern neighborhood of Kiryat Hayovel neighborhood in 1999 was under 20 percent. This figure rose to 20 percent to 40 percent by 2007 and and 60 percent to 80 percent by 2017. The figures are similar in Gilo, Pisgat Ze’ev, Neveh Yaakov and elsewhere.</p> \n<p>“There has been a drop in general of home buying among the Haredi community,” says Dr. Lee Cahaner, the head of the Interdisciplinary Studies Department at Oranim Academic College of Education and a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute. It used to be more accepted for parents to buy their children an apartment, in full or in part, but today this has shifted to renting, she says. This also reflects societal and economic changes, and also because the Haredi community has changed, adds Cahaner.</p>",

Since its creation in 2006, the ministry, receiving a yearly budget of 300 million shekels ($80 million), has requested to be exempted from the Freedom of Information Law, which all other government ministries are subjected to.</p> \n<p>Erdan's ministry often seeks to hide contacts with external organizations, claiming that exposing them would make its activities abroad more difficult. However, accoding to Shaffir, it&nbsp;&quot;sends off a message saying it has something to hide, and harms not once the important fight against the boycott and Israel haters.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Supreme Court justices in October overturned the District Court ruling upholding the government decision to bar Alqasem, arguing that it was unreasonable. Alqasem, a 22-year-old U.S. resident, sought to enter Israel after being accepted to a master's degree program at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Strategic Affairs Ministry officials sought to prevent her entry because she had once been a member of an organization called National Students for Justice in Palestine. She was held in a detention facility at Ben-Gurion International Airport based on an amendment to the Law of Entry preventing anyone who issued a call for a boycott of Israel from receiving an entry permit.</p> \n<p>The justices accepted Alqasem's argument that she never did this. They wrote in their ruling that the state should only prevent a person from entering into Israel if and only if the person seeking entry concurrently supports a BDS organization. The justices wrote further that if it is clear that the person seeking entry had stopped his support just for show, that the person should be considered a boycott supporter.</p> \n<p>The justices also criticized the decision to rescind Alqasem's entry permit. Justice Anat Brown wrote that the attempt to ban Alqasem constituted &quot;an extreme and dangerous step, which could lead to the crumbling of the pillars upon which democracy in Israel stands.&quot;</p> \n<p>Justice Neal Hendel addressed Alqasem's desire to study at Hebrew University. He said, &quot;This conduct is not in keeping, in an understatement, with the thesis that she's an undercover boycott activist.&quot;</p> \n<p>Erdan called the ruling a &quot;great victory for BDS&quot; and that the High Court &quot;emptied of content the law for preventing the entry of boycott activists into Israel.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>For more than 20 years starting in 1961, the Israeli government required citizens to lend it money in times of crisis, when it suddenly was confronted with unexpected and costly crises like the 1973 Yom Kippur War.</p> \n<p>But the loans were never repaid. Indeed, the state stopped paying interest and inflation-linkage on them in 2012, 15 years after the last of the loans, which were taken during the First Lebanon War in 1982, were supposed to have been repaid.</p> \n<p>An estimated 300,000 Israelis who lent the state money in those years, a sum now estimated at 500 million shekels ($133 million), not only haven’t been repaid, but the value of the money is being constantly eroded.</p> \n<p>Now a non-profit organization Tzedek Financi (Financial Justice) is seeking to get it back through a class action suit. What it has found out so far from the government’s response is that officials have done nothing to try to locate the lenders and return their money.</p> \n<p>Government attorneys contend that it’s up to the lender to identify themselves if they want their money back.</p> \n<p>“The responsibility for redeeming the loans applies, under the lending laws, to those who made the loans, and the relevant legislative provisions set dates and ways of redeeming the loans that the lenders have to follow,” the government said in response to the lawsuit.</p> \n<p>The claim is doubtful because the government requires private sector financial service companies, like banks and insurers, to find clients they have lost touch with over the years.</p> \n<p>Indeed, the genesis of the Financial Justice lawsuit was the fact that two women, Ora Bar and Shoshana Viner, used a treasury program to help people find lost financial assets at banks and insurance companies. The treasury’s Har Hakesef (Money Mountain) website also included information on the compulsorily loans, which the two had made to the government during the years 1961-1982.</p> \n<p>The two realized they were not the only ones who had forgotten about the loans and turned to Financial Justice for help with a class action suit.</p> \n<p>In principle the Bank of Israel, which holds the money, has said it will seek to find 4% of the lenders every year, with the goal of finding all of them within 25 years. In practice, in the last 15 years it has issued no written appeals at all.</p> \n<p>The loans came in two forms – one strictly compulsory in the form of deduction directly from paychecks that were invested in bearer bonds. The bonds were not negotiable. Other loans were somewhat more voluntary in the sense that the lender had the right to refuse – although he or she had to refuse rather than opt to lend the money.</p> \n<p>In defending itself against the need to find the lender, the government is arguing that the compulsory nature of the loans means they aren’t really investments at all.</p> \n<p>“These were not voluntary investments made by the public but an obligation made under the law and mandated by the state. ... There is no issue of investor protection or of a voluntary loan,” it told the court.</p> \n<p>The government argues that the voluntary loans also don’t count as investment. “The voluntary loans were made out of generosity to the state in its hour of need … It should be noted that at the time a minority refused to volunteer their money,” it said.</p> \n<p>Needless to say, Financial Justice doesn’t buy the argument. “You can’t call the situation anything but completely absurd,” it said in court documents.</p> \n<p>“The state raised funds from the public and promised a return on the investment. This is a financial investment in every respect, which is essentially similar to a debenture (and as mentioned, the loan law is explicitly defined as a “bond”). The state certainly did not prove that the lenders did not expect to receive money in the future,” it said.</p> \n<p>The two sides are due to meet in court this week to see whether Financial Justice class action suit will be recognized.</p>",

Alptekin was not in the United States and it was not clear if he would ever challenge the charges in court.</p> \n<p>“Ekim remains adamant that he - and he alone - ultimately moved forward with hiring FIG, paying them, and directing their work,” Molly Toomey said.</p> \n<p>'Breaking U.S. law'</p> \n<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has blamed Gulen for stoking a failed coup against him in 2016 - and his foreign minister grabbed headlines on Sunday by saying that Trump told Erdogan that Washington was working on extraditing the cleric.</p> \n<p>A senior White official pushed back on that assertion on Monday, stressing that Trump did not commit during a meeting with Erdogan at the G20 summit two weeks ago to extradite Gulen, who denies involvement in the coup attempt.</p> \n<p>The Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization affiliated with Gulen, said in a statement on Monday that the indictments illustrated “just how far the Erdogan government will go in breaking US law.”</p> \n<p>Flynn’s work on the Turkey project came under scrutiny after he published a commentary on a political news website on the day of the 2016 presidential election calling Gulen a “radical Islamist” who should be extradited to Turkey.</p> \n<p>Along with the editorial, the Flynn Intel Group produced a report on Gulen and video for a documentary that was never made. Of the roughly $600,000 paid to Flynn’s company, $80,000 was sent back to Alptekin through his Netherlands-based firm Inovo BV, Justice Department filings show.</p> \n<p>While Alptekin claims the $80,000 was sent back to him as repayment for work that was never completed, the indictment contends the money was part of a pre-arranged plan to kick back 20 percent of the project to Alptekin.</p> \n<p>Alptekin, a former chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, has said the payments to Flynn came from him personally and from Inovo, and were not from the Turkish government.</p> \n<p>During an interview with the FBI, Alptekin said that while he had discussed the project with a Turkish government minister he decided to go ahead and retain the Flynn Intel Group himself after the Turkish government “dropped the ball”.</p> \n<p>Among other evidence, the indictment cites an email from Alptekin to Rafiekian and Flynn in August 2016 in which Alptekin says that he had spoken about the project to discredit Gulen with two Turkish ministers and had a “green light to discuss confidentiality, budget and the scope of the contract.”</p> \n<p>The indictment also cites a September 19, 2016 meeting in New York which sources familiar with the matter said included Rafiekian, Flynn and Turkey’s foreign and energy ministers. The latter at the time was Erdogan’s son-in-law. The conversation centered on efforts to extradite Gulen, the indictment says.</p> \n<p>That conversation was followed in the ensuing weeks by visits by Rafiekian and others to see, among others, a member of Congress and a congressional staffer in an attempt, among other things, to prompt congressional hearings on Gulen.</p>",

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is down 14% from its August high and leading stocks like Facebook and Amazon have fallen even more. IVC noted that in the last two big global financial crises in 2000 and 2008, the impact on the local high-tech market was severe. By 2003, funding for Israeli startups had dropped 57% from its 2000 peak; in 2009 the decline was more than 35% from the year before. Venture capital funds had trouble raising capital as well and the recovery time for them was much longer, IVC figures showed. After the 2008 crisis, VC fundraising only recovered in 2011. “Should Israel’s high-tech industry be concerned? It’s a bit too early to say,” IVC said, adding that the impact, if it happens, is likely to start in the second half of 2019.

He has bought up 1,200 apartments in London over the past half year.</p> \n<p>Yakir Gabay bought the properties for about 500 million pounds ($630 million) through his company, Grand City Properties. The real estate was purchased in cash.</p> \n<p>A source close to the company said the properties were all bought from developers and are middle-level real estate rather than high-end. Gabay was able to buy them at a discount of tens of percent thanks to the Brexit-induced slowdown in the London real estate market.</p> \n<p>Although Gabay lives in the British capital, up to now he has been active mainly in Germany. Grand City, which specializes in residential real estate, owns 82,000 homes in Germany and is traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange at a market value of 3.3 billion euros ($3.8 billion).</p> \n<p>But Brexit provided the firm with an opportunity to move into the London market, the source said. Since Brexit, London’s housing market has dropped by one to five percent, he explained. At the same time, the pound has fallen 20 percent. As a result, many developers have stopped building new projects, and they have to sell under pressure.</p> \n<p>That has enabled Gabay's company to sign deals at discounts of up to 30 percent. But that is only because the company is paying in cash and is solving the contractor’s problems with the banks, the source said.</p> \n<p>It you look at the long term, he added, Brexit provided an opportunity to get into the market in Europe’s strongest city. That opportunity, he said, had last arisen in 2009.</p> \n<p>There’s a risk that the housing market might collapse following Brexit, the source acknowledged, but there is also potential. And if there are problems, the rental market might actually benefit. The company isn’t buying to sell, he said. It's in it for the long term.</p> \n<p>Buying at a discount also provide a certain level of protection, he added. And to limit the risk, Grand City decided to restrict its investments in London to no more than 10 percent of its asset portfolio.</p> \n<p>While Brexit has caused a housing slowdown throughout Britain, it has been particularly marked in London. The Guardian newspaper reported this week that overall, British housing prices fell 1.7 percent in November, the sharpest drop since 2012, citing data from the real estate website Rightmove. The fall was especially steep in Britain’s wealthiest cities, including London.</p> \n<p>Grand City is owned by another Gabay company, Aroundtown. That company trades in Frankfurt at a market capitalization of 8.4 billion euros.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s easy to feel apprehensive approaching a film that has received universal acclaim. What if you’re the one who hates it (like that dumbass guy who was the only person to give “Lady Bird” a bad review last year)? The one who fails to appreciate a work that has already been crowned a modern masterpiece by the world and his significant other? To clear up any misunderstanding, I’m not talking about “Bumblebee” here but Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n’s “Roma” – which just dropped on Netflix.</p> \n<p>The Mexican director has made, by my count, one absolute classic in his 30-year career – his 2006 adaptation of P.D. James’ dystopian novel “Children of Men.” He’s also made one of the great coming-of-age movies in “Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n” (2001) and the hands-down best Harry Potter movie (2004’s “Prisoner of Azkaban”). I’m still feeling too nauseous to decide if 2013’s “Gravity” was a classic, but for sure it was a great technical achievement – vomit-inducing camerawork and all.</p> \n<p>Clearly,&nbsp;Netflix&nbsp;had at least one eye on little gold men in Los Angeles when it green lighted “Roma,” which is also why it has just given the film a limited theatrical release across the globe. As a TV critic I opted to see it on the small screen, but it’s not hard to imagine its beautiful black-and-white images looking particularly stunning on the big screen (or as big a screen as arthouse cinemas can muster these days). I would have loved to hear it in a state-of-the-art cinema as well – somewhere that would do justice to the film’s Dolby Atmos soundscape (crashing waves, raging forest fires, droplets of water, hailstones on windows, bonkers Mexican folk songs).</p> \n<p>This is still an immensely rewarding film to see on your TV screen or computer. You know you’re in the hands of a master from the first shot when the opening credits are superimposed on a tiled floor being washed, the standing water eventually reflecting a passenger plane passing overhead. Yet while the water becomes more and more soapy, that’s not something the film can be accused of.</p> \n<p>This heavily autobiographical tale is set in the Mexico City suburb of Colonia Roma in 1970-71. Both the country and its featured family are in flux, although any political turmoil is placed firmly in the background of this unabashedly domestic story – which may well be the best-looking neorealist film ever shot.</p> \n<p>Cleo (newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) is one of two young maids working for a comfortably middle-class family with four children. The parents, a doctor and biochemist, are both decidedly hands-off when it comes to the kids, so Cleo is also a doting nanny and almost part of the family – albeit the one who has to try to maintain some kind of domestic order in this chaotic home. And the chaos is only just beginning.</p> \n<p>We follow events through Cleo’s eyes (Cuar&oacute;n dedicated the film to his own nanny, Liboria “Libo” Rodriguez), but “Roma” is not a film driven by plot. Very little happens for the first 30 minutes other than the viewer witnessing Cleo’s daily routine, and even the most dramatic moments later on are generally underplayed – which, perhaps counterintuitively, somehow makes the emotional payoffs even greater.</p> \n<p>There is one scene that is genuinely heartbreaking and many that etch themselves into your mind (the film’s poster – featuring mother, maid and children hugging on a beach – is from a scene that is a genuinely iconic moment of modern cinema). The film is ultimately a touching tribute to a working-class heroine, but never in a patronizing way.</p> \n<p>Cuar&oacute;n also served as cinematographer and co-editor here, and “Roma” is clearly a story from the heart. It’s not going to do much for Netflix’s subscription figures (youngsters will probably be too busy watching “Friends” and “The Office”), but it is a film that deserves to be seen by anyone who cares about cinema. In many ways it’s a throwback to the domestic dramas of the 1950s, leisurely recounting its tale over 135 hypnotic minutes. You could display stills from the film in an art gallery. Hell, the guy even manages to make dog poop photogenic.</p> \n<p>'Bird Box'&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If “Roma” seems a shoo-in for some Oscars love next year, another of Netflix’s hoped-for awards contenders, “Bird Box,” is unlikely to be bothering the engravers. (The film debuts on Netflix this Friday.)</p> \n<p>Any movie that sounds like a They Might Be Giants song is probably in dire need of a better title – although the film’s biggest problem is that it looks like a rather expensive rip-off of this year’s surprise hit “A Quiet Place.” The irony is that the book upon which “Bird Box” is based was penned before the script for John Krasinski’s horror-thriller got bought in 2017, but that’s showbiz – you snooze, you lose (or get Al Franken pretend-groping you; either way it’s pretty bad).</p> \n<p>Whereas the gimmick in “A Quiet Place” was aliens and sound, in “Bird Box” it’s aliens and vision: If you happen to see this mysterious thing (which we the viewers don’t, for the most part), you immediately have an overriding desire to kill yourself. It’s a bit like viewing a Jared Kushner sex tape.</p> \n<p>What is “Bird Box” exactly, other than the worst-titled film of the year? Well, the 2014 book drew comparisons to Stephen King and had a clear advantage over the film in being able to describe everything (in the film, we often get scenes in which we experience the less-than-riveting point of view of a blindfolded character). But here, the film is not quite a horror movie, not quite a thought-provoking drama, not quite a smart thriller and not quite a meditation on motherhood in a post-apocalyptic world. It wants to be 'A Disquieting Place'&nbsp;– but fails.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The story intercuts between two-time frames (the original book featured three): “Five years ago,” when the world was plunged into chaos as hundreds of millions of people started killing themselves in what the novel rather understatedly referred to as “The Problem” (it remains nameless here); and the present, when a handful of survivors try to make their way to a supposed place of sanctuary. The downside is that they must spend two days blindly navigating a small rowboat down a river in order to get there.</p> \n<p>Our hero is Sandra Bullock’s Malorie, who in her “five years ago” form is the world’s least pregnant-looking pregnant woman. (Hollywood joke: How can you tell which scenes are set in the past? They’re the ones in which Bullock looks older.) When things turn to merde, Malorie finds herself holed up in a house with a group of random strangers – including John Malkovich as an uber-asshole; another pregnant woman (Danielle Macdonald from the 2017 Sundance hit “Patti Cake$”); hot Iraq War veteran Tom (Trevante Rhodes); and Tom Hollander as a “mysterious” stranger who proves it is still possible to telegraph things in the 21st century.</p> \n<p>“You never, ever take off your blindfold!” Malorie screams at the beginning of the film – and there may be times when you too want to avert your gaze during some of the more banal moments. That said, there are two excellent set-pieces (one involving a “blind” drive to a supermarket; the other during the river run), which left me wishing Danish director Susanne Bier had embraced the story’s apocalyptic side more – in other words, more “Walking Dead” scenarios, less plodding dialogue and exposition.</p> \n<p>“A Quiet Place” demonstrated how to be smart and scary with minimal dialogue (there’s absolutely nothing here to rival the “toy space shuttle” scene in Krasinski’s film) and – most importantly – made you forget its ultimately daft premise. “Bird Box” never manages to let you overlook the bird-brained implausibility of it all.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The New York Times’s “By the Book” column is no stranger to scandal.</p> \n<p>Male authors who participate in the feature, in which an author answers questions about the books that have formed them, tend to mention few female authors among their picks. It’s a phenomenon so notable that when Lauren Groff was a “By the Book” subject earlier this year, she discussed only female authors, pointedly noting their frequent omission.</p> \n<p>But a controversy about anti-Semitism is new.</p> \n<p>That’s exactly what struck after the Times published a “By the Book” featuring Alice Walker on December 13. The first question Walker answered was about the books on her nightstand, to which she gave four answers: Somaly Mam’s “The Road of Lost Innocence,” “Perfect Peace” by Daniel Black, “Mom &amp; Me &amp; Mom” by Maya Angelou and “And the Truth Shall Set You Free” by David Icke.</p> \n<p>There’s just one problem: Icke is notoriously anti-Semitic. And his own publisher found “And the Truth Shall Set You Free” too anti-Semitic to release, so Icke published it on his own.</p> \n<p>Walker’s endorsement of Icke — “In Icke’s books there is the whole of existence, on this planet and several others, to think about. A curious person’s dream come true,” she wrote — gained attention on social media on December 17, after Tablet’s Yair Rosenberg wrote an article pointing out the explicit anti-Semitism of “And the Truth Shall Set You Free,” and Walker’s recent history of repeating its libels. “And the Truth Shall Set You Free,” among other claims, blames a Jew for the Holocaust. “A man called Alfred Rosenberg, an occultist with a Jewish, Estonian, and French background… made a copy of The Protocols Of The Learned Elders Of Zion available to Hitler,” Icke writes. “[The fate of Jews] was sealed when Alfred Rosenberg with his Jewish background, made a copy of The Protocols Of The Learned Elders Of Zion available to Hitler.”</p> \n<p>Icke also writes that “The Russian Revolution was all part of [Otto Kahn and the Morgan family’s] Big Plan, which is why the leading officials of the Rothschild-controlled Federal Reserve Bank of New York, including Thompson, supported the Bolsheviks. In this period, we are seeing the Global Elite deciding on the post-war policies and ensuring that the puppet-politicians make it happen.”</p> \n<p>Walker, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “The Color Purple” (1982), has been sharing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories for at least five years. As Philip Bump noted in The Atlantic in 2013, a post on Walker’s blog in which she wrote about her favorite books, films and more of that year featured a book by Icke, “Human Race Get Off Your Knees,” as well as a general recommendation of Icke’s work and his radio show. In a different blog post of that same year, Walker delved into Icke’s theories, delivered in “Human Race Get Off Your Knees,” about reptilian overlords who rule the planet. “They wanted gold and they wanted slaves to mine it for them. Now gosh, who does this remind us of? I only am asking,” she wrote. “You do the work.”</p> \n<p>Then, in 2017, Walker published a poem on her blog titled “It is Our (Frightful) Duty to Study the Talmud.” In the poem, Walker gave readers instructions on how to begin such study: “For a more in depth study/I recommend starting with YouTube. Simply follow the trail of ‘The/Talmud’ as its poison belatedly winds its way/Into our collective consciousness,” she wrote. Then she went further:</p> \n<p>Are Goyim (us) meant to be slaves of Jews, and not only That, but to enjoy it? Are three year old (and a day) girls eligible for marriage and intercourse? Are young boys fair game for rape? Must even the best of the Goyim (us, again) be killed? Pause a moment and think what this could mean Or already has meant In our own lifetime.</p> \n<p>The Times’s inclusion of Walker’s recommendation of Icke drew ire on social media, where some questioned why editors had published the recommendation at all, let alone without clarification of the book’s contents.</p> \n<p>A Times spokesperson provided a statement to BuzzFeed News in response to the criticism; “By the Book is an interview and portrait of a public person through the lens of books; it is not a list of recommendations from our editors,” they wrote. “The subject’s answers are a reflection on that person’s personal tastes, opinions and judgments. As with any interview, the subject’s answers do not imply an endorsement by Times editors.”</p> \n<p>In her “By the Book” column, Walker mentioned her blog, noting that she regularly uses it to publish several pieces a month. “I have always wanted my heart to be directly in touch with the reader’s,” she wrote.</p> \n<p>For more stories, go to www.forward.com.

Dreifuss assailed the Warsaw museum and those who decided, despite all the problems, to take on a project whose importance is hard to overstate. This criticism deserves a response.</p> \n<p>First, the political context. There’s no more appropriate response to Dreifuss’ criticism than the old saying that people who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Budapest Holocaust museum: Orban’s grand gesture or a whitewashing of Hungarian history?</p> \n<p>Dreifuss works for an institution that in recent years has functioned as a hard-working laundromat, striving to bleach out the sins of every anti-Semitic, fascist, racist or simply murderously thuggish leader or politician like Hungary’s Viktor Orban, the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte and Italy’s Matteo Salvini.</p> \n<p>My heart breaks when I see my colleagues, honest and faithful researchers of the Holocaust, giving tours of this historic museum, apparently under compulsion, to the evildoers the Israeli government sends to Yad Vashem to receive absolution in the name of Holocaust victims in exchange for adding a pro-Israel vote at international institutions. For some reason, Dreifuss has no criticism about this.</p> \n<p>But for the Polish government (every Polish government, both the current one headed by the nationalist Law and Justice party and the previous one headed by a liberal centrist coalition), which is spending tens of millions of zlotys every year to preserve historical Jewish sites, Jewish graveyards and countless memorials, she has scathing criticism.</p> \n<p>Fear and demoralization </p> \n<p>A week and a half ago, Matti Friedman published an opinion piece in The New York Times about what’s happening at Yad Vashem, and it made for difficult reading. When you read his conclusions, your hair stands on end. He doesn’t quote a single Yad Vashem employee by name, because no one wanted to be identified. After all, they have to earn a living.</p> \n<p>Friedman described a mood of frustration, fear and demoralization among the employees because the current extremist, nationalist government has turned Yad Vashem into a political tool reminiscent of history museums in totalitarian countries.</p> \n<p>But the most astonishing thing Friedman reported is that the institution’s chairman, Avner Shalev – who turned the museum into an international remembrance empire, and who for years has viciously fought every attempt to present a different conceptual or research approach than that of Yad Vashem – is reluctant to retire, despite having reached the age of 80.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;How a Nazi sympathizer helped found one of Sweden's most powerful parties</p> \n<p>The reason for his reluctance is that many people at the institute fear that when he leaves, his place will be taken by someone nominated by the relevant minister, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who will turn Yad Vashem into a remembrance institute in the spirit of Bennett’s Habayit Hayehudi party. It would be interesting to know what Dreifuss thinks about that.</p> \n<p>Yad Vashem is now paying the price of the many years in which it nurtured a one-dimensional, simplistic message that there’s only one way to explain the Holocaust. Today, the institution is apparently willing to place its reputation for Holocaust research, which it has built over many years, at the service of a government that has recruited it to accuse anyone who criticizes Israel of anti-Semitism. So it’s no wonder that its researchers have become partisan explainers of the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>It’s one thing when, at dubious conferences with political leaders whose governments include former neo-Nazis, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tries to pass resolutions calling criticism of Israel the new anti-Semitism. It’s another when a research and remembrance institute doesn’t stand courageously against all such attempts.</p> \n<p>Thus Yad Vashem would do better not to look for evidence that other governments are attempting to distort history and dictate nationalist content – not to mention engaging in Holocaust denial, as Dreifuss charges.</p> \n<p>The Polish angle </p> \n<p>Does any of the above justify the current Polish government’s position on the Holocaust? Obviously not. The Polish government has a problematic agenda in explaining the past, which we aren’t obligated to accept and in fact should even criticize.</p> \n<p>But Poland’s government hasn’t interfered with the work of the museum’s employees, who have now started working, and certainly not with the development of the museum’s narrative. Had Dreifuss and her colleagues gotten involved in this effort, as they were invited to do, they would have been welcomed. Had Yad Vashem offered its help and support instead of giving the project the cold shoulder, nobody would have been happier than we at the museum.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opening Italy’s ‘closet of shame’</p> \n<p>And now we come to the historical issue. To take part in the effort to establish the Warsaw Ghetto Museum, one has to agree that the Holocaust can be presented and explained from perspectives other than an ethnocentric Jewish, Zionist and nationalist one.</p> \n<p>One has to accept that the Holocaust can be studied in a way that sees Jewish history during this period as an integral part of Poland’s history under the Nazi occupation. One has to agree that the horrific Jewish tragedy that occurred during World War II can and should be understood in part by simultaneously examining&nbsp;– while noting both the differences and the common elements&nbsp;– what befell Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war and others who were murdered alongside Jews in the vast genocidal expanse that occupied Poland became.</p> \n<p>To set up a museum with a humanist, universal and inclusive message about the Holocaust, one has to accept an approach that sees the Warsaw Ghetto – a horrific terror zone that caused the deaths and physical and spiritual collapse of hundreds of thousands of Jews – as one element of a much bigger terror zone in which hundreds of thousands of other people suffered and fought for their existence: the Poles who lived on the other side of the wall.</p> \n<p>The obvious differences between the fates of these two peoples don’t absolve the research historian, or a museum depicting the history of this period, from presenting this complex message and demanding that visitors to the museum grapple with its lessons.</p> \n<p>Therefore, the new Warsaw Ghetto Museum won’t be Yad Vashem. It will be a Holocaust museum in the heart of the Polish capital that remembers the fate of the 450,000 Jews, Warsaw residents and refugees brought to the ghetto.</p> \n<p>After all, the vast majority of them were Jewish citizens of Poland. That’s how they lived, that’s how they suffered, and that’s how they should be remembered after being murdered by the Nazis.</p> \n<p>Prof. Daniel Blatman is a historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the chief historian for the Warsaw Ghetto Museum.</p>",

        "text":["<p>&gt;&gt; Update:&nbsp;Lebanese army on high alert after altercation with Israeli soldiers over tunnel operation</p> \n<p>On the eve of the first day of Operation Northern Shield, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Chief of General Staff Gadi Eisenkot stood alongside each other at a press conference and demonstrated a united front regarding the urgent need to destroy the tunnels under the border with Lebanon. Yet, Eisenkot had to exert quite a bit of pressure on the politicians to get to that moment at Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. Months of tense debates that climaxed with the resignation of former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who believed his constant struggle with the defense establishment could end his political future, the evening with the unified message.</p> \n<p>Conversations Haaretz conducted with some of those involved in the discussions preceding the operation reveal that the prime minister equivocated about the suitable time for such an operation until it was approved on November 7. Netanyahu was well-versed in the details of the tunnel project, for which the Israel Defense forces had been preparing for two years. Sources said that Netanyahu wasn’t hesitating about whether to act; the question for him, as for Eisenkot, was the timing.</p> \n<p>A source privy to some of the discussions about launching the operation in the north asserted that Eisenkot exerted more pressure on this issue than on any other issue since taking over as chief of general staff. According to people who were at the discussions, Eisenkot pushed to start destroying the tunnels as soon as possible and wrangled with several security cabinet ministers, especially with Lieberman and Education Minister Naftali Bennett. Eisenkot insisted it would be mistaken to launch an operation in the south before tackling the threat of Hezbollah tunnels, they said.</p> \n<p>“This is the organization’s [Hezbollah’s] next Operation Barbarossa against Israel,” Eisenkot said, referring to Germany’s surprise invasion against the Soviet Union in June 1941. “This is Hezbollah’s most significant part of the next confrontation,” he noted in arguing to prioritize the northern front over the southern one. “It is building on this card, which could be its signature achievement.”</p> \n<p>During another discussion, Eisenkot presented a letter from Northern Command head Maj. Gen. Yoel Strick, in which the general warned that the delay could lead to the loss of the element of surprise, and would allow Hezbollah to carry out a deadly attack.</p> \n<p>At another meeting, the chief of staff asked specifically to include Strick’s warnings in the minutes. Security sources said that Netanyahu was not pleased that Eisenkot had brought the letter, let alone sought to insert it in the protocol. But according to the sources, this was the moment that shifted the balance, because afterward Netanyahu gave the operation the green light. “Eisenkot, like all those present at that security discussion, knew unequivocally that no one could avoid taking responsibility for a terror attack coming from Lebanon when there were minutes in which the chief of staff and the head of Northern Command were warning of one,” said an official familiar with the details.</p> \n<p>Irreparable relationship</p> \n<p>The backdrop to the discussions on Operation Northern Shield was the harsh criticism over the way Israel was responding to Hamas in the south. The pressure was also coming from Lieberman, whose relationship with security officials had become so hostile that it was disrupting their work together.</p> \n<p>The tension between the defense minister and the chief of staff had been evident in the Elor Azaria affair, the disputes over closing Army Radio, the return of terrorists’ bodies and in other cases where Lieberman believed the defense establishment was not backing the policies he advocated in the Defense Ministry and the military. Another incident that increased the tension occurred when Eisenkot submitted the candidacy of Maj. Gen. Roni Noma as the sole nominee to be the next head of Military Intelligence. Sources familiar with the situation said that Lieberman had told Eisenkot that he should submit the name of at least one other candidate to enable a choice. A few weeks later, Eisenkot was informed that Lieberman had chosen Maj. Gen. Tamir Heyman as head of Military Intelligence, after consulting with several former senior IDF officers.</p> \n<p>At the end of March, when the Friday demonstrations began near the Gaza perimeter fence, the tension further worsened. The gaps between Lieberman’s position and that of defense officials regarding the Gaza policy gradually turned the tension into hostility, to the point where the relationship became irreparable.</p> \n<p>At one of its peak moments, Lieberman told senior IDF officers that he felt “as if I were talking to the Peace Now leadership.” The defense minister announced at the time that he would stop supplying fuel to Gaza until the demonstrations and incendiary kites stopped. After a certain lull, there was a conference call in which the heads of the defense establishment expressed support for allowing fuel back into Gaza due to the humanitarian crisis there. The call involved Lieberman, the chief of Military Intelligence, the head of the Shin Bet security service, Eisenkot and the coordinator of government activities in the territories. According to sources familiar with the conversation, after he compared the security officials to Peace Now leaders, Lieberman hung up, leaving his surprise listeners on the line.</p> \n<p>In another meeting, after a heavy barrage of rocket fire&nbsp;at Israel from the Gaza Strip, Lieberman demanded a decisive blow against Gaza. When a few of those present asked him what he meant, Lieberman replied: Attacks from the air that will scare them, so they understand they have crossed the red lines. Bennett presented a plan for a military operation that would also lead to the evacuation of Israeli residents in the area near the border with Gaza. Bennett also wanted aerial attacks, but without having soldiers enter the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>The operation in the north was approved at this meeting, and the defense establishment thought it would be irresponsible to be dragged into a conflict with Hamas only a few days before such sensitive operations against Hezbollah. Eisenkot looked like a man who had lost his patience, said sources acquainted with the discussion. Eisenkot said that it would be impossible to deliver a harsh blow acting only from the air, said Eisenkot, according to those sources. Weakening Hamas would require a ground operation, he stressed, adding that all involved needed to realize the implications of such a decision.</p> \n<p>Eisenkot and Shin Bet director Nadav Argaman, and after them National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat and Mossad chief Yossi Cohen, were unanimous in their views concerning the need to act in the north, and not at the same time as an operation in Gaza. All the leaders of the defense establishment agreed it was necessary to first exhaust all efforts to reach an arrangement with Hamas.</p> \n<p>The commander of the IDF’s Operations Directorate, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was making the security situation worse. Haliva said that Israel could initiate economic and practical steps to prevent an escalation of the situation. He foresaw a two-month window of opportunity to move to bring about calm in the south.</p> \n<p>The IDF’s coordinator of government activities in the territories, Maj. Gen. Kamil Abu Rukun, agreed with Haliva and presented data on the crisis in the Gaza Strip. But Lieberman did not want to hear it, said one of the sources. “Lieberman would become annoyed with the officers every time they would talk about the humanitarian situation,&quot; said the source. &quot;He didn’t let them say humanitarian crisis, it would drive him crazy.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu supported Eisenkot concerning the south, and left Lieberman all by himself with his positions. At a meeting after the day of fighting in which Hamas fired hundreds of rockets at Israel, on November 12, all those at the meeting went out for a short break, during which someone showed Lieberman a tweet from journalist Sharon Gal. “This toy Rambo defense minister is silent,” said the tweet. “I’m embarrassed that I was a Knesset member in Yisrael Beiteinu under this defense minister, who except for talk is not doing anything.” At that moment, Lieberman realized that he was seen as being responsible for the restrained response in the south and he expected to pay the political price for it, said sources familiar with the details.</p> \n<p>Top priority</p> \n<p>Thus, the discussions regarding the Hezbollah tunnels came about against the backdrop of this tension on the table, and the military – with Netanyahu’s support – trying to prevent broader military action in Gaza. Netanyahu did not talk mention an exact when he informed security cabinet members about the Hezbollah tunnels and sought approval for the operation. Eisenkot thought it was best to start the operation immediately, both for practical reasons and because Netanyahu and the other ministers who supported restraint in Gaza were losing their ability to withstand the public’s criticism.</p> \n<p>Eisenkot’s position was reinforced by Haliva and Heyman at the meeting in which Eisenkot compared the Hezbollah tunnels to Operation Barbarossa. Haliva said the issue of the tunnels was top priority, not just over dealing with Hamas, but also over Hezbollah’s project for precision missiles, which has kept the IDF very busy in Syria.</p> \n<p>In one of the meetings just before the approval of the tunnel operation, Eisenkot introduced the warning letter by Strick, the Northern Command head, about possible scenarios if Israel did not undertake the operation against the tunnels. Strick said the preparations for the operation had been completed and the military had the intelligence information needed for the operation. Strick also said that any delay would increase the possibility of the information leaking out and being exposed in the media, and the IDF could well lose its element of surprise, which was of critical importance. If Hezbollah learned that Israel knew about the tunnels, the threat to Israeli communities along the border with Lebanon would grow, said Strick. It was possible that Hezbollah would take advantage of this and act against Israel from the tunnels, he warned. Such action could make the situation worse than what was expected from the response to an operation to destroy the tunnels. The tunnels were intended to provide Hezbollah with victory pictures for Nasrallah as the first Muslim leader in years to fight against the IDF on Israeli soil, added Strick. Netanyahu was not pleased that Eisenkot presented the letter from Strick, and made it clear that the matter had been on the agenda for a long time and had received proper treatment, even without warning letters, said defense sources.</p> \n<p>Lieberman also brought in reinforcements to support his position, in which Israel needed to begin an operation in the Gaza Strip and postpone the tunnel operation in the north by a few weeks or months. Lieberman invited the head of the Research Division of Military Intelligence, Brig. Gen. Dror Shalom, who said more intelligence was needed to ensure the tunnels would be found. Eisenkot allowed Shalom to give his briefing. There were those who reminded Lieberman that only a few months earlier it was Shalom who contradicted his statements in meetings about attacking Gaza. “But in this case, Shalom’s opinion matched Lieberman’s interests,” said a defense source.</p> \n<p>During the briefing in which the approval of the tunnel operation was discussed, Eisenkot pressed to include Strick’s letter in the minutes of the meeting. He began reading out a few sentences from the letter for the minutes. “As far as Netanyahu and all those who were in the room at the time, it was a step that led to the final approval of the operation, even if someone still had minor reservations,” said a source familiar with the situation.</p> \n<p>Another source involved in the matter said that if such an incident had taken place, even if it was not conducted from inside the tunnels and led to an escalation between Israel and Hezbollah, it would have placed the responsibility on Netanyahu and the members of the security cabinet. This is what made the approval of the tunnel operation the obvious choice, said the source.</p> \n<p>The preparations for the tunnel operation took about two years, so a difference of a week or two from the set date would not have had any great affect, said security sources. “The intelligence assessment that preceded the decision on undertaking the operation was that Hezbollah would not respond, because the work would be in [Israeli] territory and Hezbollah would find it difficult to find an excuse to take action,” said a security source. “In addition, the assessments were that Hezbollah was in a very difficult situation concerning Iran and Lebanon, something that made it difficult [for Hezbollah] to go and fight Israel today.”</p> \n<p>Eisenkot was not a partner in all these optimistic assessments and said in meetings that there is always uncertainty concerning Hezbollah’s action in extreme situations, so Israel must prepare for the worst possibility of a graduated escalation – all the way up to a war in the north. “It was important to Eisenkot, before the operation, to complete all the training exercises of the [front-line] divisions and to bring the IDF to high readiness in preparation in case the operation would lead to an escalation,” said the defense source. Eisenkot thought that “we are not completely past the threats and developments that could very well come in response to the [tunnel] operation.”</p> \n<p>A spokesman for Lieberman said, “This is a mix of lies and absurdities that mostly points out the distorted approach and prejudices of the leakers and those who make use of these same leaks.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Last Tuesday evening I was sitting at one of the few caf&eacute;s in my village, Ara. Between games of backgammon and light gossip, accompanied by thick coffee with no sugar, shots were suddenly heard in the northeastern section of town. To my regret, we’ve grown used to this routine, and there was no one in the caf&eacute; who gave it a second thought. But a few minutes later, ambulance and police-car sirens were heard, preceding their arrival. Without anyone saying a word, we understood that there were people injured or worse.</p> \n<p>The exchange of fire continued well after midnight – despite the massive presence of police forces in the village, it must be emphasized. Even though I live in the western part of the community, where one doesn’t always hear what goes on in “downtown” Ara, there was almost continuous gunfire that night. On my way out of the caf&eacute;, someone said that one person had been injured.</p> \n<p>Astonishingly, the next morning I could find no reference to these events on any of the Arabic news sites I looked at, let alone the Hebrew ones. Who cares if Arabs shoot at Arabs (Kais Nasser, Haaretz Hebrew edition, Dec. 11)? Haaretz's Vered Lee (&quot;Criminal neglect: The Israeli government is complicit in the murder of Arab women,&quot; Dec.12) mainly blames the police for its incompetence in dealing with the murder of Arab women. Half of the female murder victims in Israel are Arabs, even though Arabs make up only one-fifth of the population.</p> \n<p>To my mind, the under-reporting of acts of violence that do not result in death within Arab society is a badge of shame for that society. Some of the victims of this violence, including many women, are permanently maimed, but this evokes no shock or interest, even though such injuries often destroy the lives and careers of the people affected, as well as the way of life of the people around them. Arab leaders in Israel also do not take special interest in these cases and they’re barely mentioned at conferences organized by these leaders – events that have never brought about practical results leading to a reduction in the scourge of violence.</p> \n<p>Returning to the murder of women: In light of the multiple cases in recent days, it seems that this blood-soaked chain will not be severed any time soon – the problem only seems to be intensifying. As I’ve said in the past, the basic fact is that the person pulling the trigger or wielding the knife is the main culprit, almost the only one. Don’t tell me about collecting illegal weapons – someone who shoots can also stab, and then what do we do? Will we collect all the sharp utensils in the homes of Arabs?</p> \n<p>The murder of women in Arab society has causes and elements in common with other acts of violence, as well as having much in common with murders in Jewish society. But the murder of Arab women has several unique characteristics that must be addressed at the outset of any campaign to eradicate this evil. Most murdered Arab women are young, some of them in their early teens. These are not murders committed in a criminal setting, involving drugs, turf wars and control. Even if it is not admitted, nearly all these murders are committed over what is called “family honor.” The meaning of this term is that a woman’s body, in fact her entire existence, is not under her control, and when she uses her body for sex as she sees fit, she harms the status and dignity of the man she “belongs” to.</p> \n<p>The Arab world is at a critical and very dangerous stage in its history. The accelerated technological advances experienced by the West are also experienced by Arabs, who acquire the technology without producing it. This creates a dependence on others, who do not refrain from harming Arabs in their exploitation of the region. The wars in Syria, Iraq and Yemen are clear examples of Western aggression and its exploitation of local agents (Saudi Arabia and its satellites) in order to establish supremacy over Arabs while exploiting their natural resources.</p> \n<p>What is happening in Israel’s Arab society today is very similar to what is happening throughout the Arab world: accelerated technological development, a very partial embrace of the values of Western liberalism, but also a pulling away – a return to religion and its holy writings. Naturally, women, who are less free in traditional societies, will aspire to greater liberty in a society that is technologically quasi-modern while at the same time lagging behind in its approach to modernism. These aspirations are perceived as a challenge to male dominion.</p> \n<p>This sterile academic description portrays, in fact, a scenario of murderous hypocrisy on the part of males, especially true for Arab males in Israel. Most Arab fathers will only superficially protest, or ignore, their son’s going out or having sex with a younger woman. If the woman is not Arab, they say: “Never mind, one day he’ll return to the fold, and anyway, those women don’t have families that can hurt her or him.” But when their daughters do the same thing with an Arab man, let alone a non-Arab – their fury knows no bounds.</p> \n<p>I’ll say this in the bluntest and clearest fashion: Until there is no sexual freedom in Arab society, this society will remain backward and inferior.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Council for Higher Education is demanding that academic institutions&nbsp;in the country explain why they accept or reject proposals to set up legal aid clinics in their schools.</p> \n<p>The aim is to create a mechanism for supervising the clinics, which in recent years have been criticized by right-wing groups and Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who claim they are politically biased. Currently it is up to each institution of higher learning to decide whether or not to set up a proposed clinic, in accordance with the Council of Higher Education Law that protects academic freedom.</p> \n<p>According to the new policy, the head of an academic institution “will receive and gather the annual reports of the clinics that exist in the institution,&quot; including reports about the bodies that have proposed setting up new legal aid clinics and the reasons for approving or rejecting them during the year. These reports must be submitted to the CHE.</p> \n<p>The council adds that, “a student will not have to participate in a clinic that is contrary to his personal views” – which seems superfluous, since undergoing training in such clinics is considered an elective activity, and in any event students themselves decide which clinic they want to work for and then undergo an application process.</p> \n<p>The CHE's decisions were approved at a stormy meeting last Tuesday, with 12 council members voting in favor, six against and one abstaining. Bennett told the daily Israel Hayom, which first reported on the meeting, that “we will now also open up legal training in academia to right-wing organizations, which until now were excluded from the map because of internal pressures at the universities.”</p> \n<p>Several CHE members said the new requirement to report on clinics that were not opened – because they have the same status as existing elective courses that each institution decides to offer – is unprecedented, and they warned of the “serious, disproportionate and probably illegal damage” such a move poses to academic freedom, deriving from unacceptable political pressure. Many also said the policy could hamper the efforts clinics make to help people who have no other access to legal counsel.</p> \n<p>“The rhetoric of ‘balance’ is ridiculous when one understands that the role of the clinics is to provide legal representation to weak populations,” said Vardit Damari-Madar, the professional director of the Center for Clinical Legal Education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “It would be like demanding that we also represent banks if we also take upon ourselves to represent those made homeless because of debt. The CHE decision reveals a desire to silence and damage the defense of human rights.”</p> \n<p>Another source who requested anonymity said, “Most of the CHE members have become a rubber stamp. Not only does the council not fulfill its mandate – to serve as a buffer between academia and politics – it is actively contributing to the politicization of Israeli higher education.”</p> \n<p>There are currently 110 legal clinics operating at 13 universities and colleges in the country. Their year-long programs include both courses and practical experience in casework and other projects. Some clinics focus on social issues, like fighting discrimination in housing and employment or defending the rights of asylum seekers, while others see their primary role as providing law students with work experience.</p> \n<p>Right-wing organizations have recently been focusing their attention on a few legal clinics, like the one dedicated to Arab rights at the University of Haifa, and Tel Aviv University’s Refugee Rights Clinic, which was a party to three High Court of Justice petitions against amendments to the Infiltration in Israel Law that targets asylum seekers.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is often framed in black and white, an outlook captured by this image of Palestinian youths shrouded by clouds of smoke that block out everything except an isolated moment of protest and defiance.</p> \n<p>Reuters photographer Mohammed Salem's photograph of a handful of demonstrators in a field of dying flowers and charred grass recorded a new phenomenon in an old war – the weekly Palestinian protests that began in the spring of 2018 along the Gaza-Israeli border.</p> \n<p>The protests pitted thousands of Palestinian demonstrators against heavily armed Israeli soldiers on the other side of the fortified border fence intent on stopping the protesters from crossing or approaching the frontier.</p> \n<p>What became known as the &quot;Great March of Return&quot; dominated the headlines for months, evolving into a compelling but deadly form of attritional public spectacle, all covered by photojournalists risking their lives to document it.</p> \n<p>Taking place in a handful of accessible locations at prearranged times, the protests became battlegrounds of image and spin for both sides.</p> \n<p>The Israeli military published video footage, pictures and social media posts in Hebrew, English and Arabic to support its message that its forces were engaged in &quot;riot dispersal&quot;.</p> \n<p>Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls Gaza, televised images of the Palestinian dead and wounded, and Palestinian protesters posted images from the front lines on social media.</p> \n<p>The primary stated purpose of the protests was to revive a demand by refugees for the right to return to lands that Palestinians were driven from or fled when Israel was founded in 1948. Israel has ruled out any such right, concerned that the country would lose its Jewish majority.</p> \n<p>But the immediate factor was Palestinian anger at U.S. President Donald Trump's decisions on Dec. 6 last year to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to begin preparations to move its embassy to the city that is sacred to three of the great monotheistic faiths: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.</p> \n<p>Trump's move delighted Israel's government, which regards Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish people, but infuriated Palestinians, who claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they hope to establish in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Gaza.</p> \n<p>The deadliest day of the protests was May 14, when the new embassy held its opening ceremony. It fell on a symbolic date for both sides - the 70th anniversary of the creation of Israel. That is a joyous day for Israelis, but an event regarded by Palestinians as their &quot;Nakba&quot; or Catastrophe when they lost their homeland.</p> \n<p>The Jerusalem-Gaza juxtaposition made headlines at home and abroad, and produced a worldwide split-screen television moment as Trump's daughter Ivanka attended the embassy ceremony, even as Israeli troops killed around 60 Palestinian protesters just over 70 km (43 miles) away.</p> \n<p>The border protests continued and morphed into other forms.</p> \n<p>Israelis were angered by another new phenomenon first seen in 2018 - the Palestinian 'fire kites' and balloons loaded with petrol bombs by Gaza militants and sent flying over the border.</p> \n<p>Palestinians continued to call for an end to an Israeli-led blockade on Gaza.</p> \n<p>The conflict switched to the skies in November when a bungled Israeli commando mission inside Gaza erupted into a deadly gunfight and then the fiercest Palestinian rocket salvoes and Israeli air strikes since the 2014 war.</p> \n<p>The skies fell quiet again as the year drew to a close, giving way to ceasefires and mediation efforts, as all sides waited for the Trump administration to unveil its long-expected Middle East peace plan.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Investigations now entangle Donald Trump’s White House, campaign, transition, inauguration, charity and business. For Trump, the political, the personal and the deeply personal are all under examination.</p> \n<p>Less than two years into Trump’s presidency, his business associates, political advisers and family members are being probed, along with the practices of his late father. On Saturday, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke became the fourth Cabinet member to leave under an ethical cloud, having sparked 17 investigations into his actions on the job, by one watchdog’s count.</p> \n<p>Donny Deutsch predicted on MSNBC over the weekend, &quot;What is going to put him in jail eventually... destroy anything he's ever built, and his children, is a 30 year dishonest criminal enterprise. One thing will take him out of the presidency, the other will ruin him forever.&quot;</p> \n<p>All of this with the first special counsel investigation against a president in 20 years hanging over Trump’s head, spinning out charges and strong-arming guilty pleas from underlings while keeping in suspense whether the president — “Individual 1” in prosecutor Robert Mueller’s coded legalese — will end up accused of criminal behavior himself.</p> \n<p>The scope of the scrutiny has shaped Trump’s presidency, proving a steady distraction from his governing agenda. So far, much of it has been launched by federal prosecutors and government watchdogs that eschew partisanship. The intensity is certain to increase next year when Democrats assume control of the House and the subpoena power that comes with it.</p> \n<p>Although Trump dismisses the investigations as politically motivated “witch hunts,” his high-octane Twitter account frequently betrays just how consumed he is by the scrutiny. He’s also said to watch hours of television coverage on milestone days in the investigations.</p> \n<p>“It saps your energy, diverts your attention and you simply can’t lead because your opponents are up in arms against you,” Cal Jillson, a Southern Methodist University political scientist and historian, said of the scrutiny. “It weakens your friends and emboldens your enemies.”</p> \n<p>Almost midway through his term, Trump is struggling to deliver on his central campaign promises. He may end the year without a Republican-led Congress giving him the $5 billion he wants for a border wall. And he’s previewed few legislative priorities for 2019.</p> \n<p>Even if he had, it’s unlikely the new Democratic House majority would have much incentive to help a president weakened by investigations rack up wins as his own re-election campaign approaches.</p> \n<p>Perhaps not since Bill Clinton felt hounded by a “vast wing conspiracy,” as Hillary Clinton put it, has a president been under such duress from investigation.</p> \n<p>This jeopardy has come with Trump’s party in control of Congress and the Justice Department driving at least three separate criminal investigations. They are the Mueller probe looking into possible collusion, obstruction of justice or other wrongdoing in contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia; the New York campaign-finance case involving hush money paid to Trump’s alleged lovers; and now a case from New York, first reported by The Wall Street Journal this past week, examining the finances and operations of Trump’s inaugural committee and whether foreign interests made illegal payments to it.</p> \n<p>Behind those matters is a battery of lawsuits or inquiries from state attorneys general and other parties tied mainly to Trump businesses.</p> \n<p>At best, the investigations are overshadowing what has been positive economic news. At worst, the probes are a threat to the presidency, Trump’s family and his business interests.</p> \n<p>The deep diving will only grow in the new year when Democrats take over the House. They are expected to launch their own investigations and could pursue impeachment, though party leaders caution they could face a political backlash by taking that step.</p> \n<p>Even if Trump avoids impeachment, the Democratic investigations will create headaches. Administration officials will be called to testify before Congress and lawmakers will seek a trove of documents, probably including Trump’s tax returns, which he has refused to make public.</p> \n<p>A bare-bones White House staff may struggle to keep up. A&nbsp;tally&nbsp;by the Brookings Institution finds more than 60 percent of Trump’s top aides have left in the first two years, a turnover rate exceeding the previous five presidents. In addition, 10 Cabinet secretaries have departed, more than Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Clinton lost in two years. The shake-ups now have left Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s budget chief, doing double duty indefinitely as the president’s chief of staff.</p> \n<p>That combination makes it hard to imagine a president effectively engaged in policy, even if — as in the case of Clinton — the drawn-out investigations lead to an impeachment that fails to remove the president.</p> \n<p>“The modern presidency is extraordinarily complex and demanding so you need the president’s full attention,” Jillson says. “Where your attention should be, you’re also thinking about meeting with your lawyers.”</p> \n<p>As the investigations mount, few Republicans have dissociated themselves publicly from Trump. But privately, some lawmakers do worry that the investigations will damage his re-election prospects and their own chances in 2020 House and Senate races.</p> \n<p>The federal campaign finance probe has put GOP lawmakers in a particularly awkward position. Prosecutors — as well as Trump’s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen and a tabloid company that has long been an ally — assert that Trump directed hush payments to keep women quiet about alleged affairs in the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign. Such a payment would violate campaign finance laws. Cohen was sentenced this past week to three years in prison.</p> \n<p>Underscoring the balancing act for Republicans, outgoing Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah initially stated that he didn’t much care about Trump being implicated in Cohen’s crime, then thought better of his words.</p> \n<p>“I made comments about allegations against the president that were irresponsible and a poor reflection on my lengthy record of dedication to the rule of law,” Hatch said in a statement Friday.</p> \n<p>Five people in Trump’s orbit have pleaded guilty to charges in the continuing Mueller probe. Among them, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, for a time in Trump’s presidential campaign. George Papadopoulos, a lower-level campaign adviser, was sentenced to 14 days in prison and is out. The others are Michael Flynn, who was Trump’s first national security adviser in office and is to be sentenced Tuesday, and Cohen, who is expected to begin his sentence in March.</p> \n<p>In addition, the special counsel’s office says Flynn, in giving 19 interviews and turning over a mountain of documents, has assisted in a criminal investigation that has yet to be revealed.</p> \n<p>In other words, there’s no end in sight.</p> \n<p>Trump is also exposed to legal peril beyond that from federal prosecutors. Among the lawsuits or investigations:</p> \n<p>—Democratic attorneys general in Maryland and the District of Columbia and congressional Democrats are challenging the Trump Organization’s business transactions with foreign and state government interests, such as those at his Washington hotel, citing the constitutional ban on presidents taking payments from such sources without congressional consent.</p> \n<p>—Summer Zervos, once a contestant on Trump’s TV show, has sued Trump for defamation for accusing her of lying. She alleged in 2016 that he made unwelcome physical contact with her. He’s failed several times to derail the case.</p> \n<p>—New York tax officials are looking into whether Trump or his charitable foundation misrepresented tax liability. In addition, the New York tax department said it is “vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation” after a New York Times report found Trump and his family, going back to transactions by his father, Fred Trump, cheated on taxes for decades. The report said Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father, much of it through dubious tax maneuvers. Trump called the report “a very old, boring and often told hit piece on me.”</p> \n<p>—New York authorities allege in a lawsuit that Trump illegally tapped his charitable Trump Foundation to settle legal disputes, help his campaign for president and cover personal and business expenses, including the purchase of a life-size portrait of himself for $10,000.</p> \n<p>Stanley Renshon, political scientist at the City University of New York and a psychoanalyst, says all of that adds up to a lot of people, not just the left, “trying to make his presidency untenable.”</p> \n<p>It is, perhaps, vaster than the right-wing “conspiracy” the Clintons endured, Renshon says. “I call it the everybody conspiracy.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>As Nazareth was decked out for Christmas, a group of weavers gathered in the cobblestone alleys of Israel’s largest Arab city, intent on preserving their Palestinian heritage at a time when their communities feel under pressure.</p> \n<p>Above the Christian and Muslim women laying out embroidery stalls, workmen strung seasonal lights onto the Church of St. Gabriel. The church’s underground spring, according to Greek Orthodox tradition, is where Mary was drawing water during the Annunciation - when the angel Gabriel told her she would give birth to Jesus.</p> \n<p>The most common form of embroidery on display was “tatreez”, a centuries-old form of cross-stitch patterns on stretched white canvasses that is practiced in Arab communities throughout Israel, and in Palestinian towns across the West Bank and Gaza.</p> \n<p>“There is a feeling that we, the Palestinian citizens of Israel, are starting to lose our identity, our language, and our heritage,” said Violette Khoury, director of Nasijona, a women’s association holding Christmas workshops to teach embroidery to younger generations.</p> \n<p>“In our schools, children don’t learn these traditions. They don’t learn their history,” Khoury added. “So what we decided to do is to bring the older generation, many of whom were born before Israel, into the workshop to teach traditional works to our young people.”</p> \n<p>Maintaining the ways of their elders is particularly important, the women say, in a year in which many feel their communities have been negatively affected by new Israeli legislation.</p> \n<p>In 2018 Israel passed a “nation-state” law, declaring that only Jews have the right of self-determination in the “historical homeland of the Jewish people” and removing Arabic as an official language alongside Hebrew.</p> \n<p>The law’s advocates say it is largely symbolic, marking the 70th anniversary of the state’s independence. When it passed in July, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told parliament it was a “defining moment in the annals of Zionism and the history of the state of Israel.”</p> \n<p>But critics called the law a racist measure. Many within Israel’s 20 percent Arab minority say their communities face discrimination in areas such as education, health and housing.</p> \n<p>Nazareth is the focal point of Israel’s Arab minority, which comprises mainly descendants of the Palestinians who remained after the 1948 Arab-Jewish war that surrounded the creation of the state of Israel.</p> \n<p>The integration of those who remained in what became Israel - some of whom openly identify as Palestinian - is a subject of debate within the country.</p> \n<p>Nazareth itself becomes an attraction for all communities near Christmas, as the city’s main squares fill up with families and hoards of tourists and pilgrims wanting to see the lighting of the Christmas tree and the seasonal decorations.</p> \n<p>“This tree is a sign of peace. It is a very important event, for Christians and residents of Nazareth and the Galilee region,” said Efaf Touma, president of the Community Council of Nazareth.</p> \n<p>“It symbolizes our presence, that we are still living here.” she said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>&gt;&gt; Israel says fourth Hezbollah attack tunnel found crossing from Lebanon&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Operation enters explosive stage</p> \n<p>Operation Northern Shield, to locate Hezbollah's tunnels under the Lebanese border, is entering its second week. So far the Israel Defense Forces has reported the discovery of three tunnels, and the excavations are continuing at several other sites along the border. This engineering effort is expected to take more than a month, and even then the army will probably have to make changes regarding preparedness at the border fence.</p> \n<p>Benjamin Netanyahu, in his dual role as prime minister and defense minister (among his other ministries), arrived this week for a second visit to the area, where he threatened Hezbollah. (Like when he said in September that if Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah &quot;confronts us, he'll get a crushing blow that he can't even imagine.&quot;)</p> \n<p>But it was clear that the tour was also for domestic consumption. The prime minister is preparing for Israel’s next general election due within a year, and his frequent meetings with officers and soldiers provide an ideal setting for his journey to the ballot box.</p> \n<p>In an article last week on the website Israel Defense, Col. (res.) Pesach Malovany, a former senior official in Military Intelligence, mentions a propaganda film released by Hezbollah in 2014. The organization promised “to free Bi’ina, Deir al-Asad and Majdal Krum,” three Arab villages in the Galilee, and presented an attack plan based on no fewer than 5,000 fighters.</p> \n<p>According to the film, the units would progress in four spearheads, from Nahariya in the west to Misgav Am in the east, with a fifth force in reserve. Cover would be provided by a heavy barrage of rockets launched by Hezbollah at the Galilee.</p> \n<p>Israeli officials at the time dismissed this as mere psychological warfare. Even now it’s hard to imagine how Hezbollah would be able to transfer so many troops, sometimes underground in relatively narrow and short tunnels, without being discovered. Interestingly, the size of the forces that was mentioned is quite similar to the estimated number of fighters in Hezbollah’s Radwan special forces unit. When you add the tunnels that were recently revealed, it’s easier to understand how Hezbollah is thinking about the next battle.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah’s steps are part of a change in Iran’s plans. In recent months Iran’s military intervention in Syria, including the weapons smuggled to Hezbollah in Lebanon, has ebbed due to Russian pressure.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Moscow has pressured Israel to go easy on its air strikes in Syria since the Syrians' accidental downing of a Russian reconnaissance plane in September. This week the Russians finally agreed to receive a military delegation from Israel, headed by the chief of the General Staff Operations Directorate, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, but the IDF is reluctant to state that this signals an end to the crisis.</p> \n<p>Amid the difficulties of operating in Syria, Iran is increasing its efforts in the two neighboring countries. In western Iraq it’s deploying long-range missiles that are capable of striking Israel as well. In Lebanon it’s trying to build factories that will let it improve the precision of Hezbollah’s older rockets. These efforts are accompanied by a dispute regarding the Iranian regime’s priorities for investment, in light of increased sanctions by the United States and a protest by everyday Iranians due to the deteriorating economy.</p> \n<p>Since the discovery of the tunnels, the General Staff has made sure to clarify that despite the media’s preoccupation with the precision-missile project, Hezbollah apparently has only a few dozen high-precision rockets capable of striking less than 50 meters (160 feet) or so from their target.</p> \n<p>The Iranians have yet to achieve the “industrial” capability of a swift conversion to precision missiles in Lebanon. The smuggling of weapons on flights from Iran to Beirut is also being done on a small scale, far smaller than what was tried in the weapons convoys on Syrian soil.</p> \n<p>In the north, 2018 saw a major strategic success of the axis that supported the Assad regime in Syria – a renewed takeover of most of Syrian territory and a restabilization of the government. But the Iranians also suffered failures; one is a slowdown of their efforts to entrench themselves militarily in Syria, because of Israel’s strikes in April and May. The other is the exposure of Hezbollah’s tunnel plan.</p> \n<p>That doesn’t mean that Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds force, will lay down his arms in 2019. Israel must assume that Iran will try to attack it on other fronts. At the moment, it seems this will happen in Lebanon, with the precision-missile factories the main issue.</p> \n<p>If in the future Tehran believes that it has a reason to attack Israel, perhaps due to American efforts to combat Iran's nuclear programs and missiles, it’s hard to believe it will leave Hezbollah out, as it did in the confrontation with Israel in Syria this year.</p> \n<p>In light of the billions that the Iranians have invested in Lebanon, the day will come when they demand that Nasrallah provide a better return for their money. A senior defense official, in a meeting with his European counterparts, recently said that it will be hard to maintain the quiet in Lebanon for another year.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel seeks to leverage op against Hezbollah tunnels to complete Lebanon border wall&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>&quot;We’ll try to neutralize the tunnels and remove them from the equation, but the precision-missile project remains a problem for us,&quot; he reportedly said. &quot;Iran is trying to build a missile system in Iraq and Syria, in addition to the rockets it has already provided to Hezbollah in Lebanon and to Palestinian organizations in Gaza. For us it’s too much; the Iranians have to leave Syria entirely. It’s not enough to keep them 60 or 80 kilometers [50 miles] from the Israeli border.&quot;</p> \n<p>Unprecedented challenge</p> \n<p>The Israeli rhetoric against Iran in the past decade has focused on the nuclear program. But the 2015 nuclear agreement and the lifting of the sanctions against Iran that ensued (some of which were recently renewed when Washington abandoned the agreement) have clarified the progress of Iran’s other efforts: to develop long-range missiles and increase its influence in the region.</p> \n<p>The conventional military threat against Israel has waned with the collapse of the Syrian army and Israel's closer ties with Egypt. On the other hand, the combined, hybrid threat that Iran is developing from many directions and with many means is a challenge Israel hasn't faced in the past.</p> \n<p>Heavy rocket barrages against civilians and strategic infrastructure, an attempt at a land grab on the border, cyberwarfare and electronic warfare, an option of opening a secondary front in Gaza, the big question of how Russia will behave – all these elements appear in the scenarios that the General Staff has practiced in recent years.</p> \n<p>Are the ground forces, which are still partly based on a large contribution by reservists, ready for more extreme scenarios? That's one subject of the debate with the Defense Ministry ombudsman, Maj. Gen. (res.) Yitzhak Brik. Brik isn't being attacked for his ungentlemanly style and sweeping statements, but apparently the public slap in the face by his reports has triggered a positive process of investigations in the IDF and at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.</p> \n<p>When the generals stop feeling offended, the army will discover that it’s not a bad idea to investigate itself occasionally. And the managers of large organizations tend to discover that reality is less glamorous than their high opinion of themselves.</p> \n<p>In the army, opinions about the ground forces are divided. Have the steps by Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot to bring the IDF up to par been sufficient? Some people believe it's lagging by decades. Eisenkot challenged the political leaders in the summer of 2015 when he published documents on IDF strategy; he tried to force the politicians into a deeper discussion on the army and its future.</p> \n<p>In fact, from the few statements by Netanyahu on this question in recent months, it's clear he envisions an army even more dependent on the air force, technology and intelligence. The ground forces, and the reservist system in particular, are liable to remain far behind. The prime minister, in his role as defense minister, will have to find time to discuss these controversies in depth during the first half of the coming year, when Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi takes over as chief of staff.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A Texas school district allegedly fired a children’s speech pathologist because she refused to sign a pledge not to boycott Israel, prompting a First Amendment lawsuit, The Intercept reported on Monday.</p> \n<p>The plaintiff, Bahia Amawi, has worked with developmentally disabled, autistic and speech-impaired pupils for the school district – which includes Austin, Texas – for nine years. The district had hired her on a contract basis in 2009, “to provide assessments and support for school children from the county’s growing Arabic-speaking immigrant community,” according to The Intercept, and renewed her contract annually without incident.</p> \n<p>However, Texas enacted an anti-BDS law in May 2017, prohibiting contracts with companies that boycott Israel. As a result, The Intercept reported, Amawi’s latest contract, provided to her in August, required her to sign a pledge that she “does not currently boycott Israel,” that she “will not boycott Israel during the term of the contract,” and that she shall refrain from any action “that is intended to penalize, inflict economic harm on, or limit commercial relations with Israel, or with a person or entity doing business in Israeli or in an Israel-controlled territory.”</p> \n<p>Amawi, an Austrian-born citizen and mother of four, told The Intercept that she could not “in good conscience” sign the contract. “If I did, I would not only be betraying Palestinians suffering under an occupation that I believe is unjust and thus become complicit in their repression, but I’d also be betraying my fellow Americans by enabling violations of our constitutional rights to free speech and to protest peacefully,” she said.</p> \n<p>She subsequently informed her school district supervisor she would not sign the oath. She said the supervisor tried to find a way around the oath but ultimately told her there was no alternative. If she didn’t sign the oath, the district could not legally pay her. Her refusal meant the termination of her contract.</p> \n<p>“I got my master’s in this field and devoted myself to this work because I always wanted to do service for children,” said Amawi, who believes she is the only qualified Arabic speaker to do her job in the district. “It’s vital that early-age assessments of possible speech impairments or psychological conditions be administered by those who understand the child’s first language,” she told the website.</p> \n<p>The lawsuit, filed with the U.S. District Court in the Western Texas District, argues that the oath violates her First Amendment right of free speech.</p> \n<p>“The Supreme Court has recognized [in Claiborne] that nonviolent boycotts intended to advance civil rights constitute ‘form[s] of speech or conduct that [are] ordinarily entitled to protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments,’” the lawsuit states, referring to a 1982 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that “while states have broad power to regulate economic activities, there is no comparable right to prohibit peaceful political activity such as” boycotts.</p> \n<p>According to The Intercept, the language of the anti-BDS bill is so sweeping that even victims of last year’s Hurricane Harvey were told they had to pledge not to boycott Israel in order to receive disaster relief. The author of the bill, Republican Texas State Rep. Phil King, later said the application of the law to hurricane relief was a “misunderstanding.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The greatest drawback of Marvel Studio’s cinematic universe – relative to the universe in the comic books – is that there’s only one. Marvel’s founder, the late Stan Lee, conceived the idea of creating a fictional world in which characters from different comic books exist in parallel – but he didn’t stop there: The comic books never stopped creating alternative universes that stretched the hero’s boundaries. Some succeeded, some failed, but the attempt was always fascinating – an endless playing field for creative artists with vision.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But in a cinematic universe worth tens of billions of dollars, gambles like that are out of the question. And that is why “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” which creates a new cinematic universe, is better than all the Hollywood animation pictures this year.</p> \n<p>Spider-Man is perhaps the most dominant superhero of popular culture in the 21st century, which has already been marked as the age of the superheroes. He was already there back in 2002 with Tobey Maguire, six years before the creation of Marvel’s film universe. Since then, another five movies bearing his name have been released, and two more actors, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland, have stepped into his shoes. Holland joined the Marvel film universe two years ago with a modest appearance in “Captain America: Civil War.” Last year, he was given his own movie, “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” and next July he will return to the screen with another film in the series, the seventh in 16 years.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Spider-Man’s entry into one universe together with Iron Man and the Hulk was not self-evident. It happened following multiyear negotiations between Marvel Studios and Sony, which has held the rights to Spider-Man, Venom and hundreds more characters since the 1990s, long before Marvel founded a cinematic universe and became the most powerful force, in terms of profit and cultural influence, in Hollywood.</p> \n<p>Now the other side of the deal between Marvel and Sony – in which the latter creates its own Spider-Man universe – is making its debut in movie theaters. It’s a bit difficult to think of the Sony Corporation as an underdog, but in the current world of superheroes, the idea they came up with is almost subversive. Sony has created an alternative universe that’s independent of Marvel’s universe and is wholly devoted to Spider-Man. That is, to more than one Spider-Man, and even more than that.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Three directors are credited in “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” but the driving spirit is that of producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who wrote and directed “The Lego Movie,” among others, and abandoned the production of&nbsp; “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” because they weren’t given enough creative freedom. This time, it looks as though they demanded and got their freedom, and decided to stretch the Spider-Man boundaries in terms of both narrative and form.</p> \n<p>Lord’s point of departure – he conceived the idea for the new movie and wrote the script with one of the three directors, Rodney Rothman (“22 Jump Street”) – is that the secret of Spider-Man’s charm and appeal lies in his being Everyman. There’s a host of Spider-Man heroes in the comic books, but the movies know only Peter Parker.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The hero in the new movie is Miles Morales, an outsider like Parker, but since he is a character born in comic books in 2011 and not in 1962, he’s a bit more suited to the 21st century. Miles is the son of nonwhite parents (black father, Latina mother), and he embodies a broader conception of geekiness. Where Peter likes to take pictures, Miles sprays graffiti in the New York subway.</p> \n<p>The plot gets underway when Miles is bitten by a spider and suddenly becomes aware of his powers. At the same time, he also witnesses a titanic battle between Spider-Man and his archenemy Kingpin. While the villain opens a gate to other dimensions, Miles watches his hero’s bitter demise. Just before he dies, Parker passes the scepter – that is, a memory stick – to Miles so that he will use it to close the gate and save the universes. Miles is not a young man or even a high-schooler like Marvel Studios’ Spider-Man. He’s an ungainly junior-high student who doesn’t know how to control his powers.</p> \n<p>Fortunately for him, the opening of the gate by Kingpin has led to a positive side effect in the form of different variations of Spider-Man from parallel universes. Thus, even as the boy steps into the superhero’s shoes, he gets help from a dimensions-crossing team that includes Peter Parker from another universe, divorced, middle-aged, embittered and potbellied; Spider-Man Noir, a rough-hewn black-and-white version of Spider-Man, more like a 1920s' private dick, his role voiced by Nicolas Cage; the beautiful girl Gwen Stacy, aka Spider-Woman; Peni Parker, a young woman in the spirit of Japan’s anime universe, which includes a telepathic robot; and Spider-Ham, an animal version of Spider-Man who’s illustrated and behaves like a Looney Tunes character.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lord and Miller elegantly leap over the pit of the character’s origin stories, which we’ve already see in too many Spider-Man movies. They don’t back down, but present five versions for every character who came from another dimension, each introduction becoming weirder and shorter, in accordance with the universe, as demonstrated in the way the initial connection is made between Peni Parker and the robot.</p> \n<p>Abstraction and psychedelia</p> \n<p>With two active Spider-Man figures – Peter Parker at Marvel and Miles Morales at Sony – it appears that it’s actually the animated version that presents the more human character of the two. Miles gained fame as the Spider-Man of color, but more interesting is the fact that he’s a boy Spider-Man. The actor Shameik Moore, in a sometimes cracked voice, breathes life into the boy who wants only to behave like an adult. He’s also exceptional in terms of his background.</p> \n<p>In contrast to many superheroes, including Peter Parker, Miles is not an abandoned orphan who’s stuck on the emotional axis between bereavement and revenge. His problem is not an absence of parents, but rather their over-involvement in his life. His father is a police officer, his mother is a nurse, and both are excessively protective of him, and shower him with love, warmth and encouragement to succeed, when all he wants to do is be free of them and feel independent. Miles is a true hero for a new generation, above whom helicopter parents hover.</p> \n<p>The other Spider-Man figures appearing alongside him, at least in part, round off the group in appealing to an older audience, particularly the divorced and neglected Peter Parker (in contrast to the young man who died at the beginning of the movie), who acts as a mentor for Miles and symbolically passes the torch of Spider-Man in the name of a debilitated generation whose strength has shifted from its loins to its potbelly.</p> \n<p>However, the most striking impression the film leaves you with is visual. Lord and Miller, who are known for their ability to pay respect to the heritage without sliding into empty nostalgia, have here outdone themselves. The various incarnations of Spider-Man in the comics since he first appeared 56 years ago, are referenced in multiple allusions. But the true homage lies in the bold animation, which honors decades of illustrators. This is not only a tribute to the comic books, but the most sincere and most successful attempt to make an animated movie look like a comic book that has come to life. Various genres are intermixed, but all of them bear the silhouettes and the framing that characterizes the typical comic-book format.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Because the homage is being paid to diverse artists, the result is eclectic and disturbed, at times bordering on abstraction and psychedelia. The daring of the directors and the screenwriters stands out not only in the fusion of styles, nor even in the departure from the world of images of the superheroes, but in the adoption of chaos as an expression of form. There is a recurring movement toward abstract images, or battles that look logical in comic books but whose like has not been seen before in the movies – or, alternatively, a departure from comics into the works of graffiti, such as Spider-Man’s old-new symbol.</p> \n<p>But it only looks like chaos, because in practice every frame is precisely designed in an attempt to convey the feeling of an autonomous painting. It’s not by chance that in one of the scenes of a collision between dimensions, a passerby wonders whether a peculiar jagged tree is a work by Banksy.</p> \n<p>Contemporary Hollywood is characterized by the studios’ unrelenting effort to replicate the success of Marvel’s cinematic universe. But every imitation to date has imploded already in the first effort, under the weight of the attempt to cram too many unconnected plotlines into the picture. We have seen this in “The Mummy” with Tom Cruise, “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,” with Charlie Hunnam and many other failed attempts. Yet in “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” which actually deals with multiple universes and infinite possibilities, that doesn’t happen. The reason is simple: Lord and Miller are occupied primarily with one character, without digressing into long-term thinking about additional movies.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There’s no doubt at all that the new film is fertile ground for an array of sequels, but the filmmakers prepare the ground organically and ensure that the movie we’re watching now will be enjoyable and satisfying in its own right.</p> \n<p>The new adaptation approaches Spider-Man not as a character but as a myth that has taken hold in the culture. Lord and Miller deconstruct the core of the myth – the Sixties outsider – and reconstruct it for a different era. And as befits that era, there is no longer one figure but a spectrum of figures. After all, anyone can wear the mask.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse” is an animation film that draws on the past without wallowing in nostalgia, and that challenges viewers without toadying to them. It’s a daring move for Hollywood. The result is one of the most successful animation movies to emerge from Hollywood, and one of the best superhero pictures seen on the silver screen.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I’m not a great fan of 3D screenings, but this is one of the few cases where it’s preferable, except in the case of people with weak stomachs.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Yellow Vest protests in Tel Aviv Friday against the high cost of living hadn’t broken up when the Central Bureau of Statistics released its latest inflation report showing that prices fell 0.3% in November.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Seven years after the social-justice protests, the high cost of living remains a frequent topic of discussion in Israel. “Prices are rising,” scream the headlines, but the reality is that the consumer price index, which reflects how prices are moving, has barely budged in recent years.</p> \n<p>Since July 2011, when the protests were underway, the CPI has risen just 3.9%. That's low inflation over an extended period, and many categories of prices have fallen. If the Bank of Israel had managed to keep inflation in the government’s target range (an average of 2% a year), prices would have climbed 15% in the seven years.</p> \n<p>But the CPI doesn’t measure the cost of living. It tells you how much prices have changed for a designated basket of goods and services. It doesn’t tell you how high the cost of living in Israel is compared to other countries, or how high prices are compared to incomes.</p> \n<p>It also tells you nothing about the future direction of prices, while the latest headlines about price rises talk about increases that are about to come. The big increase in electricity and water rates are due to take effect in January, as are higher prices for dairy products and bread. Their impact will only appear in the January CPI published in February.</p> \n<p>Comparing prices in Israel with those abroad tells a different story than the CPI does about the cost of living. The price of the popular dessert Milky costs twice as much in Israel as does the equivalent product in Berlin.</p> \n<p>Online shopping has made it easier for Israelis to compare prices, as has the big increase in Israelis taking holidays abroad. This often makes consumers feel they're being ripped off.</p> \n<p>But that doesn’t mean the comparison is always fair. That’s especially the case in one-on-one comparisons, which don’t necessarily reflect things like product quality, differing incomes between countries and exchange rates.</p> \n<p>To help cope with the problem, economists use purchasing power parity, which looks at the cost to buy a fixed basket of goods and services across different countries. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development publishes comparative price levels monthly, based on consumer spending, inflation and exchange-rate changes.</p> \n<p>For October, the index shows that a basket of goods that would cost 100 shekels ($26.50) would cost 97 shekels in Australia, 84 in Austria, 54 in the Czech Republic and just 32 in Turkey. Only four OECD countries have higher prices by that measure than Israel – Switzerland and Iceland, both at 118 shekels, Norway at 108 and Denmark at 109.</p> \n<p>Exchange rates distort these comparisons; for example, with Turkey, where the lira has collapsed. Moreover, prices among countries vary by product and service. Thus in 2014 OECD figures showed Israel 22% more expensive on average, but some items like apparel and fresh produce were lower in Israel than the OECD average.</p> \n<p>Also, people are bad at estimating their income and outgoings. When the prices of high-profile products and services go up and the media covers it, people tend to perceive it as if all prices were going up.</p> \n<p>Average Israelis are attuned to every change in the price of cottage cheese but not to the price of the table they're eating it on. The price of furniture in Israel has plummeted in recent years, but the modest increase in the prices of dairy products has received far more attention.</p> \n<p>The ability of households to spend isn’t just a matter of prices but also of income, and here the picture is quite clear. There are many ways of calculating household income, but by most of them Israel’s is low by developed-country standards – below that of Western Europe, Scandinavia and North America.</p> \n<p>The good news is that Israeli incomes are rising quickly. Household cash income (before taxes) rose 4.5% in 2017, the median wage for salaried earners last year rose at its fastest pace in 15 years or more, and the minimum wage was lifted twice in 2017 at a time when more Israelis than ever are in the workforce. In fact, pay is rising much faster than consumer prices.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Ministers of the ruling Likud party said on Tuesday that evicting the families of terrorists from their homes is a crucial and efficient move, even in the absence of any proof that they abetted terrorism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This position contrasts that of the attorney general, the head of the Shin Bet security service and the IDF chief of staff, who voiced their objection to the bill before it was approved by the Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Tourism Minister Yavin Levin told Army Radio on Tuesday morning that the issue at stake is political, and an attempt is being made to turn a political argument into a legal issue.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Deterrence? Israel demolishes Palestinian assailant's home – for the&nbsp;third time</p> \n<p>&quot;Israel has no constitution and what may or may not be done is a matter of legislation in the Knesset, not behind closed doors. These people support a terror attack and called on others to follow suit, and people acting this way are full partners in crime,&quot; Levin said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Conversely, Science Minister Ofir Akunis said that in any case, the step in question would be a constitutional one. Following the argument by Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit that the bill would badly harm the right to freedom and property, Akunis said on Kan B&nbsp; radio that the argument that some of the family members are not involved is absurd.</p> \n<p>&quot;There is no such thing as 'not involved,'&quot; Akunis said. &quot;That is simply ridiculous. A family cultivates a murderer, the murderer grew up in a hothouse. This is not collective punishment – you don’t raze the whole village, you demolish the house.&quot;</p> \n<p>Akunis said he holds the officers who oppose the eviction bill in the highest regard, but claimed there are examples that refute their positions. For instance, he noted the family of Hamas official Omar Barghouti, whose son Salah had been suspected of involvement in a terror attack near the settlement of Ofra. Salah Barghouti was killed by counter-terrorism forces last week.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Barghouti family is a family of terrorists,&quot; Akunis said. &quot;These are facts. This family is cultivating generations of murderers and should be expelled.&quot;</p> \n<p>Regarding the terror attack on December 10 in which seven people were wounded, including Shira Ish-Ran, whose child was born prematurely and died three days later, Akunis said that anybody who shoots a pregnant woman in her eighth month &quot;isn't a human being, but a two-legged animal.&quot; He also said that intervention by the court impairs deterrence, a position expressed by other right-wing ministers during a demonstration outside the Prime Minister's Office on Sunday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On Sunday, the Ministerial Committee for Legislation voted in favor of the bill, which would facilitate the expulsion of terrorists' families from their homes to other areas of the West Bank. According to the bill, within seven days from the date of an incident, the IDF central command chief will be able to expel the families of assailants who perpetrate or try to perpetrate a terror attack.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit, however, expressed his concern on Monday about the bill, which is sponsored by Moti Yogev of the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi party, because it would badly impair the constitutional rights of the family members slated for expulsion, such as the right to freedom and the right to property. He might not be able to defend the bill in court, Mendelblit said, adding that the bill could also hurt Israel on the international law front.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Shin Bet chief Nadav Argaman called the law unimplementable and warned that it would boomerang and if anything, hurt Israel's security. Israeli forces can hardly go from house to house, entering the kasbah every day, or Hebron or Nablus, to see who lives where and whether a family returned home, he said. Implementing the law will just exacerbate tensions and could have a negative effect on the ground, Argaman said. People present at the meeting said the discussion was turbulent and Argaman and the ministers had heated exchanges.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for his part, said that expelling the families of terrorists is an efficient tool and added at a Likud meeting that the bill's benefits outweigh the harm. While Netanyahu said he anticipates legal challenges to the bill, he has no doubt as to its efficacy</p>",

        "text":["<p>Many and myriad a solution has been touted for the catastrophes reportedly afflicting bee colonies around the world, spurring fears that the loss of their pollinating powers will lead to massive crop losses.</p> \n<p>The latest wrinkle is to vaccinate the insects against diseases implicated in colony collapse disorder, a method (dubbed PrimeBEE) developed by two scientists in the University of Helsinki, Dalial Freitak and Heli Salmela, and reported by AFP&nbsp;and&nbsp;ZME Science.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There is no consensus about the extent of the problem, or even whether bee colony collapse disorder is a thing, let alone a worsening thing. Some experts claim that declines in world bee populations is a natural fluctuation or that, in any case, it is reversible. The cause of the declining bee populations is variously ascribed to pesticides, geomagnetic disturbances (impairing the bees’ navigation), vampire-like mites, viruses, sunspots (navigation again), bacteria, fungi, climate change, and malnutrition. Or a combination of some or all of these. Some even claim that although there is a problem, its dimensions have been egregiously overstated.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The one thing we’re sure of is that bees are good, certainly since we have abandoned a life of hunting and grubbing for roots in favor of industrial farming. Around a third of the plants people eat require pollination (grains don’t), and while fruit bats and other living beings play their part, bees are estimated to be responsible for about a third of that. No question, the insect is crucial to food security.</p> \n<p>So, whether or not colony collapse is a thing, clearly prevention is worth an ounce of honey. A riot of flower species are being planted or just allowed to grow between European crop fields, to vary the bees’ sources of nectar for the sake of their nutrition; in England, farmers have been planting hedgerows and trees because honey bees prefer them to “just” flowers.</p> \n<p>Scientists have experimented with fighting mite infestations by a method involving exposing the bees to cold (by, er, shutting them in the fridge), while others are monkeying around with rich solutions to augment their feed.</p> \n<p>Some people propose to replace the humbled honeybee with other more robust bee species, bats or whatever. (Robot bees don’t seem to be the answer.) And now Finnish scientists have invented the first-ever vaccines for bees.</p> \n<p>One gets a mental picture of a nimble-fingered scientist armed with an extremely fine needle and infinite patience. But one would be wrong.</p> \n<p>The inoculating chemical is put into a sugar cube that is fed to the queen bee, who passes the immunity onto her offspring. The scientists have begun their testing process with a sugar-coated vaccine against so-called “American foulbrood” – a fatal bacterial condition that actually affects bees around the world. Unhappily for our friends the bees, foulbrood is caused by sporulating bacteria, meaning hardy ones, and it’s highly infectious. It infects and kills bee larvae, not adults, hence the name.</p> \n<p>The bee vaccination technique will take some four to five years to perfect, lead researcher Freitak told AFP.</p> \n<p>Intriguingly, bee vaccination isn’t about injecting an antigen that provokes production of antibodies. Insect immune systems don’t have antibodies, but as the University of Helsinki explains, Freitak had noticed (in moths) that if the parents eat certain bacteria in their food, their offspring show elevated immune responses to that germ. Ultimately, this led to the thought of a delivery system of the vaccination via food. They started with foulbrood because it’s so deadly and infectious. Right now, the technique is being tested for safety, following which commercialization can ensue.</p> \n<p>Also, given that vaccinations do not cause autism in people (with all due respect to the lunatic fringe), there’s no reason to think they cause mental acuity or behavioral issues in bees.</p> \n<p>Although much work remains to be done – including to adapt the technique to a lot more bacteria, fungi and other nasties – as Freitak stated: “If we can save even a small part of the bee population with this invention, I think we have done our good deed and saved the world a little bit.”</p>",

Special Envoy for&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;who steps down on Dec. 31, has tried since January to clinch agreement on the identity of 150 members of a new constitutional committee to revitalise a stalled peace process.</p> \n<p>President Bashar al-Assad's government and the opposition fighting to topple him have each submitted a list of 50 names. But Russia, Iran and Turkey have haggled over the final 50 members from civil society and &quot;independent&quot; backgrounds, diplomats say.</p> \n<p>&quot;The three countries are coming with a proposal for the third list, which has been the heart of the problem,&quot; one diplomat following the negotiations closely told Reuters.</p> \n<p>Turkey and other nations would consider working with Assad if he won a democratic election, Cavusoglu said on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Turkey supports rebels who control part of northwest&nbsp;Syria. A year ago, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan described Assad as a terrorist and said it was impossible for&nbsp;Syrian peacemaking efforts to continue with him.</p> \n<p>Assad, whose forces have reclaimed most of&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;with Russian and Iranian support apart from Idlib, a northwestern province, has clung to power throughout the conflict and is widely seen as being loath to yield power after it ends.</p> \n<p>The Damascus government has previously brushed off U.N.-led efforts to set up a constitutional committee.</p> \n<p>Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, in comments reported by state media on Monday, said it was &quot;early to talk about&quot; the constitutional committee starting work. He blamed attempts at &quot;interference&quot; by Western states for the hold-up in its formation, in addituon to &quot;obstacles&quot; laid by Turkey.</p> \n<p>Syrian authorities have only ever signalled a readiness for &quot;amendments&quot; to the existing constitution and also said these must be put to a referendum.</p> \n<p>De Mistura said at the weekend that the constitutional committee could be a starting point for political progress.</p> \n<p>&quot;It does touch, for instance, on presidential powers, it could and should be touching on how elections are done, on division of power, in other words a big issue,&quot; he said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Russia’s sweeping political disinformation campaign on U.S. social media was more far-reaching than originally thought, with troll farms working to discourage black voters and “blur the lines between reality and fiction” to help elect Donald Trump in 2016, according to reports released Monday by the Senate intelligence committee.</p> \n<p>And the campaign didn’t end with Trump’s ascent to the White House. Troll farms are still working to stoke racial and political passions in America at a time of high political discord.</p> \n<p>The two studies are the most comprehensive picture yet of the Russian interference campaigns on American social media. They add to the portrait investigators have been building since 2017 on Russia’s influence — though Trump has equivocated on whether the interference actually happened.</p> \n<p>Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment on the specifics of the reports.</p> \n<p>The reports were compiled by the cybersecurity firm New Knowledge and by the Computational Propaganda Research Project, a study by researchers at the University of Oxford and Graphika, a social media analysis firm.</p> \n<p>The Oxford report details how Russians broke down their messages to different groups, including discouraging black voters from going to the polls and stoking anger on the right.</p> \n<p>“These campaigns pushed a message that the best way to advance the cause of the African-American community was to boycott the election and focus on other issues instead,” the researchers wrote.</p> \n<p>At the same time, “Messaging to conservative and right-wing voters sought to do three things: repeat patriotic and anti-immigrant slogans; elicit outrage with posts about liberal appeasement of ‘others’ at the expense of US citizens, and encourage them to vote for Trump.”</p> \n<p>The report from New Knowledge says there are still some live accounts tied to the original Internet Research Agency, which was named in an indictment from special counsel Robert Mueller in February for an expansive social media campaign intended to influence the 2016 presidential election. Some of the accounts have a presence on smaller platforms as the major companies have tried to clean up after the Russian activity was discovered.</p> \n<p>“With at least some of the Russian government’s goals achieved in the face of little diplomatic or other pushback, it appears likely that the United States will continue to face Russian interference for the foreseeable future,” the researchers wrote.</p> \n<p>The New Knowledge report says that none of the social media companies turned over complete data sets to Congress and some of them “may have misrepresented or evaded” in testimony about the interference by either intentionally or unintentionally downplaying the scope of the problem.</p> \n<p>The Senate panel has been investigating Russian interference on social media and beyond for almost two years. Intelligence committee Chairman Richard Burr said in a statement that the data shows how aggressively Russia tried to divide Americans by race, religion and ideology and erode trust in institutions.</p> \n<p>“Most troublingly, it shows that these activities have not stopped,” said Burr, a North Carolina Republican.</p> \n<p>One major takeaway from both studies is the breadth of Russian interference that appeared on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook and was not frequently mentioned when its parent company testified on Capitol Hill. The study says that as attention was focused on Facebook and Twitter in 2017, the Russians shifted much of their activity to Instagram.</p> \n<p>The New Knowledge study says that there were 187 million engagements with users on Instagram, while there were 77 million on Facebook.</p> \n<p>“Instagram was a significant front in the IRA’s influence operation, something that Facebook executives appear to have avoided mentioning in congressional testimony,” the researchers wrote. They added that “our assessment is that Instagram is likely to be a key battleground on an ongoing basis.”</p> \n<p>The Russian activity went far beyond the three tech companies that provided information, reaching many smaller sites as well. The New Knowledge report details sophisticated attempts to infiltrate internet games, browser extensions and music apps. The Russians even used social media to encourage users of the game Pokemon Go — which was at peak popularity in the months before the 2016 presidential election — to use politically divisive usernames, for example.</p> \n<p>The report discusses even more unconventional ways that the Russian accounts attempted to connect with Americans and recruit assets, such as merchandise with certain messages, specific follower requests, job offers and even help lines that could encourage people to unknowingly disclose sensitive information to Russia that could later be used against them.</p> \n<p>The Russians’ attempts to influence Americans on social media first became widely public in the fall of 2017. Several months later, Mueller’s indictment laid out a vast, organized Russian effort to sway political opinion. While the social media companies had already detailed some of the efforts, the indictment tied actual people to the operation and named 13 Russians responsible.</p> \n<p>Also notable is the study’s finding that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was favorably treated in posts aimed at both left-leaning and right-leaning users. The New Knowledge report says there were a number of posts expressing support for Assange and Wikileaks, including several in October 2016 just before WikiLeaks released hacked emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign.</p> \n<p>The Oxford study notes that peaks in Internet Research Agency advertising and organic activity — or posts, shares and comments by users — often corresponded with important dates on the U.S. calendar, crises and international events.</p> \n<p>The researchers from Oxford said that organic postings were much more far reaching than advertisements, despite Facebook’s sole focus on ads when the company first announced it had been compromised in 2017.</p> \n<p>Other findings in the studies:</p> \n<p>— During the week of the presidential election, posts directed to right-leaning users aimed to generate anger and suspicion and hinted at voter fraud, while posts targeted to African-Americans largely ignored mentions of the election until the last minute.</p> \n<p>— Establishment figures of both parties, especially Clinton, were universally panned. Even a tag targeted to feminists criticized Clinton and promoted her primary opponent, independent Bernie Sanders;</p> \n<p>— Several posts promoted the Russian agenda in Syria and Syrian President Bashar Assad.</p> \n<p>— IRA’s posts focused on the United States started on Twitter as far back as 2013, and eventually evolved into the multi-platform strategy.</p> \n<p>— Russian activity on Twitter was less organized around themes like race or partisanship but more driven by local and current events and made use of occasional pop culture references.</p> \n<p>— Facebook posts linked to the IRA “reveal a nuanced and deep knowledge of American culture, media, and influencers in each community the IRA targeted.” Certain memes appeared on pages targeted to younger people but not older people. “The IRA was fluent in American trolling culture,” the researchers say.</p>",

        "text":["<p>As the Middle East ushers in 2019, the decade’s ruinous conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Libya and Iraq seem to be winding down after exacting a painful price — many thousands killed, millions uprooted from their homes and entire cities reduced to rubble.</p> \n<p>Yet the potential for unrest remains high, including in countries that escaped civil war after the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, such as Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt. Millions of young people in the region remain locked out of economic and political participation as authoritarian governments fail to tackle soaring youth unemployment and other deep-seated problems.</p> \n<p>“I think 2019 is a very challenging year,” said analyst Amer Sabaileh in Jordan, where weekly rallies against economic policies toppled a prime minister this year and now take aim at his successor.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s policy of siding with one Middle East powerhouse, Saudi Arabia, against its main rival, Iran, has further heightened regional tensions. For now, Tehran seems determined to wait out Trump’s presidency, sticking to its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers despite the U.S. withdrawal and restoration of heavy sanctions.</p> \n<p>In a region where violent conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people, the brutal slaying of one Saudi writer, Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, by Saudi agents has been one of the most significant events of 2018. The killing, for which Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was widely held responsible — including by the Republican-led U.S. Senate — forced a reckoning of Saudi Arabia’s involvement in Yemen’s civil war and a review of the U.S.-Saudi relationship.</p> \n<p>Here’s a look at the Middle East as it heads into 2019.</p> \n<p>CONFLICTS WINDING DOWN</p> \n<p>Yemen’s government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, made some progress with the Iran-linked Houthi rebels toward a U.N.-sponsored peace deal last week, a first after four years of fighting killed at least 60,000 people and pushed the country to the brink of famine. A new round of talks is set for January, with expectations that U.S. pressure on Gulf Arab allies could lead to further de-escalation.</p> \n<p>In Syria, President Bashar Assad, aided by Russia and Iran, crushed a 7-year-old rebellion and the opposition’s dream of ousting him from power. The war is not over, with major fighting still ahead in the rebel-held north. Assad’s inner circle and allied entrepreneurs stand to make a fortune from reconstruction, even if the West won’t contribute in the absence of a political settlement.</p> \n<p>In Iraq, it’s been a year since the government declared victory over the Islamic State group, but challenges remain, including the rebuilding of devastated cities. Rioting against corruption and poor services in the oil-rich southern region of Basra signaled the urgency of addressing Iraq’s economic problems.</p> \n<p>In Libya, rival governments in the east and west have agreed to meet at a national conference in early 2019 to pave the way for a general election. Oil production remains below its pre-2011 levels, and lack of security still prevents major foreign investment or economic growth.</p> \n<p>ECONOMIC TROUBLES AHEAD</p> \n<p>In Iran, hit hard by renewed U.S. sanctions, the currency wildly fluctuated, but the Islamic Republic did not see the same widescale protests that opened the year.</p> \n<p>While the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal ended billion-dollar deals for airplane and car manufacturers, the United States allowed many countries to continue importing Iranian oil for now. That led oil prices to plummet, straining the petrodollar economies of Gulf nations.</p> \n<p>The boycott of Qatar by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates appeared no closer to ending, especially with a last-minute surprise by Doha of pulling Qatar from the Saudi-dominated OPEC oil cartel.</p> \n<p>In Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous country with 100 million people, job creation lags far behind an explosive population growth of more than 2 million per year. Investor confidence is improving, but inflation surpassed targets set by the International Monetary Fund.</p> \n<p>In politically paralyzed Lebanon, decades of mismanagement and corruption are finally catching up, with a debt of $84 billion heightening concerns of impending economic collapse.</p> \n<p>“I wonder what will happen with the rising sense of hopelessness among broad populations,” said Jon Alterman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Will people just put their heads down and be miserable? Or will a sense that there is no public outlet, no media outlet, lead to some sort of explosion, even if it’s not specifically directed toward change?”</p> \n<p>The destructive fallout from Arab Spring uprisings could serve as a deterrent to some.</p> \n<p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT</p> \n<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu started the year with a gift from Trump, who recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and then moved the U.S. Embassy to the city in May. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas froze ties with the U.S. administration, accusing it of pro-Israel bias concerning the most sensitive issue of the conflict, which sputtered along in 2018.</p> \n<p>Israel kept building settlements in the West Bank, the Islamic militant Hamas led mass border marches against a decade-old blockade of the Gaza Strip and lone Palestinian assailants carried out sporadic attacks against Israelis. Dozens were killed in 2018, the vast majority Palestinians.</p> \n<p>A U.S. peace plan, promised by Trump since the beginning of his term, still hasn’t materialized — to the relief of Abbas, who fears any proposal will at best offer a Palestinian mini-state in Gaza, with a small footprint in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>With Israeli elections to be held sometime in 2019, a peace plan that calls for even minimal concessions could tear apart Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition. He might not get to run for re-election if a pair of corruption cases moves forward, after police recommended charges against him.</p> \n<p>U.S. POLICY</p> \n<p>The Trump administration’s staunch support for Saudi Arabia is expected to continue despite the Khashoggi scandal, in part because the alliance with Riyadh serves as a means of pressuring Iran.</p> \n<p>However, Washington lacks a clear Syria policy. Trump has&nbsp;wavered on whether he wants troops to stay in Syria, with what goal, and appears content to cede ground to the Russians.</p> \n<p>In Afghanistan, the administration appointed a special envoy to negotiate a peaceful exit from America’s longest war, but no clear pathway has emerged. Successive presidents have sought to wind down Washington’s presence in Afghanistan, to no avail.</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. President Donald Trump keeps changing his story in the swirling investigations into Russia election interference and hush money payments to women who say they had affairs with him.</p> \n<p>He insists that payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal during the 2016 campaign were “private transactions” and that any crime committed would be the fault of his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, not him. That’s a change from what the president said before. Trump previously had denied knowledge of payments and dismissed any hint of a crime.</p> \n<p>Read more:&nbsp;Trump’s Victory Dance on the Weekly Standard’s Grave Is Obnoxious, Foolish - and Dangerous</p> \n<p>In the special counsel’s probe into contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign, Trump tried to cast doubt on whether his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had lied to the FBI. Flynn in fact pleaded guilty to doing just that.</p> \n<p>Over the past week, Trump also made a flurry of false or unsupported statements about immigration. He said, with no evidence, that migrants are plagued with disease. He asserted that Mexico has in effect agreed to pay for his border wall, even as he threatens a partial government shutdown if Congress doesn’t approve billions of dollars to build it. He twisted federal statistics to claim the recent arrest of 10 terrorists who don’t exist.</p> \n<p>A look at the claims:</p> \n<p>COHEN</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “Remember, Michael Cohen only became a ‘Rat’ after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable &amp; unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY’S OFFICE!” — tweet Sunday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: It was not a break-in. The FBI executed a search warrant obtained from a judge in conducting the raid and seizing records on a variety of matters, among them a $130,000 payment made to porn actress Stormy Daniels by Trump’s lawyer, Cohen. The application for the warrant was approved high in the Justice Department.</p> \n<p>Former FBI director James Comey tweeted in response Sunday that Trump is “lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge.”</p> \n<p>Even Fox News analyst Andrew McCarthy went after Trump for his tweet, McCarthy replied, &quot;Sir, in mobster lingo, a ‘rat’ is a witness who tells prosecutors real incriminating info. Perhaps a different word? Searches of lawyer’s offices common enough that DOJ has a procedure for them. Here it yielded evidence of crimes you said he should be jailed for. You should stop.&quot;</p> \n<p>Conservative media personality Ben Shapiro added, &quot;Please listen to your lawyers and stop tweeting your thoughts on ongoing legal matters.&quot;</p> \n<p>Read more: Michael Cohen Cites Holocaust Survivor Parents to Blast Trump in Quitting RNC</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “I never directed him to do anything wrong. Whatever he did, he did on his own.” — interview Thursday with Fox News.</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law ... many campaign finance lawyers have strongly stated that I did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws, if they even apply, because this was not campaign finance.” — tweets Thursday.</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution,...which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obama’s - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer’s liability if he made a mistake, not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced.” — tweets Dec. 10.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: Whatever the truth, his account is evolving. Trump’s description of the payments as a “simple private transaction” — which he couples with his insistence that “did nothing wrong” with respect to campaign finance laws — is not how he explained it just a few months ago.</p> \n<p>In April, Trump issued a blanket denial that he knew anything about reports of $130,000 in hush-money paid to Daniels, saying reporters would “have to ask Michael Cohen.” A month later, he then acknowledged the payments as a “private contract.” Trump is now saying if something criminal happened, it would be solely Cohen’s fault as his former attorney.</p> \n<p>Both Cohen and American Media Inc., the company that owns the National Enquirer tabloid, say they made hush-money payments to Daniels and McDougal for the purpose of helping Trump’s 2016 White House bid, a campaign finance violation. Both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which the White House denies. Federal prosecutors say the payments were made at Trump’s direction.</p> \n<p>For the payments themselves to be a crime rather than a civil infraction, prosecutors would need to show that Trump knew that what he was doing was wrong when he directed Cohen to pay the women and that he did so with the goal of benefiting his campaign.</p> \n<p>It’s unclear what federal prosecutors in New York will decide to do if they conclude that there is evidence that Trump himself committed a crime. In the meantime, Trump’s changing version of the truth is running head-on into facts agreed to by prosecutors.</p> \n<p>RUSSIA INVESTIGATION</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “Wow, 19,000 Texts between Lisa Page and her lover, Peter S of the FBI, in charge of the Russia Hoax, were just reported as being wiped clean and gone. Such a big story that will never be covered by the Fake News. Witch Hunt!” — tweet Saturday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: The Justice Department’s watchdog, in a report released Thursday, found no evidence the FBI intentionally destroyed text messages of former FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation when they worked for the bureau.</p> \n<p>The inspector general faulted an FBI-wide software failure that has resulted in large portions of FBI text messages not being archived.</p> \n<p>The report examined a gap in messages from December 2016 through May 2017 from the phones of Strzok and Page. The FBI ultimately managed to recover thousands of the messages.</p> \n<p>Some congressional Republicans had suggested the messages were intentionally deleted. The inspector general report said there was no evidence Strzok and Page circumvented protocol. Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation after anti-Trump texts were discovered. He has since been fired. Page resigned.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “Well the FBI said Michael Flynn, a general and a great person, they said he didn’t lie. And Mueller said: ‘Well, maybe he did.’ And now they’re all having a big dispute, so I think it’s a great thing that the judge is looking into that situation. It’s an honor for a lot of terrific people.” — remarks Thursday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: That’s not what the FBI said. And Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, has agreed that he lied to the FBI. He pleaded guilty to it and is to be sentenced this week — the first White House official punished as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing Russia investigation.</p> \n<p>The idea that Flynn didn’t lie to the FBI picked up steam after Republicans on the House intelligence committee issued a report this year that said ex-FBI director James Comey, in a private briefing, told lawmakers that agents who interviewed Flynn “discerned no physical indications of deception” and saw “nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them.” But Comey called that description “garble” in a private interview with House lawmakers this month.</p> \n<p>Comey, in essence, said Flynn was a good liar, having a “natural conversation” with agents, “answered fully their questions, didn’t avoid. That notwithstanding, they concluded he was lying.”</p> \n<p>As for Trump’s comment that the judge is looking into the matter, it’s true U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has asked for documents related to the agents who interviewed Flynn. It’s not clear from Sullivan’s order whether he considers there to be a dispute to resolve or if he just wants to see the underlying documents as he decides Flynn’s sentence.</p> \n<p>BORDER SECURITY</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “The Democrats policy of Child Seperation (sic) on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years.” — tweet Sunday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: Democratic President Barack Obama did not have a separation policy. The Trump administration didn’t, explicitly, either, but that was the effect of his zero tolerance policy, which meant that anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted, even those with few or no previous offences.</p> \n<p>The policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings and their children were separated. In most cases, if the charge took longer than 72 hours to process, which is the longest time that children can be held by Customs and Border Protection, children were sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department. Zero tolerance remains in effect, but Trump signed an executive order June 20 that stopped separations.</p> \n<p>Trump also misrepresents 2014 photos of children in holding cells. They did not involve family separation.</p> \n<p>The photos, taken by The Associated Press during the Obama administration, showed children who came to the border without their parents and were being housed at a Customs and Border Protection center in Nogales, Arizona. The photos were identified as such but wrongly described online as illustrating imprisonment under Trump.</p> \n<p>Read more: Video of Migrant Children With Numbers on Their Arms Goes Viral After 7-year-old Girl Dies in Detention</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “People with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in, and in many — in many cases it’s contagious. They’re pouring into our country. We have to have border security.” — statement in Oval Office meeting Tuesday with Democratic leaders, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: Trump provided no evidence that people coming into the country, including the caravan at the U.S.-Mexico border, are carrying contagious diseases at a higher rate than the U.S. population. Medical screening is part of the process for vetting people who seek asylum.</p> \n<p>A study published this month by the UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health called scares about contagion one of the most pervasive myths about migrants. The&nbsp;study&nbsp;found no evidence that migrants pose a significant public health risk to countries such as the U.S. that have good health systems. In fact, migrants themselves face health threats from arduous journeys, violence along the way, or overcrowding in shelters or camps, the Lancet commission said. While some may come from regions where certain diseases are common, the report noted that international tourism and movement of animals spread illness, too.</p> \n<p>As for the caravan and other migrants from the south, World Bank statistics show Mexico and Central America vaccinate most children against measles, sometimes at a bit higher rate than the U.S. Along the border between Mexico and California, public health departments have long had a system in place to watch for signs of outbreaks of a variety of illnesses, whether they’re immigration-related or not.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way.” — tweet Tuesday.</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “We need border security. People are pouring into our country, including terrorists. We have terrorists. But we caught 10 terrorists. These are over the last very short period of time — 10. These are very serious people.” — statement in Oval Office meeting.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: Trump contradicted himself, declaring the border secure and insecure on the same day. And Trump is wrong about the government recently catching 10 terrorists.</p> \n<p>His statement is a mangling of federal statistics showing that U.S. Customs and Border Protection stopped an average of seven to 10 people a day in the 2017 budget year who were denied entry to the U.S. because they were on a watch list. That average applied to all points of entry, and overwhelmingly from airports, and was not specific to the southern border. The standard for placing someone on the list is reasonable suspicion, a lower bar than the probable cause needed to arrest someone for an alleged crime. The statistics do not show how many might have been arrested or charged with anything.</p> \n<p>In any event, Trump rendered a daily average as 10 recently captured terrorists in the flesh.</p> \n<p>As for border security, U.S. arrests on the Mexican border jumped 78 percent in November from a year earlier to the highest level in Trump’s presidency. Increased arrests indicate that more people are trying to cross the border illegally.</p> \n<p>JOBS</p> \n<p>PELOSI: “We came at a place to say, ‘How do we meet the needs of American people who have needs?’ The economy has — people are losing their jobs.” — Oval Office meeting.</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “Well, we have the lowest unemployment that we’ve had in 50 years.” — Oval Office meeting.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: Trump is correct about jobs.</p> \n<p>There may always be some layoffs even if the economy is strong. General Motors, for instance, said last month it would cut as many as 14,000 workers in North America in a restructuring aimed at generating cash to spend on innovation, even though U.S. auto sales are near historic highs.</p> \n<p>But the U.S. economy has now added jobs for a record 98 straight months, dating to October 2010, during the Obama administration.</p> \n<p>The Labor Department reported the unemployment rate in November stayed at 3.7 percent, a five-decade low, for the third straight month.</p> \n<p>The job gains are pushing down unemployment rates to historically low levels for a variety of groups. The unemployment rate for men aged 20 and above fell last month to 3.3 percent, the lowest in 18 years. The rate for Americans with just high school diplomas dropped to 3.5 percent, the lowest since December 2000. The African-American jobless rate declined to 5.9 percent, matching May’s figure as the lowest on record.</p> \n<p>That’s making it more challenging for businesses to find the workers they need. Employers have posted 7 million open jobs, outnumbering the ranks of the unemployed, which fell last month to just under 6 million.</p> \n<p>THE WALL</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “I often stated, ‘One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.’ This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly &amp; anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!” — tweet Thursday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: This is a face-saving statement to mask the fact that Mexico refused to pay for a U.S. border wall, Trump gave up trying to make it do so and U.S. taxpayers are on the hook for it.</p> \n<p>In essence, Trump is arguing that new terms of trade with Mexico will increase economic growth in the U.S. and produce more tax revenue. That’s what everyone hopes trade agreements will do. As part of that, he hopes for a lower trade deficit with Mexico. Neither outcome is assured.</p> \n<p>The deal negotiated with Mexico and Canada is an update of the North American Free Trade Agreement he railed against, not a transformative pact. The three countries will continue trading in an environment of mainly low or no tariffs, with improvements here and there for all three partners. There is no credible way for Trump to forecast additional growth covering costs that are being charged to U.S. taxpayers if the wall is built. Trade balances depend on too many factors — consumer tastes, exchange rates, overall economic performance, and the choices of thousands of companies among them — and some are well outside any government’s control.</p> \n<p>Trump specifically promised in the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall. That is not the same as trying to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which is about the exchange of goods and services among private entities rather than payments between governments. Nor is a trade deficit necessarily a penalty on consumers. It is the result of consumers buying things made in another country.</p> \n<p>He wants some $25 billion from Congress for wall construction over five years and promises a partial government shutdown if he does not get a $5 billion or so portion in the next week. Congress may or may not give him that. If it does, it will not be because lawmakers expect a refund to the treasury in future years from extra growth produced by a trade deal.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built.” — statement in meeting Tuesday with Pelosi and Schumer.</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built.” We have already built large new sections &amp; fully renovated others, making them like new.” — tweets.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: Tremendous portions of the wall have not been built. Yes, some barrier renovation has happened, but little wall construction has been completed under Trump.</p> \n<p>Congress allocated roughly $1.4 billion in the spring — a bit more than 5 percent of what Trump wanted — for border security and specified that the money was not to be used for construction of the prototype wall sections that stand near San Diego. Instead, the money is to strengthen or replace existing fencing with more secure fencing.</p> \n<p>Altogether, Trump promised in the campaign that he’d build a 1,000-mile (1,600 kilometer-) wall, as high as 40 feet or 12 meters (and have Mexico pay for it, which isn’t happening). If some 650 miles (1,050 km) of existing fencing are considered in the equation, that leaves him with about 350 miles (560 km) of wall to build.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel's efforts against Hezbollah after the discovery of the attack tunnels under the Lebanese border enter the diplomatic sphere Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Israel's claims, which have received U.S. support, will come up in the UN Security Council's periodic briefing on the situation in the Middle East. Israel is trying to leverage military developments – the discovery of the tunnels – to increase the pressure on Hezbollah and the Lebanese government in the international arena.</p> \n<p>On Sunday the Israel Defense Forces announced the discovery of a fourth tunnel. The systematic exposure of the tunnels in two-week-old&nbsp;Operation Northern Shield apparently reflects extensive intelligence information. The impression is that the IDF is working according to a plan and is exposing Hezbollah’s tunnel program step by step.</p> \n<p>This gradual exposure also serves the diplomatic angle. The operation remains in the headlines in Israel, even if the international media’s interest waned once the tunnel phenomenon was no longer new.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'Hezbollah's Operation Barbarossa': How army chief pushed Netanyahu to go after the tunnels&nbsp;■&nbsp;From Lebanon to Iraq: Iran’s new, hybrid threat to Israel&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>Israel is also trying to maintain awareness of the tunnels through visits to the border by Prime Minister&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu, who has already toured there twice, and President Reuven Rivlin, who has been there once.</p> \n<p>At the United Nations, Israel will claim that the digging of tunnels into its territory violated its sovereignty and Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the Second Lebanon War in 2006.</p> \n<p>The Lebanese government, for its part, is protesting Israeli threats against the people of south Lebanon – including a text message to villagers near the newly discovered tunnels – and Israel Air Force flights to take photographs. Israel had hoped that the discovery of the tunnels would convince Washington to impose sanctions on Lebanon and limit U.S. aid to the Lebanese Army, but the Trump administration has signaled that this won't happen.</p> \n<p>On the ground, the engineering work will continue for at least a few more weeks. Military Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot had originally hoped to begin the work before the winter, but the debate in the cabinet on the need for the operation delayed the engineering work. The IDF believes that it might find a few more tunnels along the border.</p> \n<p>The UN Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, has a strong presence at the border, in areas where Israel is operating. The IDF shows every tunnel it exposes to the UN officers. The most sensitive locations are the areas north of the patrol fence that are still under Israeli sovereignty; there’s no physical separation between the sides there. The IDF knows that Lebanese intelligence agents are always there; Hezbollah operatives may be among them.</p> \n<p>Sure enough, on Monday the Lebanese military declared a state of high alert at an area where Lebanese soldiers prevented Israeli soldiers from unrolling a barbed wire fence, according to Lebanese reports and video footage.</p> \n<p>Despite the American support for the Israeli complaints against Hezbollah, it’s doubtful whether Israel’s efforts at the United Nations will yield immediate results. But Netanyahu seems to be aiming at longer-term goals.</p> \n<p>First, Israel is preparing for a public relations battle to halt Iran’s effort to build precision-missile factories for Hezbollah in Lebanon. The tunnels, which betray Hezbollah’s belligerent intentions, make it easier to convey the message on the missile issue as well, which Hezbollah considers even more important. Second, in the background is always the possibility that future tension with Hezbollah – especially surrounding the missile factories – will lead to war.</p> \n<p>In any war, the IDF will resort to unprecedented force in Lebanon in a densely populated civilian area. The current steps are designed to prepare the ground in the international arena to justify the IDF’s operations. Israel won’t receive approval from the international community at any stage, but it considers it important to explain its reasoning and the complex circumstances under which it may have to act.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Arizona’s governor has named Rep. Martha McSally to replace U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl in the U.S. Senate seat that belonged to Sen. John McCain.</p> \n<p>Republican Gov. Doug Ducey announced Tuesday that McSally will take over after Kyl’s resignation becomes effective Dec. 31. McSally last month lost a race for Arizona’s other Senate seat to Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.</p> \n<p>McSally's appointment means that a record number of women will serve in the Senate in the 116th Congress, bringing the total up to 25.</p> \n<p>“With her experience and long record of service, Martha is uniquely qualified to step up and fight for Arizona,” Ducey said in a statement. “I thank her for taking on this significant responsibility and look forward to working with her and Senator-Elect Sinema to get positive things done.”</p> \n<p>McSally will serve until the 2020 election, when voters will elect someone to serve the final two years of McCain’s term.</p> \n<p>Kyl was appointed after McCain’s death from brain cancer in August. He previously served in the Senate for Arizona and had said he would only commit to serving until the end of 2018.</p> \n<p>The appointment puts Arizona back in the political spotlight just a month after Democrats won their first statewide race in a decade. Democrats hope that the state swings again in 2020 and are expected to target it both in the presidential race and the contest for McCain’s seat.</p> \n<p>U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, former astronaut and current gun control advocate Mark Kelly and former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, who left the GOP this year, have all considered running as Democrats for the post.</p> \n<p>The intense interest in the seat was a factor in Ducey’s convoluted decisions. He initially appointed Kyl while the governor himself was campaigning for re-election. By picking Kyl, Ducey dodged tough political decisions that could have complicated his own re-election bid.</p> \n<p>McSally is a two-term congresswoman who was long considered for the Senate by the state’s GOP establishment. The first female combat pilot, McSally once sued the U.S. military so she would not be required to wear a head covering while stationed in the Middle East. She rose to the rank of colonel in the Air Force before entering politics. She got a taste for it through working for Kyl’s office as a national security aide.</p> \n<p>McSally represented a swing district in Tucson that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She carved out a reputation as a moderate who could win tough elections. That went out the window during her Senate campaign this year. She had been critical of President Donald Trump in 2016 but praised him during the midterm election. Facing a primary challenge from her right, McSally embraced a tougher stance on immigration.</p> \n<p>But McSally was unable to defeat Sinema, despite playing up her military record against a Democrat who had once been an anti-war activist. McSally even contended that Sinema committed “treason” for saying she “didn’t care” if an anti-war radio host fought for the Taliban during a 2003 interview.</p> \n<p>Sinema ran as a centrist, peeling away enough moderate Republicans from McSally to win by 2 percentage points. In a post-election memo, McSally strategists argued that she did well in a strong Democratic year and noted that the president never polled above 80 percent support among Arizona Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lobbied for Ducey to select her.</p> \n<p>Still, many Arizona Republicans were disappointed by McSally’s campaign and questioned whether she would be the strongest pick to fill McCain’s seat, especially after she followed Trump’s lead by failing to mention the dying senator’s name during the signing of his last defense bill. That drew public reproaches from McCain’s family.</p> \n<p>The most prominent Democrats cited as possible Senate challengers in 2020 are all men, which gave McSally an advantage. She is the only Arizona Republican female politician with Washington experience to have run statewide recently.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Divisions between the different Women’s March chapters are deepening as the third march approaches, centering around support for anti-Semitic and anti-LGBTQ Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan by three of its national leaders, with at least three local branches either cutting ties or issuing calls against the national group.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The head of the Washington state chapter announced last week that it would disband after the January 19 event. Meanwhile, a former leader of the Michigan state group urged activists to “abstain” from attending marches in Washington D.C. and Detroit funded by the national organization, encouraging them instead to participate in other Michigan marches which are not sponsored by or affiliated with the Women’s March.</p> \n<p>A disclaimer now appears also on the home page of the Women's March Los Angeles, one of the largest in the nation in 2017, which drew celebrities including&nbsp;Barbra Streisand, Kerry Washington, Natalie Portman and Ariana Grande,&nbsp;explicitly distancing itself from the national leadership.</p> \n<p>The statement reads that the Los Angeles chapter &quot;has no affiliation and was never part of the Women's March&quot; and is &quot;its own separate organization, with separate leadership, board and funding. WMLA was the first organization to incorporate under the Women's March name in 2016, with no guidance or input from what is now Women's March, Inc.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Angie Beem, Washington State director for the march, wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday, that: &quot;We have conveyed the message, multiple times, that [the Washington State Women’s March] does not agree nor support [the national organization leadership’s] praise of Farrakhan and all he stands for. We have decided to distance ourselves from Women’s March.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;Farrakhan's hate speech leads to actual abuse of Jews. I just experienced it</p> \n<p>“Because of the events happening at the national level and their refusal to acknowledge and apologize for their anti-Semitic stance, we have decided to dissolve our Women’s March on Washington State organization in order to separate from the national message that is being sent, both from a social justice standpoint and a financial standpoint,” she added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Beem recounted in a December 10 article in Tablet how she pushed for “at least two” of the four co-chairs of the march – Bob Bland, Tamika Mallory, Carmen Perez and Linda Sarsour – to be removed. Beem was one of several local leaders who reportedly expressed deep dissatisfaction with the movement’s leadership. The article contained charges that the national group was not financially transparent and had contracted with Nation of Islam-affiliated organizations for security. It also contained an account of Perez and Mallory allegedly “berating” one of the group’s original organizers, Vanessa Wruble, not only for being white, but also for being Jewish, reportedly telling her, “your people hold all the wealth.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The report added fuel to existing signs of dissatisfaction of many of the original founders and leaders of the Women’s March movement, many of whom – including Teresa Shook, who first conceived of the march – resigned or distanced themselves from the national leadership.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Beem said in her Facebook post she originally joined the Women’s March because she believed it would be “a powerful movement to fight against racism, sexism, and the issues that oppress our marginalized and vulnerable. The four National Team co-chairs have lost sight of that and have allowed their personal biases to cloud our mission and purpose.”</p> \n<p>She said she felt that “continuing to be a part of the Women’s March with the blatant bigotry they display would be breaking a promise. We can’t betray our Jewish community by remaining a part of this organization.”</p> \n<p>Despite the announcement, she said, five individual cities in Washington were still holding 2019 marches and she asked for donations to help make that happen. “After the 2019 event, each city will determine on their own, if they will continue.”</p> \n<p>In Michigan, a letter circulated by a list of signatories calling on activists involved with the march to “reconsider ... involvement with the Women’s March Inc. national organization and its affiliate Women’s March Michigan.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The letter was headed by Sarah Eisenberg, the co-founder of Women's March Michigan, who has since left the group. “As organizations and individuals committed to inclusion and intersectionality, we urge you to use your voice to push for change, either within the national Women’s March Inc. or within Women’s March Michigan. We ask you to abstain from attending January demonstrations organized by these organizations in Washington DC or in Detroit, and to encourage others to do the same.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The march’s leaders, the letter said, “have demonstrated a pattern of repeatedly embracing anti-Semitic and anti-LGBTQ movements and leaders, and refusing to accept responsibility or to be accountable for their own anti-Semitic statements.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Despite the controversy, at least one major feminist group is standing by the Women’s March. Planned Parenthood told the website that it will join the march in fighting &quot;unprecedented attacks on our health and rights from the Trump-Pence administration.”</p> \n<p>Erica Sackin, the group's communications director, said “the Women’s March has become a symbol of our collective resistance to these damaging and discriminatory policies and Planned Parenthood is proud to once again, join our progressive partners for the #WomensWave mobilization to protect and advance the progress we've made as a movement dedicated to equity and justice for all people.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>I often admire Gideon Levy’s columns and their forthright, outspoken courage. I can also see how his countless experiences and the countless events on which he has reported with such justified outrage, and seemed to have had no effect, have perhaps even made him bitter. And even this is actually understandable.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But I found his recent op-ed, I Feel No Sympathy for the Settlers, humanly incomprehensible and - to the deepest possible extent - objectionable.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There is a fundamental difference, which Levy seems to overlook, between no&nbsp;political&nbsp;sympathy for the Settlement Movement – for which I have none either, nada, zilch - and no&nbsp;human sympathy for most of the individual settlers.</p> \n<p>Some settlers live in the West Bank for reasons of ideology, some for economic reasons, some didn't go there of their own accord - spouses, children, teens, young adults who were taken or born and raised there. Most have, or were raised with, political opinions that are not saturated by hate of the Palestinians; some do, of course, embrace execrable hatred.</p> \n<p>But in most cases it is a question of settlers holding different political opinions from us. And for that they putatively deserve to be stabbed in bed in their beds at night, as were three children from the Fogel family in 2011 in Itamar?</p> \n<p>Amjad and Hakim Awad were convicted of murdering Ehud and Ruth Fogel, along with three of their six young children, Yoav, 11, Elad, 4, and Hadas, 3 months old (the infant was decapitated) before fleeing the scene.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whatever mindset was behind was unimaginably monstrous. I have zero sympathy for the political settlement movement - in fact, I bear vehement political hostility to it. But on the human level, my sympathy for innocent civilian victims and their families and loved ones is, well, infinite. Just as my human sympathy for the - many - Palestinian victims in this conflict is, well, also infinite.</p> \n<p>Soon after the attack on the Fogel family at Itamar, Haaretz reported that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas &quot;condemned the murder of five members of a single family in the West Bank settlement of Itamar over the weekend,&quot; telling Israel Radio that it was &quot;a despicable, immoral, and inhuman act. 'A human being is not capable of something like that. Scenes like these - the murder of infants and children and a woman slaughtered - cause any person endowed with humanity to hurt and to cry.'&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In an op-ed, Larry Derfner wrote that the &quot;cold-blooded murder of children cannot be mitigated by anything. It is outside of politics, outside of anything the ‘other side’ does, no matter who the other side is and what he does. When children are murdered, the blame belongs to the murderer, not to any enemy he might have had.&quot; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sara Hirschhorn wrote: “Today, settlers are barely viewed as human beings to many on the left…Believing that all human beings - even those with controversial ideologies - deserve equal protection doesn’t mean one subscribes to ultra-nationalist politics. You are lying to yourself if you say you are a liberal but don’t actually think all peoples are deserving of the same dispensations…</p> \n<p>&quot;It is sheer&nbsp;hypocrisy to decry the death and disenfranchisement of a [Palestinian] population under occupation on a daily basis, while turning a blind (even benevolent) eye to [Palestinian] terrorists who would do the same to their neighbors in their own homes…If we allow human rights to be applicable only to some of history's subjects, we will all have lost our humanity.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That&nbsp;Levy can't even bring himself to make this simple distinction, between the political tragedy and the human tragedy, is&nbsp;beyond my own ability to imagine.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Levy writes: &quot;I have no sympathy for the settlers not even when they are hit by tragedy. A pregnant woman was wounded and her newborn baby died of its wounds&nbsp;- what can be worse than that? Driving on their roads is frightening, the violent opposition to their presence is growing - and I feel no sympathy for their tragedy, nor do I feel any compassion or solidarity.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So please let me say, both with frequent disagreement but also often - at least back in the past - admiration for some of what Levy writes: This is unconditionally inexcusable and unforgivable.</p> \n<p>James Adler holds&nbsp;a Master’s Degree in World Religions from Harvard Divinity School,&nbsp;is a religion cataloger in a university research library and lives in Cambridge, Mass.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Efforts to improve the relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia have been seriously hindered after Riyadh fired two Saudi officials leading the project over suspected involvement in the&nbsp;murder of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>One of the officials, former media adviser to the court&nbsp;Saud al-Qahtani, issued directives to the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;press with the goal of improving Israel's image. The two countries have no diplomatic ties and anti-Israel sentiments are widespread in the kingdom.</p> \n<p>The other official, also a former close aide to&nbsp;Prince Mohammed bin Salman&nbsp;and a subordinate of al-Qahtani, reportedly made several secret trips to Israel to look into&nbsp;employing Israeli surveillance technology, sources familiar with the matter told the Journal. The alleged visits would make&nbsp;former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Assiri&nbsp;the most senior Saudi official to ever set foot in Israel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Is Saudi Arabia repaying Trump for Khashoggi by attacking Linda Sarsour?&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;On Fox News, Kushner ignores the CIA and glosses over Saudi crown prince's connections to Khashoggi murder</p> \n<p>Al-Qahtani, however, &quot;was the key player in all of this,&quot; the report quoted a Saudi official as saying. The former court adviser&nbsp;sought out spyware made by Israeli firm NSO Group&nbsp;and its Luxembourg-based affiliate, Q Cyber Technology, which signed a $55-million deal to sell cyber surveillance tools to Riyadh, the report says.</p> \n<p>A Haaretz investigation&nbsp;revealed in October that NSO negotiated the sale of advanced cyber-attack capabilities&nbsp;with Saudi Arabia, a deal that The Washington Post says was authorized by the Israeli government. NSO said in response that &quot;the company develops products that are sold only to authorized government entities.&quot;</p> \n<p>A month after Haaretz revealed the sale,&nbsp;NSO found itself targeted by a lawsuit&nbsp;launched by Montreal-based Saudi activist Omar Abdulaziz, who claims that the firm's software was used to hack his cellphone in order to track conversations with Khashoggi.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to the Journal, Mossad Director Yossi Cohen held several meetings with Saudi officials over the past year. One of these meetings, facilitated by the U.S., brought together Egyptian, Jordanian and Palestinians intelligence officers in June. Sources also said Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates now &quot;regularly share intelligence of shared threats,&quot; including matters related to Iran.</p> \n<p>The Saudi government has also facilitated business between the two countries, according to the report. People familiar with the process told WSJ special waivers have been issued to Israeli businessmen, so that they may visit the country without using their Israeli passports.</p> \n<p>The mission to forge closer ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which the Journal calls &quot;a secretive U.S.-backed initiative,&quot; has also been impeded by the Saudi crown prince's own alleged role in the murder.</p> \n<p>Citing people familiar with the situation, the report says that the international outcry following the killing hampered the prince's &quot;room to maneuver among prospective rivals and dampened appetite for risky foreign policy endeavors such as the outreach to Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>Prime Minister&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;said last week that while&nbsp;the murder&nbsp;of Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul is &quot;horrific,&quot; it does not outweigh the strategic importance of Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>&quot;What happened in Istanbul is nothing short of horrific. But it’s balanced by the importance of Saudi Arabia and the role it plays in the Middle East,&quot;&nbsp;Netanyahu told foreign reporters at an event in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>&quot;Because if Saudi Arabia would be destabilized, the world, not the Middle East, will be destabilized,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu's response was similar to&nbsp;comments made by U.S. President Donald Trump&nbsp;during an interview to Reuters. &quot;I really hope that people aren't going to suggest that we should not take hundreds of billions of dollars that they're going to siphon off to Russia and to China, primarily those two, instead of giving it to us,&quot; he said, while discussing the murder of Khashoggi.</p> \n<p>&quot;You're talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs. You're talking about huge military and other contracts. I hope that's not going to be a recommendation,&quot; he concluded.</p> \n<p>Turkey&nbsp;accused the United States&nbsp;late November of trying to turn a blind eye to the murder of Khashoggi, and dismissed&nbsp;comments from Trump&nbsp;on the issue as &quot;comic&quot;.</p> \n<p>Turkey’s Foreign Minister&nbsp;Mevlut Cavusoglu&nbsp;said: &quot;This is a humanitarian issue. It concerns a murder. It is not possible to say 'our trade will increase, let's cover this up, let’s ignore it.'&quot;&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here&nbsp;or for early 7AM access via Debut Inbox</p> \n<p>JI EXCLUSIVE —&nbsp;Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) are expected to introduce a Senate resolution today encouraging the United States to formally recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, Jewish Insider has learned.  According to a draft of the resolution:&nbsp;“Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights is critical to Israel’s national security. Israel’s security from attack from Syria and Lebanon cannot be assured without Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. It is in the United States’ national security interest to ensure Israel’s security.”  In the wake of Syria's long-running civil war, the Senate measure also mentions formal recognition as a punitive measure to the Assad regime: “It is in the United States’ national security interest to ensure that the Assad regime faces diplomatic and geopolitical consequences for the killing of civilians, the ethnic cleansing of Syrian Sunnis, and the use of weapons of mass destruction.” [JewishInsider]  BACKSTORY — Since President Reagan’s strong rebuke of Israel’s annexation of the Golan in 1981, consecutive administrations from both political parties have been unwilling to change existing U.S. policy. However, the U.S. has also traditionally abstained from voting on resolutions against Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights at the United Nations, although last month, the Trump administration voted for the first time against a UN resolution that condemned Israel’s occupation of the Golan Heights.  Israel has been lobbying for this move for years. In 2015, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for formal recognition of the Golan Heights by the Obama administration during a visit to the U.S. Senator Cruz,&nbsp;a Republican candidate for President at the time,&nbsp;endorsed Netanyahu’s request in 2016. Netanyahu also raised the issue in his first White House meeting with President Donald Trump in February 2017, and more recently expressed hope that the Trump administration would include recognition as part of broader U.S. policy in Syria.  Former Ambassador Daniel Shapiro emails:&nbsp;“There is no plausible scenario where Israeli-Syrian peace talks will resume, perhaps in our lifetime. The status quo, therefore, strongly reinforces Israel's presence on the Golan Heights. Declarations by the U.S. Senate or the administration will add little to the picture. One thing they may do is put Syrian opposition groups, who are focused on Assad and not on Israel, in the position where they feel they must make statements about Syria regaining the Golan Heights in order to demonstrate their Syrian patriotism. It is less than clear how Israel will benefit from the U.S. sparking this discussion when, at present, no Syrian is talking about it.”  FDD’s Jonathan Schanzer tells us:&nbsp;“Recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan would be consistent with the Trump administration’s overall policy, which has been to strengthen Israeli diplomatic and security positions. As I heard from one senior administration official several months ago, this administration believes that a strong Israel, and an Israel that is confident in its relationship with the United States, is one that will be more inclined to make certain compromises when the time comes.”  “It certainly makes a lot of sense, and I think it’s an important move, because I don’t see the Golan changing hands, really ever at this point, barring some miraculous change in the status quo. The question is how does this fit into the administration’s overall plans for Syria? And more importantly, perhaps, is how does this fit into the administration’s so-called deal of the century? &nbsp;It probably doesn’t have too much of a role in the latter. The former could be interesting right now only because you have an administration that seems like it’s trying to change some policies in Syria.”  IPF’s Michael Koplow: “Ambassador David Friedman knocked back this idea a few months ago when it was raised by MK Yair Lapid and others, and it hasn’t been something that the administration has pushed for in the past, so I’d be surprised if they do so now. Unlike Israel’s presence in the West Bank, there is little to no pressure for Israel to leave the Golan and its sovereignty there is essentially unchallenged and non-controversial. So formally recognizing it may end up being counterproductive by calling attention to an issue that has been quiet. It also runs the risk of heating up southern Syria by baiting Hezbollah and other pro-regime forces into carrying out a response.”  PODCAST PLAYBACK — Howard Wolfson,&nbsp;a Democratic political strategist and senior advisor&nbsp;to Michael Bloomberg, discussed his Jewish&nbsp;upbringing and the rise of global anti-Semitism on The Axe Files podcast with David Axelrod: &quot;There was a lot of conversation in my father's parents' house of the Holocaust&nbsp;and the impact of the Holocaust on their family and the Jewish people as a whole.&nbsp;I have a very early memory of them talking about the Holocaust and what it meant to them.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;They were corresponding with relatives — in the old country if you will — with some frequency. Then all of a sudden the letters stop. That was obviously a pretty telling indication that something terrible was happening and had happened. I sort of felt like there was this life that had been touched by history...&nbsp;These were not people who were congressmen or mayors or presidents, but I think I learned pretty early on that circumstances can really impact what happens to people.&quot;&nbsp;  Axelrod: You commented recently on this surge in anti-Semitic acts here in this country, with Pittsburgh being the most tragic of them. You must see them in the context of history.  Wolfson:&nbsp;&quot;I&nbsp;do. I feel like we're living through history again. Not in ways that we would have necessarily imagined or certainly hoped for. I am enormously hopeful based on the results of the last election. I am worried about the larger set of circumstances that a lot of us find ourselves in and see around us. If you look at the western world, there's a lot of turmoil and a lot of anger, a&nbsp;lot of unrest and tumult. It's a worrisome time.&quot;  Axelrod:&nbsp;You see phrases that you saw in the past about globalists and international bankers and the corrupt media. Some of it has been aimed by&nbsp;the President of the United States at the guy you work for (Mike Bloomberg).  Wolfson:&nbsp;&quot;He actually hasn't been...&nbsp;He's not been overly critical of Mike, but phrases like that have echoes in history and they're not good ones. As I said, I think it's a worrisome time. Having said that, I think that there was a real reaction to a lot of this on the part of the American people in the last midterm election.&quot;&nbsp;  Wolfson on getting over the fear of flying:&nbsp;&quot;The joke that I tell, which I think has some grain of truth to it, is that after Hillary [Clinton] lost in 2008 I was so depressed that I needed to get out of the country and I didn't care whether I lived or died to do it. So I got on a plane to the UK, I was able to take a number of trips there, and somehow just snapped out of it.&quot;&nbsp;  Axelrod:&nbsp;Are you ready to commit yourself to another campaign?  Wolfson:&nbsp;&quot;If Mike [Bloomberg] runs, I will do anything I can that he wants me to do to be helpful to him. So, certainly.&quot;&nbsp;[AxeFiles]  WATCH:&nbsp;Comedian Modi Rosenfeld, known as MODI, roasted former Senator Joe Lieberman at the Commentary Magazine annual fundraiser held on October 8 at the Plaza Hotel in NYC.&nbsp;The dinner was off the record at the time, but Modi posted highlights of his routine from the event yesterday.

Jerry] Nadler, the incoming Judiciary Committee chairman, was in his congressional office. The walls were bare, save some exposed nails. All the pictures and framed bills that once hung on them were piled in a plastic-lined dumpster in the reception area — “Jerry’s bucket of achievements,” Daniel Schwarz, Nadler’s communications director, joked. Nadler was in the process of moving to a space closer to the Judiciary Committee’s offices...&nbsp;The Judiciary Committee is endowed with the authority to start impeachment proceedings against a president... Nadler is thus probably the committee chairman most likely to find himself caught between the expectations of the Democratic base and the political and institutional realities their representatives are now subject to.&quot;  &quot;Still, as he sat in his emptying office, Nadler did not sound like someone eager to lead a potential impeachment. “The fact that you find impeachable offenses and the fact that you think you can prove impeachable offenses,” he said, “doesn’t necessarily mean the offenses rise to the level of importance where you should impeach.” When I spoke to Nadler a couple of weeks later, after federal prosecutors said that Trump directed Michael Cohen to make payments in violation of campaign-finance laws to squelch a sex scandal, he still sounded cautious. “I don’t think things have changed, really,” Nadler said. “We know a little more, but there’s a lot more to know.” [NYTimesMag]  PIC — Incoming Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-MI)&nbsp;visited the Holocaust Memorial Center in Farmington Hills, Michigan yesterday. &quot;So thankful that my brother, Rachid Elabed, introduced me to Rabbi Eli Mayerfeld of the Holocaust Memorial Center,&quot; Tlaib wrote on Instagram. &quot;We met Holocaust survivor Mania Salinger whose granddaughter teaches in&nbsp;#13thDistrictStrong.

This apparent denial came shortly after the Tourism Ministry issued a statement of its own, saying Airbnb had told officials that it would not be implementing its policy — a move the ministry called “a step in the right direction.” [ToI]  — Barak Ravid reports: &quot;An Airbnb delegation arrived secretly in Israel [yesterday] and held talks with the minister of tourism and his aides.

But as Iran’s vice-president for legal affairs she has already secured a rare if symbolic victory over the U.S. on the global stage. After the Trump administration this year withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran, Ms Joneydi filed a lawsuit in co-operation with other ministries against the US at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) — and Iran won.

Booker won’t have that problem (he’s a member of a National Baptist congregation in Newark, and was raised in the AME church), and it may help him not only against white candidates like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden but against fellow senator Kamala Harris, who&nbsp;says&nbsp;she split time between a black Baptist church and a Hindu temple growing up.&quot; [NYMag]  Cory Booker’s Theory of Love — by Franklin Foer:&nbsp;&quot;When I met with Booker this month, he reminded me several times that he had recently returned from New Hampshire. His barely concealed preparations for a presidential run have included the unveiling of large-scale, creative policy proposals that should put to rest any questions about where he resides ideologically... Despite all this aggressive legislation, his tone remains stridently conciliatory. A recurring theme in his speeches is love—or as he once put it, “unreasonable, irrational, impractical&nbsp;love.” [TheAtlantic]</p> \n<p>** Good Tuesday&nbsp;Morning!

TALK OF THE NATION —&nbsp;Alice Walker under fire for praise of 'anti-Semitic' David Icke book — by Luke O'Neil:&nbsp;&quot;The&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;Book Review and Alice Walker have come under criticism for comments the celebrated writer made in an interview with the publication in which she recommended a work by someone accused of anti-Semitism. Asked what books were currently on her nightstand, Walker, the author of The Color Purple, mentioned among others And the Truth Shall Set You Free, by the controversial British figure David Icke...&nbsp;“The book is an unhinged anti-Semitic conspiracy tract written by one of Britain’s most notorious anti-Semites,”&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;Tablet magazine’s Yair Rosenberg...

About 1,000 survivors are thought to be alive today, with about half living in Britain, and the payment is seen as a “symbolic recognition of their suffering,” Claims Conference negotiator Greg Schneider said.” [AP]  LONG READ —&nbsp;What Caf&eacute;s Did for Liberalism — by&nbsp;Adam Gopnik:&nbsp;&quot;Shachar Pinsker’s “A Rich Brew: How Caf&eacute;s Created Modern Jewish Culture” (New York University) might seem, at a glance, like one of those “Bagels of Our Fathers” books that a Leo Rosten could have written back when Jewishness, as a cultural subject, still struck Americans as fresh and mostly funny. The cover shows an appealing pastel of a sunny, amazingly high-ceilinged and arch-filled caf&eacute; in Berlin—a lost Eden of conviviality and conversation.

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – A lawsuit filed by a speech pathologist who reportedly lost her job because she refused to sign an oath saying she will not engage in a boycott of Israel could end up protecting other employees in Texas and have major implications on anti-boycott legislation in the United States, her attorney has told Haaretz.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>John Floyd, representing Bahia Amawi, said he intends to file an injunction with a federal judge in Texas that could halt the enforcement of the law, which prohibits state agencies from working with companies and contractors that boycott Israel. The 18-month-old law is an infringement of the constitutional right to free speech, he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As reported in The Intercept on Monday, Amawi was told she could no longer work in Pflugerville Independent School District, which includes Austin, after she declined to sign a clause in her contract stating that she “does not boycott Israel and will not boycott Israel during the term of this contract.”</p> \n<p>The contract also stipulated that Amawi would not engage in any action “that is intended to penalize, inflict economic harm on, or limit commercial relations with Israel, or with a person or entity doing business in Israel or in an Israel-controlled territory.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When she refused to sign the oath, Amawi lost her job. She had spent the past nine years working with developmentally disabled, autistic and speech-impaired elementary school students in Austin.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Amawi filed a lawsuit against the school district and the state’s attorney on Monday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“She is not a radical person or an activist,” Floyd said. “She is someone who is concerned about children. She is concerned about the way some of the Palestinians have been treated. She could not, in good conscience, sign [the oath] because she wanted to be able to speak about this issue, if she ever had to.”</p> \n<p>Floyd said it is this aspect of the oath that makes the case a free speech issue. “Amawi would not speak about these issues at work or with the children she is working with,” he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“She would never bring this up, she is a professional. It’s not her job and it wouldn’t be appropriate,” he said. “But this has nothing to do with her job or her performance. This law regulates her speech outside her job. The law is prohibiting her political speech in her private life – and that is the problem.”</p> \n<p>The anti BDS-oath is part of legislation enacted in May&nbsp; 2017 by the Texas State Legislature and signed into law two days later by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. It bars contractors working with the state of Texas from supporting a boycott of Israel – yet this is the first reported case of a contractor losing their job for refusing to sign the oath since the law was passed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“It could happen to anyone who receives state funding,” Floyd said. “It could just as easily have happened to someone who is providing the meals to the school or fixing the roads. It can apply to a policeman, a fireman, a public school teacher.</p> \n<p>“We will file an injunction with a federal judge that will halt the enforcement of the law until the case is over,” Floyd added. “We will be asking the federal judge to enjoin both the application of the statute as to Ms. Amawi and to all contractors throughout the state of Texas.”</p> \n<p>It’s still too early to predict how long Amawi’s case might take, although the attorney predicts it might last one to two years. However, the injunction could take place much sooner.</p> \n<p>“This particular litigation is not about someone who has hard feelings or any animosity toward people in Israel,” Floyd said. “Free speech is a cherished democratic value and protected by the constitution. It goes all the way back to the founding of this country.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>A federal judge delayed sentencing on Tuesday for President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael&nbsp;Flynn&nbsp;in a case that stemmed from an investigation of possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia in the run up to the 2016 presidential election.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Flynn's lawyers asked U.S. District Judge&nbsp;Emmet Sullivan for a continuance that would allow&nbsp;Flynn&nbsp;to complete his cooperation in the Russia probe being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. A new sentencing date was not scheduled.</p> \n<p>Even though Flynn walked out a free man due to his extensive cooperation with federal prosecutors, the run-up to his sentencing hearing has exposed raw tensions over an FBI interview in which he lied about his Russian contacts.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: Jared Kushner faces new scrutiny on Israel after Mueller lets Flynn off easy&nbsp;■ Mueller filing: Flynn got in trouble over Israel UN vote and vecame asset for russia probe</p> \n<p>In a stinging rebuke, the judge lashed out at Flynn during his sentencing hearing, saying “I can’t hide my disgust, my disdain” at his crime of lying to the FBI.</p> \n<p>“Arguably you sold your country out,” Sullivan told Flynn in a tongue-lashing that raised the prospect that the judge could send the retired Army lieutenant general to prison, even though prosecutors have recommended against prison time, citing his cooperation in the Russia probe.</p> \n<p>The former Trump national security adviser’s lawyers have suggested that investigators discouraged him from having an attorney present during the January 2017 interview and never informed him it was a crime to lie. Prosecutors shot back, “He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.”</p> \n<p>Flynn, who served as national security adviser for only a few weeks, is to be the first White House official sentenced in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. The hearing is taking place amid escalating legal peril for Trump, who was implicated by federal prosecutors in New York this month in hush-money payments to cover up extramarital affairs. Nearly a half-dozen former aides and advisers — including Flynn — have pleaded guilty or agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.</p> \n<p>President Donald Trump signaled his intense interest in the case with a “Good luck” tweet to Flynn on Tuesday. He added: “Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!”</p> \n<p>Flynn's hearing has resurrected public debate about FBI actions in the case. On Monday evening, the dispute — and a judge’s intervention — led prosecutors to publicly file a&nbsp;redacted copy&nbsp;of the notes from Flynn’s FBI interview that largely bolster the case, showing he told agents things he later said were false.</p> \n<p>Still, the mere insinuation of underhanded tactics has been startling given the seemingly productive relationship between the two sides, and it was especially striking since prosecutors with special counsel Robert Mueller’s office have praised Flynn’s cooperation and recommended against prison time. The defense arguments spurred speculation that Flynn may be trying to get sympathy from Trump or may be playing to a judge known for a zero-tolerance view of government misconduct.</p> \n<p>“It’s an attempt, I think, to perhaps characterize Flynn as a victim or perhaps to make him look sympathetic in the eyes of a judge — and, at the same time, to portray the special counsel in a negative light,” said former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurule, a University of Notre Dame law school professor.</p> \n<p>Until the dueling memos were filed last week, Flynn had cooperated extensively and largely eschewed the aggressive tactics of others involved in the Mueller probe.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors, for instance, have accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate. Another potential target, Jerome Corsi, leaked draft court documents and accused Mueller’s team of bullying him. And George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser recently released from a two-week prison sentence, has lambasted the investigation and publicly claimed that he was set up.</p> \n<p>But then came Flynn’s sentencing memo.</p> \n<p>Although Flynn and his attorneys stopped short of any direct accusations of wrongdoing, but they suggested the FBI, which approached Flynn at the White House just days after Trump’s inauguration, played to his desire to keep the encounter quiet and as a result kept him from involving a lawyer.</p> \n<p>They also insinuated that Flynn deserves credit for not publicly seizing on the fact that FBI officials involved in the investigation later came under scrutiny themselves. Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who contacted Flynn to arrange the interview, was fired this year for what the Justice Department said was a lack of candor over a news media leak. Peter Strzok, one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, was removed from Mueller’s team and later fired for trading anti-Trump texts with another FBI official.</p> \n<p>Mueller’s team has sharply pushed back at any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding that as a high-ranking military officer steeped in national security issues Flynn “knows he should not lie to federal agents.”</p> \n<p>Trump has made no secret that he sees Mueller’s investigation as a “witch hunt” and has continued to lash out at prosecutors he sees as biased against him and those who help them. He’s shown continued sympathy for Flynn, though, calling him a “great person” and asserting erroneously last week that the FBI said he didn’t lie.</p> \n<p>Flynn, who lives in Middletown, Rhode Island, where he and his wife grew up and where they have a deep social network, has not tried to retract his guilty plea, and there’s every indication the sentencing will proceed as scheduled.</p> \n<p>Arun Rao, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Maryland, said the defense memo is striking because it’s “inconsistent” with Flynn’s cooperative stance so far.</p> \n<p>“You also wonder in this very unusual situation,” he said, “whether it is a play for a pardon.”</p> \n<p>Sullivan was the judge in the Justice Department’s botched prosecution of now-deceased Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska. He dismissed the case after prosecutors admitted that they withheld exculpatory evidence, prompting the judge to say that in nearly 25 years on the bench, “I’ve never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I’ve seen in this case.”</p> \n<p>In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last year, Sullivan said the case inspired him to explicitly remind prosecutors in every criminal case before him of their obligation to provide defendants with favorable evidence. He says he has encouraged colleagues to do the same.</p> \n<p>In Flynn’s case, he directed prosecutors to produce FBI records at the center of his case, including portions of the notes from his January 24, 2017, FBI interview.</p> \n<p>The notes, publicly filed Monday evening, show that FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his contacts with Russia, including his past trips to the country and his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, then Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.</p> \n<p>The notes show Flynn told agents he didn’t ask Kislyak not to escalate Russia’s response to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in response to election interference. But Flynn admitted in court papers last year that he did.</p> \n<p>The notes also show Flynn told agents he didn’t ask Kislyak to see if Russia would vote a certain way on a United Nations resolution involving Israeli settlements. But in court papers last year he admitted that he did ask Kislyak to see if Russia would vote against or delay the resolution. Court papers show Flynn made that request at the direction of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Israel Police’s Investigations Department on Monday appealed to the Jerusalem District Court on Monday to crack down on former officer Moshe Cohen, a member of the force’s special patrol unit, who was caught on film beating a Palestinian truck driver last year.</p> \n<p>The punishment meted out to the former policeman by the Jerusalem Magistrates Court was 380 hours of community service and a suspended sentence. The Police Investigations Department is now urging the higher court to sentence the ex-cop to hard time.</p> \n<p>The Police Investigations Department&nbsp;wrote in its statement that while the lower court saw the evidence involving Cohen, the image of the victims of the crime – who should never have been exposed to the “ugly brutality” of an officer in uniform bearing authority – was completely obscured. Cohen's actions, the department added in the complaint about his lenient sentence, taint the entire community of police officers and damages the public's faith in the force.</p> \n<p>“The court erred in failing to take into account the fact that cases of violence by police officers involve normative people without criminal records,” the Police Investigations Department stated. “Ignoring that in favor of considerations of rehabilitation misses the concept of enforcing the law against police officers who went bad.”</p> \n<p>The incident in question occurred in Wadi Joz, in East Jerusalem, in March 2017, and sparked public outrage. Cohen had left his private vehicle in a parking lot there and upon returning, discovered that it had been damaged by a truck. Cohen used police records to track down the Palestinian owner/driver (who later testified that he had left a note on the car with contact information) and attacked him violently. When others tried to intervene, he hit one of them as well.</p> \n<p>Following the incident, Cohen was fired from the police force and stood trial. The Police Investigations Department demanded that he be charged with assault and breach of trust, but he admitted only to assault.</p> \n<p>Despite the fact that Cohen's attack had been caught on video, however, Judge Ilan Sela showed leniency based on the defendant's past record in the military and the Israel Police. The Police Investigations Department demanded a one-and-a-half-year jail term for Cohen but Sela settled for community service.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The other day the Population and Immigration Authority said it was reexamining 1,500 asylum requests by Sudanese from the Darfur, Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile regions. The authority admitted that the interviews it had conducted were “not in-depth enough for making a decision on a request for political asylum,” and that additional material was needed – also considering the great amount of time since these interviews took place.</p> \n<p>This statement shouldn’t be viewed as any soul-searching by the authorities or a change for the better at the Interior Ministry and its Population Authority, which so far have rejected Israel’s commitments to international agreements. This admission of failure and the re-examination of requests are simply another bureaucratic maneuver designed to keep delaying the approval of requests.</p> \n<p>The Population Authority’s statement is another reminder of the incompetence of Israel’s asylum system. The asylum seekers are survivors of attempted genocide, most of whom have been living in Israel with no status for more than a decade. Under an extreme right-wing government whose lust for “national purity” has made it lose its moral compass, the Interior Ministry is failing to meet its commitment and refusing to decide on the asylum requests.</p> \n<p>Israel has approved only one request out of around 3,400 filed by Darfurians. The others remain unanswered; they have been neither rejected nor approved. In 2015 the High Court of Justice sought an explanation from the state on how it could imprison people whose requests were not handled for so long a time, and the state committed to deciding on the requests by February 2016. It did not meet this commitment.</p> \n<p>Since 2016, some 800 asylum seekers from Darfur have been granted a status similar to that of refugees, letting them work and awarding them benefits, as well as the right to leave and return to Israel. In October, Haaretz reported that the government had decided to examine every asylum request. In light of that, the High Court gave the government 45 days to provide a schedule for checking the requests.</p> \n<p>Now, in response to petitions to the court on the state’s lag in meeting this commitment, the government has found a sophisticated way to keep stalling: It will name a team of six people, each of whom will examine a file each day for the next six months. At the same time, it will continue to examine whether any change has occurred in Sudan to allow the deportation of asylum seekers back to their homeland.</p> \n<p>For how long will asylum seekers have to wait without any status? The state has provided no time estimate for handling their requests.</p> \n<p>The High Court must put an end to this farce. Asylum seekers from Darfur have been waiting for years for a decision on their cases. If the state had a legal basis for denying the requests it would have denied them long ago. Instead of dragging its feet and inventing bureaucratic hurdles, it must stop avoiding its commitments and grant all the Darfurians asylum.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz's lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The agreement in principle signed by two Israeli ministers Tuesday marks the advent of a long-awaited reform at the Haifa Port. The accord, approved by Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Transportation Minister Israel Katz, will become a collective labor agreement within the next few months. </p> \n<p>The agreement states that one in five employees will need to choose to depart, at a cost of 2.5 million shekels (about $664,700) per person, and that the port will be sold off in cooperation with the employees and their union. </p> \n<p>In addition, the State of Israel agrees to forgo any dividends from the sale. </p> \n<p>The government aims to privatize the port and sell it to a strategic owner by the second quarter of 2019. The buyer must have experience that will enable the port to improve its volume of activity. </p> \n<p>The Transportation Ministry plans to set detailed criteria for a buyer by May 2019, in consultation with the Histadrut labor federation and the Haifa Port Company. During the first five years after the sale, the port's workers union will have the right to appoint to observers to the board of directors. After five years, the union will be permitted to appoint one observer, who will serve as an external director. </p> \n<p>Protection from collective firing for 10 years after privatization will also be granted to the port workers, among them so-called second-generation employees hired before mid-2017 – especially contract workers – who initially received less lucrative terms of employ than their more senior, first-generation colleagues. This protection does not, however, apply to individual layoffs. </p> \n<p>The agreement also offers workers protection should the port’s business be negatively impacted by increased competition between the years 2021-2027. Currently, most of the employees' salaries comprise bonuses earned per shift. The new reform promises workers minimum bonuses of 70% of their current average wage through 2025, a figure that will be reduced to 60% by 2027. </p> \n<p>The clause in the agreement that encourages employees to depart by choice applies to some 200 of the port’s 1,000 workers between the ages of 50 and 64, with a minimum of 25 years' seniority at the company as of 2024. These employees will not be replaced. In return, their pension payments will be increased by 7.7%, and they will receive vacation pay that covers the number of years remaining until their official retirement date. They will also receive a grant based on their average bonuses. The port expects that the cost of the retirement scheme will be 2.5 million shekels per worker, including pension payments for those under age 67. </p> \n<p>In addition, employees will receive a one-time grant of 50,000 shekels when the port is actually privatized. </p> \n<p>The main source of funding for the agreement is the state's willingness to forgo dividends from the sale of Haifa Port, which will also be partially financed by a future bond sale. </p> \n<p>The Israel Port Authority is slated to start planning a new port in Haifa, West Kishon, that will be capable of handling particularly large ships. The cost will be split between the authority and the Haifa Port. </p> \n<p>News of the agreement sparked anger among workers at the Ashdod Port, who are far from reaching their own agreement with their employers and are concerned that the Haifa terms will be applied to them too. </p> \n<p>“The Haifa Port is being sold for a mess of pottage,” Ashdod employees claimed.</p>",

I know that for sure,” he said, adding that the ministry was now considering if it could adjust and actually reach its target.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The official said the problem was not in tax receipts in the current year, where the shortfall is expected to be between 2 billion and 3 billion shekels. “If we were preparing the 2019 budget now, there wouldn’t be a problem, but we passed it nine months ago and the figures have changed,” the official said.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Kahlon spoke to Haaretz before a meeting of Knesset members of his Kulanu party. “There is no prediction at the moment for the 2019 budget,” he said. “There will be one in the coming weeks. Rest assured, there’s no special problem in collection” of taxes.</p> \n<p>He added: “In 2019 there will be huge investments. There will be exits. I’ve never exceeded the budget even once and I’ve never exceeded the deficit. People are arguing about something that can’t be checked.”</p> \n<p>The Finance Ministry has gone on the offensive in recent days to play down price hikes about to go into effect for electricity, water, municipal taxes and many food products. Kahlon and his director general, Shai Babad, were interviewed Tuesday on Kan Bet public radio and Army Radio.</p> \n<p>In one of the interviews Kahlon said: “The situation of the citizen has improved significantly ....

We won’t move things from one year to another or play with moving taxes up, especially when we know there’s a problem in 2019.”</p>",

They show wide shortfalls regarding children’s needs, though also an improvement in budgeting and the construction of classrooms.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>According to an Education Ministry plan based on the five-year plan for the Bedouin community for 2017 to 2021, these gaps will be closed in the coming years by building 1,204 classrooms and 238 preschools.</p> \n<p>One solution is to provide transportation for children living in unrecognized villages in the regions of Al-Qasum and Neveh Midbar. The Education Ministry has ruled that children under 5 should not have to travel so far as to need such transportation, and that children in general should not have to travel on unpaved roads.</p> \n<p>According to the Knesset report, about 3,700 children between 3 and 4 use the transportation, but Mohammed al-Hib, the head of Bedouin education at the Education Ministry, says the number is actually much lower.</p> \n<p>“There are parents who are interested in transportation to a preschool in another community, but the preschools are full,” he said. “We need cooperation from the regional councils and the Authority for Development and Settlement of the Bedouin in the Negev to let us build additional structures.”</p> \n<p>The Sikkuy Association for the Advancement of Civic Equality recently criticized the fact that Bedouin children had to be driven significant distances to school. Experts on education and child development said this could harm small children in unrecognized villages, as well as the communities’ social fabric.</p> \n<p>Sikkuy calls for the construction of preschools in unrecognized Bedouin villages as well.</p> \n<p>The study also presents the latest figures for high school dropouts in Bedouin communities, where there has been an improvement over the years. The numbers indicate an improvement in the school system in Bedouin areas in the Negev in some aspects. But there are still difficulties, especially low rates of attendance in preschools and in grades 7 to 12.</p> \n<p>For its part, the Education Ministry added that it provides transportation for preschoolers in the permanent Bedouin communities. In the unrecognized villages the ministry allocates portable structures.</p> \n<p>In the past two years, a budget for 97 such structures used for preschools has been allotted, providing a solution for about 70 percent of children 3 and 4, the ministry said, adding that it was now working on catering to the other 30 percent.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The medical cannabis industry is starting to mature. The sector garnered criticism after several companies began trading their shares on the stock market long before they had sales to speak of. At least 12 companies entered the industry.</p> \n<p>Now the trend has shifted. In the past few weeks, companies with years of experience growing medical marijuana and developing new strains are launching on the stock market by merging with publicly traded shell companies. Finally, investors will have a real opportunity to invest in Israel’s medical cannabis market — the one that’s up and operating, not the hopeful future one. Is it a worthwhile investment?</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The cannabis stock frenzy is not unique to Israel. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, companies including Canopy, Aurora and Tilray traded at a combined market cap of $26 billion, as Canada moved toward legalization of marijuana in October. But the shares are extremely volatile and many are tens of percentage points off their highs. Their stock market valuations are completely disconnected from their actual profits.</p> \n<p>Likewise, Israeli funds investing in these North American stocks, managed by Ayalon and IBI, saw as of October their values increase by 50% from their launch, only to have it all wiped out. IBI’s fund is now 8% lower than at its April launch.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to argue with forecasts showing that the markets for both medical and recreational marijuana are expected to grow sharply, given the growing number of countries that are legalizing it to varied extents, the increasing acknowledgement of its medicinal properties and its mounting social acceptance.</p> \n<p>Then there’s the fact that huge companies like Coca-Cola and the maker of Corona beer invested billions of dollars this year in marijuana companies with an eye to developing soft drinks based on CBD, a component of cannabis with medical applications but no psychoactive affects. While it’s hard to quantify the scope of the change, while the North American market for legal marijuana is worth $9.2 billion a year today, Arcview Market Research estimates that international sales will reach $57 billion by 2027.</p> \n<p>Israel’s newest stock market players are Better and Pharmocann, which are merging with the stock market shells WhiteSmoke and Medical, respectively. Both companies have a decade of experience in Israel’s medical marijuana industry. Better has a market cap of 36 million shekels ($9.575 million) — up 48% for the year and currently 17% below its peak valuation; Pharmocann, with a valuation of 38 million shekels, is up 345% for the year and is 6% off its top share price.</p> \n<p>And then there’s Panaxia Pharmaceutical Industries, which is merging with the stock market skeleton Herodium Investments. Panaxia manufactures a range of products from marijuana, one of just two Israeli companies with the necessary processing facilities. As a result, most of the other Israeli companies in the field are likely to be Panaxia clients. It has a market valuation of 37 million shekels, is up 112% for the year, and is currently priced 8% under its peak.</p> \n<p>The biggest and best known company in the field is Intercure. Its current valuation is 420 million shekels, up 1,270% for the year, and is currently 7.5% off its top price. It is notable for having former Prime Minister Ehud Barak as chairman. Its current sales are based on Canndoc, a small company it bought out with 6.2 million shekels in revenues as of 2017 and 600,000 in profits. Intercure says it seeks to expand into 10 other countries.</p> \n<p>Another player in the field is Breath of Life Pharma, whose investors include the owner of local drugstore-chain giant Super Pharm, and which owns the country’s second marijuana processing plant. Last year it had revenues of 10.8 million shekels and losses of 17 million shekels.</p> \n<p>Four out of Israel’s eight active medical marijuana companies are slated to be publicly traded.</p> \n<p>Yet despite the rosy forecasts for the medical marijuana industry, this doesn’t mean anything for the shares of any specific Israeli company.</p> \n<p>Investors are right to regard the industry with some caution. One of the better known players, Together, reached a market cap of half a million shekels this year, and released dozens of announcements to the stock exchange regarding its plans to grow marijuana and its agreements in foreign countries, but is still yet to plant its first plant. Its market cap is currently 250 million shekels, 68% off its peak but still up 283% for the year. Mediway, another company that tried to ride the trend, also is yet to show any actual progress, and even its research and development contract with High Pharma was recently canceled. The company is still trading at a market cap of 115 million shekels, up 100% for the year but down 49% from its peak.</p> \n<p>As for the companies with actual operations, the two big questions at the moment are whether they’ll receive export permits, and what the local market will look like following a Health Ministry reform. A reform scheduled for April would see the companies competing against each other over a local market that, while growing, is still relatively small. Current demand is for 10 tons of medical marijuana a year — some 33 grams a month for each of some 28,000 patients. Patients pay growers 370 shekels a month, regardless of how much they consume.</p> \n<p>Israel has been considered a medical marijuana powerhouse for years, yet the government has been hesitant to approve exports, possibly due to fears of being perceived as an exporter of arms and drugs. For months, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been deciding not to decide whether approve medical marijuana exports, despite professional opinions calling on him to do so. As a result, Israel has missed out on major international tenders issued by hospitals, research institutes and companies. But market players say the ministry reform will give Israel particularly advanced regulation in the field.</p> \n<p>For the local players, export approval will mean significantly higher share prices; being limited to the local market will significantly limit the companies’ value. That said, the timing of export approval is far from certain.</p> \n<p>While a few companies have hinted at foreign operations to bypass the need for local export approval, these statements should be regarded with some skepticism. These countries already have major companies in the field, and local consumers are likely to look for the best-known brands. The Israeli companies seem to think Israel’s “startup nation” reputation will be enough to make them global players in the field. In practice, there’s no way of knowing how much demand they’ll find abroad, once all the necessary regulatory approvals come through.</p> \n<p>The market is likely to expand, but given the risks and the high prices of some of the shares, randomly choosing a medical marijuana company to invest in is likely to be a risky strategy. Ultimately, the companies’ valuations will need to be on par with their earnings.</p>",

        "text":["<p>For decades Israelis have ignored the advantages to be gained from terror. Naivete, not to say stupidity, makes dwellers on the west side of the Green Line think they’re obligated to observe the construction laws, get the runaround from local building committees, carefully check the National Master Plan, receive building permits and build in accordance with those permits. They believe that’s how a law-abiding country works.</p> \n<p>All this time there has been a marvelous solution to the housing problem, a fast track to bypassing the red tape and even the financial loss suffered by most home buyers. Around the corner live other Jews, but smarter, who know how to exploit their government’s moments of insanity and use terror to their advantage. They’ve discovered the joy of terror.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Zionism as a form of toxic masculinity&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;'A family cultivates a murderer': Likud ministers back bill to expel terrorists' families&nbsp;■&nbsp;Legalizing outposts: Netanyahu's ministers try to profit from West Bank attacks&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>Their plan could be called the National Master Plan-Suitable Zionist Response, or TAMA-TATZA, to use the Hebrew acronym. It received formal approval this week when the government approved the draft of a bill to authorize illegal outposts in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>According to this illegal juggling, the government would have to authorize 60 illegal outposts within two years. During that period it would provide infrastructure, public buildings and budgets. Lawsuits by Palestinian landowners would be rejected and enforcement against illegal construction would be frozen.</p> \n<p>The attorney general can scream and shout, but who’ll dare confront a community that redeems its sorrow and bereavement with plots of land, and who’ll stand in the way of people striving to be named the worthiest settlers? The law, as Israelis are discovering, is meant only for those who obey it.</p> \n<p>But why be angry? It’s better to learn from the experts and imitate success. If this good government is willing to approve construction offenses, maybe all that’s needed is to order up a few terror attacks in Tel Aviv or Afula and then demand a TAMA-TATZA permit in those cities.</p> \n<p>Are there development issues in Petah Tikva? A long delay of an urban renewal project in south Tel Aviv? A shortage of public housing in Hadera? Two or three precision terror attacks will get the bulldozers moving and shake up the lazy municipalities. What works in the state of the territories should work in Israel too. An equal law for all Zionists, including an equal right to violate the law.</p> \n<p>But in reality this right, alas, distinguishes between different types of terror. You can ask Israelis near Gaza how long they waited for the government to build safe rooms in their homes and install mobile shelters outdoors. And when will they receive compensation for the burning of their fields and the destruction of their homes?</p> \n<p>Just let someone from Sderot try to build a house or even a storage shed without a permit after a missile strike; let’s see him use the “suitable Zionist response” argument to remove the inspectors and cops who come to demolish the illegal structure. But in the land of unlimited opportunities, in the no-man’s-land that relies on divine law, everything is permitted.</p> \n<p>The legal criminality that the government invented in honor of the settlers isn’t only an issue between the right and the left, it’s an unbridled attack on the rule of law, the undermining of Palestinian landowners’ right to appeal at the High Court, and the destruction of the planning and building system. And mainly, it turns terror into a real estate perk for lawbreaking extortionists. Here lie the prevarication and the throwing of sand in the eyes of those who believe in the rule of law.</p> \n<p>The “Zionist response” as a reaction to terror means that approving the outposts is an act of revenge. It has nothing to do with security. There’s no war on terror here but a translation of murder into institutionalized terror against the law.</p> \n<p>Anyone who makes accusations that distinguish between blood and blood, between the murder of a settler and the murder of an Israeli in Israel proper, can’t help but look at the bottom line as well. In the West Bank, terror is good for the Jews. In Israel it’s just a security problem.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Zionist Union announced Tuesday that it will support a bill to annul the so-called nation-state law. The move came just hours after the Haaretz Hebrew edition reported that the party had decided to vote against the draft law. The party had initially said the law, whose full name is the Basic Law on Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People, should be amended, not annulled.</p> \n<p>The bill calling for the law’s dissolution has symbolic significance only, and does not have the power to abolish the legislation. A preliminary vote on the draft law is scheduled in the Knesset Wednesday.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Basic Law or basically a disaster? Israel’s nation-state law controversy explained</p> \n<p>“The nation-state law in its current form is a bad law and we oppose it,” the Zionist Union said in a statement Tuesday. “We therefore support the bill to annul it. At the same time, the party is proposing to lead a series of laws that are aligned with the principles of [Israel’s] Declaration of Independence, [for Israel that is] a Jewish and democratic state. Tomorrow the party will lead the bill to add the principle of equality to the law.” The statement added that the Zionist Union Knesset members had recently discussed and approved such a bill.</p> \n<p>As a Basic Law, the nation-state law carries constitutional weight. It was widely supported by the right-wing parties in the coalition, which will not allow it to be annulled. The opposition Zionist Union and Yesh Atid parties worked hard to prevent its passage, and voted against it in its two final readings in the Knesset in July. Among its controversial clauses is one that states that Israel is the historical homeland of the Jewish people, which has a unique right to national self-determination here. Another contentious clause says that Hebrew is the only official language in Israel, and Arabic was defined as having special status.</p> \n<p>Zionist Union MKs have been wrestling with whether to support the annulment bill, fearing that they could be seen as objecting to the definition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>The party said in a statement Tuesday that Zionist Union MK Miki Rosenthal will submit a bill adding the principle of equality to the nation-state law on Wednesday. “The acceptance of this amendment will assure the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with full equal rights for its citizens, and that is precisely the ideology of the Zionist Union,” the statement said.</p> \n<p>Two parallel bills to annul the nation-state law are up for a vote on Wednesday, one by MK Mossi Raz and his Meretz colleagues and the other by MK Yousef Jabareen of the Joint List. A third bill, drawn up by Zionist Union MKs Merav Michaeli, Yossi Yonah and Yael Cohen Paran, will not be submitted for now.

Don’t the MKs have a political and moral backbone? Either they’re in favor of the superiority of the Jewish people in the nation-state law, or they’re in favor of equality.”</p> \n<p>Raz criticized the leadership of the Zionist Union and Yesh Atid. He said their leaders, MKs Tzipi Livni and Yair Lapid, respectively, do not understand the role of the opposition.</p> \n<p>“Only a few months ago the heads of the Zionist Union and Yesh Atid fought this law. Opposition chairwoman Livni said the framers of the law had forgotten the Declaration of Independence, and Yesh Atid’s chairman rightly said it was intended to insult citizens. But apparently the centrist parties change their opinions like socks, because this week they intend to oppose a bill to annul the law,” Raz said.</p> \n<p>“Perhaps it’s a lack of backbone, perhaps it’s amnesia, but we should remind them: The nation-state law is in opposition to the Declaration of Independence and it insults citizens. Not only does it insult non-Jewish citizens, but also anyone to whom democracy in Israel is important,” Raz added.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Half the women in Israel who applied to abortion committees in 2016 claimed they were not married to the man who impregnated them, the Central Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Some nine percent of pregnancies in Israel are aborted intentionally. In 2016, 18,032 women applied to their local termination of pregnancy committee, as required to obtain approval for an abortion. Of these, 92.3 percent were approved.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The central bureau’s figures allow an updated look at the sensitive process for women facing these committees, in a country that reveres childbirth to the point of deeming it necessary to intervene personally in women’s lives.</p> \n<p>Pregnancy out of wedlock is the only one of four circumstances in which abortion can be approved without a physical examination. While it eliminates the need for invasive exams or having to provide medical records, it comes at the price of being tagged as unfaithful.</p> \n<p>It’s difficult to prove, but one can cautiously presume that some of the 9,000 women who had abortions two years ago used the out-of-wedlock clause as a pragmatic way to end an unwanted pregnancy.</p> \n<p>Facing an official board of strangers to declare you’ve been impregnated by someone other than your spouse is certainly an uncomfortable position to be in.</p> \n<p>Among Jewish applicants, 53.9 percent use this clause, while among Muslims it is 27.8 percent. An additional 9.1 percent of all women use the age clause — women younger than 17 or over 40 can automatically qualify for an abortion.</p> \n<p>“The rules and criteria have created a distorted reality that forces women to face an official committee and lie,” Dr. Adi Niv-Yagoda, an attorney specializing in medical law and health policy, said.</p> \n<p>“The law provides for a draconian and unreasonable arrangement that creates the need to lie in order for a woman to have the right to autonomy over her own body.</p> \n<p>“Given the rate of permits the committees give for ending pregnancies it’s clear that the committees for terminating pregnancies have become ‘committees of deceit” and that they deal a blow to women’s basic rights,” Niv-Yagoda said.</p> \n<p>He said the use of the out-of-wedlock clause can have legal repercussions as well.</p> \n<p>“If a woman declares her pregnancy is out of wedlock, in the future this can be used against her in divorce proceedings,” he said.</p> \n<p>An additional 20.7 percent of applicants cite danger to their own health, while 20.5 percent point to a high risk of birth defects as their reasons for wanting to abort.</p> \n<p>In recent decades there has been a decline in applications to the abortions approval committee. In 1988 there were 15 applicants per 100 pregnancies, and in 1998 there were 13 per 100.</p> \n<p>By 2008 the figure dropped to 11 per 100 and today it stands at 9. The reasons for this the advances in prenatal examinations and the improved ability to intervene medically in instances where this was more difficult to do in the past.</p> \n<p>Of women who sought abortions in 2016, 47.7 percent — were under 30, while 11.7 percent were at least 40 year old. 9.1 percent —1,632 applicants — were below the age of 19.</p> \n<p>Of the total, 86 percent sought abortions during the first trimester. Some 30 percent of applicants had previously terminated a pregnancy.</p>",

The viciousness, toxic partisan anger, intellectual dishonesty, motive-questioning and sexism are at all-time highs, with no end in sight.&quot;</p> \n<p>And yet ... how is it not possible to also love a website that lets its users poke fun at the high and mighty in near-real time and prick the most pompous of pricks.</p> \n<p>The best example of that in 2018 came when conservative commentator Ann Coulter tweeted &quot;Kansas is dead to me&quot; after the midterm results came in,&nbsp;with Ken Reid shooting back: &quot;Come on Ann, you've hated Kansas since it dropped a house on your sister.&quot;</p> \n<p>Trump has continued to dominate the Twittersphere, of course, having tweeted an average of about 11-12 times a day over the past decade to his 56.3 million followers (at least seven of whom are not actually journalists or diplomats forced to read his missives).</p> \n<p>Here are some of the best Trump takedowns of the past year&nbsp;– an honor for which the competition was fierce&nbsp;...</p> \n<p>But it wasn't just the president in the firing line. Oh no. His family were also&nbsp;prime targets for some of Twitter's cruelest jibes:</p> \n<p>And if it weren't Trump or his immediate family, there was also the Trump White House to attack, like when &quot;Anonymous&quot; wrote an op-ed in the New York Times in September, calling themselves a member of the resistance:</p> \n<p>Then there were the Putin-Trump tweets in which the U.S. leader was guilty by association (and a few more things besides):</p> \n<p>Believe it or not, a member of the Trump family wasn't the subject of every single tweet sent in 2018. In fact, some huge news stories actually originated on Twitter.</p> \n<p>Like the shitstorm when Roseanne Barr tweeted in May&nbsp;that former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett&nbsp;looked like the &quot;Muslim Brotherhood and 'Planet of the Apes' had a baby.&quot;</p> \n<p>She then compounded her racist nonsense by partly blaming the sedative Ambien for her tweet – leading to possibly the best response of the year by the drug's maker, Sanofi:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Naturally, other Twitter users were not shy to weigh in on the controversy, which saw the actress fired from her job on ABC sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot;...</p> \n<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't safe from Twitter's scorn either (as opposed to his son Yair, who was responsible for some of it). After Bibi staged an elaborate press conference at the end of April to reveal Israel's capture of hundreds of files allegedly related to the Iranian nuclear program, tweeters leaped into action:</p> \n<p>Mind you, even the Israeli Embassy in Washington couldn't help throwing shade on the Iranians, posting this tweet:</p> \n<p>Some events seemed as if they were made for Twitter&nbsp;– like the British royal wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May:</p> \n<p>And even events that didn't seem ready-made for Twitter still generated tweets. For example, jokes about gun control, voter supression and, er, photobombing Mitch McConnell.</p> \n<p>Even the Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearing for Trump’s controversial Supreme Court pick, Brett Kavanaugh, proved an unlikely source of inspiration:</p> \n<p>Then there's Jewish Twitter, or (((Jewish Twitter))) as it is never known. Stand-up comedian Zack Bornstein is one of the funniest tweeters you should be following...</p> \n<p>...and while you're at it, Bess Kalb and Jess Dweck should be on your digital radar too:</p> \n<p>In Britain, meanwhile, comedian-actor David Schneider is brilliant on, among other things, Brexit – demonstrating yet again that anger and despair are the ingredients behind most of the funniest posts on Twitter.</p> \n<p>Finally, this late entry could actually be the most LOL tweet of the year&nbsp;– the U.S. president complaining about Twitter's anti-GOP bias:</p>",

So far, the show’s biggest advertisers appear to be sticking with him and his prime-time show, “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”</p> \n<p>Carlson said last Thursday that there’s pressure from “our leaders” to accept immigrants “even if it makes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided.” He added Monday that in the Southwest, “thanks to illegal immigration, huge swaths of the region are covered with garbage and waste that degrade the soil and kill wildlife.”</p> \n<p>Read more:&nbsp;Trump’s Victory Dance on the Weekly Standard’s Grave Is Obnoxious, Foolish - and Dangerous |&nbsp;Fox's Tucker Carlson: Why Is Congress Paying for Walls in Israel, but Not the U.S.</p> \n<p>The comments caused a furor on social media. Several advertisers, including the IHOP restaurant chain, personal finance website NerdWallet and Pacific Life insurance, have pulled advertising from the show. (NerdWallet is a content partner of The Associated Press.) SmileDirectClub said it is working with its ad buyers to stop running ads during any political opinion shows.</p> \n<p>“As a company, we strongly disagree with Mr. Carlson’s statements,” Pacific Life said in a tweet Thursday. “Our customer base and our workforce reflect the diversity of our great nation, something we take great pride in.”</p> \n<p>IHOP spokeswoman Stephanie Peterson said the chain continually evaluates ad placements to make sure they align with the company’s values of “welcoming all folks from all backgrounds and beliefs.” She said the company will continue to advertise on other Fox News programs.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, Laura Ingraham&nbsp;lost some advertisers&nbsp;after she made negative comments about Florida school shooting survivor David Hogg. And last year, Bill O’Reilly saw&nbsp;advertisers abandon him&nbsp;following reports of sexual-misconduct complaints against him; he left the network shortly afterward.</p> \n<p>Fox News Channel said in a statement that “left wing advocacy groups” were using social media to “stifle free speech.” The network said it “continues to stand by and work with our advertisers through these unfortunate and unnecessary distractions.” Later on Tuesday, Fox issued another statement saying it won’t allow Carlson to be “censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts.” Fox added that all advertisers have switched their ads to other shows, so no revenue was lost.</p> \n<p>Carlson said he would not back down to criticism.</p> \n<p>“We’re not intimidated,”&nbsp;he wrote&nbsp;. “We plan to try to say what’s true until the last day. And the truth is, unregulated mass immigration has badly hurt this country’s natural landscape.”</p> \n<p>Most of Carlson’s biggest advertisers are sticking with the show or staying mum.</p> \n<p>MyPillow, which makes pillows and mattress toppers, has no plans to leave. It’s the show’s biggest advertiser in terms of dollars spent, according to Kantar Media.</p> \n<p>“I make all of my advertising decisions based on what is best for MyPillow, my customers and my employees,” MyPillow inventor and CEO Mike Lindell said in a statement Tuesday.</p> \n<p>The number five top advertiser, AstraZeneca, said it would “continue to assess our advertising purchases regarding the heightened attention surrounding this matter,” but did not announce any action.</p> \n<p>The other top three advertisers, Rosland Capital, a precious metals asset firm, and weight-loss companies Jenny Craig and Nutrisystem, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p> \n<p>Allen Adamson, co-founder of brand consultancy Metaforce, said Tucker’s comments, “while damaging in short term, will be supplanted by some other news event. No matter how polarizing your comments are, if you wait long enough someone else will say something more polarizing and take limelight away.”</p> \n<p>And advertisers often come back once the controversy dies down. In a statement, NerdWallet said it is pulling ads “at this time and will be reevaluating any ongoing advertising on this program.”</p> \n<p>Jeff Greenfield, co-founder of marketing measurement firm C3metrics, said these types of controversies are “usually short term” and amount to little more than a slap on the wrist. He said shows “don’t feel it unless you permanently pull spending, and most people are not going to do that.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON - The American Civil Liberties Union announced on Wednesday that it has filed a legal challenge against a law in Texas that prohibits state contractors from boycotting Israel or its settlements in the West Bank. The lawsuit was filed by the organization on behalf of four Texas citizens who had either lost their jobs because of the law, or were “forced” to sign it against their beliefs in order not to lose their income.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The ACLU claims that the anti-boycott law in Texas, which went into effect last year, violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. An attorney for the organization explained on Wednesday that “whatever you may think about boycotts of Israel, the bottom line is that political boycotts are a legitimate form of nonviolent protest. The state cannot use the contracting process as an ideological litmus test or to tell people what kind of causes they may or may not support.” The ACLU does not take a position on boycotts of Israel, but it supports the principle that politically motivated boycotts are a protected form of speech.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;WATCH:&nbsp;Texas speech pathologist fired for refusing to pledge not to boycott Israel</p> \n<p>The Texas law being challenged by the ACLU made headlines earlier this week after The Intercept reported that a speech therapist at an elementary school lost her job after she refused to sign a pledge that she doesn’t support boycotts of Israel or “Israeli controlled territories.” The law doesn’t make any distinction between Israel as a country and the settlements it has built in the West Bank since 1967. The speech therapist is filing a separate lawsuit from the one brought forward by the ACLU.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Last year, the same Texas law caused uproar after citizens who sought relief from hurricane damages were asked to sign a pledge that they oppose boycotts of Israel. At the time, state officials said the law was misinterpreted by local authorities.&nbsp;Over the past year, federal courts have frozen the implementation of two similar laws in Arizona and Kansas, because of constitutional concerns. In Kansas, the law was amended in order to ensure that it will affect only companies, not individual citizens.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>A former teen model has accused famed Jewish filmmaker Woody Allen, already dogged by decades-old allegations&nbsp;of sexual misconduct involving his adopted daughter, entering into an illicit sexual affair with her when she was only 16 years old.</p> \n<p>In an interview with&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter, Babi Christina Engelhardt&nbsp;described how she began seeing the then 41-year-old filmmaker in 1976 while she was still in high school. The relationship would last for eight years and allegedly served as the real life inspiration for Allen’s 1979 film “Manhattan,” in which Allen played a 42-year-old character who has a romantic relationship with a 17-year-old.</p> \n<p>Allen, who had previously been accused of sexual assault by adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, declined to comment when contacted by The Hollywood Reporter.</p> \n<p>Engelhardt was quoted as saying that she began to reevaluate her memories of the relationship in the light of the #MeToo movement but that she was “still impressed with him as an artist. How he played with characters in his movies, and how he played with me.”</p> \n<p>“What made me speak is I thought I could provide a perspective,” she told the Reporter. “I’m not attacking Woody. This is not ‘bring down this man.’ I’m talking about my love story. This made me who I am. I have no regrets. I was a pleaser, agreeable. Knowing he was a director, I didn’t argue. I was coming from a place of devotion.”</p> \n<p>An ethnic German, she noted the difference in background between her and her erstwhile lover, stating that “Woody’s the uber-Jew, and I’m the uber-German. There was a chip on my shoulder about wanting to please those who cast me aside. I wasn’t confrontational because I thought, ‘Nobody likes Germans.’”</p> \n<p>Several years into the affair, Woody introduced her to his girlfriend Mia Farrow, with whom he would eventually have a biological son and two adopted children. Engelhardt wrote that she “felt sick” but that she “couldn’t find the courage to get up and leave. To leave would mean an end to all of this. Looking back now, that’s exactly what I needed, but back then, the idea of not having Woody in my life at all terrified me. So I sat there, patiently, calmly trying to assess the situation, trying to understand why he wanted the two of us to meet.”</p>",

In addition, food aid to 165,000 people in the territory and in the Gaza Strip would be reduced by 20 percent.</p> \n<p>&quot;WFP has been forced, unfortunately, to make drastic cuts to the number of people that we support across Palestine, both in Gaza and the West Bank,&quot; Stephen Kearney, WFP country director in the Palestinian Territories, told Reuters.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said the agency was making the cutbacks &quot;mainly because the amount of funding that we are receiving is dropping drastically.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;It's not just WFP, it's across the whole humanitarian community as donor contributions significantly fall,&quot; Kearney said, blaming the shortfall on cuts by the United States, WFP's biggest contributor, and other countries in aid to Palestinians.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>USAID, one of the largest and most important humanitarian agencies in the regions, announced last month that half of its employees in the West Bank and Gaza will be let go in the coming weeks and by early 2019, the operations will be completely shut down.</p> \n<p>Israeli defense officials are reportedly aware of developments regarding the suspension of USAID’s work, but are also concerned over a cessation of American assistance to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. The United States earlier this year&nbsp;cut its aid to UNRWA, the United Nations agency tasked with assisting Palestinian refugees. Senior Israeli defense officials have warned that without an alternative to UNRWA, the situation in Gaza would worsen. UNRWA was later able to obtain $120 million from the European Union, Kuwait, Ireland, Norway and France.</p> \n<p>The United Nations and the Palestinian Authority&nbsp;appealed on Monday for $350 million in aid for Palestinians&nbsp;next year, saying much more was needed but they had to be realistic after a year of funding cuts, especially by the Trump administration.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Kearney told Reuters the WFP needs $57 million to maintain the current level of support for the benefit of 360,000 people in 2019.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;The people that we do reach are the most vulnerable across Palestine, and we appreciate that we are going to put further anxiety on these families,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Kearney said that while food aid was crucial in Gaza, the territory's underlying problems would remain as long as Israel maintained its blockade and Palestinian factional infighting continued, preventing any long-term political solution.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A spokesman for the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, declined immediate comment.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In Gaza, Fawzi Barhoum, spokesman for the Islamist Hamas group that runs the enclave, urged the United Nations to &quot;continue to provide the needs of the Palestinian people until they regain their freedom and not take decisions that worsen their suffering&quot;.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Maher al-Tabbaa, a Gaza-based economist, said the territory's poor would be especially hard-hit.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;The poverty rate in Gaza is over 53 percent and the WFP decision will get that higher, it will also affect the number of people suffering from food insecurity, whose percentage stands today at 70 percent,&quot; Tabbaa told Reuters.</p>",

        "text":["<p>I have been a Birthright participant and trip leader and an on-campus Israel advocacy professional, and I'll never forget the first time I visited the West Bank.</p> \n<p>I was standing in a Palestinian village in Area C under a half-completed minaret, its rusted and twisted metal shooting up into the sky, as the head of the village council described how the village had applied for building permits from the Israeli civil administration to finish construction of their mosque and other facilities, including a school. He told us each time they’ve applied for a permit, they’ve been denied, no explanation given.</p> \n<p>I looked out across the hill at an Israeli settlement. I saw neat rows of red-roofed houses and heard the gleeful whooping of children beating the summer heat next to a swimming pool.</p> \n<p>With all my time spent in Israel, I’d never heard from Palestinians like this village elder speaking first-hand about their lives under occupation. The web of checkpoints, walls, and roads Palestinians are forced to navigate, in a military regime they didn't choose to live under, had been invisible to me.</p> \n<p>Why, in all my previous Israel trips, had no one mentioned this reality?</p> \n<p>It felt like a fissure in my relationship to Israel. And I'm not alone - Birthright enrollment this year has declined by as much as 50%. There’s a lot for Israel trip organizers and educators to learn about how they make participants feel when they decide what to highlight and what to hide.</p> \n<p>My experience as a Birthright participant pushed me to become an enthusiastic advocate for Israel. I led trips to Israel and trained thousands of young people, from high school all the way through college as an on-campus Israel professional. For several years, I rarely questioned what I had learned.</p> \n<p>But it was my students who showed me the limits of my Israel education. They started asking questions I couldn't answer: Who controls the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank? What are the settlements? Why do they keep growing? If Israel is just protecting itself, why are so many more Gazans killed in every war than Israeli soldiers?</p> \n<p>They had seen things online and talked to their friends on campus. My hasbara toolbox didn’t contain authentic answers.</p> \n<p>I’m sure some trip organizers fear that showing anything but Israel’s most relatable, positive aspects will cause participants to feel alienated and disengaged. But meeting Palestinians and learning about the occupation didn’t make me want to walk away. It made me want to dive in. I felt called to learn more deeply and critically about Israel, and later, to take action alongside Israelis and Palestinians against the occupation.</p> \n<p>This summer, I led a group of young Jews from the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Australia visiting Israel for a New Israel Fund program called the Naomi Chazan Global Activism Fellowship, to meet with Israeli and Palestinian activists and see the kinds of complex realities I have come to understand, and which most organized trips avoid or even hide.</p> \n<p>We visited Hebron on a Breaking the Silence tour and met Palestinian communities in Area C of the West Bank; traveled through East Jerusalem to learn about the 350,000 Palestinians who call the divided city home; visited an unrecognized Bedouin village in the Negev; met with Mizrachi activists in Yeruham and South Tel Aviv fighting racism against their community, and more.</p> \n<p>Many of our trip participants, who had visited many times previously, told me they felt like they were engaging honestly and completely with Israel for the first time.</p> \n<p>When, for example, we visited an unrecognized Bedouin village in the Negev, one participant relayed her shock to me as the village sheikh described over tea how the village remains unconnected to water, electricity, and other basic services, even though its residents are Israeli citizens. Just a year prior she had spent a night in a &quot;Bedouin tent&quot; on Birthright and been told that this was representative of the Bedouin experience.</p> \n<p>Young Jews shouldn’t have to feel like they’re engaging with a sanitized and whitewashed version of Israel. When we don’t show them realities like the occupation, we are painting an incomplete and dishonest picture of what’s happening on the ground.</p> \n<p>Young people are going to find out about the hard stuff - there is no way around that. And if they are lied to by educators and shielded from the reality that is coming to their doorsteps, the fissure that is created is simply too wide. It’s almost impossible to get past it.</p> \n<p>More often than not, when they witness a less filtered Israel, young people like my trip participants - and me - find ourselves even more likely to stay engaged and take action.</p> \n<p>That’s because any liberal or progressive young person who is socially and politically aware in their own country (in the U.S., that’s the majority of us) is asking the same questions about fairness, equal rights, and social justice in Israel that they ask at home. They’re eager to build relationships with their Israeli and Palestinian counterparts on the basis of shared values.</p> \n<p>This is particularly meaningful right now, since many of them see parallels between the politics of racism and tribalism in America, Europe, and Israel.</p> \n<p>While some may believe that young people don’t have the tools to understand these issues in context, and therefore should be shielded from seeing injustice on the ground, all of my experiences prove that the opposite is true.</p> \n<p>When trips like Birthright deliberately avoid showing participants a fuller picture, including the occupation (but not only the occupation) they leave participants feeling like they’re being lied to, which is why some of them feel motivated to walk off to see the things Birthright won’t show them.</p> \n<p>So the question becomes: will our community encourage young people to engage with these issues head-on, or are we going to continue with a model that leaves them feeling betrayed and alienated?</p> \n<p>I have seen the difference firsthand. When we give young people the space to see and grapple with the occupation and meet the activists and organizations working to end it, they understand that they’re dealing with Israel in its fullness, in a way that aligns with their values.</p> \n<p>They see the incredible Israeli civil society leaders who, in the face of anti-democratic moves by their political elite, are fighting for equality, pluralism, civil and human rights. Like me, they feel called to join the struggle.</p> \n<p>Jacob Levkowicz is a Program Officer at the New Israel Fund.

American anti-BDS legislation coming under heat in the media and in court&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“While we do not support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctons (BDS) Movement, we remain resolved to our constitutional oath to defend the right of every American to express their views peacefully without fear of actual punishment by the government,” Sanders, an independent, and Feinstein, a Democrat, wrote in their letter, which was sent to Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.</p> \n<p>Both Schumer and McConell support the anti-boycott bill, which is being promoted by the pro-Israeli lobby group AIPAC.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;In starkest warning yet, EU states say Trump's Mideast Peace Plan risks 'being condemned to failure'</p> \n<p>The legislation has been met with opposition from leading civil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, over concerns that it will limit American citizens’ freedom of speech.</p> \n<p>AIPAC and key Senators sponsoring the legislation have rejected these concerns by claiming that the bill will only punish large-scale companies that join the internationally-led boycott of Israel, and will not harm private citizens who choose to boycott the country.</p> \n<p>The ACLU has warned, however, that the bill could be used for punishing private citizens, and would encourage states across the U.S. which have passed similar laws against BDS, to prosecute individuals for their political views on Israel.</p> \n<p>Federal courts in Kansas and Arizona have ruled two such laws as unconstitutional over the past year, as Sanders and Feinstein noted in their letter.</p> \n<p>“The courts’ reasoning in both cases applies with equal force” to the national anti-boycott law, they said.</p> \n<p>Sanders and Feinstein also warned that the legislation will create de-facto American support for the settlements, by punishing American citizens who choose to boycott them.</p> \n<p>“At a time when the Netanyahu government is pursuing policies clearly aimed at foreclosing the two-state solution, it is deeply disappointing that Congress would consider choosing to penalize criticism of those policies,” they wrote.</p> \n<p>The impetus for the letter is an attempt several senators, including Maryland Democrat Ben Cardin, to include the controversial “anti-boycott act” within a broader budget bill that must pass before the end of 2018.</p> \n<p>If the anti-boycott law is not included within that bill, it will have to be reintroduced the next time Congress convenes in January.</p> \n<p>Ever since Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 election, Sanders - who ran for president two years ago but lost to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries - has become one of the most active and prominent voices on Middle East policy for the party.</p> \n<p>Last month he successfully led, along with Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, a vote challenging the Trump administration’s policy in Yemen.</p> \n<p>Sanders has repeatedly called on the administration to promote a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to work towards solving the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which he believes poses a security risk to Israel.</p> \n<p>Jewish Democrats are divided over the legislation, with a visible rift between mainstream traditional Jewish Democrats and the more progressive left-wing chapter of the community.</p> \n<p>The Jewish Democratic Council of America (JDCA) announced its support for the legislation early on. &quot;The Israel Anti-Boycott Act is consistent with the 2016 Democratic Party Platform that states Democrats ‘oppose any effort to delegitimize Israel, including at the United Nations or through the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement’ and is also aligned with JDCA’s platform of opposition to global BDS,&quot; Halie Soifer, Executive Director of JDCA said in a statement.</p> \n<p>The Anti-Defamation League also publicly supported of the law, although a recently revealed two-year old memo showed the organisation has debated the issue internally, with some of ADL leaders arguing that anti-BDS laws are “ineffective, unworkable, unconstitutional, and bad for the Jewish community.”</p> \n<p>J Street, “the political home for pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans,” &nbsp;has officially voiced opposition to the bill, on the grounds that it “would do nothing to help strengthen Israel’s security or effectively combat BDS,” saying it stifles free speech and &quot;erases the distinction between Israel and the occupied West Bank.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The number etched on the bracelet around Mohammed’s wrist gave the 13-year-old soldier comfort as missiles fired from enemy warplanes shook the earth beneath him.</p> \n<p>For two years Mohammed fought with Yemen’s Houthi rebels against a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the United States. He says he tortured and killed people and didn’t care whether he lived or died.</p> \n<p>But if he died, the bracelet would guarantee his body made it home.</p> \n<p>“When I become a martyr, they enter my number in the computer, retrieve my picture and my name, then print them with the name ‘Martyr’ underneath,” Mohammed said. It would be pasted to the lid of his coffin for return to his family.</p> \n<p>Mohammed was among 18 former child soldiers interviewed by The Associated Press who described the Houthis’ unrelenting efficiency when it comes to the recruitment, deployment and even battlefield deaths of boys as young as 10.</p> \n<p>While both sides in the four-year civil war have sent children into combat in violation of international human rights conventions, the Houthis are believed to have recruited many more than the coalition — often forcibly.</p> \n<p>The Houthis have inducted 18,000 child soldiers into their rebel army since the beginning of the war in 2014, a senior Houthi military official acknowledged to the AP. He spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information.</p> \n<p>That figure is higher than any number previously reported. The United Nations was able to verify 2,721 children recruited to fight for all sides in the conflict, the large majority for the Houthis, but officials say that count is likely low, because many families will not speak about the issue out of fear of reprisals from Houthi militiamen.</p> \n<p>The Houthis say officially that they don’t recruit children and send away those who try to enlist.</p> \n<p>Some of the children told the AP they joined the rebels willingly, mainly because of promises of money or the chance to carry a weapon. But others described being forced into the service of the Houthis — abducted from schools or homes or coerced into joining in exchange for a family member’s release from detention.</p> \n<p>Many can be seen manning checkpoints along main roads across northern and western Yemen, AK-47s dangling from their narrow shoulders. Others are sent to the front lines as foot soldiers.</p> \n<p>A 13-year-old named Riyadh said half of the fighters he served with on the front lines in Yemen’s mountainous Sirwah district were children. Rebel officers ordered them to push forward during battles, even as coalition jets zoomed overhead, he said.</p> \n<p>He said he pleaded with his commander to let the young fighters take cover during airstrikes: “Sir, the planes are bombing.”</p> \n<p>The reply, he said, was always: “Followers of God, you must attack!”</p> \n<p>An unknown number of child soldiers have been sent home in coffins.</p> \n<p>More than 6,000 children have died or been maimed in Yemen since the beginning of the war, UNICEF reported in October. But the U.N. agency has not been able to determine how many of those minors were combatants and the Houthi-run Defense Ministry does not release its records for casualties.</p> \n<p>A former teacher from the city of Dhamar said that at least 14 pupils from his school were recruited and then died in battle. Their pictures were placed on empty classroom seats in 2016 during the Week of the Martyr, which the Houthis celebrate each year in February. Most of them were fifth and sixth graders, he said. An education official from Dhamar confirmed his account. The two spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of retribution.</p> \n<p>The teacher said some of the dead children’s parents were Houthi leaders who willingly sent their sons to the front lines. “It’s painful because this is a child and they are all my children because I was their teacher,” he said. “They were taken from the school and returned in coffins.”</p> \n<p>The Houthis and the coalition forces began peace talks in Sweden two weeks ago, but an end to the war appears far off. Many worry about what will become of the children who fought in the Middle East’s poorest country once a peace treaty is signed.</p> \n<p>Naguib al-Saadi, a Yemeni human rights activist who founded a Saudi-funded counseling center in Marib for child warriors, said “the real problem with Houthi recruitment of the children will be felt in 10 years — when a generation that has been brainwashed with hatred and enmity toward the West comes of age.”</p> \n<p>'Firewood for this war'</p> \n<p>The war began after Houthi rebels swept down from the northern highlands in late 2014, seizing the capital, Sanaa, and then pushing south. Yemen’s internationally recognized government sought help from the Saudis and other oil-rich neighbors, which formed the military coalition opposing the Houthis.</p> \n<p>The result has been a proxy war as much as a civil war, with forces backed by the Saudis fighting the Houthis, a Zaidi-Shiite religious and political group with ties to Iran.</p> \n<p>A report released in August by a U.N. expert panel said both sides are using child soldiers. The panel said it had information that coalition forces had targeted “particularly vulnerable children” living in displacement camps and “offered significant payments for child recruits.” The report said coalition units “frequently used children in support roles, although they have also been used in combat on the front lines.”</p> \n<p>The panel noted that nearly two-thirds of the child soldiers identified by the U.N. in 2017 were deployed by the Houthis and their allies.</p> \n<p>The Houthis constantly recruit new fighters because their ranks are smaller and thinned by battlefield losses. The well-funded and well-equipped coalition units have nearly 140,000 troops in the field, experts who study the war say. The Houthi military official told the AP that rebel forces have 60,000 fighters on the front lines. Outside experts estimate the Houthis’ troop strength at between 15,000 and 50,000.</p> \n<p>Top Houthi officials heap praise on young soldiers who have died in a conflict they describe as a sacred war against America, Israel and other outside powers they believe are trying to take over the country.</p> \n<p>Under the Houthi-controlled Defense Ministry, the rebels have pursued what they call a “national voluntary recruitment campaign.”</p> \n<p>Brig. Gen. Yahia Sarie, a spokesman for the Houthis’ armed forces, told the AP “there is no general policy to use the children in the battles,” but he acknowledged that some young people do volunteer to join the fight.</p> \n<p>“It’s personal initiative,” the general said. “Some of the children are motivated by the desire to take revenge, thinking it’s better to take action and fight with honor instead of getting killed inside our homes.” When they try to join, he said, Houthi leaders “send them back home.”</p> \n<p>He dismissed the accounts from the children who spoke to the AP, saying their claims were coalition propaganda.</p> \n<p>Children, parents, educators, social workers and other Yemenis interviewed by the AP described an aggressive campaign that targets children — and is not always completely voluntary. Houthi officials use their access to the Civil Registry Authority and other state records to gather data that allows them to narrow down their target list of the neediest families in villages and displacement camps — the ones most likely to accept offers of cash in return for recruits.</p> \n<p>In Sanaa, the Yemeni capital under Houthi control, recruiters go door to door telling parents they must either turn over their sons or pay money for the war effort, according to residents.</p> \n<p>The AP interviewed the 18 former child soldiers at displacement camps and a counseling center in the city of Marib, which is controlled by the Saudi-led, U.S.-backed coalition. They had come to Marib after slipping away from rebel forces or being captured by coalition units.</p> \n<p>Because of their ages and because some of them acknowledge committing acts of brutality, the AP is only using their first names. Some children gave themselves a nom du guerre after they joined the fighting. One 10-year-old boy, for example, called himself Abu Nasr, Arabic for “Father of Victory.”</p> \n<p>A 13-year-old boy named Saleh told the AP that Houthi militiamen stormed his family’s home in the northern district of Bani Matar on a Saturday morning and demanded he and his father come with them to the front lines. He said his father told them, “Not me and my son” and then tried to pull his rifle on them. “They dragged him away,” the boy recalled. “I heard the bullets, then my father collapsing dead.”</p> \n<p>Saleh said the militiamen took him with them and forced him to do sentry duty at a checkpoint 12 hours a day.</p> \n<p>International relief agencies working on child protection programs in northern Yemen are not allowed to discuss the use of child soldiers, out of fear their agencies will be barred from delivering aid to Houthi-controlled territories, according to four aid workers who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “This is a taboo,” one said.</p> \n<p>“They don’t raise the issue,” said Abdullah al-Hamadi, a former deputy education minister who defected earlier this year from the Houthi-controlled government in the north.</p> \n<p>Al-Hamadi said that the children who are targeted for recruitment are not the sons of important Houthi families or top commanders. Instead, they are usually kids from poor tribes who are being used “as firewood for this war.”</p> \n<p>In villages and small towns, recruiters include teenagers whose brothers or fathers already work for the Houthis. They can be seen hanging around schools, handing out chewing tobacco and trying to persuade the boys to become fighters.</p> \n<p>Several residents of Sanaa told the AP that Houthis divide the capital into security blocs, each overseen by a supervisor who must meet rolling quotas for bringing in new recruits. He collects information on the families living in his bloc by knocking on the doors of each house and asking for the number of male members, their names and ages.</p> \n<p>“It looks random from the outside, but in reality it’s not,” a Yemeni journalist who worked in Houthi territory said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the risks of talking about the rebels. “There are teams with specific missions and clear structure.”</p> \n<p>He and his family fled to Marib, a coalition stronghold, because he feared that the rebels would try to recruit his children.</p> \n<p>Houthi recruiters assure families their sons won’t be assigned to battle zones, but instead will be sent to work behind the lines at roadside checkpoints. Once militiamen get hold of the children, they often instead send them to indoctrination and training camps, and then the front lines, according to two children interviewed by the AP and officials from two child protection groups. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns that the Houthis might retaliate by blocking their groups from working in Yemen.</p> \n<p>Children interviewed by the AP said they were targeted by recruiters on soccer pitches, farms and, especially, schools.</p> \n<p>A 12-year-old named Kahlan said Houthi militiamen drove him and 10 of his classmates away in a pickup truck, telling them they were being taken to a place where they would get new school bags.</p> \n<p>It was a lie.</p> \n<p>Instead, still in their school uniforms, they found themselves inside a training camp getting instructions on how to hide from airstrikes.</p> \n<p>'Key for heaven'</p> \n<p>New recruits are usually taken first to “culture centers” for religious courses lasting nearly a month. Instructors read aloud to the children from the lectures of the Houthi movement’s founder, Hussein Badr Eddin al-Houthi, the late brother of the current leader, Abdul-Malek al-Houthi.</p> \n<p>The lectures, dating back to 2002, are circulated in audio and video and transcribed into booklets known as “Malazem.”</p> \n<p>They are told they are joining a holy war against Jews and Christians and Arab countries that have succumbed to Western influence — and that if the boys die fighting, they will go to heaven. The instructors fuel the recruits’ anger with accounts of coalition attacks that have killed civilians, including an airstrike in August that hit a bus full of schoolchildren.</p> \n<p>“When you get out of the culture center, you don’t want to go home anymore,” said Mohammed, the boy who served with the Houthis from ages 13 to 15. “You want to go to jihad.”</p> \n<p>The recruits are then sent to military training camps in the mountains, according to several children who defected from the Houthis. By night, they sleep in tents or huts made of tree branches. By day, they learn how to fire weapons, plant explosives and avoid missiles fired by coalition jets.</p> \n<p>From noon to sunset, the young soldiers get a daily share of the green leaves of qat, a mild stimulant that the vast majority of Yemenis chew every day. Coming from poor families, having qat is an incentive for the children, who might not be able to afford it at home.</p> \n<p>After less than a month of boot camp, they are sent to war, wearing the bracelets that are supposed to ensure that, if they die, they are returned to their families and honored as martyrs.</p> \n<p>The children call the inscription their “jihadi number.” Critics of the Houthis sardonically call the bracelets the children’s “key for heaven.”</p> \n<p>Once in the battle zones, some children said, their weapons and their beliefs made them feel powerful. Others just felt frightened.</p> \n<p>Mohammed fought in and around the city of Taiz, the scene of the war’s longest running battle.</p> \n<p>One day, his comrades captured a coalition fighter and brought him to a bombed-out restaurant for interrogation. Mohammed, 14 at the time, said he fetched an electric generator and hooked it up to the prisoner. He sent electric shocks screaming through the man’s body, he said, as his commander questioned the captive about coalition forces’ positions.</p> \n<p>When the questioning was over, he said, his commander gave this order: “Get rid of him.” Mohammed said he took a heavy metal tool, heated it in a flame, then swung it, caving in the back of the man’s head.</p> \n<p>“He was my master,” Mohammed recalled. “If he says kill, I would kill.... I would blow myself up for him.”</p> \n<p>Riyadh, the 13-year-old who fought in the Sirwah mountains, said he and his 11-year-old brother once shot and killed two enemy soldiers who had refused to lay down their weapons. But more often, he said, he closed his eyes tightly when he fired his rifle.</p> \n<p>“Honestly, when I am afraid, I don’t know where I am shooting — sometimes in the air and sometimes just randomly,” he said.</p> \n<p>The most frightening moment came when his brother disappeared during a firefight.</p> \n<p>“I was crying,” Riyadh recalled. “I told the commander that my brother had been martyred.”</p> \n<p>He began turning over corpses on the battlefield, searching bloodied faces for his lost brother when he and other fighters came under fire. They fired back. Then, after some yelling back and forth, he realized the shooter was not an enemy fighter but his brother, lost in the fog of battle.</p> \n<p>A few weeks later, Riyadh and his brother escaped, paying a truck driver to smuggle them away from the Houthi forces.</p> \n<p>Kahlan — the schoolboy who had been lured into combat with the promise of a new book bag — was first assigned to carry boxes of food and ammunition for soldiers. Then he was deployed to fight. He and the other boys had no clothes other than their school uniforms, he said. They were so filthy many sprouted skin rashes.</p> \n<p>Coalition aircraft screeched overhead, dropping bombs and firing missiles at Houthi positions. Afterward, trucks rumbled in to collect the dead.</p> \n<p>“The sight of the bodies was scary,” Kahlan recalled, using his hands to pantomime how corpses were missing heads or limbs or had their intestines oozing out.</p> \n<p>He slipped away from the Houthi camp early one morning, running from one village to another. “I was afraid to look back. I saw trees and rocks and I got more scared because they used to hide behind the trees.”</p> \n<p>'Listening session'</p> \n<p>Mohammed, Riyadh and Kahlan all ended up in Marib, at a rehabilitation center for children who served as Houthi soldiers. Since September 2017, nearly 200 boys have come through the center, which was founded by the Wethaq Foundation for Civil Orientation and funded with Saudi money.</p> \n<p>Mayoub al-Makhlafi, the center’s psychiatrist, said the common symptom among all the former child soldiers is extreme aggression. They suffer anxiety, panic attacks and attention deficits. Some describe being beaten by their own commanders, a staffer at the center said. She said she has also heard reports from children on both sides of the fighting about being sexually abused by officers. She spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of sexual abuse issues.</p> \n<p>The center brings the children together for “listening sessions” that help them remember their lives before they were sent to war.</p> \n<p>On his first day at the center, Mohammed said, he was terrified. He didn’t know what they would do to him there. “But then I saw the teachers and they gave me a room to stay in. I felt good after that.”</p> \n<p>His mother lives in Taiz, in an area under Houthi control, so he can’t live with her. He has other relatives and moves from one house to another. Sometimes, he said, he sleeps in the street.</p> \n<p>He no longer has the bracelet with the serial number that the Houthis gave him as part of their promise that he’d get a martyr’s funeral. When he defected, he said, his older brother sent him to be questioned by coalition authorities.</p> \n<p>During the interrogation, a security officer took out a pair of scissors and cut the bracelet from Mohammed’s wrist.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Legislation in the United States outlawing some activity in support for BDS, the anti-Israel boycott movement, is generating a backlash on the legal front and in the media.</p> \n<p>As Congress works to head off a partial federal government shutdown on Friday, one piece of legislation in the spotlight is the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, sponsored by Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, and Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portrman. The bill would impose criminal and civil penalties on American firms that participate in boycotts in support of Palestinian rights. The sponsors reportedly hope to tack it onto funding legislation that would head off the shutdown.</p> \n<p>“Our bipartisan legislation is a direct response to highly selective and discriminatory efforts to isolate Israel, such as those by the UN Human Rights Council,” Mr. Portman said in a statement quoted by the New York Times.</p> \n<p>Also in the spotlight is legislation in Texas, one of a number of states with laws outlawing some anti-Israel boycott activity. A Texas school speech pathologist,&nbsp;Bahia Amawi, who is of Palestinian descent, lost her job as a supplier of services to a Texas school district for refusing to sign a commitment to comply with the Texas law.</p> \n<p>Anti-BDS laws have been passed in 26 U.S. states, according to The Forward newspaper, and generally seek to bar state governments from doing business with companies that boycott Israel.</p> \n<p>&quot;It would be more constructive if political leaders would focus on the injustice and finding viable solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict rather than reinforcing divisions between the two parties and promoting legislation that raises free speech concerns,&quot; the New York Times wrote in a lead editorial on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>For his part, Washington Post columnist David Von Drehle, wrote this week: &quot;Israel and its friends can win the fight against BDS only through persuasion and example; outlawing dissent will never work.&quot; With regard to the Texas school speech therapist, he said: &quot;As an American citizen, Bahia Amawi possesses a number of ironclad rights, the first of which — according to the Constitution — protects her freedom of speech. So when the Pflugerville, Tex., school district refused to renew her annual contract to provide speech therapy for its students because she was, in her view, exercising those rights, she responded like a true American.&nbsp;She sued.&quot;</p> \n<p>The American Civil Liberties Union announced on Wednesday&nbsp;that it has filed a legal challenge to the law. The lawsuit was filed by the organization on behalf of four Texas citizens who had either lost their jobs because of the law, or were “forced” to sign it against their beliefs in order not to lose their income. The organization has also been critical the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, the federal bill sponsored by Senators Portman and Cardin.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, Cardin issued a statement in which he said: “We have welcomed the public discussions that have been essential in focusing this bipartisan legislation in such a way that definitively upholds the rights of individual Americans while clarifying decades-old legislation.”&nbsp;It quotes Portman as saying: “I am confident this bill strikes the right balance between protecting U.S. businesses and our Israeli allies from unfair targeting by international organization, while upholding America’s commitment to free speech and individual liberty.”</p> \n<p>An ACLU analysis claimed, however, that it &quot;leaves intact key provisions which would impose civil and criminal penalties on companies....&quot;</p> \n<p>Taking Portman and Cardin to task, the Times editorial board wrote: &quot;In a properly functioning Congress, a matter of such moment would be openly debated. Instead, Mr. Cardin and Mr. Portman are trying to tack the BDS provision onto the lame-duck spending bill, meaning it could by enacted into law in the 11th-hour crush to keep the government fully open.&quot;</p> \n<p>In a column critical of anti-BDS legislation, Batya Ungar-Sargon, the opinion editor of The Forward, wrote: &quot;This is not to say that BDS is worthy of support. I, like many Jews, find BDS distasteful. I find its leaders morally unimpressive and its ranks full of anti-Semites, some of them Jews.&quot; But she added: &quot;The entire point of the First Amendment is to protect the speech of people we despise (you don’t need the law to protect the speech of people you like). It’s something we Americans hold dear, and something we seem to recognize as crucial to our identity in all areas but Israel. It’s nothing short of a&nbsp;shonda&nbsp;[a disgrace] for Israel to be the one topic where Americans forget about their most dearly held values.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>The White House said on Wednesday that the United States has started sending troops back from Syria but that the move does not signify the end of the campaign or a halt to the work of the global coalition in the war-torn country.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The U.S. is considering a total withdrawal of forces, U.S. officials told Reuters.</p> \n<p>All U.S. State Department personnel are being evacuated from Syria within 24 hours, a U.S. official told Reuters.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; GOP senators: U.S. withdrawal from Syria a win for ISIS, Iran and Russia</p> \n<p>The official said the U.S. plans to pull military forces out of the country once the final stages of the last operation against Islamic State is complete, and that the time-frame for the troop pullout is expected to be between 60 to 100 days.</p> \n<p>The decision came after a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan on Friday. &quot;Everything that has followed is implementing the agreement that was made in that call,&quot; the official said.</p> \n<p>Such a decision upends assumptions about a longer-term U.S. military presence in&nbsp;Syria, which U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other senior U.S. officials had advocated to help ensure Islamic State cannot reemerge.</p> \n<p>The Pentagon also said it had started the process of returning U.S. troops from Syria. &quot;The Coalition has liberated the ISIS-held territory, but the campaign against ISIS is not over,&quot; Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We have started the process of returning U.S. troops home from Syria as we transition to the next phase of the campaign,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;For force protection and operational security reasons we will not provide further details. We will continue working with our partners and allies to defeat ISIS wherever it operates.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Still, Trump has previously expressed a strong desire to bring troops home from&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;when possible. On Wednesday, Trump appeared to declare victory against the group and made clear he saw no further grounds for remaining in&nbsp;Syria.</p> \n<p>Leaked Cable:&nbsp;Without Russia, Israel's Iran Strategy 'Would Be More Complex,' Top Diplomat Says&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We have defeated ISIS in&nbsp;Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,&quot; he tweeted.</p> \n<p>Israel wary of repercussions</p> \n<p>Israel was aware of Trump's intentions, and has been trying to postpone the decision over the last year. However, it was the timing of the move which caught the political echelon off-guard and came at a moment when Israel is facing the repercussions of the September downing a Russian spy plane in Syria.</p> \n<p>Since the incident, Netanyahu has yet to be invited to Moscow, and Israel was hoping this would happen before the U.S. withdrawal.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he spoke Monday with U.S. President Donald Trump and with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. &quot;The U.S. administration has told me that it was the president's intention to&nbsp;pull out their troops from Syria. They clarified that they have other ways to wield their influence in that arena,&quot; the premier stated.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu added that Israel will closely follow the time table of the American troops' withdrawl and what repercussions this move will have on Jerusalem. &quot;In any case we will make sure to ensure the safety of Israel&nbsp; and protect ourselves from this arena.&quot;</p> \n<p>Israel's envoy at the UN, Danny Danon, voiced concern over the American move later Wednesday. Speaking at a UN Security Council session on Hezbollah's cross-border tunnels, the Israeli ambassador said that while Israel respected its ally's decision it still had its own concerns about the situation in Syria.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The timing of the troop withdrawal was not immediately clear and U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity did not disclose details about the deliberations. But one official told Reuters that partners and allies had been consulted.</p> \n<p>Read more: Islamic State Kills 700 Prisoners in East Syria, War Monitor Finds</p> \n<p>Two U.S. officials said a decision to withdraw had already been reached but that could not be immediately confirmed. It was unclear how soon a decision detailing any withdrawal plans might be announced.</p> \n<p>The Pentagon declined to comment to Reuters, saying only that it continued to work with partners in the region.</p> \n<p>The United States still has about 2,000 troops in&nbsp;Syria, many of them special operations forces working closely with an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias known as the&nbsp;Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF.</p> \n<p>The partnership with the SDF over the past several years has led to the defeat of Islamic State in&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;but outraged NATO ally Turkey, which views Kurdish YPG forces in the alliance as an extension of a militant group fighting inside Turkey.</p> \n<p>The deliberations on U.S. troops come as Ankara threatens a new offensive in&nbsp;Syria. To date, U.S. forces in&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;have been seen as a stabilizing factor in the country and have somewhat restrained Turkey's actions against the SDF.</p> \n<p>A complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;would still leave a sizeable U.S. military presence in the region, including about 5,200 troops across the border in Iraq.</p> \n<p>Much of the U.S. campaign in&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;has been waged by warplanes flying out of Qatar and other locations in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>Still, Mattis and U.S. State Department officials have long fretted about leaving&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;before a peace agreement can be reached to end that country's brutal civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced around half of&nbsp;Syria’s pre-war population of about 22 million.</p> \n<p>In April, Mattis said: &quot;We do not want to simply pull out before the diplomats have won the peace. You win the fight — and then you win the peace.&quot;</p> \n<p>Islamic State is also widely expected to revert to guerilla tactics once it no longer holds territory.</p> \n<p>A U.S. withdrawal could open Trump up to criticism if Islamic State reemerged.</p> \n<p>Trump has previously lambasted his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq that preceded an unraveling of the Iraqi armed forces. Iraqi forces collapsed in the face of Islamic State's advance into the country in 2014.</p> \n<p>Last one percent</p> \n<p>Islamic State declared its so-called &quot;caliphate&quot; in 2014 after seizing large swathes of&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;and Iraq. The hardline Islamist group established its de facto capital in the&nbsp;Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe.</p> \n<p>According to U.S. estimates, the group oversaw about 100,000 square kilometers (39,000 square miles) of territory, with about 8 million people under Islamic State control. It had estimated revenues of nearly one billion dollars a year.</p> \n<p>Brett McGurk, the U.S. special envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State, said last week that the group was down to its last 1 percent of the territory it once held in its self-styled &quot;caliphate.&quot; The group has no remaining territory in Iraq.</p> \n<p>Hajin, the group's last major stronghold in&nbsp;Syria, is close to being seized by U.S.-backed SDF forces.</p> \n<p>After losing Hajin, Islamic State will control a diminishing strip of territory along the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in the area where U.S.-backed operations are focused. The militants also control some desert terrain west of the river in territory otherwise controlled by the Damascus government and its allies.</p> \n<p>But U.S. officials have warned that taking back the group's territory would not be the same as defeating it.</p> \n<p>&quot;Even as the end of the physical caliphate is clearly now coming into sight, the end of ISIS will be a much more long-term initiative,&quot; McGurk told a State Department briefing on Dec. 11.</p> \n<p>U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cautioned earlier in December that the United States had trained only about 20 percent of&nbsp;Syrian forces required to stabilize areas captured from Islamic State.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Drones flying near London’s&nbsp;Gatwick&nbsp;airport grounded flights for at least 15 hours, causing chaos for tens of thousands of Christmas travellers in what authorities said was a reckless attempt to cripple Britain’s second busiest airport.</p> \n<p>Flights were halted at&nbsp;Gatwick&nbsp;at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted flying near its airfield, triggering the biggest disruption to its operations since a volcanic ash cloud grounded flights in 2010.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said those flying the drones were &quot;irresponsible and completely unacceptable&quot; and voiced sympathy for people having their travel plans upset just days before Christmas.</p> \n<p>The airport and&nbsp;Gatwick's biggest airline easyJet told passengers to check before travelling to the airport as several thousand people waited there in chaotic scenes.</p> \n<p>&quot;It's really busy. People are sitting everywhere, on the stairs, on the floors,&quot; passenger Ani Kochiashvili, who was booked onto a Wednesday evening flight, told Reuters by phone.</p> \n<p>Police said more than 20 units were searching for the drone operators on Thursday, when the airport had expected to handle around 115,000 passengers.</p> \n<p>&quot;At the moment we're still getting sightings of the drones in and around the airfield,&quot;&nbsp;Gatwick&nbsp;Policing Airport Commander Justin Burtenshaw told the BBC.</p> \n<p>Sussex regional police said public safety was paramount, adding in a statement: &quot;There are no indications to suggest this is terror-related.&quot;</p> \n<p>Gatwick, which lies 50 km (30 miles) south of London, gave no indication on when it would reopen and described the situation as an &quot;ongoing incident&quot;.</p> \n<p>There has been an increase in near-collisions by unmanned aircraft and commercial jets, heightening concerns for safety across the aviation industry in recent years.</p> \n<p>The number of near misses between private drones and aircraft in Britain more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year, according to the UK Airprox Board.</p> \n<p>&quot;INDUSTRIAL DRONE&quot;</p> \n<p>Gatwick&nbsp;Chief Operating Officer Chris Woodroofe warned that the knock-on effects from the airport closure would last for more than 24 hours. He described one of the drones as a heavy industrial model.</p> \n<p>&quot;It's definitely not a standard, off-the-shelf type drone. &quot;Given what has happened I definitely believe it is a deliberate act, yes,&quot; he said on BBC radio.</p> \n<p>&quot;We also have the helicopter up in the air but the police advice is that it would be dangerous to seek to shoot the drone down because of what may happen to the stray bullets.&quot;</p> \n<p>Under British law it is illegal to fly drones within 1 km (0.62 mile) of an airport boundary. The offence is punishable by up to five years in prison.</p> \n<p>Policing airport commander Burtenshaw said the police were exploring other options to try and bring the situation to a close. He said he was confident of tracking down whoever was behind the drones, but it wouldn't be easy.</p> \n<p>&quot;It's a painstaking thing with the new drones; the bigger the drones the further the reach of the operator so it's a difficult and challenging thing to locate them.&quot;</p> \n<p>SAFETY FIRST</p> \n<p>Gatwick&nbsp;apologised on Twitter to affected passengers, adding that safety was its &quot;foremost priority&quot;.</p> \n<p>Tens of thousands of passengers were affected, with hundreds of thousands of journeys likely to be disrupted in the coming days, the airport said.</p> \n<p>Gatwick, which competes with Europe's busiest airport, Heathrow, west of London, had previously said Sunday would be its busiest day of the festive period.</p> \n<p>There have been multiple reports of drone sightings since the initial report on Wednesday evening,&nbsp;Gatwick&nbsp;said. The runway briefly appeared to reopen around 0300 GMT before drones were spotted again.</p> \n<p>Kochiashvili, who had been due to fly to Tbilisi, Georgia, on Wednesday, said she had spent six hours overnight sitting on a plane which did not take off.</p> \n<p>&quot;I'm very annoyed because I'm with two kids, a three-month-old and three-year-old. They require a lot of space and food and changing and all that, and the airport is crazy busy so it's challenging. There's literally zero information being shared,&quot; she told Reuters by phone.</p> \n<p>Passengers took to Twitter to share their stories.</p> \n<p>One waiting at the airport on Thursday said: &quot;At&nbsp;Gatwick&nbsp;Airport, drone chaos, surprisingly good natured, but complete mayhem.&quot;&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>It seems that a perverse contest has been taking place among the last three presidents of the United States, with each vying for the dishonor of having the worst Middle East policy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>George W. Bush, of course, still has the edge with his catastrophic, profoundly misguided and destabilizing invasion of Iraq. Barack Obama takes the special jury prize for fecklessness, offering high-minded speeches and largely ruminating himself into indecision amid the alienation of all of America’s allies in the region. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Donald Trump has only been in office two years, and with his recent decision to ignore the advice of his advisors and the national interest of both the U.S. and our allies in the region combined with his pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and kowtowing to despots, tyrants and wannabes from Putin to Erdogan to MBS to Benjamin Netanyahu, he seems like he is positioning himself for a run for the title.</p> \n<p>Bush’s catastrophe was redeemed somewhat by his ability to learn from his errors, get rid of the members of his team that were the most wrong-headed and make some progress in restoring relations with allies in the region during his final years in office.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Obama, of course, built on efforts that took place under Bush and finally got Bin Laden, and despite the failures of his Syria policies and his bungled diplomacy in Israel, Turkey, Egypt, Libya and the Gulf, he did fashion the Iran nuclear deal which, although imperfect, reduced the immediate nuclear threat from Tehran.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Both also had a healthy skepticism of the motives and actions of Russia&nbsp; and a broader sense of America’s strategic interests. They also had policy processes that while flawed, had them listening to their advisors and weighing decisions in a relatively thoughtful manner (Iraq aside.)</p> \n<p>But what makes Trump so different and potentially so much worse is illustrated in his mercurial decision on Syria - one that caught his State Department, Defense Department, Intelligence Community, and allies by surprise.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the days before the decision was announced on Wednesday, Trump advisors had repeatedly pledged a commitment in Syria until the job was done—the Islamic State was defeated, a political settlement was in place, and a de-escalation of the conflict (the goals that were enumerated by Trump’s Special Envoy for Syria James Jeffrey a month ago.) Jeffrey repeated the point as recently as the beginning of this week. Behind the scenes, they also all urged the president not to pull the troops out suddenly.</p> \n<p>But then in true Trump style with a tweet, the president announced he was done. He said that the only reason he had troops in Syria was to defeat the Islamic State and that work was completed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Quite apart from the bizarre personalization of the announcement (it was about him rather than about the country), it was also not only inconsistent with the views of his team, it was based on a lie. The Islamic State is not defeated. They are still active in Northern Syria and there is no doubt that the pull out of U.S. troops will create conditions that might actually lead to their regaining strength.</p> \n<p>Reporting suggests that Trump had decided to do this as part of an agreement with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, one of the many despots in the region for which Trump has a warm place in his heart - and one from whom he would like help suppressing further investigations into the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Erdogan was hardly the only big winner from the decision. Trump’s patron Vladimir Putin also was a winner with Russian influence in Syria and the Assad regime it has supported now left firmly in control. Iran too, a stated nemesis of Trump’s, is also a winner, but that seems only to illustrate how half-baked the move was.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The New York Times reported that in the U.S. Defense Department there was immediate speculation Trump was doing this to try to distract from the maelstrom of scandals currently swirling around him.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And of course, that was a prime motivation. Trump is flailing. In the best of times, everything he does is motivated by self-interest. But as he reaches crisis that malignant narcissism only grows worth. He will do anything to change the subject or to save himself.</p> \n<p>That is what puts Trump in the position to go from bad to much much worse in his Middle East policies (and I use the term loosely: they are more like impulses or fits.)</p> \n<p>Trump has already thrown his lot in with the cruel, autocratic and destabilizing regime in Riyadh - pitting himself not only against what is right but against many of the people of the region who are chafing under the leadership of such regimes. He has lit the fuse for a conflict with Iran, egged on by his buddy Bibi. He has given Bibi carte blanche to behave as brutally as he likes with regard to the Palestinians.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Further, he has shown absolute disregard for the human costs of the wars in Syria and Yemen, of Saudi or Turkish or Egyptian abuse of dissidents, of the harshness of Israel’s treatment of the Palestinian people or the likely Erdogan crackdown on the Kurds.</p> \n<p>It is a formula both for the further empowerment of bad actors like the Russians, Assad, Iran, MBS and of extremists of every stripe from Israel and across the region. It raises the possibility of further brutality in Syria, war with Iran, and political unrest.</p> \n<p>And at the same time, because Trump is so polarizing a figure at home and his ties to the worst figures in this world are so caught up in scandal and compromise, those allies he has chosen will find themselves under political attack in the U.S. and their cases viewed - largely by their own choice - in highly partisan and damaging terms.</p> \n<p>Suddenly pulling out of Syria without any rhyme or reason is not an error on the scale of Iraq. But Trump is an especially bad president: not just the most corrupt in American history, but the least competent. And so this move should not be seen in isolation, but rather as a harbinger of potentially very unhappy events to come.</p> \n<p>David Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and host of the&nbsp;Deep State Radio&nbsp;podcast</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement was founded in 2005 by 170 different Palestinian organizations, most of them NGOs. Inspired by the Anti-Apartheid Movement in South Africa, BDS urges nonviolent pressure on Israel until it complies with its three demands:</p> \n<p>1) Ending the occupation that begun in 1967</p> \n<p>2) Granting Israel’s Arab-Palestinian citizens full equality and</p> \n<p>3) Giving the Palestinian refugees the right of returning to their properties as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.</p> \n<p>Two years later, in 2007, the Reut Institute, an influential Israel think tank,&nbsp;framed the BDS movement as a &quot;strategic threat with potentially existential implications&quot; for Israel.</p> \n<p>What have been the effects of BDS so far? In the economic sphere, precious little.</p> \n<p>When the movement was founded in 2005, Israel’s GDP&nbsp;(in current US$) was $142 billion,&nbsp;according to the World Bank. In 2017 (the latest available figure), it was $350 billion. By comparison, the strong economy of the United States grew by 47% during the same period, France by 17% and the United Kingdom by 4%, according to the same World Bank&nbsp;statistics.</p> \n<p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows to Israel also&nbsp;reached an all-time high in 2017. Both 2017 and 2018 have also been&nbsp;record years for tourism in Israel with more people than ever&nbsp;visiting the country. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel is flourishing not just in the economic sphere but in the diplomatic sphere as well. Having written about Sweden’s recognition of Palestine and whether EU members would follow -&nbsp;so far none has&nbsp;-&nbsp;it has long been clear that it is Israel that is enjoying increased recognition, and not the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>This is obvious when one looks at the many meetings Netanyahu has had with world leaders: from hosting the President of Chad recently, to his trip to Oman, to his secret dealings with&nbsp;other Gulf and Muslim League countries, to his close relations with the Visegrad countries, to his strategic alliance with Greece and so on.</p> \n<p>In my university classes, we sometimes discuss which countries that are most supportive of the Palestinians. Turkey and Qatar are close friends of Hamas, but both the students and myself have a hard time listing the Palestinian Authority’s top supporters. Diplomatic friends who work closely with the PA say that Sweden, France, Jordan, Ireland, South Africa and maybe Ecuador and Venezuela are the PA’s top supporters at the moment.</p> \n<p>Consequently, with an Israel that is stronger than it has ever been, economically, diplomatically and militarily, and the Palestinians at one of the low-points in their history, how on earth can supporters of the BDS movement claim they’re winning?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are different ways to measure the success or failure of a movement like BDS. The most obvious would be to analyze to what extent BDS has realized its objectives. The second would be to establish how far it has contributed to actual boycotts, divestments and sanctions against Israel. Thirdly, what other consequences and impacts it has had.</p> \n<p>Regarding the first measure, no sane person could argue that the occupation is closer to end today as compared to 2005. In fact, the opposite is true. The same logic applies to Palestinian refugee return. It can be argued that the situation for Israel’s Arab population has improved, for example the rise in Arab&nbsp;enrolment at Israeli universities, but it is hard to see BDS as a factor in this development.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;South Africa's Shameful Capitulation to anti-Israel Thuggery</p> \n<p>When it comes to actual boycotts, divestments and sanctions against Israel, there have over the years since 2005 been a number of small victories for the BDS movement, the latest of which was Airbnb’s de-listing of accommodation in Israeli settlements (which now seems to be in jeopardy), possible new laws on the way in Ireland and Chile against the settlements, academic boycotts, cancelled music concerts, and two U.S. police departments’ cancelling of training in Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While these measures have received much publicity, they have - just like similar measures in the past - done very little to improve the situation on the ground for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</p> \n<p>During the lifetime of the BDS movement, the number of settlers in the West Bank has actually grown by almost 70% (from 247,300 in 2005 to 413,400 in 2017),&nbsp;according to data from Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics, used by&nbsp;Peace Now’s Settlement Watch.</p> \n<p>My own experience, from travelling regularly to the Palestinian territories over the past 15 years, is that the Palestinians, both in the West Bank and Gaza, are still searching for effective strategies to confront Israel. They don’t believe they have that strategy in BDS. Indeed, only a small minority of Palestinians believe in the effectiveness of non-violent resistance against Israel, according to&nbsp;the latest poll from the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.</p> \n<p>Finally, the BDS movement should be evaluated according to what other impacts it may have had. Here, it can be argued that the BDS movement has emerged as a central actor in what might be called the &quot;the legislative turn&quot; of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;That Roaring Sound? It’s Palestine Unleashing a Legal Tsunami Against Israeli War Crimes&nbsp;&gt;&gt; ACLU:&nbsp;In America, the Right to Boycott Israel Is Under Threat. This Is Why That's Cause for Concern</p> \n<p>This trend can be seen across the political spectrum, in laws enacted by the Israeli Knesset, in the European Union’s differentiation strategy against the settlements, in the UN Human Rights Council, in the Palestinians turning to the ICC, in anti-boycott legislation in the U.S. Congress and in more than 25 states.</p> \n<p>It remains to be seen how this trend will play out in the future, but it will likely include much more of what is already being called the &quot;BDS wars&quot; between free speech on the one hand, and criminalization of the BDS movement and accusations of anti-Semitism on the other, as we are beginning to see more and more of already today, not least in Texas.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A peculiarity of the BDS movement is that it seems strongest in the Western country most friendly to Israel: the U.S., and almost non-existent in a country like Sweden, the Western country considered most critical of Israel.</p> \n<p>The BDS movement’s role in the &quot;the legislative turn&quot; is connected to another trend of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: &quot;the authoritarian turn.&quot;</p> \n<p>Both Israel and Palestine-West Bank were recently downgraded by&nbsp;V-Dem, the world’s largest academic democracy ranking project. Israel was downgraded from being a &quot;liberal democracy&quot; to an &quot;electoral democracy,&quot; replaced for the first time by Tunisia as the only liberal democracy in the Middle East. Palestine-West Bank was also downgraded from &quot;electoral democracy&quot; to &quot;closed,&quot; while Palestine-Gaza was ranked at the bottom of the Liberal Democracy Index.</p> \n<p>V-Dem’s findings mirror those of other similar surveys and indexes over the last years when it comes to Israel and Palestine, such as Freedom House’s&nbsp;Freedom in the World 2018 survey and&nbsp;The Economist’s&nbsp;Democracy Index. Freedom House's downgrading of Israel’s civil liberties rating was triggered by &quot;a series of laws that have been enacted or proposed in recent years with the aim of tightening restrictions on critical nongovernmental organizations and denying them access to international support.&quot;</p> \n<p>Just recently, the 2018&nbsp;Israeli Democracy Index found that close to half of the Israeli public, including 57% of secular Jews and 70% of Arab Israelis, believe that democracy in Israel was in serious danger.</p> \n<p>Like a bicycle that that must be ridden forward or fall over, it is in the DNA of a movement like BDS always to claim victories. Supporters of BDS typically say that their movement has had a steeper curve than the Anti-Apartheid Movement in South Africa, which needed over&nbsp;30 years to end apartheid.&nbsp;But Israel’s economic and diplomatic curves have far outpaced the BDS movement’s curve during the 13 years since 2005.</p> \n<p>One of few curves in Israel that is going down rather than up at the moment is Israel’s status in democracy ranking projects. The importance of this should not be underestimated. No longer being able to credibly use epithets such as &quot;liberal democracy&quot; and &quot;the only democracy in the Middle East&quot; will likely create major identity and hasbara problems for Israel in the future.</p> \n<p>Many critics of the BDS movement, including left-wingers like&nbsp;Noam Chomsky and&nbsp;Norman Finkelstein, have long argued that the BDS movement’s ultimate objective is not to fix Israel’s problems, but to destroy it.</p> \n<p>Whether that’s true or not, the BDS movement has not been able to hurt Israel from the outside. But it is beginning to hurt Israel from the inside.</p> \n<p>Anders Persson is a political scientist at Lund University, Sweden, specializing in EU-Israel/Palestine relations.

        "text":["<p>The following are highlights from Russian President Vladimir Putin's annual end-of-year news conference on Thursday.</p> \n<p>ON THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR</p> \n<p>&quot;If, God forbid, something like that were to happen, it would lead to the end of all civilisation and maybe also the planet... These are serious questions and it's a real shame that there's a tendency to underestimate them.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;There are currently certain specifics, there is a danger... We are essentially witnessing the breakdown of the international order of arms control.&quot;</p> \n<p>ON WESTERN SANCTIONS</p> \n<p>&quot;Russia throughout almost all of its history has been under some sort of sanctions... This is to do with the growth of Russia's power and its ability to compete. A new player has appeared which must be taken into consideration.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Our economy has adapted to these external constraints... And look, there's also some advantages to this sanctions story. In what sense? It has forced us to switch on our brains in relation to many things.&quot;</p> \n<p>ON BRITISH-RUSSIA TIES</p> \n<p>&quot;It is in the interests of both countries, both governments to get out of this deadlock.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Are we interested in restoring full relations with Britain? Yes, we are interested... And we know that British (companies) work pretty actively here.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;In terms of Brexit, if it is carried through to the end, I understand the prime minister's (Theresa May's) position... There was a referendum after all. What can she do? She must enact the will of the people, expressed during the referendum.&quot;</p> \n<p>ON MARIA BUTINA AND SKRIPAL POISONING CASES</p> \n<p>On Butina: &quot;I don't understand what she is supposed to confess to. She did not carry out any orders from Russian security services. Clearly she and her lawyers are fighting to get her out of jail. I don't understand why she was jailed, there are no grounds for it.&quot;</p> \n<p>On Skripals: &quot;It's good that he wasn't killed... Thank God, Skripal is alive.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;It's simply an excuse to organise yet another attack on Russia. If there were no Skripals, they would have come up with something else, that's clear to me. There's only one goal: to constrain Russia's growth as a possible competitor. I can see no other goals.&quot;</p> \n<p>ON RUSSIAN CAPTURE OF UKRAINIAN SAILORS</p> \n<p>&quot;Provocations are always bad. A provocation aims to escalate the situation. Why do our Ukrainian partners need this development? They need to escalate the situation around the elections, to raise the rating of one candidate for the post. Did the provocation achieve its aims? In terms of raising ratings, maybe.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;An investigation is ongoing. After the proceedings it will become clear what will happen to (the sailors).&quot;</p> \n<p>ON GROWTH AND THE ECONOMY</p> \n<p>&quot;Inflation remains at levels that we welcome... We will go outside the Central Bank's 4 percent reference point somewhat.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;We can't create GDP growth for the breakthrough we need without changing the structure of our economy. That's what our national goals are geared towards... to giving the economic structure an innovative character.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;From 2021, the government is planning for 3 percent growth, even more perhaps.&quot;</p> \n<p>ON VAT, INFLATION</p> \n<p>&quot;I expect that this (the increase in prices) will be a one-off... Recently, they (the central bank) decided to increase the (key) rate by 0.25 percentage points. There are pluses and minuses but this is done also to avoid an increase in inflation and prices. So in general I think that the decision (to raise VAT) was right, balanced, plus this gives additional budget revenues and possibilities to fulfil our development plans which are parts of our national goals.&quot;</p> \n<p>ON KURILS TERRITORIAL DISPUTE WITH JAPAN</p> \n<p>&quot;The U.S. base on Okinawa has been there for decades now... We don't understand the level of sovereignty Japan has when such decisions are made.</p> \n<p>&quot;What will happen after a peace agreement is signed, we don't know. But without an answer to this question, it will be very difficult for us to take any major decisions.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;I am convinced - and Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe agrees - the current situation is not normal. Russia and Japan are both interested in the complete normalisation of our relations.&quot;</p> \n<p>ON&nbsp;SYRIA, ISLAMIC STATE</p> \n<p>&quot;In terms of the victory over Islamic State, overall I agree with President Trump.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;In terms of the withdrawal of U.S. troops, I don't know what this is about. The U.S. has had a presence in Afghanistan for 17 years, lets say? And almost every year it says that it is withdrawing troops from there. But they are still present there.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;We don't see any indication of U.S. withdrawing troops as of yet but I accept that it may be happening.&quot;</p> \n<p>ON PRIVATE MILITARY CONTRACTORS</p> \n<p>&quot;Everyone must remain within the bounds of the law... I repeat, they are not breaking Russian law and have the right to work and promote their business interests wherever they like in the world.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;If this Wagner Group is breaking any laws, the procurator's office must give its legal opinion.&quot;</p> \n<p>ON SCHISM IN ORTHODOXY</p> \n<p>&quot;Undoubtedly it has a political rationale. Nothing good will come of it for religious freedom in general. And I'm most concerned about the division of property that will follow. It's already happening, effectively. It could... get bloody.&quot;</p> \n<p>ON GRAIN, AGRICULTURE</p> \n<p>&quot;We retain and have even grown our grain export potential to 52.5 million tonnes. We will fulfil all of our responsibilities and contracts.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>After 12 years and a respectable career in Israeli soccer, Paty Yeye Lenkebe – know to local fans as YeYe Paty – is about to lose the life he built here.</p> \n<p>It follows the decision by Israel’s Population and Immigration Authority in October to suspend a policy in place since 2001, which protected citizens of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from being deported.</p> \n<p>As of January 5, any Congolese citizen in Israel without a visa, or not in the process of obtaining a visa, must leave the country or face the consequences for living here illegally.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been here for 12 years, my whole life is in Israel. I have nothing anymore in Congo. I can’t go back there; I’ll be killed,” says Lenkebe, whose contract with second tier side Maccabi Ahi Nazareth ended this summer, leaving him unemployed at age 36.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Asylum seeker turned TV star: 'It's as if Israelis forgot what they went through'&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“People who go back to Congo disappear. It’s certain death,” says Lenkebe, whose career in Israel also encompassed spells for Maccabi Herzliya, Bnei Sakhnin and FC Ashdod. “The situation there is so bad that there’s reverse migration from the cities to the countryside. In the city, they can monitor you and follow you. It’s harder for them to do that in the villages,” he says.</p> \n<p>Lenkebe came to Israel in 2006 and proceeded to spend the bulk of his professional career here. Though he didn’t play for any of the big clubs and didn’t win a major title, he is still well-known among Israeli soccer fans and is one of the foreign players who has really connected with Israeli society in his time here.</p> \n<p>For years, he was one of the most reliable defenders in Israeli soccer, and at times was even eyed by top clubs Maccabi Haifa and Hapoel Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>In 2017, Lenkebe – who lives in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv – was part of the Team for Social Responsibility, a project aimed at combating racism in Israeli soccer. This is something he cares deeply about and has spoken about in the media on more than one occasion. He has lived and worked with Jews and Arabs, from Herzliya to Nazareth and from Ashdod to Sakhnin.</p> \n<p>His wife left Israel after her visa expired and now lives in Belgium. Asked why he doesn’t move there, he says he cannot get a Belgian visa, for reasons similar to those in Israel.</p> \n<p>“I have no idea where the rest of my family is, I haven’t been in touch with half of them for years,” Lenkebe says. “I want to build my family here in Israel with my wife. She also wants to live here. This is my place in the world. This is my home. I have nowhere else.”</p> \n<p>An inherited civil war</p> \n<p>For close to 20 years now, DR Congo, the fourth-largest nation in Africa with a population of some 84 million, has been in a state of chaos. Since 2001, the country has been headed by Joseph Kabila, who inherited the throne from his father along with one of the world’s most savage civil wars. “We’re waiting to see what happens in the next election,” says Lenkebe. “If Kabila wins, it will be a disaster for Congo.”</p> \n<p>One reason for its many wars is that DR Congo is rich in valuable resources: copper, diamonds and cobalt (the material from which smartphones are made). Combine that with a war culture fomented by various militias for decades, regional tribal conflicts, a government that doesn’t intervene but profits from the battles and quarries, and it all adds up to one of the toughest places on Earth.</p> \n<p>The country’s soccer stadiums have actually become one of the last places where criticism of the regime can be voiced. Earlier this month, the return match of the CAF Confederation Cup Final was held between Raja Casablanca and AS Vita, one of DR Congo’s biggest clubs, at Stade des Martyrs in the capital, Kinshasa. (Lenkebe played for AS Vita before moving to Maccabi Herzliya in 2006.)</p> \n<p>The venue was packed with 75,000 fans, whose singing and chanting created an electrifying atmosphere – a stark contrast to the situation outside the ground.</p> \n<p>Much of this chanting was directed against Kabila, with tensions mounting ahead of the presidential election later this month. Kabila initially said he wouldn’t run, but recently changed his mind and announced he would run again.</p> \n<p>“I watched the game and felt simultaneously happy and sad,” says Lenkebe. “I was happy to hear people taking a stand against Kabila, but I was also well aware that they were doing so in the stadium – because if it happened anywhere else, these people would soon go missing.</p> \n<p>“If Kabila is reelected, there will be trouble,” he adds. “If you saw the final of Vita against Raja [Vita lost 4-3 on aggregate], you could hear the fans chanting against him. The Moroccans came with security from the army and the Moroccan secret police. Is that a normal situation in which to play soccer?”</p> \n<p>Voice of the community</p> \n<p>According to Interior Ministry figures, there are just 404 Congolese citizens living in Israel. Many of them have been living in Israel for at least 10 years. Some arrived in the late 1990s, at the height of the civil war in DR Congo, and others made their way here after Kabila came to power. Hamoked – the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants says about half of the Congolese community here is now slated for deportation, while just a few have refugee status. It doesn’t matter how long they’ve been here or if they have family and jobs here. Whoever lacks a proper visa will be forced to leave the country by January 5.</p> \n<p>Lenkebe is one of them. To date, more than 180 new applications for refugee status have been submitted by Congolese in Israel. Interior Ministry policy says that someone whose application is being processed cannot be deported and returned to his country of origin. Lenkebe has a temporary UN visa that will expire on December 31; currently, no more visa applications that extend beyond January 5 may be submitted. So Lenkebe is one of nearly 200 now due to be deported back to DR Congo.</p> \n<p>“I’m speaking out on behalf of the Congolese community in Israel. Yes, it’s not a lot of people – just a few hundred – but you must understand: They have no voice. They don’t know what to do in a situation like this and they’re absolutely terrified to go back to the hell that’s in DR Congo.”</p> \n<p>Hamoked and several other human rights and civil rights organizations have called on the Interior Ministry to freeze its decision to deport the Congolese residing in Israel – at least until after the election there and stability is restored in the country.</p> \n<p>Lenkebe isn’t pinning much hope on the appeal that has been made to soccer’s governing body, FIFA, either. “I don’t think FIFA will do anything about it, just like the authorities in Israel,” he says. “In the best case, it will be the same situation as with Pedro [Galvan],” he says, referring to the Argentine soccer player who is the top foreign scorer in Israeli soccer but is also threatened with deportation after his contract expired with Hapoel Tel Aviv. “I’ll just sit and wait, and I won’t know what’s going on,” says Lenkebe. “I won’t be here or anywhere.”</p> \n<p>If his fears come true, we’ll see another foreign player who spent a major chunk of his career here, making Israel his home, forced to make an unpleasant departure from Israeli soccer. But unlike Galvan, who would return to Argentina, Lenkebe would be forced to return to the vicious civil war he escaped in 2006.</p> \n<p>The Population and Immigration Authority says its decision regarding Congolese citizens residing in Israel was made following an expert opinion from the Foreign Ministry, which was itself based on a UN ruling that Congolese not require collective protection.</p> \n<p>Uri Levy is the founder and editor-in-chief of BabaGol and an expert on Middle Eastern soccer.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Some of the prisoners in Wing 6 of the Ma’asiyahu Prison are counting the minutes until they are released early on Thursday. The atmosphere is thick with spices and the steam from the communal showers, and a feeling of chaos is in the air with prisoners going in and out of their cells in the evening, just before the regular inspection.</p> \n<p>Starting Thursday morning, 114 prisoners will be released early from Ma’asiyahu after a change in the law two months ago. A few hours before their release, the excitement is at its peak. “There is not a single person here who is not sitting and calculating how much the administrative [changes] will reduce his [sentence], everyone here is going crazy,” said one of the prisoners behind the thin bars of the steel door separating us during the search of the cells. “I’m getting out tomorrow, it shortened it for me by four months, it’s a gift from God.”</p> \n<p>The gates of 29 prisons will open on Thursday and 970 prisoners will be leave, months before their original release dates. The early release is an attempt to meet the orders of the High Court of Justice to provide minimal living space for all prisoners who were convicted of criminal and not security crimes and who are serving a sentence of no more than four years.</p> \n<p>They will be released early, regardless of the crimes they have committed, the prison they are in, their sex or ethnic origin. The only exceptions apply to security prisoners.</p> \n<p>The new law is good for A, sitting on one of the two bunk beds in Cell 13. He is only 22, but looks like a 14-year-old boy. A large black kippa rests on his head. His cell is very small, and he shares it with three other prisoners. All of them are large sized, and every inch of the cell is utilized for storage.</p> \n<p>In the bed next to him is a fiftyish man covered with a comforter and who once in a while glances at A. “It’s like winning $5 million,” he says about the moment two days ago when he was told he was one of those who would be getting out early. “Actually, forget about it, it’s something that is impossible to value in money. It’s like being born again. It’s air.”</p> \n<p>A was sentenced to six months in prison, a relatively short sentence, for possessing a handgun. “What was, was,” he says about the crime, refusing to say any more. He will be getting out after three months. He spent a year and eight months before that under house arrest. A hopes he can now leave his criminal past behind him. “The hardest thing here is the crowding. Look how we live,” he says. “No privacy. Without the barrier between the beds my feet would touch someone else’s head. The stool you’re sitting on is our dining table. I never thought it would be this way.”</p> \n<p>This cell is relatively pleasant. In two other wings of the prison, life is shared by eight prisoners in a cell of 18 square meters: 2,25 square meters per prisoner – much less than the 3 square meters per person mandated by the High Court. The conditions in Israeli prisons are unfit for human life, ruled the justices.</p> \n<p>No one in the Israel Prison Service is pleased about the mass early release program. It may make the overcrowding better, but a large number of those released are expected to return to prison through the revolving door of recidivism.</p> \n<p>“The public should not be in a panic because these people were anyway going to be released in another two or three months,” said the warden of Ma’asiyahu, Nili Toledano. “If it was up to me, I would have first released the prisoners who completed all the processes of rehabilitation, but the law set release unrelated to the crime and so we prepared appropriately: The police were updated about prisoners who are dangerous, sex offenders were transferred to [the unit that supervises sex offenders], and crime victims were informed of the expected release. There is an effort to limit the existing risk as much as possible,” she added.</p> \n<p>Toledano says she has despaired of the overcrowding in the prison. Parts of the building date back to the 1950s, and this is one of the better prisons. The Prisons Service has facilities dating back to the British Mandate era, and even earlier. “The release now has drastically reduced the overcrowding because the situation is very bad today, in particular in the summer,” said Toledano. “For me, as the commander, it is not good for eight prisoners to live in a room of 18 square meters because this friction causes violence, pressure. Now they will be five in a room, it changes the whole world.”</p> \n<p>The Prison Service is not the only one preparing for the early release. The police are readying themselves for confrontations outside the prison walls between former prisoners at odds with one another. At the same time, everyone understands that the recidivism rate is high. One of the prisoners for whom this is the second time inside says: “You see the people here? Half of them will return, it’s a fact.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Against the background of the U.S.-China trade war and concerns about China’s industrial espionage, Israel is moving forward with plans to vet foreign investment for the first time.</p> \n<p>Legislation that would set out the structure and terms for a government committee with the power to approve or order changes in deals involving foreign investors is being examined by National Security Council chief Meir Ben-Shabbat.</p> \n<p>Sponsored by Zionist Union lawmaker Omer Bar-Lev, the bill is due to be deliberated in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee next week and then go to the ministerial legislative committee.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;'Trump will be furious': Tension between U.S. and Israel over China infrastructure projects | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“The proposal isn’t aimed just at restricting investments by Chinese bodies,” Bar-Lev said. “If a Russian company wants to buy a cybersecurity company of a major tech company like Check Software, it will need to be vetted. So will investments by front companies registered in Luxembourg, let alone a private company that may have Arab parties behind it.”</p> \n<p>Prof. Avi Simhon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s economic adviser, told Knesset members last July that a plan to vet foreign investment was in the works and that matter was brought up in the security cabinet three weeks ago. Simhon has been working on the issue for two years.</p> \n<p>But, as Bar-Lev’s statement indicated, the bill’s backers have proceeded cautiously on the matter for fear of causing friction with China. Chinese companies are building ports in Ashdod and Haifa, and the Tel Aviv Light Railway. They have also become increasing important investors in Israeli high-tech companies.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has been encouraging Chinese investment both to draw in more foreign investment and as a way of strengthening bilateral ties.</p> \n<p>Chinese companies have been turned back multiple times in their quest to buy the Israeli insurance companies Phoenix and Clal, but that was the initiative of the capital markets regulators, who expressed concern over Chinese control of hundreds of billions of shekels in Israeli pension savings.</p> \n<p>In the case of defense companies, the Defense Ministry’s International Defense Cooperation Directorate can withdraw the export licenses of companies sold to foreign buyers. In any case, companies selling to the Israel Defense Forces sign secrecy agreements.</p> \n<p>Under the proposed legislation, foreign investments involving investing in, acquiring or merging with an Israeli company would be examined by a government committee.</p> \n<p>The businesses needing to seek approval would be involved in critical technology, connected with national infrastructure projects or companies with access to significant data on Israeli citizens. The latter would include companies in telecommunications, financial services and defense.</p> \n<p>The panel would have 30 days to examine a deal and an additional 15 days after that to publish its explanation for disallowing it. It could also give parties to a deal 60 days to amend it to meet the committee’s requirements for approval.</p> \n<p>The panel will include the finance, defense, public security and justice ministers, or their representatives, as well as the head of Israel’s National Cyber Authority. The finance minister will chair it.</p> \n<p>“The idea that the committee will be headed by the finance minister or his representative – and not a representative of the security establishment – is critical,” said Bar-Lev. “An important part of the proposal is preserving a balance between supervising the market and freedom to conduct business.”</p> \n<p>If Israel goes ahead with the plan it will be joining a worldwide trend. In August U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, which broadens the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment. In November European Union institutions agreed to terms of a planned mechanism to screen foreign direct investment within the bloc.</p>",

Two of the sheep died during the evacuation, as well as a lamb fetus carried by one of the sheep. Four other sheep died after the evacuation.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;How settlers use flocks of sheep to take over Palestinian land&nbsp;■&nbsp;A planned, calculated killing of sheep in the West Bank | Opinion</p> \n<p>A video filmed during the evacuation shows at least four workers loading the sheep on a truck. They can be seen holding the sheep by their legs or dragging them by their necks or front legs. The police filmed the entire evacuation, and the owner of the flock also filmed parts of the events.</p> \n<p>The owner, a resident of the outpost, filed a lawsuit against the Civil Administration for tens of thousands of shekels in damages caused to the sheep.</p> \n<p>Last month, the Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry found the suit justified. In a letter from the ministry’s legal department to Haim Bleicher, an attorney from the Honenu nonprofit organization&nbsp;(which is representing the owner of the sheep) the ministry refused to provide details on the process in which it was decided not to open a criminal investigation for animal abuse.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, the ministry did tell Bleicher that the contractor had received an administrative fine.</p> \n<p>“The Civil Administration severely harmed animals in a brutal manner despite the warnings and pleas of the flock’s owners to stop. The owners of the flock also said that if they had been informed in advance of the evacuation, they would have moved the flock by themselves in an appropriate manner,” said Bleicher.</p> \n<p>Even though the Agriculture Ministry ruled that the animals were abused and the evacuation caused the deaths of the sheep, the Civil Administration has not canceled its contracts with the contractor. The Civil Administration did confirm they were informed of the fine and knew of the incident.</p> \n<p>The Civil Administration said in a statement: “First, let us make clear that this is a serious incident that does not comply with the values of the Civil Administration and the contractor’s professional conduct. In addition, as part of the inquiry into the incident in the Civil Administration, a hearing was held for the contractor by the deputy head of the administration, during which the [contractor] took full responsibility and drew appropriate lessons.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Against the advice of many in his own administration, President Donald Trump is pulling U.S. troops out of Syria. Could a withdrawal from Afghanistan be far behind?</p> \n<p>Trump has said his instinct is to quit Afghanistan as a lost cause, but more recently he’s suggested a willingness to stay in search of peace with the Taliban. However, the abruptness with which he turned the page on Syria raises questions about whether combat partners like Iraq and Afghanistan should feel confident that he will not pull the plug on them, too.</p> \n<p>“If he’s willing to walk away from Syria, I think we should be concerned about whether Afghanistan is next,” Jennifer Cafarella, the director of intelligence planning at the Institute for the Study of War, said in an interview Wednesday.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Trump's pullout leaves Russia holding the cards in Syria, to Israel's bitter disappointment&nbsp;■&nbsp;Despite the blow to its national security, Israel will bow to Trump’s Syria withdrawal&nbsp;■&nbsp;How Assad helped create ISIS to win in Syria and got away with the crime of the century</p> \n<p>The U.S. has been at war in Afghanistan for 17 years and still has about 15,000 troops there helping government troops combat the Taliban. The approximately 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq are training and advising Iraqi security forces as they continue to fight Islamic State militants, a battle the U.S. entered in 2014 after IS swept into Iraq from Syria.</p> \n<p>Before other officials confirmed the withdrawal decision, Trump tweeted, “We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.” The aspect of this that he did not address is whether the extremists or others will fill the security vacuum created by the U.S. withdrawal to regroup and pose a new threat.</p> \n<p>The administration said it intends to continue combatting Islamic State extremists globally and could return to Syria if necessary. Still, critics launched a barrage of questions about the implications of Trump’s decision, including whether it opens the door for Turkish forces to attack the Syrian Kurds who had partnered with the U.S.</p> \n<p>Kori Schake, deputy director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on the Atlantic.com website Wednesday that the Syria decision ought to unsettle every ally that relies on U.S. security assurances.</p> \n<p>“The governments of Iraq and Afghanistan ought to be very, very worried,” she wrote. “For if Syria can be so lightly written off, the fight arbitrarily declared won, what is the argument for continuing to assist Iraq — where ISIS is even more defeated? And if Trump has so little interest in stabilizing security and assisting governance in Syria, how can Afghanistan have confidence that he won’t make the same decision about them, when the fight there is costlier and progress less evident?”</p> \n<p>These and other questions about the Trump decision and its broader implications were on the minds of many in Congress. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, denounced what he called a betrayal of the Syrian Kurds.</p> \n<p>“Now the President seems content to forsake their trust and abandon them to a potentially bloody conflict with Turkey,” Reed said. “This decision also significantly increases the security risks to our key regional partners in Israel, Iraq and Jordan.”</p> \n<p>Trump has argued for a Syria withdrawal since he was a presidential candidate in 2016, and he has repeated his view several times since taking office. Still, the decision appeared to catch many in his administration by surprise; Pentagon officials offered no details on the timing or pace of the withdrawal, nor could they square it with numerous statements by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis about the importance of remaining in Syria to assure stability.</p> \n<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and typically a Trump supporter, said he was “blindsided” by the decision and called it “a disaster in the making.” He said, “The biggest winners in this are ISIS and Iran.”</p> \n<p>Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said the withdrawal would be a “grave error with broader implications” beyond the fight against IS. He called it “one more example of how the United States is not a reliable partner.”</p> \n<p>Just last week, the U.S. special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, Brett McGurk, said U.S. troops would remain in Syria even after the Islamic State militants were driven from their strongholds.</p> \n<p>“I think it’s fair to say Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring,” McGurk told reporters on Dec. 11. “Nobody is declaring a mission accomplished. Defeating a physical caliphate is one phase of a much longer-term campaign.”</p> \n<p>And two weeks ago, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. still has a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilize the country. He said it will take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of them have been trained.</p>",

Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight...&quot;</p> \n<p>Trump also tweeted that the decision to withdraw from the war-torn country &quot;was no surprise.&quot;</p> \n<p>Trump went on to explain the move, writing: &quot;I've been campaigning on it for years,&quot; the U.S. president continued, &quot;and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer. Russia, Iran, Syria &amp; others are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing there work. Time to come home &amp; rebuild. #MAGA&quot;</p> \n<p>He also addressed criticism of the decision, writing: &quot;Russia, Iran, Syria &amp; many others are not happy about the U.S. leaving, despite what the Fake News says, because now they will have to fight ISIS and others, who they hate, without us. I am building by far the most powerful military in the world.

I fear it will lead to devastating consequences for our nation, the region, and throughout the world.&quot;</p> \n<p>Earlier Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that while he agreed with Trump that Islamic State had mostly been defeated, he did not understand what the American withdrawal from Syria meant because he has not seen signs of it yet.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Russian president warned that there is a risk that ISIS militants would regroup, and called U.S. military presence in Syria illegitimate.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;said that Israel will continue to defend itself &quot;against Iran's attempt to entrench itself in Syria,&quot; noting that Israel doesn't intend to reduce efforts to curb Iranian aggression and to destroy terror tunnels on the Israel-Lebanon border.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu said that he is aware that Israeli actions are being carried out &quot;with the full support and backing of the U.S.&quot;</p> \n<p>Washington's Kurdish partners warned that the move will allow Islamic State to regroup at a critical stage in the conflict, echoing alarm expressed by Western allies.</p> \n<p>The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said Trump's withdrawal of all U.S. troops would also leave Syrians stuck between &quot;the claws of hostile parties&quot; fighting for territory in the seven-year-old war.</p> \n<p>Trump's announcement on Wednesday upended a central pillar of American policy in the Middle East and stunned U.S. lawmakers and allies, who challenged the president's claim of victory.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Amnesty International, probably the world’s most respected human rights monitoring organization, has just published a report on the online abuse of female politicians and journalists on Twitter, with a particular focus on Britain.</p> \n<p>The results, sadly, are not surprising. Women in public life are targets of disproportionate vitriolic attacks and degrading slander, demeaning them and seeking to silence their voices. No less surprisingly, prominent women from ethnic minorities are particular targets of Twitter abuse combining racism and misogyny.</p> \n<p>There is one surprising feature in the Amnesty report however. You only need a very passing interest in British politics to have been aware that over the past three and a half years, since Jeremy Corbyn shot out of obscurity to become leader of the Labour Party, female Jewish members of parliament and journalists in Britain have been consistently singled for abuse, not only on Twitter, but often also in real life.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Mix Together anti-Semitism and Misogyny. For Jewish Women in Public Life, the Results Are Terrifying</p> \n<p>Strangely, this didn’t even warrant a mention in Amnesty’s report. When questioned about this glaring omission, the organization responded that, &quot;despite our best efforts, we didn’t have enough data about the Jewish background of the women in our sample.&quot;</p> \n<p>How to explain such a blatant lie?</p> \n<p>There is absolutely no way Amnesty’s researchers and the compilers of the report could have made their &quot;best efforts&quot; and not come up with enough data to prove that female politicians in Britain, who openly celebrate their Jewish identity, have been inordinately singled out on Twitter for constant abuse.</p> \n<p>The only possible conclusion is that Amnesty has consciously decided that anti-Semitism is not a form of racism worthy of its notice. There could be many reasons for that. Perhaps they think Jews are too privileged, too white, too wealthy and too protected, that hatred directed at them should be regarded as a threat to their civil and human rights.</p> \n<p>Maybe they’ve bought in to the prevalent theory on the left that nearly all Jew-hatred can be explained away as being &quot;legitimate criticism of Israel.&quot; It’s likely that highlighting anti-Semitism doesn’t fit in well with the political leanings of Amnesty’s leadership, its fundraising and the personal agendas of its researchers.</p> \n<p>But while the anger with Amnesty over its obviously intentional ignorance of hate-speech towards Jewish women is entirely justified, I find it difficult to forget that when it comes to monitoring anti-Semitism, also the most prominent Jewish organization in the world in that field is abusing its mandate.</p> \n<p>Last month, the Anti-Defamation League decided that it was its role to castigate,&nbsp;in a public letter, a website that allows people from around the world to rent out properties, Airbnb, for its decision to &quot;de-list&quot; properties on settlements in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>You can argue that it isn’t Airbnb’s job to intervene in political issues and question why the company has not done the same with other &quot;contested&quot; regions around the world. But even if it’s controversial, it’s still a perfectly legitimate decision not to include on your website properties within settlements which according to the consensus of the overwhelming majority of experts in international law, were built illegally.</p> \n<p>This is not a boycott of Israel (which 50 years since the 1967 Six Day War, has yet to extend its sovereignty to the West Bank) or of Jews anywhere. Airbnb users can still rent on its site hundreds of thousands of Jewish-owned properties in Israel and around the world. Just not in illegal West Bank settlements.</p> \n<p>So why was it even ADL’s business to comment on the issue? The only conceivable reasons for its letter to Airbnb could be its leadership’s politics or pressure from donors.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How does sticking up for settlers, who many, if not most Jews around the world oppose, fit in with ADL’s mandate of fighting anti-Semitism &quot;and all forms of hate&quot;?</p> \n<p>What’s worse? Amnesty International’s whitewashing anti-Semitism out of existence, or the ADL’s cynical manipulation of the term to include the denial of the right of a small proportion of the Jewish people to build homes on militarily-occupied land?</p> \n<p>The definition of anti-Semitism has never been so politicized. The Corbynist left in Britain is busy redefining it to only include hatred of Jews emanating from the far-right, while leaving Jews who are not entirely critical of Israel’s very existence, even and especially if they are female Labour MPs, as fair game.</p> \n<p>In the United States, the right, including sadly many Jews, is intent on focusing only on Muslim and black anti-Semites, while ignoring the very real threat to Jews from white supremacists, boosted by President Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has only one litmus test for foreign politicians. If, like the current leaders of Hungary, Poland and Lithuania, they’re supportive of his policies, uninterested in the Palestinian issue or the Iran nuclear deal and willing to consider moving their country’s embassy to Jerusalem some time in the future, they can be as hostile as they like on their own turf towards local Jews and even revise the history of the Holocaust, they will be welcomed in the Prime Minister’s Office as friends of the Jewish people and given a guided tour of Yad Vashem.</p> \n<p>As Batya Ungar-Sargon poignantly put it last week in The Forward - “Netanyahu truly can’t see the anti-Semitism of his fellow leaders of ethno-states for what it is, because despite engaging in anti-Semitism against the Jews in their own countries, these leaders are, in fact, Zionists.”</p> \n<p>This summer in Britain, Corbyn’s Labour was tearing itself in to shreds over whether or not it could accept the anti-Semitism definition established by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, and whether official caveats should be applied.</p> \n<p>Sadly, the one question not being asked is: why there was even a need for an official definition?</p> \n<p>The answer is that in an era when ignorant and bigoted men like Trump and Corbyn, who were once consigned to the margins of society, but have now been propelled to leadership positions, we tend to fall back on problematic legal definitions of what should have been obvious to every decent human being.</p> \n<p>So what to do in an age when fringe elements and racist freaks have become mainstream? When even the most respected &quot;anti-racism&quot; NGOs, let alone western governments and political parties, can no longer be trusted, to tell basic truths?</p> \n<p>When even the sensible New York Time Book Review uncritically interviews writer Alice Walker, already notorious for being a fan of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, who only recently published poems lambasting the Talmud as a source of evil&nbsp;and saying that she loves Jews, just not &quot;the Zionist Nazis,&quot; who lists the Holocaust-denying David Icke as one of the writers currently inspiring her?</p> \n<p>We are living in a time when there are no longer trustworthy arbiters of what is acceptable to say about Jews. It’s not all bad. Jews, whether in Israel or the Diaspora, are physically protected and secure like never before and that’s much more important than being protected from hate speech, which is anyway rightly protected by freedom of speech.</p> \n<p>But in times when we have no faith in politicians and watchdogs to confront hate and protect its victims, we can only rely on our common decency and common sense. That's all we have.</p>",

        "text":["<p>An activist Jewish sociologist, I have long been fascinated by Jewish views on the sensitive subject of assimilation. Assimilation is ordinarily seen as taking the explicit form of intermarriage, or the subtler version of shedding religious and ethnic Jewish identifications in favor of blending in with the larger society.</p> \n<p>Suppose, though, there is another, more threatening assimilation problem: the abandonment, by Jewish figures in public life in America and in Israel, of the core ethics that have shaped Judaism and Jewish consciousness.</p> \n<p>That second threat to our Jewish world as we know is in front of our eyes. There are at least two dozen Jewish Trump appointees - including Stephen Miller, Jason Greenblatt, David Friedman, Steven Mnuchin and&nbsp;Jared Kushner.</p> \n<p>We now see Jews like these who willingly collaborate with a president who encourages white supremacists, racists and anti-Semites. He even invited two overtly anti-Semitic Christian fundamentalist preachers to speak at the ill-advised opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>What is going on here?</p> \n<p>The heart of the Jewish ethical mission is the attempt to negate the brutalities and inhumane practices that were rampant at the time of the writing of classic Jewish texts and beyond, through mandating justice and righteousness, valuing human life above all and working for social justice.</p> \n<p>Jews can be said to have invented social criticism. The Biblical prophets were the social critics of their era. They reminded kings and citizens of the differences between corruption and justice, which is the core of Jewish ethics.</p> \n<p>The Jewish ethical core has for millennia rubbed raw the nerves and sensibilities of self-serving elites throughout the world.</p> \n<p>From tikkun olam, to &quot;Love thy neighbor as thyself&quot; to &quot;Whatever is hurtful to&nbsp;you,&nbsp;do not do&nbsp;to any&nbsp;other&nbsp;person.&quot; And this less -known statement from the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 54b-55a):</p> \n<p>Anyone who is able to protest against the transgressions of one's household and does not, is punished for the actions of the members of the household; anyone who is able to protest against the transgressions of one's townspeople and does not, is punished for the transgressions of the townspeople; anyone who is able to protest against the transgressions of the entire world and does not is punished for the transgressions of the entire world.</p> \n<p>And more recently, from the civil rights activist rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel: &quot;The opposite of good is not evil; the opposite of good is indifference. In a free society, some are guilty, but all are responsible.&quot;</p> \n<p>In Israel, with his insistence on Israel as nation-ghetto, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to complete Israel’s transformation from a beleaguered country trying to survive to a state that, in his own words, lives forever by the sword.</p> \n<p>Forget his cynical co-optation of religious terminology and endless rhetorical repetitions of Israel as Jewish, Jewish, Jewish: Netanyahu and his rightwing government have abandoned the ethical core of Judaism in favor of an obsession with power.</p> \n<p>Many Jews in Israel and the United States complain that Israel is no different from other countries that repress and persecute minorities. They have a point, but those other countries did not proclaim 3000 years ago that they had come upon a strikingly new ethical truth from On High, and reiterate those Biblical texts as legitimacy and justification for state policies.</p> \n<p>What is so Jewish or ethical about Netanyahu’s policies? Is Jewish machismo to replace Jewish ethics?</p> \n<p>Those Jews who abandon the prophetic vision in favor of wealth and power are assimilating to the life-denying, justice and planet-threatening values of societies that have sucked countless religious and secular people and movements into their jaws where they chew them up and spit them out to negate empathy, compassion, and decency.</p> \n<p>It surely delights anti-Semites that Jewish right-wingers in the United States and Israel conflate ritual observance with ethical behavior, as if there was the unified &quot;Jewish character&quot; anti-Semites endlessly fantasize about.</p> \n<p>Those Jewish right-wingers constantly point to the Orthodox Jews in Trump’s inner circle, as if proving the administration is both Jew-friendly and Jewish values-friendly. They celebrate Jared Kushner, because of his overt religious practices, and denounce Bernie Sanders, whose approach to politics and social change represents far more closely the Jewish ethical core.</p> \n<p>Were I an anti-Semite, I would delight in what is going on in Washington D.C. The most corrupt, wealth-obsessed, power-hungry U.S. presidency in history has surrounded itself with compliant Jews.</p> \n<p>And at the same time, Netanyahu is a leader who elevates the norms of power over those of compassion and justice, who declares it's better to live by the sword and ditches solidarity with Jews around the world - and the sublimely revolutionary Jewish ethics - for alliances with ethno-nationalists.</p> \n<p>It is up to Jews in America, Israel, and elsewhere to shed light on the damage right-wing Jews in power do to the very foundations of Judaism itself. This is arguably the far greater and more urgent Jewish assimilation problem we face.</p> \n<p>Gordon Fellman is Professor of Sociology at Brandeis University, where he also chairs its undergraduate interdisciplinary program in Peace, Conflict, and Coexistence Studies</p>",

        "text":["<p>Following a series of highly publicized walkouts on Taglit-Birthright trips this summer, the organization has revised the contract participants on its 10-day, free tours of Israel are required to sign.</p> \n<p>A new clause included in the contract appears aimed at preventing a recurrence of such fiascos, which caused considerable embarrassment to the organization and were unprecedented in its nearly 20-year history. The clause is included in all the contracts signed in the current winter season.</p> \n<p>The new clause appears under the “Code of Conduct” section of the contract, which is known as the “Gift Waiver and Permission Agreement.” It suggests – though it does not say so explicitly – that participants who disrupt trips could face sanctions.</p> \n<p>A key excerpt reads as follows: “Taglit-Birthright Israel expects each participant to maintain the personal integrity needed to build the intimate, intense and holistic group experience that typifies its trips. In order to ensure the trip’s overall integrity and educational mission, Taglit-Birthright Israel rejects any attempt, by any individual or organization, to manipulate its open climate. Efforts to coerce, force or suppress opinions, hijack a discussion or create an unwarranted provocation violate Taglit-Birthright Israel’s founding principles and will not be permitted.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Young U.S. Jews would engage more on Israel if Birthright didn't lie about the occupation ■&nbsp;How Birthright guides (don't) discuss the West Bank ■&nbsp;Between Adelson and BDS, Birthright has become a political battlefield&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>This past summer, activists affiliated with IfNotNow, an anti-occupation movement, organized walkouts on several Birthright trip to protest what they charged was the program’s one-sided take on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The walkouts were live-streamed on social media and shared widely.</p> \n<p>Participants who left their trips subsequently joined activists from Breaking the Silence, an organization of former Israeli combat soldiers fighting the occupation, on trips to the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Movement activists also handed out flyers, containing information about Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, to Birthright participants flying out of JFK Airport in New York.</p> \n<p>When asked if the new clause in the contract was prompted by the walkouts this past summer, a spokeswoman for Birthright refused to comment. She also refused to explain what the organization meant when it warned in the contract that such activities “will not be permitted” and specifically, whether participants engaging in such activities would be thrown out or sent home.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;IfNotNow Hijacked Our Birthright Trip </p> \n<p>As reported in Haaretz last week, Birthright is experiencing a sharp drop in registration and participation rates this winter season, as compared with last winter. According to five trip organizers who spoke with Haaretz, the drop ranges from 20 percent to 50 percent, depending on the trip organizer. Birthright acknowledged that its numbers were down this season and blamed the decline on the fact that the first registration days for the winter season coincided with the Jewish High Holy Days.</p> \n<p>The trip providers told Haaretz they were not entirely sure of the reasons for the downturn but offered several possible explanations.</p> \n<p>One explanation was that because eligibility requirements have been loosened in recent years, young Jews feel less of a sense of urgency nowadays to register for the program. In the past, the program was open only to participants aged 18 to 26. &nbsp;In a bid to expand the applicant pool, Birthright announced a few years ago that anyone up to the age of 32 would be eligible.</p> \n<p>Trip providers have also speculated that the downturn could reflect the well-documented fact that young American Jews are growing increasingly disengaged from Israel, and have less and less interest in visiting the country – even when the trips are free.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;Earlier this month, a petition signed by 1,500 Jewish students – demanding that Birthright include in its itinerary Palestinian speakers able to address the realities of occupation&nbsp;– was delivered to Hillel directors at over 30 campuses across the United States.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;petition was organized by J Street U, the campus affiliate of the pro-Israel, anti-occupation advocacy group. Hillel, the largest Jewish student organization in the world, is a major recruiter for Birthright.</p>",

        "text":["<p>If Rona Ramon had been the widow of an important intellectual or esteemed doctor who was killed in a car accident on the Arava Highway with their son, would her death from an illness have become such an extraordinary national event? Would Israel’s president have eulogized her, would the prime minister have filed by her coffin? Would her casket have been placed at the Peres Center for Peace? Would the public have come in droves to file by her coffin?</p> \n<p>Would Israel Hayom have headlined its story on her death “You are All In Heaven”? Would Yediot Ahronoth have devoted nine pages and countless clich&eacute;s – “Death of a Fighter,” “A Righteous Israeli,” “Embodiment of the Dream of Generations” – to it? And if in addition to working for the Ramon Foundation on behalf of “academic excellence and social leadership,” being the widow of an air force pilot and the bereaved mother of an air force pilot, she had also volunteered with Machsom Watch or was an activist in the Parents Circle-Families Forum – would she still have been turned into a national hero?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Those who shun the grief over Ramon’s death are only arrogant | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ramon’s story is truly and monumentally tragic. Her pilot husband was killed in the Columbia space shuttle disaster, her pilot son was killed in a training accident, and now comes her death from cancer at a young age.</p> \n<p>This is the stuff of which drama, a book or a film is made – but a cultural hero? A national hero with an honorary doctorate and the honor of lighting a torch at the Independence Day ceremony?</p> \n<p>Who was Rona Ramon? Most Israelis know nothing about her, including about her activity on behalf of children, which everyone is admiring so much now. Israel has been instructed to worship her because Israel worships bereavement and wallows in the ritual of death, especially of soldiers, and of pilots most of all. Israel has been trained to admire her because Israel admires “the mother of sons,” a generic name. It’s no wonder that her counterpart in this national role, the other mother of sons, Miriam Peretz, was the one to eulogize her.</p> \n<p>Until Ramon’s husband was killed in the space shuttle accident, no one had heard of her. Until her son was killed in a training accident, she was still just the widow of the first Hebrew astronaut. The deaths that struck twice are what made her a mythic figure. Widow of and bereaved mother of, not so much because of who she was herself. If not for her personal tragedies, no one would have heard of her.</p> \n<p>Then came her public appearances. Not much was said there, hardly anything, but they enhanced her image and made it a heroic myth, as if she had chosen her tragedies. And then came her death from cancer at a young age – and the national tragedy soared. Her body was placed in the wooden coffin in which her husband’s remains were transported, a coffin kept by the air force. Now her name will be added to the institutions and airports that were named for her husband and son.</p> \n<p>This country does not lack for tragedies, but the way Ramon is being turned into a cultural hero says a lot more about Israel than it does about the sad fate of the woman who died, as wonderful as those who knew her may attest she was.</p> \n<p>Israel yearns for heroes. When they can’t be found, it is desperate to invent them, sometimes out of nothing. It is ready to accept its heroes mainly if they are dead, preferably in uniform, ideally in air force blues.</p> \n<p>Had Ilan Ramon been an infantry commander who was killed in an accident in the territories, and had Asaf Ramon been killed in a tank accident in the Golan Heights, they likely would not have become the mythic figures they are. Death in the air is not like death on the ground; a pilot is not the same as a foot soldier.</p> \n<p>The widow and the bereaved mother also filled her prescribed role to a tee: taking precisely the Israeli middle line, with no deviation whatsoever; not saying anything that could be controversial; representing the military tragedies, militaristic heroism and macho strength; a woman whose image was defined not by herself, but by the men in her life. This is how we like our heroes. But of what substance are they?</p>",

        "text":["<p>The U.S. President is weak. He is running away, with America’s tail between its legs. He is abandoning Israel, betraying the Kurds and sticking a knife in the back of Bashar Assad’s opponents. He is strengthening Iran, handing a victory to Russia, throwing a lifeline to ISIS and encouraging radical Islam. This is what Benjamin Netanyahu and his disciples would undoubtedly be reciting now, if the U.S. President’s name were Barack Hussein Obama, with added emphasis on his middle name, so that everyone gets the message.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; U.S. starts withdrawing from Syria but campaign not over, White House says</p> \n<p>But the President of the U.S. is Donald Trump, Lion of Judea, Cyrus incarnate, Netanyahu’s soul mate and the best friend that Israel ever had. He abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and told the Palestinians where to get off. So that when it is Trump who suddenly decides to withdraw 2000 American troops from Syria, Israel understands. It respects any decision. Its criticism, if at all, will be nuanced and coated with sugar. And it will pray that its apprehensions about the American move are not borne out.</p> \n<p>This is what happens to a country and a prime minister who have wagered all their chips on empty gestures, such as the embassy move, at the expense of the far greater and more immediate threat on its northern border. This is what happens when one relies on evangelicals - who couldn’t care less about Syria, at best, or are praying for it to spark the war of Gog and Magog, at worst - as its sole advocate in Washington. This is what awaits an Israeli leader who gets bogged down in the thick molasses of flattery and kowtowing to a U.S. President, to the extent that he effectively loses any ability to challenge him or to enlist Congress and public opinion against his decisions. This is the destiny of a prime minister who is terrified that any direct public rebuke could make Trump blow his top and endanger the beautiful friendship he worked so hard to build.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;560,000 killed in Syria’s war according to updated death toll&nbsp;| Timeline</p> \n<p>In the next few weeks and months, Israel will watch with bated breath as the U.S. relinquishes much of its ability to influence events on the ground in Syria. Although U.S. officials promised on Wednesday to maintain the U.S. air campaign, without a significant ground presence, its deterrence will be weakened, its ability to quickly deploy troops on the ground will disappear and its impact on a final settlement of the Syrian civil war will diminish dramatically.</p> \n<p>The withdrawal, announced on Wednesday by U.S. defense officials, concedes hegemony in Syria to the Kremlin, either because this is what Trump promised in his election campaign or as part of a more nefarious payoff, of the kind that is now being investigated by Robert Mueller.</p> \n<p>According to reports in U.S. media, Trump overruled senior army and Pentagon officials, who objected to the quick pullback. Trump tweeted on Wednesday “We have defeated ISIS” but U.S. defense experts claim that the Islamic terrorists continue to hold significant swaths of territory in northern Syria, that the organization is definitely down, but certainly not out. If a worst case scenario emerges, history might list Trump’s ISIS braggadocio alongside George Bush’s woeful 2003 declaration “Mission Accomplished” on Iraq or Senator George Aiken’s famous 1966 recommendation that the U.S. declare victory in Vietnam before it scurries away.</p> \n<p>Trump’s decision is likely to accelerate an expected Turkish offensive against the Kurdish enclaves in northern Syria. Fear of a clash with U.S. troops has hitherto deterred Turkish President Erdogan from launching the onslaught, but it turns out that it scared Trump even more.</p> \n<p>The Kurds, who were armed by the U.S. and manned the front lines of the war on ISIS, will now be left to fend for themselves against a bigger and stronger Turkish army, which takes no prisoners. For them, Trump’s withdrawal is a great betrayal, and possibly a gateway to disaster and massacre.</p> \n<p>The imminent U.S. withdrawal has symbolic and not only military portent. Solve your own problems, the White House is telling the Middle East. You will soon be alone, against the Kremlin, the Ayatollahs in Tehran and Assad’s murderous regime, it is signaling Israel. We are no longer engaged. We’ve spent too much money on your fruitless wars already. After all, we are for America First, not America and Israel first, in case you misheard.</p> \n<p>Israel will know how to defend itself, Netanyahu said on Wednesday, putting on a brave face. It’s quite possible he’s right. But it will be doing so from a weakened position, with its big brother no longer behind it, at a time when its room for maneuver has been seriously curtailed already, in the wake of the September downing of the Russian aircraft over Latakia.</p> \n<p>Trump’s decision, if it stays in force, inflicts a direct and harsh blow on Israel’s national security, but Jerusalem will accept the setback with empathy and love. It will now have to pretend that the spit from the White House is actually the bountiful rain we’ve all been waiting for.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Data from the Israel Democracy Institute regarding demographic changes in ultra-Orthodox society should worry decision makers as well as every citizen. They show that the number of ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) men in yeshivas and kollels (yeshivas for married men) shot up in 2017 to 114,100, compared to 94,000 in 2014, a rise of 21 percent in only three years.</p> \n<p>Moreover, for the first time since higher education programs aimed at Haredim started opening in 1998, there was a drop in the number of Haredim enrolled, from 9,600 people to 9,400.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;More ultra-Orthodox students enroll in yeshivas but fewer go to academic institutions</p> \n<p>These statistics combine with data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, which show that the trend toward employment among Haredi men has also reversed; for three straight quarters there has been a drop in the employment rate of Haredi men, and in the third quarter of 2018 it fell to 47.8 percent.</p> \n<p>According to professional sources, the primary reason for this reversal is this government’s policy changes regarding allowances and an increase in the budgets of yeshivas and kollels.</p> \n<p>These numbers are part of the disastrous results of political agreements signed by the current government. In 2012 to 2014, the government, at the initiative of then-Finance Minister Yair Lapid, cut support for yeshiva students who hadn’t served in the army and almost totally eliminated the budget for foreign students studying in Israel’s Haredi institutions. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has, in his current government, allowed all this funding to be restored.</p> \n<p>Far-reaching coalition agreements have stymied long-term efforts to increase ultra-Orthodox participation in the job market. These figures are particularly worrisome because they conflict with the government’s plan for integrating Haredi men into the labor market, which calls for their employment rate to reach 63 percent by 2020. This goal now seems far from realistic.</p> \n<p>The government was irresponsible when it yielded to the demands of Haredi political representatives. The allowances and support for yeshivas and yeshiva students must be gradually stopped, because they provide a disincentive for Haredim to integrate into the labor market, something that harms all the country’s citizens.</p> \n<p>Along with gradually stopping the allowances and support, the government must cooperate with people in the ultra-Orthodox community who are working to increase Haredi independence and their integration into the wider society. These people are not represented on the political level; in fact, they are often in conflict with the Haredi community’s official political representation. These people should be the allies of any responsible government, not the politicians who perpetuate the lagging employment of their voters, do them damage and undermine the country’s future.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz's lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Police Maj. Gen. (ret.) Menashe Arbiv, former commander of Lahav 433, the police anti-fraud unit, was sentenced Wednesday to a suspended four months in prison and to 200 hours of community service for failing to report ties he had with Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto, who was jailed for bribery, as well as two offers of bribery he had received from Pinto. Arbiv also failed to report that Pinto was aware of the investigation being conducted into his affairs.</p> \n<p>As part of a plea bargain Arbiv made with the police’s internal investigations department, he admitted to not fulfilling a formal obligation, and the charges of fraud and breach of trust were dropped. The two sides could not agree on a sentence. The state asked for community service while Arbiv’s attorneys Yehoshua Reznik and Yinon Sartel asked that his conviction be struck, with a lighter sentence of community service imposed instead.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The president of the Magistrate Court in Rishon Letzion, Judge Einat Ron, determined that “Arbiv’s actions undermined the police’s image and the public’s trust in it. The high office he held caused a larger impact on public trust,” she said. She denied his attorneys’ request to strike his conviction but accepted their position regarding the sentence, ruling for a lighter one than the prosecution had asked for.</p> \n<p>Pinto was the one who implicated Arbiv, in an attempt to lighten his own sentence, following Pinto’s offer of a bribe to the late Brig. Gen. Effi Bracha. Pinto made a deal with state prosecutors, in which he’d give information about Arbiv in exchange for them requesting a one-year sentence. According to the charges Arbiv confessed to, he sought the assistance of Pinto and his associates in, among other things, finding work for his son.</p> \n<p>In the course of their acquaintance Pinto offered Arbiv financial help, starting when the latter was the commander of the Tel Aviv District police, and later, when he was the police representative in the U.S. Pinto later offered Arbiv $60,000 for speaking to then-head of the police’s investigations division, Yoav Segalovich, about Pinto’s investigation.</p> \n<p>The Welfare Ministry’s probation service, which assesses the degree of responsibility assumed by people on trial before recommending a sentence, recommended a favorable response to the request to cancel Arbiv’s conviction and to sentencing him to working for the public, which differs from community service, which is tantamount to a prison sentence.</p> \n<p>In her decision, Rom wrote that “not reporting and hiding facts went beyond causing damage to a particular investigation – it was a serious betrayal of the trust placed in the accused by his commanders and the organization he worked for, an organization charged with enforcement of the law and with ensuring public security. The accused was familiar with the inner workings of police investigations, making him well aware of the significance of not reporting and its ramifications. His actions continued for a long period. On several occasions he could and should have reported his acquaintance with Rabbi Pinto and the nature of their relationship, but he failed to do so. He maintained his contact with Pinto and his people.”</p> \n<p>According to the prosecutor at the hearing, which took place two months ago, “even though the accused was updated about suspicions that Pinto was secretly running a non-profit organization and was trying to obstruct an investigation against him, and was asked by the head of the fraud department to help in the investigation in his role as police representative in Washington, the accused did not see fit to report his relations with Pinto, and even continued to host Pinto and his wife at a hotel.”</p> \n<p>Arbiv, 59, is currently a businessman. He set up a company dealing with security and strategy management. He expressed concern that he would be unable to work as a private investigator if he were convicted of a criminal offense. The judge related to this, saying a conviction would not necessarily rule out a license, and that this would be considered by a licensing committee.</p> \n<p>In an earlier hearing Arbiv said he was no criminal. “Between not reporting and crime there is a big gap. I never hurt my organization or system. I served in the police for 37 years without blemish. I never received or gave Pinto and his people any benefits or information about my work. I was not one of his associates.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>A yeshiva for Christians?</p> \n<p>Strange as it sounds, some Christians prefer getting their Bible lessons from Jewish teachers – ideally, Orthodox rabbis. Evidence that such demand is on the rise can be found in the growing number of initiatives cropping up around Israel with this particular audience in mind.</p> \n<p>“It’s become a phenomenon,” says Rivkah Lambert Adler, an Orthodox-Jewish educator who is active in several such ventures. “What we’re seeing is a profound hunger and thirst among Christians for authentic Torah teaching,” adds the 59-year-old.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; What do Jews really do in yeshiva? Reverse-engineer the will of God</p> \n<p>By Christians she mainly means evangelical Christians, who tend to take the Bible very literally and see events playing out in Israel these days as fulfillment of its prophecies.</p> \n<p>“Many of these Christians see the Jewish people as leaders in Bible scholarship and as individuals who are able to open the door to a better understanding of the Hebraic roots of their own faith,” says Lambert Adler, who published a book on the subject last year called “Ten From the Nations: Torah Awakening Among Non-Jews.”</p> \n<p>The title is based on a biblical verse she believes has inspired this new trend: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts: In those days it shall come to pass, that 10 men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, shall even take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying: We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you” (Zechariah 8:23).</p> \n<p>Root Source, one of the first ventures of its kind, was launched in April 2014 by Gidon Ariel, an Orthodox Jew, and Bob O’Dell, a Christian philanthropist and high-tech entrepreneur.</p> \n<p>For up to $27 a month or $270 a year (there are three pricing levels, “in the spirit of Leviticus 5:6-11”), subscribers to Root Source can access prerecorded lectures on topics that include biblical Hebrew, women in the Bible, Jewish prayer, the Holy Temple, God, Moses and the Book of Proverbs.</p> \n<p>Although it may be a bit off-topic, one of the most popular courses offered at this online school is apparently “Islam – Insights and Deceptions.” A blurb about the course notes that it “uses scriptures from the Old Testament and occasionally even the New Testament to make the case that Islam is extremely dangerous.”</p> \n<p>Torah School for the Nations, founded by Lambert Adler earlier this year, focuses more on face-to-face learning. Her project offers evangelicals visiting Israel during the three biblical feasts – Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot – the opportunity to participate in a full day of Torah study.</p> \n<p>It held its first such teach-in last Passover in the West Bank settlement of Ma’aleh Adumim, where Lambert Adler lives. “But so many people wanted to join that the next two times, for lack of space, we had to move it to Jerusalem,” she says. The price is $75 per participant per day, including a kosher lunch.</p> \n<p>“Ultimately, my dream is to have a brick-and-mortar facility that operates year-round,” she says.</p> \n<p>‘A few thousand’ participants</p> \n<p>Yeshiva for the Nations, launched about a year ago, bills itself as “an online academy that offers authentic Torah classes designed for non-Jews.” Like Root Source, it is a Jewish-Christian partnership. The Jewish partner, Rabbi Tuly Weisz, is an Orthodox rabbi who immigrated to Israel from the United States and has been engaged ever since in creating bridges between Israel and the international evangelical community. His other endeavors include publishing Israel365 – a daily newsletter distributed to some 250,000 Christian Zionists around the world. His business partner, Donna Jollay, is an evangelical Christian with a rags-to-riches story in which she made a killing in high-tech. The 59-year-old recently moved from Hawaii to Israel.</p> \n<p>“God had a plan for me, and the same is true of Israel and the Jewish people,” she says.</p> \n<p>Since experiencing a “spiritual awakening” about 20 years ago – in which she claims Jesus appeared before her – Jollay has become a devout Christian. She signs off every email she writes with the biblical verse from Genesis that explains why evangelicals like her are so devoted to the Jewish people: “God blesses those who bless the children of Israel” (which is how many evangelicals interpret Genesis 12:3: “And I will bless them that bless thee”).</p> \n<p>The list of prerecorded online courses offered by Yeshiva for the Nations includes Bible 101, End of Days studies, Introductory Judaism for non-Jews and Israel’s Seven Holy Cities. Plans are also underway to offer online webinars that would allow students to interact with their teachers in real time.</p> \n<p>The most recent addition to the growing list of Christian yeshivas in Israel is Align With Zion.</p> \n<p>This brand-new enterprise was founded by AnaRina Heymann, a former marketing executive for the City of David archaeological site in Jerusalem who made aliyah to Israel from South Africa seven years ago.</p> \n<p>Align With Zion is not yet in full swing, having launched only in October, but Heymann says her plan is to provide both online and live lectures on topics that include the fulfillment of biblical prophecy, Hebrew language, the Jewish festivals and the centrality of Jerusalem in the biblical narrative.</p> \n<p>“There is a genuine and growing wave of interest from pro-Israel Christians, and we have a responsibility to respond and engage through the common ground of biblical narrative – which in turn provides them with advocacy tools to stand with us against the growing wave of anti-Semitism in the world,” she says.</p> \n<p>Lambert Adler notes that hundreds, if not thousands, of Jewish studies programs – catering to different levels of religiosity and knowledge – exist in Israel. The problem, she says, is that enrollment is restricted. “If you’re not Jewish, most of these places are off-limits to you,” she says.</p> \n<p>All told, Lambert Adler estimates that “a few thousand” Christians have participated in classes offered by this new crop of yeshivas now open to them. But she believes the potential is far greater and that if anything is preventing it from being realized, it is not a lack of students but a lack of teachers.</p> \n<p>“The pool of teachers who are Jewishly knowledgeable, who are English-speaking and who are willing to engage with non-Jews is relatively small,” she explains. The fact that there is considerable overlap in the faculty lists of these schools is, therefore, no coincidence.</p> \n<p>Asked if Orthodox Jews are sometimes reluctant to share their religious knowledge with Christians, Lambert Adler responds: “That would be an understatement. The Jewish people, by and large, are very defensive about Christians. We tend not to trust them, we tend to think they have a missionizing agenda 100 percent of the time, and we tend to want them to just leave us alone.”</p> \n<p>Knesset Bible classes</p> \n<p>The forerunner of all these initiatives was the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding &amp; Cooperation (CJCUC), the first Orthodox-Jewish institution to offer Jewish-taught Bible classes to Christians. CJCUC was established in January 2008 by Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, a prominent Modern Orthodox rabbi, in the West Bank settlement of Efrat.</p> \n<p>Unlike some of the newer initiatives, it reaches out to Christians across all denominations – not only evangelicals.</p> \n<p>Interfaith Bible classes have also found their way to the Israeli parliament. Among the participants at a recent class in May was Michele Bachmann, the former U.S. presidential candidate and co-founder of the ultra-conservative Tea Party movement.</p> \n<p>The driving force behind the Knesset initiative, which began last February, is a California-based evangelical organization known as the Schindler Society, founded by megachurch Pastor Jim Garlow and his wife Rosemary Schindler Garlow.</p> \n<p>Lambert Adler profiles several dozen Christians in her book, including Jollay, who are “in some sort of relationship with Torah.” In most cases, the desire to study with Jewish teachers comes at a relatively advanced stage of the spiritual and theological progression these Christians experience, Lambert Adler notes.</p> \n<p>“Part of what’s happening is that people coming from Christian backgrounds are connecting to Israel first, often because they’re very biblical-literate and literal, and God promised to give the Land of Israel back to the Jewish people – and they see that that has happened,” she says.</p> \n<p>“Once they start having what they call a ‘heart for Israel,’ they realize that Jesus was Jewish. And in order for them to understand Christianity, they have to understand the Hebraic roots of Christianity. In other words, the lifestyle that Jesus lived – and that happens to be very similar to the way religious Jews live today, especially in Israel,” explains Lambert Adler.</p> \n<p>“So it’s a process that starts with being intrigued by Israel,” she continues, “then being intrigued by the Hebraic roots of Christian faith, and then learning the Bible from the people who they see are the natural continuation of Jesus’ life.”</p> \n<p>While Christian yeshivas may be a new trend, Jason M. Olson – an expert on evangelical attitudes toward Israel – believes it was Israel’s military victory in 1967 that paved the way.</p> \n<p>“The Six-Day War [which saw Israel occupy the West Bank and East Jerusalem] kind of put Jews back into history for evangelicals – and when I say history, I mean sacred history,” says Olson, author of the just published “America’s Road to Jerusalem: The Impact of the Six-Day War on Protestant Politics.”</p> \n<p>As a first step, he says, evangelicals began to understand that Jewish studies had merit as an academic discipline – and that included the Jewish interpretation of the Bible.</p> \n<p>“With the Jews re-entering sacred history and the Bible having something to say about modern Jewish people, then it follows that modern Jewish people have something to say about the Bible,” says Olson. “I think that’s where this sort of transformation occurs: That maybe we need Jews to teach us about the Jewish Bible.”</p> \n<p>When Weisz and Jollay were trying to come up with a name for their new venture, it was she, the Christian partner, who was determined to use the word “yeshiva.”</p> \n<p>“Rabbi Tuly was concerned that many Christians might not be familiar with the term,” she recounts. “So I said to him, ‘But that’s just the point – I want to raise the standards.’”</p> \n<p>It’s clear who won that argument in the end. “Don’t forget,” she says with a chuckle, “I had the financial leverage.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The death of Rona Ramon on Monday– the widow of Ilan Ramon, the Israeli astronaut who died in the 2003 Columbia space shuttle disaster and whose son Asaf was killed in the crash of an Israel Air Force plane in 2009 – is first and foremost the latest in a series of tragedies for her family. It prompts empathy and deep pain in anyone capable of feeling anything.</p> \n<p>Even ahead of her role as grieving wife and mother, ahead of the philanthropic activity and educational projects that she undertook, hers is the case of an Israeli family that repeatedly had to face hellish human loss. In addition, the huge sacrifice suffered by her family transformed Rona Ramon into probably one of the only people who could bring Israelis from different and even opposing camps together.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Rona Ramon, cultural heroine?&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the news of her death, I found myself by chance with my Likudnik father. Unfortunately we hadn’t managed in the past to respond in a similar fashion to any news event (recalling Ehud Banai and Daklon’s song lyrics: “What for you is a dream, for me is a horror”). But my father and I were both very upset over the news of Rona Ramon’s death. How many figures are capable of prompting such a reaction in two people who are close to being enemies?</p> \n<p>In the face of the outpouring of national kitsch that reached flood proportions, such that it prompted suspicions of cynicism, came the backlash. The signs of it can be seen in the marginal placement that the news of Rona Ramon’s death received on the front page of Tuesday’s Haaretz Hebrew edition, as if any event that involves emotion is disqualified as hard news, and as evidenced by what Haaretz writer Rogel Alpher wrote, complaining about the religiosity and messianism in the coverage of her death.</p> \n<p>A day after her death from pancreatic cancer at the age of 54, a woman who had lost her husband and son, what Alpher found to be the most burning issue to write about regarding Rona Ramon was that headlines in other papers about her going to heaven would encourage suicides.</p> \n<p>It’s possible and proper to go beyond the obvious. Anything can be judged with a critical eye or via a specific agenda, and it is certainly appropriate to decry the exploitation of tragic incidents. But where is that step along the way, the stage in which we stop for a moment in silence and simply feel the grief, in empathy and respect? Where is this modest place where we can experience our feelings for a moment as human beings?</p> \n<p>The reaction of those who shun the grief over Ramon’s death doesn’t involve restraint and rationality, but rather an arrogance cut off from reality, but which still has an emotional dimension. Such childish defiance has been growing in the face of the rising influence of fascism in Israeli society, in the face of racist and violent developments and the destruction of democracy. I would say to those people that reality drives people crazy and that is what is happening to them.</p> \n<p>This backlash only deepens the rifts in the country, knocking down those who are capable of belonging to the democratic and secular camp but who still wish to feel solidarity of some kind with their fellow countrymen, and who refuse to be estranged from them or from other human emotions. These are people who do not hate the stranger, who don’t force religion on others, who don’t behave violently, but who nevertheless allow themselves to be sad, and yes, even a bit sentimental at times. People like Rona Ramon, for example.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The number of ultra-Orthodox men enrolling in yeshivas has gone up in recent years while there has been a slowdown in numbers of ultra-Orthodox enrolling in higher education institutions and the job market, according to figures released on Wednesday by the Israel Democracy Institute.</p> \n<p>The institute’s annual report monitors trends within the ultra-Orthodox community and is being published for the third year in a row.</p> \n<p>The data, based on information from the Central Bureau of Statistics, government ministries, the military and the National Insurance Institute, show that in 2017 there were 114,100 ultra-Orthodox men registered at yeshivas (not including non-citizens), up from 94,000 in 2014, reflecting a 21 percent increase in a three-year period. This is a reverse trend from the 2013-2014 period when the number of yeshiva students decreased by 16 percent due to a sharp drop in yeshivas’ budgets and changes in the age requirement for ultra-Orthodox seeking exemption from military service at that time.</p> \n<p>The study’s authors, Dr. Gilad Malach and Dr. Lee Kahaner found that a rise in stipends provided by the government had apparently influenced the entry of ultra-Orthodox into academic life. The year 2017 saw the first drop in ultra-Orthodox students since the launch of university programs formed expressly for those students, from 9,600 to 9,400 (excluding the Open University), particularly in colleges for education.</p> \n<p>The researchers explained the drop as a response to a decline in scholarships for ultra-Orthodox students in law and business departments that had been popular with ultra-Orthodox students.</p> \n<p>There were 2,300 ultra-Orthodox students learning to be teachers in 2017, down from 2,600 the previous year, which represents a drop of 12 percent.</p> \n<p>In addition, the data show that ultra-Orthodox enroll in relatively high numbers in medical-related professions (12 percent compared to 5 percent of the general population), as well as in natural sciences and engineering, where they represent 10 percent of students.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the number of ultra-Orthodox students rose by 141 percent during the seven-year period from 2010 to 2017 – compared to just 9 percent for the general Israeli population. In addition, there is a continual rise in the number of ultra-Orthodox students enrolled in graduate studies - in 2017, that figure stood at 1,525, which is five times greater than in 2010.</p> \n<p>More than half of the ultra-Orthodox students are enrolled at academic colleges and about a third in teaching colleges, while a minority - only 17 percent - go to university, which is vastly different than the general population, where 39 percent are enrolled in universities.</p> \n<p>The dropout rate for the ultra-Orthodox in academia is 12.5 percent compared to 7 percent for the general population. The dropout rate at universities is six percent for the ultra-Orthodox, a lot lower than in the teaching colleges where the number is 11.5 percent and 19 percent at academic colleges.</p> \n<p>Natural growth has remained stable at 4.2 percent in the past decade compared to 1.4 percent among the non-Orthodox Jewish population. Among the more than million ultra-Orthodox, 58 percent are 19 and younger, compared to 30 percent among the rest of the Jewish population. Most of this is due to ultra-Orthodox women having more children than other Israelis, 7.1 compared to 3.1 for the rest of the population.</p> \n<p>The study finds that 83 percent of ultra-Orthodox men aged 20 and above are married compared to 63 percent of non-Orthodox Jews. But marriage age has risen for the ultra-Orthodox population in recent years, from 77 percent for 20 to 29-year-olds in 2003-2004, to 73 percent in 2010-2011, down to just 67 percent for that age group in 2017.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Unlikely as it may sound for a site sidelined for years, Tell Beit Shemesh in central Israel has suddenly become the arena for an epic wrestling match, pitting archaeologists against traffic planners. The issue at stake: What matters more, the heritage of King Hezekiah of Judah, or Route 38?</p> \n<p>Hezekiah ruled Judah from about 727 B.C.E. to 698 B.C.E., though in fact for at least some of that 30-year period he was a vassal king of Assyria. A seal, apparently belonging to Hezekiah and found in Jerusalem, suggests he indicates that he did not shy from bowing to the pagan values of his overlords. As for Route 38, it connects the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway to the biblical town of Beit Guvrin.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Route 38 has been widened in recent years to accommodate growing traffic, except at one spot. Between Beit Shemesh and the farming community of Yish’i, it remains a two-lane road. That, because of the archaeological remains on either side, which some scholars believe should be preserved, not paved over.</p> \n<p>Intensive archaeological investigation of the site bisected by Route 38 began in March, involving dozens of archaeologists and hundreds of volunteers. The digs are categorized as a salvage excavation by the Israel Antiquities Authority, which routinely checks sites slated for development.</p> \n<p>However, the very definition of “salvage excavation” implies that after accelerated exploration, the builders will move in. “Salvage” excavations, an archaeologist told me, are actually “eradication” excavations.</p> \n<p>The Transportation Ministry has allocated 60 million shekels ($16 million) for the archaeological work in Beit Shemesh. The Israel Antiquities Authority is responsible for the digs, working with archaeologists from Tel Aviv University and the sponsorship of Hebrew Union College in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>All this is normal for sites around Israel. And all would have been well and good if at least some archaeologists hadn’t been absolutely stunned by what they found.</p> \n<p>King Hezekiah</p> \n<p>Biblical Beit Shemesh (Beth-Shemesh) is nothing less than a time capsule of the First-Temple-era Kingdom of Judah, say Tel Aviv University archaeologists Zvi Lederman, who has been digging at Tel Beth Shemesh for 27 years, and Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz. It also represents the boundary of the Philistine expansion.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; An alternative Hanukkah tour of Israel: From Hasmonean archaeology to turtles</p> \n<p>Lederman says the Israelite identity was formed partly in border areas, such as Tell Beit Shemesh, which dates to the First Temple era, around 3,000 years ago. Before this salvage excavation, archaeologists had no idea just how important the site is, Lederman says.</p> \n<p>The discoveries sprawl out on both sides of the busy road. The town there was a bustling place, featuring dense building and planning, with the purpose of contributing to the wealth and power of the Kingdom of Judah.</p> \n<p>The finds are changing our understanding of what happened in King Hezekiah’s reign, when the leader of a backwater consolidated his fellow monarchs in a rebellion against their Assyrian overlords.</p> \n<p>The assumption has been that little could be found of Judah from that period. When the Assyrian King Sennacherib marched his forces to the Mediterranean coastal region in the 14th year of Hezekiah’s reign (701 B.C.E.), to crush the rebellion, he brutally destroyed the rebel cities, mercilessly burning down their fields and vineyards, as the prophet Isaiah&nbsp; describes so vividly (blaming God’s wrath on the fickleness of the people).</p> \n<p>“Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly; they have forsaken the Lord” (Isaiah 1:4).</p> \n<p>The prophet goes on to say, “Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire.”</p> \n<p>Now the exploration amid whizzing cars has shed light on an unknown chapter in Judean history at one of its lowest points, the aftermath of the rebellion against Sennacherib. Archaeologists had assumed the Judean foothills, the Shefela, were laid waste, all its people killed or expelled. Perhaps not.</p> \n<p>Hezekiah’s coalition</p> \n<p>The Jewish rebellion did not go well. The infuriated Assyrians counterattacked, razing cities up and down the coast and besieging Jerusalem itself in 701 B.C.E.</p> \n<p>The Assyrians were in the habit of obliterating rebels from the face of the planet: The kings of cities such as Tyre and Ashkelon were slaughtered. Yet for some reason, Sennacherib spared Hezekiah.</p> \n<p>One theory is that while camped outside Jerusalem, the Assyrian forces were struck by rodent-borne plague. Another is that Hezekiah bribed Sennacherib to spare the city and himself. The fact is, Lederman says, we have no idea why the brutal Assyrian leader spared Hezekiah.</p> \n<p>“It was very strange and highly uncharacteristic of the Assyrians to let Hezekiah survive,” Lederman says. “The Assyrians had to be cruel: Their wars were very brutal, because they had a huge empire, and it was a small people with a small army, so they had to leave an impression. Having said that, Hezekiah remained king, which is astonishing.</p> \n<p>“Sennacherib had been very aggressive. Almost all the sites examined in the Judean foothills (Shefalet Yehuda) had been destroyed,” Lederman tells Haaretz. One of the most famous examples is Lachish, apparently the kingdom’s second-most important city, after Jerusalem. The Assyrian forces razed the city and celebrated the achievement in the annals of Sennacherib and in the famous reliefs, now displayed at the British Museum, Lederman notes. “It is a very hard scene showing the expulsion of the Jews of Lachish.”</p> \n<p>At Lachish, there is a destruction layer from the Assyrian attack (level 3) and above it, a later occupation layer (level 2). The million-shekel question is when Lachish was rebuilt, and this is a subject of heated debate, Lederman says. “Clearly there is a gap of decades between Lachish levels 3 and 2. Archaeologists concluded that for a long period, the Judean foothills were empty of people.”</p> \n<p>The thinking had been that the ruling peoples, the Philistines and Assyrians, would not let the vanquished and exiled people of Judah return.</p> \n<p>“Big surprise,” says Lederman. “Beit Shemesh shows clearly that the settlement returned, big-time, in the very years everyone thought the area had been empty.”</p> \n<p>Yes, Sennacherib’s army had destroyed the city of Beit Shemesh too. But the people returned and rebuilt, and Lederman thinks they did so as soon as the Assyrian army moved on. “That is the big new discovery,” he says. “In my opinion, they returned to Beit Shemesh in the second half of Hezekiah’s regime.”</p> \n<p>The archaeologists found dense public construction, storage rooms and industrial quarters, and 14 olive pressed from the Hezekiah period. They also found 48 royal seal impressions identified with Hezekiah’s time. Based on the finds, Lederman believes that west of Beit Shemesh were a number of plantations that Hezekiah established, chiefly to produce olive oil.</p> \n<p>The area around Beit Shemesh in the Judean plains was the kingdom’s breadbasket, Lederman explains. The Judean Hills had neither suitable land nor adequate water, not to mention trading routes. “Judah needed the lowlands, with its land, water and valleys,” he says.</p> \n<p>Lederman marvels at Hezekiah’s survival. He had to have been one of the smartest monarchs the kingdom had, and doesn’t get the respect he deserves, the archaeologist argues.</p> \n<p>“He lived and ruled during a traumatic period for the people of Israel. In his lifetime, he saw how the city of Samaria, Israel’s capital, was destroyed. He saw the 10 [biblical] tribes sent into exile, saw the refugees, saw the deaths and heard of the Assyrians,” Lederman says. “It must have been terrifying. However, he was a very entrepreneurial king: He seized the moment. He had a special opportunity to turn his little kingdom into something more important and he did it well.”</p> \n<p>Hezekiah was a Judean hillbilly, Lederman laughs, ruling a small, poor kingdom with a small capital that played no great role in the history of Middle East. He turned it into a key player in the region by heading the anti-Assyrian coalition.</p> \n<p>“Assyria was the superpower of the time, and he united the kingdoms from Tyre to Ashkelon, all these kings under him, in opposition of the Assyrian expansion.”</p> \n<p>That is why Sennacherib set out to punish Hezekiah, who nonetheless survived and so, it seems, did ancient Beit Shemesh. By the way, thus the Assyrians became the first people to use the soubriquet “Ya-hu-di” (meaning ”from” or “of Judah”), in documentation, Lederman says.</p> \n<p>Build the road</p> \n<p>Yet the government hasn’t pulled back from its plan to expand Route 38 smack over this extraordinary site. Will it really go ahead and build over the First Temple-period city?</p> \n<p>Yehuda Guvrin, owner of the company excavating the south part of the site, has engaged in contractual archaeology for 25 years and is keenly aware that the main impetus behind hiring him is to get sites approved for development. Since his very living depends on it, what he has to say bears hearing: If there’s one site that should not, repeat not, be handed over to builders, it’s this one. “It’s the only site that I categorically say shouldn’t be zoned for development. A solution has to be found that doesn’t damage the antiquities,” Guvrin says, though admitting that no simple one springs to mind.</p> \n<p>The north part of the site is being explored by Tel Aviv University, with 20 archaeologists, students and administrators and 150 workers. Prof. Oded Lipschits of the TAU Archaeology Institute has a different take on the site than Lederman and Guvrin. He thinks the government should go ahead and build the road.</p> \n<p>The findings attest to a multilayered site that began in the seventh century B.C.E. and remained occupied until the Ottoman era, Lipschits advised the IAA, in writing; and indeed there are impressive architectural assemblies and underground systems too, but in his opinion, they are nothing unique, not from the scientific perspective and not from the perspective of conservation potential.</p> \n<p>The real mistake, says Lipschits, was made five years ago, during sample excavations at the site, and although the digs signaled that there were things to be found there, the IAA approved the road expansion, rather than push for an alternative, such as a tunnel running below the tell.</p> \n<p>The issue at stake, explains Lipschits, is the boundaries of archaeological ethics versus the power of the state. “What we found at the tell is simply bigger than we had thought,” he says. “The extent is huge, but there is nothing special there or grandiose that would justify turning the site into a tourist attraction. The site doesn’t even come close to Maresha [Beit Guvrin], for instance. No archaeological park is going to go up in it. The current battle is inter-archaeological politics.”</p> \n<p>He feels that if the archaeologists stand firm and refuse to allow the road to proceed, the only thing that will suffer is archaeology itself. “Next time we ask to conduct salvage excavations and then to release the land [for development], they won’t believe us,” he suggests. “They invested 60 million shekels in Beit Shemesh in order to release the land, and now we’re getting cold feet? It will just harm archaeology in the future.”</p> \n<p>His worst fear is that if they dig in their heels, the government will amend the antiquities law, which presently gives the power to decide on the fate of sites to the IAA.</p> \n<p>At this point, says Lipschits, other engineering solutions won’t work and they should go ahead and expand the road – also he also urges the archaeological community to support the IAA in protecting archaeological assets in the future.</p> \n<p>‘Size doesn’t matter’</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, in the modern city of Beit Shemesh, everybody did and does know the tell, says city resident Gadi Damari, and he finds the squabble infuriating.</p> \n<p>“The place was neglected for years,” he says. “Why isn’t there a Beit Shemesh national park? In what are we inferior to Ashkelon? Why do they want to cover up what they found? Why don’t they come to us, the city residents, and tell us about the importance of the site? The solution must lie in conservation. The state should invest more and ascribe the appropriate respect to the national treasure discovered here. A site of this magnitude could put Beit Shemesh on the tourism map. Let them divert the road westward.”</p> \n<p>Who knows. Just this week Beit Shemesh gained a new mayor, Aliza Bloch, who says she will examine the possibility of creating a national park at the site.</p> \n<p>Yuval Baruch, the Jerusalem district head at the IAA, explains that the Beit Shemesh case is complex and requires delicate balancing. The IAA agreed in principle that the road go ahead because the new road is necessary to developing housing in Ramat Beit Shemesh, and neither a tunnel or bridge would be a relevant solution, he says.</p> \n<p>At the time, the initial excavations did give some direction, but they couldn’t predict the sheer size and importance of the site, Baruch says. However, under the circumstances, discussions are being held within the archaeological community, and with the builder too (which is unusual), so the builder and his people will understand the complexity, Baruch says.</p> \n<p>Size doesn’t matter, Baruch sums up: only the value, and there are parameters for that.</p> \n<p>He feels there is something unique at the Beit Shemesh site, remnants from the First Temple period. It’s rare for salvage excavations to prevail over major development projects, Baruch says, but in this case he thinks the authorities should be looking for alternatives. As he puts it, “the exposure of a settlement from the late First Temple period changes the rules of the game.”</p> \n<p>“We realized that the site has values that ought to be preserved. They don’t have to be, but they ought to be,” Baruch says. The Transportation Ministry’s construction company, says it is examining alternatives to road expansion. Where is the prophet Isaiah when you need him?</p>",

In a report issued on Wednesday as part of its semiannaul Financial Stability Report, the bank said about 140 billion shekels ($37.3 billion) had been lent to the sector, equal to about 16% of all credit to the business sector. Close to two thirds of that was borrowed by publicly traded companies that have taken advantage of low interest rates to issue bonds. It estimated that about 74 billion of the credit came from pension fund assets. The Bank of Israel warned that the conditions that allowed companies to borrow and investment in income-producing real estate would not prevail for much longer. “Macroeconomic changes – among them drops in occupancy rates, lower rents or alternatively a change in capitalization rates – could lead to sharp drops in asset prices and turnover,” the bank said. “These developments could lead to deterioration in leveraging, the ability to repay [debt] and liquidity.” (Shelly Appelberg)</p> \n<p>Microsoft reportedly eyeing&nbsp;rival bid to Xilinx for Israel’s Mellanox</p> \n<p>Six weeks after the U.S. financial news network CNBC reported that the American semiconductor company Xilinx wants to buy Israel’s Mellanonx, reports have emerged that Microsoft is interested, too. No further details were available on the Microcoft offer, but sources in the capital market said the U.S. company had retains Goldman Sachs to advise in negotiations. Xilinx reported offered $100 a share for Mellanox, valuing the company at $5.5 billion. The news caused Mellanox shares to soar 48% to a peak of $97.48, but they pulled back subsequently.&nbsp; On Wednesday, they were trading up 4% at $92.46 in New York at midday ocal time. Based in the Galilee town of Yokneam Illit, Mellanox sells networking hardware used in data centers, including Ethernet switches and cables for connecting switches to other hardware. Acquiring Mellanox and turning it into a research and development unit would provide Microsoft with a technology edge over rivals and prevent them from using Mellanox products.

IMI won the contract for its Iron Fist active protection system after years of testing by the U.S. military. The system is designed to prevent line-of-sight guided anti-tank missiles/projectiles from acquiring and/or destroying a target. Iron Fist combines radar and an optional passive infrared detector to detect imminent threats, and launches a projectile interceptor that explodes very near the threat, destroying or deflecting it without detonating its warhead. The system is similar to Rafael’s Trophym which is deployed on Israel’s Merkava tanks and American M1 tanks. Elbit shares ended 1.2% up at 470.20 shekels ($125.17). (Eran Azran)</p> \n<p>Government panel to work on way to coordinate crypto-currency regulations</p> \n<p>Israel is beginning an effort to better coordinate its policies on crypto-currencies like bitcoin and block chain and other distributed ledger technologies. The Bank of Israel said on Tuesday that committee had been formed to create a knowledge base on the issue for regulators and the public, and to formulate recommendations for how polices can be better coordinated between different regulators. The government last addressed the issue in a coordinated way in 2014 but since the crypto-currency segment has exploded and different Israeli regulators have adopted rules independent of each other. “Digital currency users in Israel face challenges every day is using their money for transactions,” said Meni Rosenfeld, chairman of the Israel Bitcoin Association. Among those challenges, he said, is by law having to report to tax authorities and pay tax if they use a crypto-currency to buy lunch. The team will be taking comments from the public through the end of the year.

        "text":["<p>Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon appeared to have won the first battle in his war against rising prices on Wednesday, with two big food makers promising not to go ahead with plans for price hikes. But industry executives said Kahlon wasn’t facing up to the fact that manufacturers’ cost were rising.</p> \n<p>The treasury said Osem, whose products include the best-selling Bamba peanut snack, would not go ahead with planned price increases for a third of its products. The reversal came after a nighttime meeting with Osem executives.</p> \n<p>Strauss, Israel’s second-biggest maker of dairy products, also rescinded planned price hikes, according to the treasury.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Prices in Israel rising? Think again. They've barely changed while wages have soared | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As of Wednesday night Tnuva, the No. 1 dairy maker, hadn’t backtracked on its planned increases, but Manufacturers Association President Shraga Brosh informed Kahlon that the food industry was backing off price rises.</p> \n<p>“I am happy to inform you that due to your efforts, we have succeeded in preventing an increase in food prices to retailers for the coming period,” Brosh said in a letter released by the treasury.</p> \n<p>Kahlon and Finance Ministry officials have been working intensively over the last several days to block price rises, not only by businesses but also by the state-owned Israel Electric Corporation. The increases, which have sparked “yellow vest” rallies in imitation of French protesters, threaten to undermine Kahlon’s reputation as a fighter for middle-class consumers.</p> \n<p>While trying to contain rising food prices, the treasury has also been working on ways to moderate a rise of between 6.5% and 10% in electricity rates now scheduled to go into effect January 1. The most likely strategy is cancelling the excise tax on fuel used by IEC.</p> \n<p>The Electricity Authority, which approved the rate increase earlier this month, said eliminating the tax wouldn’t do away with the rate hike but officials estimated it could reduce it to 4.35%. The excise tax costs IEC 700 million shekel ($186 million) every two years.</p> \n<p>A 400 million shekel settlement with Siemens and other European companies over an old price-fixing lawsuit could be used to reduce the increase even more, officials said.</p> \n<p>Food executives who spoke with TheMarker on Wednesday reacted to Kahlon’s campaign against higher food prices with disgust.</p> \n<p>“Because of a few newspaper headlines, they suddenly decided to meet the manufacturers? It’s a joke,” said one executive, who asked not to be named. “We’re talking about a problem that’s been going on over four years.”</p> \n<p>At a meeting Tuesday night, Osem executives, led by CEO Avi Ben-Assayag and chairman Dan Propper, told Kahlon that their costs had risen 20% due to the government-ordered increases in the minimum wage and higher water and power costs.</p> \n<p>The fact that many commodity prices have fallen sharply in the last several years, they said, didn’t offset the increases. Kahlon said he would look into ending customs on some inputs used by companies like Osem, such as powdered eggs and tomato concentrate.</p> \n<p>Referring to the halt to price hikes, a senior executive at one food maker asked, “How long can it hold? I don’t know.”</p> \n<p>“We have absorbed [cost increases] and right now can continue to absorb them. But the public and its leaders have to understand that our ability to do so with eventually end,” he said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Two and half years ago, Murray Lee voted in favor of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.</p> \n<p>A Jewish real estate agent from northern London, Murray shared the concerns of many in the “leave camp” over the United Kingdom’s perceived vulnerability to Europe’s immigration problems. If England remained shackled to Brussels’ policies, he and other leavers argued, they’d pay the price for the exodus of work and asylum seekers from the Middle East and beyond.</p> \n<p>Murray is still worried by those issues. But now, he is also concerned about the damage that the turmoil around the Brexit vote — in which the leavers won a narrow majority of 52% — may be wreaking on the British economy and Murray’s industry, not least in the Jewish hub of northern London.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“I don’t think we knew then what we know now,” Murray said about his vote, about which he now has some regrets. “We were badly advised.”</p> \n<p>Referencing predictions of an economic downturn over the next 15 years, he added: “Unfortunately, I never thought of it.”</p> \n<p>Murray, a real estate agent with 45 years of experience who founded the Dreamview Estates agency on Golders Green Road, has seen housing prices drop by around 10% from their peak levels in 2016, with some assets attracting little to no bids, he said.</p> \n<p>A busy artery running through the pricey neighborhood that gave it its name, Golders Green Road features multiple Israeli and kosher eateries and shops such as Florentin, Hummus Bar and Yarok, that reflect the heavily Jewish makeup of the area.</p> \n<p>A bit further up the road, Richard Dangoor, managing director at his Jewish family’s real estate agency, Hausman &amp; Holmes, has seen a drop of about 20% in the number of sales since the Brexit vote.</p> \n<p>The U.K. housing market’s growth of 1.5 % in October dropped sharply to a near-stagnant 0.3% in November, The Guardian reported this month. And London, which in 2015 saw a whopping 9.2% rise in housing prices, has become a “weak spot” in the U.K. property market, The Guardian reported in October.</p> \n<p>The London bubble may have burst not only because of Brexit uncertainty, but also because “prices had become unaffordable,” Murray said. He and Dangoor both said they don’t at this point fear for the viability of their business.</p> \n<p>More broadly, though, shares in British firms have taken considerable hits following the Brexit vote. The pound had lost nearly 15% of its value against the dollar since January 2016.</p> \n<p>Complicating matters is the uncertainty and anger around the terms of Britain’s withdrawal as stipulated in a draft agreement that Prime Minister Theresa May made public last month, after lengthy negotiations. The document says that the United Kingdom will have to adhere to EU laws — including on unencumbered immigration within the bloc — for the duration of a two-year transition period, but lose its representation in its government bodies.</p> \n<p>The document’s shortcomings triggered a no-confidence vote inside May’s Conservative Party, where it angered moderates and hard-liners alike. She survived last week’s vote. But, with less than four months to go before the proposed deal expires, the shaky support for it is raising the specter of Britain crashing out of the EU with no deal. Economists warn that such a spectacle would be economically disastrous.</p> \n<p>In central London, this uncertainty is hitting the housing market particularly hard, said Dangoor, a father of three.</p> \n<p>Central London’s real estate market depends on investment from overseas, including the Middle East, South Africa and China.</p> \n<p>“When there was fear, when there was concern,” he said. “You’re seeing a big drop in values there.”</p> \n<p>The drop is less noticeable in suburbs, though, due to low interest rates that mean “owners aren’t forced to sell,” Dangoor said. Suburban assets that “tick all the requisite boxes” still fetch premium prices as “these areas are insulated by a microbubble of their own and buyers looking for a family home a have longer-term viewpoint,” Dangoor added. But the number of transactions is down there, too, “because people are concerned,” he added.</p> \n<p>Murray puts it another way.</p> \n<p>“Would you buy a house for a million pounds if you weren’t sure that it’d be worth that tomorrow?” he said.</p> \n<p>May’s tenuous position over Brexit increases the likelihood of an election and her government’s replacement with a cabinet headed by the leader of the opposition Labour Party, the far-left Jeremy Corbyn.</p> \n<p>For Murray and Dangoor, a Corbyn-led government is menacing because of his support for rent control and a mansion tax. Some economists have warned that Corbyn’s election could cause the property market and the pound to crash.</p> \n<p>Mark Ruben, a 57-year-old hotelier who recently bought a $7 million home in London, wasn’t waiting to see what will come to pass. Earlier this year, he sold the property, which he called his “dream home,” partly out of concern over Corbyn winning an election and imposing a mansion tax, he told JTA.</p> \n<p>And then there are the specifically Jewish concerns about a Labour government.</p> \n<p>Corbyn, who has called Hamas and Hezbollah his friends and said that British “Zionists” don’t understand British irony, has been battling allegations of anti-Semitism, including from the former chief rabbi of Britain, Jonathan Sacks. Earlier this year, all of Britain’s leading Jewish newspapers in a joint editorial warned that Corbyn could pose an “existential threat” to British Jewry.</p> \n<p>Murray, who specializes in the heavily Jewish northern London market, is already seeing what he called “the Corbyn effect” on some of his clients, he said.</p> \n<p>“It shocked me the third time,” he said of owners seeking to sell property out of fear of Corbyn’s election. One buyer, Murray said, told him: “I’m selling because I’m going to Israel if Corbyn gets elected.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Reports concerning President Trump’s intention to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria should come as no surprise, at least for one reason. Trump usually changes policies like one changes socks, and there was no reason to assume he would act any differently in Syria.</p> \n<p>It’s true that back in April he declared he would pull out American troops, but since then he changed his mind, coming into serious conflict with the Pentagon and the State Department. Only three weeks ago, the U.S. special envoy to Syria, James Jeffrey, said an American withdrawal from Syria is contingent on an acceptable diplomatic resolution in Syria and the establishment of a reasonable regime there. In other words, victory over ISIS, which until then was the main reason for the U.S. presence in Syria, was replaced by a new argument: waiting for a stable regime in Syria.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Trump's pullout leaves Russia holding the cards in Syria, to Israel's bitter disappointment&nbsp;■&nbsp;Despite the blow to its national security, Israel will bow to Trump’s Syria withdrawal&nbsp;■&nbsp;How Assad helped create ISIS to win in Syria and got away with the crime of the century</p> \n<p>Even in this, the U.S. contributes nothing, since the management of diplomatic developments in Syria is entirely in the hands of Russia, joined by Turkey and Iran. Predicating American withdrawal on a diplomatic resolution not only failed to impress Russia and its allies, it put America in a position in which it was dependent on Russia’s ability to reach such a resolution. It actually made finding one much harder, since as long as Kurdish forces believed they had an American umbrella against Turkey, which would enable them to continue holding territory they had acquired and use it as a bargaining chip before withdrawing, Russia had a hard time forming a united coalition of rebels who would accept Russia’s blueprint for a solution.</p> \n<p>If Trump sticks to his decision to withdraw and doesn’t yield to pressure exerted on him by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis, or if he wakes up with some new fantasy, the U.S. will evacuate the base at al-Tanf on the Syrian-Iraqi border, which acted as a deterrent to the entry of Shi’ite militia units into Syria. The U.S. will also evacuate its northern bases, which served as a base for strikes against ISIS, and it will also give up the idea of setting up observation posts along the border with Turkey which would protect the Kurds. This would leave the city of Manbij, now under Kurdish rule, open to a Turkish occupation, from where it could spread to other Kurdish enclaves east of the Euphrates.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Despite the blow to its national security, Israel will bow to Trump’s Syria withdrawal | Analysis</p> \n<p>It’s true that the extent of American forces in Syria was not sufficient for conducting significant tactical operations, but their very presence marked a territory of control and deterrence, preventing conflict with Russian, Turkish, Syrian and Iranian forces. Thus, the U.S. prevented the expansion of the Turkish invasion eastwards from the city of Afrin, by warning that hurting American soldiers would lead to painful retaliation.</p> \n<p>Wariness of a conflict with American forces led Turkey to sign with clenched teeth an agreement to cooperate with the U.S. in jointly monitoring the city of Manbij, which had become a source of diplomatic conflict between the two countries. The American obstacle will no longer deter Turkey, and the Kurds will have to decide whether to wage a long and possibly hopeless war against Turkey, or to seek shelter with Moscow, without being able to pose conditions regarding future arrangements in Syria.</p> \n<p>The Kurds are undoubtedly the biggest losers following the U.S. decision. This won’t be the first time in their history in which the U.S. is shown to be an unreliable ally. The State Department is rightly concerned that withdrawal from Syria would provide further proof to American allies that there’s no one that can be trusted in Washington and that Trump’s commitments are not worth the virtual space his tweets occupy.</p> \n<p>However, the value of America’s commitment to its allies, with all its importance, is for now secondary to the main issue, which is the foreign forces involved in Syria, mainly those of Iran. One of the reasons given by the U.S. for its continued presence in Syria was based on the equation that as long as there are foreign forces in Syria, American troops would also continue their mission. Russia and Iran countered that their presence was legitimate since they had been invited by Syria, in contrast to the U.S. and Turkey, who had invaded the country.</p> \n<p>The U.S. ignored this argument, and even though it clarified that the removal of Iranian forces would not be achieved through military means but through diplomatic ones, it was clear that the Iranian presence gave justification for its operations in Syria. American withdrawal will now be presented by Syria and Iran as a rout, which could impact the status and influence of the United States in the region, including Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and even Saudi Arabia, which could view an American retreat from Syria as a serious blow to the joint campaign against Iran.</p> \n<p>For Israel, the U.S. presence in Syria did not carry much weight in terms of its campaign against the Iranian presence in Syria, but it had great importance in setting the rules of the game with regard to Russia, in delineating regions of reduced conflict in southern Syria and in removing Iranian forces from the Golan border. In all of these, Washington was either directly or indirectly involved, through its backing of Israel in multilateral meetings, and through its presence in Syria, which gave it the status of an active partner. Furthermore, as long as there are American bases in Syria they enable some military “elasticity,” which allows increasing the number of troops when more extensive local interventions are needed, without this appearing as a game-changer or a precedent.</p> \n<p>Withdrawal of these forces means that any new deployment in Syria will now become a complex and prolonged political move, requiring Congressional approval, since such a move could be interpreted as an act of war. Trump can now boast that he’s fulfilled a campaign promise, returning troops home, but at the same time he’s disengaging the U.S. from another arena in which it could have had great impact.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In September 2014, one month after starting airstrikes in neighboring Iraq, then-President Barack Obama launched a U.S. air campaign against the Islamic State in Syria. The Islamic State had built substantial military firepower in Syria, which it used to sweep across western and northern Iraq earlier in 2014.</p> \n<p>In late 2015 the first American ground troops entered Syria — initially 50, growing to the current official total of about 2,000. They recruited, organized and advised thousands of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, dubbed the Syrian Democratic Forces, and pushed IS out of most of its strongholds.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Washington is an ally, but only to a point&nbsp;&nbsp;■&nbsp;Despite the blow to its national security, Israel will bow to Trump’s Syria withdrawal&nbsp;■&nbsp;How Assad helped create ISIS to win in Syria and got away with the crime of the century</p> \n<p>Military operations</p> \n<p>To date, the U.S.-led coalition has launched airstrikes on at least 17,000 locations in Syria since the start of the operation. Last week, there were strikes on 208 locations, largely on Islamic State fighters and facilities in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, according to the U.S. military.</p> \n<p>Thousands of IS fighters have been killed or captured, but U.S. military officials say there are still as many at 2,000 insurgents still in the MERV, and a number of others who have escaped to various locations around the country.</p> \n<p>Complications</p> \n<p>Russia joined the big-power entanglement in Syria in the fall of 2015. Moscow said it was there to defeat terrorists, but Washington objected, saying the Russian military was propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad and making it more difficult to eliminate IS. To avoid aerial confrontations and accidents, U.S. and Russian military officials set up a telephone “deconfliction line,” which remains in effect.</p> \n<p>Turkey’s concern about links between the U.S.-supported Syrian Kurdish militias and Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey added a further complication for Washington. The Turkish military intervened in northern Syria, prompting the Syrian Kurds to temporarily abandon the fight against IS.</p> \n<p>The U.S. has claimed that Iran also maintains a presence in the country, supporting Assad and supplying weapons.</p> \n<p>The U.S. pullout</p> \n<p>President Donald Trump said his administration had continued the Syria fight only because of the IS threat. On Wednesday the president tweeted, “We have defeated ISIS in Syria,” and later U.S. officials said he had ordered a full withdrawal of U.S. forces there.</p> \n<p>The Pentagon said in a prepared statement that IS-held territory had been “liberated,” but added that the U.S. would continue “working with our partners and allies to defeat ISIS wherever it operates.” Officials refused to say when all U.S. troops would be out of Syria.</p> \n<p>Opponents oppose decision</p> \n<p>The decision has been met with widespread condemnation and only a smattering of support.</p> \n<p>Pentagon leaders were largely mum on Wednesday, adhering to the mandate that U.S. civilian leaders make policy and the military salutes and moves forward. But top defense officials have been blunt in recent assessments that the fight against the Islamic State is not over.</p> \n<p>Brett McGurk, the administration’s envoy for the fight against IS, said on Dec. 11: “It would be reckless if we were just to say, well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now. I think anyone who’s looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.”</p> \n<p>Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, called the pullout “catastrophic,” and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., deemed it a “disaster in the making.”</p> \n<p>Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said an ill-informed and hasty withdrawal may breathe new life into ISIS and other insurgent groups, and “will also cede America’s hard-fought gains in the region to Russia, Iran and Assad.”</p> \n<p>Supporters endorse move</p> \n<p>Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he was “very supportive” of the decision. “For the first time in my lifetime we have a president with the courage to declare victory and bring the troops home. We haven’t had a president in 20 or 30 years who can figure out how to declare victory,” he said.</p> \n<p>Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said Americans don’t want troops in Syria in perpetuity. “We brought them there to crush ISIS. We’ve crushed ISIS. We have troops in Iraq who can spring over there (to Syria) to do something” if needed.</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. President Donald Trump overrode his top national security aides, blindsided U.S. ground commanders, and stunned lawmakers and allies with his order for U.S. troops to leave Syria, a decision that upends American policy in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>The result, said current and former officials and people briefed on the decision, will empower Russia&nbsp;and Iran and leave unfinished the goal of erasing the risk that Islamic State, or ISIS, which has lost all but a sliver territory, could rebuild.</p> \n<p>Trump was moving toward his dramatic decision in recent weeks even as top aides tried to talk him out of it, determined to fulfill a campaign promise of limiting U.S. involvement militarily abroad, two senior officials said.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;U.S. withdrawal from Syria shows Washington is an ally, but only to a point | Analysis ■&nbsp;Despite the blow to its national security, Israel will bow to Trump’s Syria withdrawal | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The move, which carries echoes of Trump’s repudiation of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate change accord, is in keeping with his America First philosophy and the pledge he made to end U.S. military involvement.</p> \n<p>A former senior Trump administration official said the president’s decision basically was made two years ago, and that Trump finally stared down what he considered unpersuasive advice to stay in.</p> \n<p>“The president won. His inclination was always not to be there,” said the former official who is close to the White House, saying a variety of senior advisers had all argued against pulling out.</p> \n<p>In meetings with top advisers, Trump would ask: “What are we doing there? I know we’re there to fight ISIS, but we did it. Now what?” said the former official.</p> \n<p>Trump understood, but rejected, arguments by senior advisers that U.S. troops were not on the front lines, numbered only 2,000 and markedly strengthened anti-Islamic State local forces, saying he wanted to get out once Raqqa and other ISIS strongholds fell.</p> \n<p>Qualms in the Pentagon</p> \n<p>A U.S. defense official said Trump’s decision was widely seen in the Pentagon as benefiting Russia as well as Iran, both of which have used their support for the Syrian government to bolster their regional influence. Iran also has improved its ability to ship arms to Lebanese Hezbollah for use against Israel.</p> \n<p>Asked who gained from the withdrawal, the defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, replied: “Geopolitically Russia, regionally Iran.”</p> \n<p>Another U.S. defense official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S military commanders had expressed concerns with the administration about what a rapid withdrawal would mean for U.S.-backed local forces fighting Islamic State.</p> \n<p>The official said the plan to withdraw had caught the commanders by surprise.</p> \n<p>Trump “destroyed ISIS safe haven in Syria &amp; will lose the peace by withdrawing,” tweeted retired Army Vice Chief of Staff Jack Keane, who has been seen as a possible successor to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. “ISIS will re-emerge, Iran a greater threat, will own all of Syria, Israel more in danger.”</p> \n<p>Like other experts, Keane, who is also a Fox News analyst, said that by pulling out, Trump will surrender Washington’s ability to play a major role in framing a settlement of the Syrian civil war.</p> \n<p>Charles Lister, an expert with the Middle East Institute thinktank, agreed. “It completely takes apart America’s broader strategy in Syria,” he said, “but perhaps more importantly, the centerpiece of the Trump administration policy, which is containing Iran.</p> \n<p>“Syria is the jewel in the crown of Iran’s regional strategy,” he said.</p> \n<p>The Trump administration dismissed that argument.</p> \n<p>“These troops that we had in Syria were never there to counter Iran. They were always there to destroy the territorial caliphate of ISIS,” said a senior administration official. “And so I think the president was perfectly justified when he judged that mission was at an end.”</p> \n<p>Frustration among Republicans, allies</p> \n<p>Lawmakers from both parties complained that they were not briefed in advance of the decision. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Reuters that GOP senators expressed their frustration “in spades” during a lunch with Vice President Mike Pence.</p> \n<p>French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were scrambling to find out exactly what the announcement meant and how it will affect their participation in U.S.-led coalition operations against Islamic State.</p> \n<p>“If this turns out to be as bad as it sounds, then it’s a serious problem for us and the British because operationally the coalition doesn’t work without the U.S.,” said one French diplomat.</p> \n<p>Syria’s civil war, which began in 2011, has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced around half the country’s pre-war 22 million population and defied all efforts at diplomatic resolution.</p> \n<p>The pull-out may be an especially bitter pill for Jim Jeffrey, the U.S. special representative for Syria, who was the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad when former President Barack Obama decided to withdraw U.S. forces, undercutting his leverage.</p> \n<p>As recently as in September, Jeffrey told reporters, “We are not in a hurry to pull out.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Israeli military is investigating the death of two Palestinian teens during an Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip last July, Haaretz has learned.</p> \n<p>The two, 15-year-old Amir al-Nimrah and 16-year-old Luai Kahil, were killed while sitting on a rooftop at the Shati refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip on July 14, as Israel and Hamas were locked in a flare-up.</p> \n<p>The two teens were killed in what Israel calls &quot;roof tapping&quot; or &quot;roof knocking&quot;&nbsp;– firing small missiles at a roof of a building, creating a small explosion to warn the residents of an impending wider attack. Israel has also used this tactic in other campaigns in Gaza, such as Operation Cast Lead in December 2008 and January 2009 as well as Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012.</p> \n<p>The probe was launched following an investigation carried out by the human rights organization B’Tselem and the Forensic Architecture London-based research group. A video published by the two organizations combines aerial photographs and photos published by the Israeli army on the day of the attack.</p> \n<p>On the day of the attack, the IDF Spokesperson said that the structure at the refugee camp &quot;served as the Palestinian national library, a huge abandoned building near Nasser Street.&quot; The IDF added that the building's five stories were &quot;meant for the use of Gaza residents, for public and government services [or] housing,&quot; but that it had been converted to a Hamas training compound.&quot; &nbsp;The building, the army added, serves as a training ground &quot;for urban warfare… and for survival in tunnels – thanks to an attack tunnel that was dug under it.&quot;</p> \n<p>Asked again for comment, the army spokesman's office issued a statement on Wednesday in which it acknowledged that, following the attack, there were reports that the two teens had been killed. &quot;An investigation showed that, at the time of the [missile] fire, no people were spotted on the roof of the building. The findings of the investigation are currently being examined by the Military Advocate General's office.&quot;</p> \n<p>Before the attack, various steps were taken to minimize possible harm to civilians, including the roof tapping the statement said. &quot;Contrary to what had been claimed, the [army] probe was carried out immediately following the event and not as the result of new information being received.&quot;</p> \n<p>The roof-tapping tactic had been discontinued for several years because crowds of Palestinians would gather on the rooftops to try to prevent the demolitions of buildings.</p> \n<p>After the 2014 conflict, a group of U.S. military experts from the Pentagon arrived in Israel to learn about the operation and the IDF's attempts to minimize civilian casualties.</p> \n<p>A UN Human Rights Council commission of inquiry's report on 2014's Operation Protective Edge&nbsp;concluded&nbsp;that while the method &quot;may have been effective&quot; in minimizing civilian casualties in specific instances, &quot;'roof-knocks' cannot be considered an effective warning given the confusion they often cause to building residents and the short time allowed to evacuate before the actual strike.&quot;</p>",

Judge Esther Helman, the court’s vice president, said she also felt &quot;compelled to express a troubling feeling in light of the many accumulating flaws in the investigation, which in turn raise doubts as to the fairness of the [original] trial.”</p> \n<p>In October last year, a lower court had found the man guilty of stealing security cameras in 2015, when he was 16. At the time, the court had been convinced by the security footage and identification testimonies by two policemen.</p> \n<p>The minor was required to sign a payment commitment of 1,000 shekels if he were to commit another crime, and a 2,000 shekel compensation fee to the business owner.&nbsp;Another suspect who is claimed to have collaborated with him was not indicted due to his mental state.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The verdict was unanimous. Among the flaws the judge noted was that one of the policemen identified the suspect only after encountering him by chance on the street. The policeman did not arrest or question him, but instead went back to the police station to look at the security footage again.</p> \n<p>Consequently, the suspect was questioned only a month later, at which point he had difficulties providing an alibi. In their questioning, the police erred as to the precise day that the crime occurred, and asked the suspect to provide an alibi for the wrong date, two days after the incident.</p> \n<p>Finally, the suspect’s home was never searched in order to locate the stolen cameras.</p> \n<p>“After receiving the investigators’ full story, despite the abovementioned difficulties and in my humble opinion, the court was unjust in not examining the identification issue, particularly after it turned out the appellant was only spotted after being seen on the street with the other adult,” Helman wrote in her ruling.</p> \n<p>She added that the credibility of their identification was less than it should have been, and that it may have been influenced by &quot;various factors relating to the appellant’s origins … and the appellant having been spotted in the company of an adult who isn’t Ethiopian, so that they appeared similar to the pair who carried out the theft.”</p> \n<p>Helman also wrote that “Whether the appellant lied in his testimony … is not sufficient grounds by which to establish that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p> \n<p>The judge also pointed to flaws in recordings of the questioning and absence of written investigation reports. “These matters are all the more serious when we are dealing with a minor. The investigative authorities must be stricter about the rules when faced with a minor. He was only 16 when he was questioned, he gave up his right to counsel and had to handle the investigators on his own.”</p> \n<p>Rimon Sheleg, the appellant’s attorney from the Public Defender’s Office, said mistaken identity was a leading cause of innocent people being convicted of crimes. “We are talking about a minor who was 16, of Ethiopian origin, with no criminal record, put on trial on the basis of police spotting him in a security camera.”</p> \n<p>Sheleg noted that the district court had pointed out that the probablity of mistaken identity is greater when identifying a person of a different ethnic group.</p> \n<p>The Israel Police issued the following response: “This was a theft case that took place more than three years ago… We are studying the court's decision and if necessary, the appropriate lessons will be learned.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Until 2018, the men and women on this list may have been known in their communities or professional circles, although some were still complete unknowns. They were chosen because this was their breakout year, the one in which they inspired those around them and became known to the wider world – either through their victories and accomplishments or, conversely, the way they handled challenges and even tragedies. Some, meanwhile, just introduced the world to a crazy song...</p> \n<p>1. Jacky Rosen</p> \n<p>In the casino lingo of her state of Nevada, 61-year-old Jacky Rosen hit the political jackpot. Three short years have taken her from synagogue president to freshman congresswoman to senator. Her hard-fought win in the 2018 midterms was the Democrats’ sole success in flipping a GOP Senate seat. Impressive, particularly in view of the fact that her opponent was strongly backed by the wealthiest and most powerful Republican donor in the state (and country) – Sheldon Adelson.</p> \n<p>The former computer programmer and software consultant will serve on five Senate committees – including homeland security, and health, education and labor – when she starts her new job next month. Not bad for someone derided as “Wacky” Jacky by the leader of the Free World.</p> \n<p>2. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers</p> \n<p>The world of Rabbi Jeffrey Myers was turned upside down on October 27 when gunfire rang out in his Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue as he was leading morning services. He was a hero – and not only because he helped some worshippers escape the synagogue and told others trapped in the back of the sanctuary to drop to the floor. In the days after the tragedy (which he still only refers to as “October 27th”), he put his own pain aside, officiating at the funerals of the 11 deceased congregants, escorting President Donald Trump as he paid his respects on a controversial visit to the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, and acting as a voice of calm and reason, imploring political leaders to tone down their rhetoric.</p> \n<p>Marking the end of the shloshim (first 30 days of mourning), Myers, 62, wrote: “The outpouring of compassion and love, not just from fellow Jews, but people of all faiths throughout the world, has been a soothing balm. It has reassured not just our synagogue, but the entire Jewish community, that we are not alone at this time, that all good people stand with us.”</p> \n<p>3. Bari Weiss</p> \n<p>Less than a year after leaving the Wall Street Journal for the New York Times opinions section, 34-year-old Bari Weiss joined her mentor, Bret Stephens, as one of the Gray Lady’s highest-profile and most controversial opinion-makers. Carving out a lane that sets off the paper’s liberal readers and conservative foes alike, Weiss – who jokes that she is “sort of intellectually promiscuous” – has penned takes on the #MeToo movement and Israel that have gone viral, making her a prime target for abuse on Twitter. She has also become a favorite guest on HBO’s weekly political show “Real Time with Bill Maher.”</p> \n<p>In November, after the anti-Semitic shooting attack on the Tree of Life synagogue where she herself became a bat mitzvah while growing up in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, Weiss won much praise after penning a deeply personal piece describing the devastation “when a terrorist comes to your hometown.”</p> \n<p>4. Einat Kalisch Rotem and Aliza Bloch</p> \n<p>There may not have been a Knesset election in Israel this year, but municipal races put several female faces on the national radar. Dr. Einat Kalisch Rotem, 48, defeated Haifa’s longtime mayor in a landslide win, making her the first elected woman to head one of Israel’s three major cities. The left-wing Kalisch Rotem, who has a doctorate in architecture and urban planning, was aided by the northern city’s ultra-Orthodox community, who backed her against incumbent Yona Yahav.</p> \n<p>In a much tighter race in the small but high-profile city of Beit Shemesh, the 51-year-old religious-Zionist candidate Aliza Bloch surprised everyone by ending the reign of controversial ultra-Orthodox Mayor Moshe Abutbul. And this in a city that many Israelis had written off as hurtling toward religious extremism. In her victory speech, the former school principal declared: “From today, Beit Shemesh will be a model for the nation.”</p> \n<p>5. Rabbi Dov Haiyun</p> \n<p>The year 2018 was a roller-coaster one for Rabbi Dov Haiyun, spiritual leader of one of Israel’s oldest Conservative congregations. His lowest point came in July when he was detained by the police after a complaint was filed against him by Haifa’s rabbinical court. It was an attempt to enforce a law prohibiting Jewish weddings be performed outside of the Chief Rabbinate in Israel&nbsp;– a crime that carries a potential two-year jail sentence.</p> \n<p>But Haiyun, 56, made lemonade out of lemons: after a public outcry derailed his detention (and after the intervention of Israel’s attorney general, Avichai Mendelblit), he rode the wave of public sympathy to become the first non-Orthodox rabbi ever to serve as deputy mayor of an Israeli city – in this case Haifa, serving under Kalisch Rotem. He also experienced an uptick in demand for his services at weddings, perhaps proving his mantra that “when you sow love, you reap love.”</p> \n<p>6. Newbie Jewish congressmen and women</p> \n<p>Eight Jewish newcomers – four men and four women – will take their seats in the House of Representatives in January, after midterm victories in the “blue wave” gave the Democratic Party control of the lower house. Three attention-getting Jewish military veterans scored unexpected upsets: Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Max Rose of New York (who overturned a large GOP majority on Staten Island) and Elaine Luria of Virginia, who once held a Passover seder on an aircraft carrier. They are joined by the two Levins – California’s Mike and Michigan’s Andy; Minnesota’s Dean Phillips; Susan Wild of Pennsylvania; and Kim Schrier from Washington.</p> \n<p>And last week, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – the 29-year-old incoming Democratic congresswoman from New York who has been critical of Israeli policy in Gaza – said that members of her family were descendants of Jews forced to convert and flee Spain during the Inquisition in the 15th century.</p> \n<p>7. Netta Barzilai</p> \n<p>Never, it seems, has an Israeli been transformed quite so quickly from a nobody to the name on everyone’s lips – including the country’s prime minister (much to the confusion of Bing’s auto-translating machine) – than Netta Barzilai. The 25-year-old singer from Hod Hasharon accomplished what nobody thought possible by being crowned winner of the 63rd Eurovision Song Contest in May with her over-the-top clucking and strutting performance of the #MeToo anthem “Toy.”</p> \n<p>Barzilai, who earned the right to represent Israel by winning a reality show competition, will be the star of the show when Eurovision comes to Israel for the first time in 20 years next May. However, writers of “Toy” fared slightly less well after Universal Music threatened to sue them over their song’s similarities to the White Stripes’ “Seven Nation Army.” Luckily, they reportedly reached a deal that meant Israel wouldn’t be stripped of its Euro crown due to plagiarism.</p> \n<p>8. Ady Barkan</p> \n<p>Among the many political progressive activists emerging during the Trump presidency, Israeli-American Ady Barkan has stood out. His fight against legislation that chips away at Obamacare and his battle for Democratic victories in the midterms hasn’t just been political – it’s been personal. Barkan, 35, is dying of ALS (or Lou Gehrig’s disease) and is devoting his final years to the battle for health care. His body growing weaker, he raised money and campaigned for candidates in 22 states during the 2018 election campaign, addressing crowds from his wheelchair and declaring that he is “willing to give my last breath to save our democracy.” As he told his followers on Twitter several times. “I may be dying, but I’m definitely not going quietly.”</p> \n<p>9. Adele Raemer</p> \n<p>It’s not every day that an English teacher from the Bronx living on a kibbutz in southern Israel gets invited to testify before the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. But that is what happened to Adele Raemer, who was asked to address the UNHRC’s Independent Commission of Inquiry in November about events on the Gaza border this year.</p> \n<p>Raemer, 64, was chosen because her Facebook group, Life on the Border with Gaza – Things People May Not Know (But Should), has drawn a worldwide following, making her the face and voice of Gaza-area residents in the English-speaking world. Like her social media presence, Raemer’s UN testimony described how missile attacks and incendiary kites and balloons affect real lives, emphasizing the “little details of people’s lives that do not get reported in the press.”</p> \n<p>10. Ben Yaffet</p> \n<p>Normally, it takes a major sports team or famous musician to fill an arena with thousands of enthusiastic people. But the Israeli phenomenon known as Koolulam, with its cool, dreadlocked front man Ben Yaffet, has been drawing huge crowds not as spectators but to participate in mass performances of popular songs.</p> \n<p>Yaffet flits across the stage, conducting what he calls a “social choir.” Videos of the happenings have gone viral worldwide, Koolulam’s visibility peaking when Israeli President Reuven Rivlin was among 12,000 at an event marking Israel’s 70th anniversary this spring. In October, Koolulam traveled to South Africa, where 3,500 people came along to sing along – its first international foray, but surely not its last.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It has become almost clich&eacute; in recent years to say Israel and the Jewish Diaspora have never been more divided. But just when you thought things couldn’t get any worse, along comes 2018, bringing with it new low points. Here are nine of the very lowest...</p> \n<p>1 Pittsburgh massacre aftermath</p> \n<p>In the deadliest attack ever carried out against Jews in American history, 11 worshippers were gunned down in the midst of Shabbat morning prayers at a Conservative synagogue on October 27. The shooter said he hated Jews because they are welcoming to refugees, and he wanted no refugees in the United States.</p> \n<p>The Israeli government was quick to react, sending an official representative to Pittsburgh’s Jewish community as a sign of solidarity. Given his portfolio, Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett seemed a natural choice. But was he. During his visit, Bennett went on to defend U.S. President&nbsp;Donald Trump&nbsp;– believed by many progressive Jews to be partly responsible for the hateful atmosphere which served as the backdrop for the killer's actions – calling Trump “a great friend of Israel and of the Jews.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Moreover, nothing could seemingly be further from Bennett’s heart than the plight of refugees. Chairman of the Orthodox, settler-aligned Habayit Hayehudi party, he has called for the deportation of African asylum seekers from Israel. And it was Bennett who, earlier this year, pressured Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to renege on a deal that would have allowed thousands of them to obtain legal status in the country. What was the government thinking, some wondered, when it chose to send a right-winger like Bennett to a community targeted because of its progressive values?</p> \n<p>The icing on the cake, as it were, came from Israel’s Ashkenazi chief rabbi, David Lau, who refused to directly call the site of the massacre a synagogue, describing it instead as a “place with a profound Jewish flavor.”</p> \n<p>2 Leftists detained</p> \n<p>A travel ban enacted by Israel early last year was supposed to bar key activists in the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement from entering the country. It wasn’t supposed to target visitors who disagree with the Israeli government, certainly not prominent Jews. But events of the past summer would suggest otherwise.</p> \n<p>In July, Moriel Rothman-Zecher, an Israeli author and anti-occupation activist who resides in the United States, was detained by Shin Bet security service officials when he landed at Ben-Gurion Airport. He was warned by his interrogators that left-wing activities were a “slippery slope.” Earlier that same month, prominent Jewish-American philanthropist Meyer Koplow was held up on his way out of the country after a Palestinian tourism brochure was discovered in his suitcase.</p> \n<p>In August, Simone Zimmerman – a founding member of the Jewish anti-occupation group IfNotNow – was detained at the Israeli-Egyptian border, together with fellow activist Abby Kirschbaum. They were questioned about their work with Palestinians in the West Bank and their views on Netanyahu. That same month, prominent U.S. journalist Peter Beinart, on a trip to Israel to attend a family celebration, was interrogated at the airport about his participation in a protest in the West Bank city of Hebron a few years earlier.</p> \n<p>The following month, Julie Weinberg-Connors – a young American who planned to study at a Jerusalem yeshiva and eventually immigrate to Israel – was almost deported after landing in Tel Aviv. Her alleged crime: A previous visit to a Bedouin village in the West Bank that is off-limits to Israelis. Weinberg-Connors was questioned at the airport for two-and-a-half hours before being released. Last month, her citizenship request was approved.</p> \n<p>Still, her experience, and those of other left-wing Jewish activists, has left many progressive-minded Jews wondering whether they should risk a visit to Israel. In an unprecedented move this fall, the Reform movement began furnishing its rabbinical students in Israel with letters to present to the authorities in case they get detained at the border. The letters confirm that they are not engaged in any activities the government might consider sinister.</p> \n<p>3 Birthright walkouts</p> \n<p>Almost 20 years ago, a group of Jewish philanthropists, together with representatives of the Israeli government, came up with a novel idea. To combat rising rates of intermarriage among Diaspora Jews, they said, let’s send every young Jewish adult on a free trip to Israel. The result, Taglit-Birthright, is often ranked as one of the most successful Jewish world projects of modern times.</p> \n<p>But many things have changed since its inception. For one, the billionaire Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson was not on the scene at the beginning. Today, he is the organization’s single biggest funder. Second, in the past two decades, Israel has veered increasingly to the right, while young Jewish millennials have moved in the opposite direction. Many young millennials consider policies Israel pursues – particularly its occupation of the West Bank – antithetical to their progressive values.</p> \n<p>With Birthright increasingly perceived as an Adelson-financed Israeli propaganda tool, the backlash was inevitable. This summer, activists affiliated with the U.S.-based Jewish anti-occupation movement IfNotNow organized a series of highly publicized walkouts on Birthright trips, causing considerable embarrassment to the organization.</p> \n<p>The narrative participants are exposed to on Birthright trips, they charged, neglects to mention that there is another side. (The movement’s activists also handed out flyers, containing information about Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, to Birthright participants flying out of JFK Airport in New York.)</p> \n<p>Did these walkouts succeed in turning away potential participants? It’s too early to tell but, coincidentally or not, Birthright participation figures for the current winter season are down markedly, according to trip organizers.</p> \n<p>4 Reform, Conservative leadership sidelined</p> \n<p>It’s no secret that Reform and Conservative leaders have their issues with Israel’s prime minister. They want recognition for their movements, but as Netanyahu has explained to them on numerous occasions, he would be happy to provide them with recognition if it didn’t mean jeopardizing the future of his government. The ultra-Orthodox parties, whose support he relies on for his governing coalition, would simply never agree to such recognition.</p> \n<p>Try as he might, the premier has not succeeded in gaining much sympathy for his plight among Reform and Conservative leaders. Convinced it was a lost cause, he decided to experiment with another strategy: If Reform and Conservative leaders were unwilling to show any flexibility or tone down their criticism of him, he would find other people in their movements who might. The idea was to create a back channel for dialogue with other representatives of the movements, not necessarily at the highest echelons.</p> \n<p>Among the driving forces behind this initiative was Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador in Washington, who helped organize a delegation of congregational rabbis that visited Israel in October and met with the prime minister. Here’s how Union for Reform Judaism President Rabbi Rick Jacobs responded: “We hope that Prime Minister Netanyahu will understand his responsibility to renew a sincere, honest and meaningful dialogue with the leadership of the movement. We did not and would not break off respectful discussions with the leadership of the Israeli government. It was the prime minister who broke his promises to provide government funding for our congregations in Israel, to fund mikvehs [ritual purification baths] for the streams, reneged on the Western Wall compromise agreement, and has done nothing to stop the vicious incitement against our movement. This moment of division must be overcome through courageous leadership. We’ve always done our part, and we expect nothing less from the prime minister.”</p> \n<p>5 Irate over nation-state</p> \n<p>As a general rule, where Israelis stand on the controversial Jewish nation-state law is where they stand politically: Right-wingers support it, left-wingers do not. Its detractors argue that the controversial law, passed in July, downplays Israel’s democratic character and poses a potential threat to the status of non-Jewish minorities in the country.</p> \n<p>For overseas Jews, though, it’s been less of a partisan issue: Indeed, opposition in the Diaspora has been nearly across the board. Organizations as mainstream as the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish Federations of North America – usually reluctant to intervene in internal Israeli matters and criticize the government – have issued sharp rebukes of the law.</p> \n<p>Even the Jewish Agency – that embodiment of the old-school establishment – could not resist a jab. At its last board of governors meeting in October, the Agency passed a resolution reaffirming its commitment to “the fundamental principles of the State of Israel as emerging from the Declaration of Independence.”</p> \n<p>The nation-state law was not mentioned by name, but the resolution was clearly prompted by its passage and the opposition it has sparked across the Jewish world. The Declaration of Independence stipulates that the State of Israel “will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants, irrespective of religion, race or sex.”</p> \n<p>6 GA no-show</p> \n<p>Once every five years, the Jewish Federations of North America hold their big annual bash (aka the “General Assembly,” or “GA”) in Israel. This year, for the first time ever, the event was held in Tel Aviv. No doubt alluding to the deep crisis plaguing Israel-Diaspora relations, it was titled: “We Need to Talk.” Three jam-packed days were devoted to the subject, and more than 2,500 delegates from Israel and the Diaspora took part. And guess who didn’t show up? Diaspora Affairs Minister Bennett. Was he invited? Indeed. A spokesman for the Israeli government liaison to world Jewry explained that Bennett could not attend because of “prearranged commitments” that could not be moved. Efforts to discover what those commitments were have thus far yielded no results.</p> \n<p>7 Non-Orthodox rabbi arrested</p> \n<p>Non-Orthodox movements are not officially recognized in Israel, but never before has a non-Orthodox rabbi been arrested for doing what rabbis typically do. At the crack of dawn on a weekday morning in mid-July, police woke Rabbi Dov Haiyun and dragged him in for questioning at the nearest precinct. Haiyun is the spiritual leader of Congregation Moriah in Haifa, one of the oldest Conservative synagogues in Israel. His alleged crime was marrying an Israeli couple outside the confines of the Chief Rabbinate.</p> \n<p>Under a law passed several years ago, rabbis who officiate at traditional Jewish weddings (in other words, weddings where everything is conducted in accordance with halakha, or Jewish religious law) but do not register, as required, with the Rabbinate could face up to two years in jail.</p> \n<p>The incident involving Haiyun was the first time the law was tested. Word of his arrest spread quickly and, before long, condemnations were pouring in from around the globe. Their common theme: How dare Israel arrest a rabbi for officiating at a Jewish wedding? In Haiyun’s case, all’s well that end’s well. The 56-year-old rabbi was able to parlay his newfound fame into a major electoral achievement. He won enough votes in the recent municipal elections to be named deputy mayor of Haifa, becoming the first non-Orthodox rabbi to ever serve in local government in Israel.</p> \n<p>8 Another setback for conversion reform</p> \n<p>It’s the issue that refuses to go away: Reform and Conservative Judaism are the largest Jewish movements in the Diaspora, yet Israel refuses to recognize conversions performed by their rabbis.</p> \n<p>In practice, this means that Jews of choice who were converted by Reform and Conservative rabbis cannot legally marry in Israel. They can, however, immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return. A few years ago, the ultra-Orthodox parties in Netanyahu’s government tried to pass a new law that would outlaw conversions performed outside the confines of the state-sanctioned Rabbinate. World Jewish leaders responded with outrage, so Netanyahu put the legislation on hold. In the meantime, he said, he would try to come up with an acceptable compromise.</p> \n<p>The task of resolving the crisis was given to Moshe Nissim, a prominent Likud politician who had previously served as justice minister and finance minister. The ultra-Orthodox parties and non-Orthodox movements both waited with bated breath for Nissim to publish his recommendations. He finally did so in June, and when he did both sides finally had something they could agree on: Neither liked what he was proposing.</p> \n<p>Nissim’s plan was to set up a new public institution, independent of the Rabbinate, that would be in charge of all conversions performed in Israel. The ultra-Orthodox didn’t like the idea because it meant that the Rabbinate, which they control, would lose its power. The non-Orthodox movements didn’t like it because the new authority, under Nissim’s proposal, would only recognize and perform Orthodox conversions.</p> \n<p>So what happened to Nissim’s recommendations? Nada. The cabinet has yet to discuss them. Netanyahu has already made clear there’s little chance of passing them, and both the government and non-Orthodox movements agreed last week to hold off on any action that could change the status quo for another six months.</p> \n<p>9 Western Wall broken promises</p> \n<p>Remember the Kotel deal? In January 2016, the Israeli government approved a plan that would have granted the Reform and Conservative movements official status at the Jewish holy site, as well as creating a new and improved egalitarian prayer space for them. It was hailed at the time as “historic.” But no sooner had the deal entered the world than it began crumbling. Within 18 months, under pressure from his Orthodox coalition partners, Netanyahu announced it was being suspended. However, he promised, a key part of the deal would be implemented: The renovation and upgrade of the existing egalitarian prayer space on the southern expanse of the Western Wall.</p> \n<p>In a video address to the GA of the Jewish Federations of North America late last year, the prime minister said, “I hope you will see the improved space before next year.” How hard could it be to undertake a renovation of a few hundred meters of space? Almost impossible, it turns out. More than a year has passed since Netanyahu reassured North American Jewish leaders that the plan was proceeding on schedule. A visit to the site tells a very different story.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The 2011 admission-committees law grants communities a liberal and vague authority to reject applications by people seeking to move in. One common justification to excuse the screening of would-be residents is the label “unsuitable candidate for the community’s social life.” Under the law, such a claim must be based on the “professional opinion” of a screening institute.</p> \n<p>But in the guise of professionalism there is always a close link between the community and the institute contracted to do the evaluation, especially in cases where the community isn’t keen to accept the person or people.</p> \n<p>This isn’t solely about sending candidates’ cases to a certain institute, but building a system of evaluations in accordance with specific characteristics and demands. You can find institutes that promise to ensure “an orderly process of communication with the community,” or the “coordination of expectations and positions about the applicants.”</p> \n<p>Sometimes, such as in a case uncovered by Haaretz’s Or Kashti over the weekend, a screening institute even dramatically amends its original opinion about a family, after the community appeals. In the case Kashti looked into, two opinions that were provided over a space of months came out vastly different.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The exclusive Israeli communities that shun Arabs, Mizrahim and anyone else 'incompatible'</p> \n<p>The original grade given the father in the category “social characteristics” tumbled. Positive comments about him and his family were removed, including the conclusion that the family was “suitable” for the community. A new conclusion appeared: “There is potential for creating a subcommunity or at the very least harming the character of the existing community.”</p> \n<p>The first version of the opinion by the Adam Milo Institute did not contain the “subcommunity” concept. The introduction of that term doesn’t seem a coincidence; it was a reason to allow the rejection of the application. The term also appears in the community’s appeal after it believed that the original evaluation was too positive.</p> \n<p>Also, the process for the appeal was kept secret; even members of the government board that reviews such appeals didn’t know what the procedure was. Nor did anyone tell the family about the appeal or suggest that they seek a new evaluation.</p> \n<p>In 2014 the High Court of Justice rejected appeals against the admission committees by a 5:4 vote. The court said that at issue was a general discussion, not a specific case. But in light of the case that Kashti looked into, the petition should be revived because of the unconstitutionality of the law.</p> \n<p>In a minority opinion, then-Justice Salim Joubran cautioned that the screening institutes would have trouble standing up to “the wishes of their employers – the communities,” and would become “fig leaves for admission committees’ decisions.” The justification for this fear has been borne out by reality. The next step to take is to repeal all the laws that allow such discrimination.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz's lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The calls by Israeli legislators, mainly from the Habayit Hayehudi party, for “a fitting Zionist response” to the recent terror attacks – in the form of building permits for settlements and the authorization of illegal outposts&nbsp;– are part of an attempt to conceal the bleak picture that is the messianic settlement project outside the settlement blocs and east of the security barrier.</p> \n<p>The Central Bureau of Statistics’ recently published socioeconomic index for the West Bank – covering 413,000 settlers in 127 settlements – once again reveals the poor socioeconomic status of most Israelis there. It reveals the burden on the Israeli economy and the gloomier economic future lurking around the corner.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How many settlers need to be evacuated to make way for a Palestinian state</p> \n<p>The distinction between “settlement blocs” and isolated settlements underscores yet again the government’s cynical exploitation of the weaker segments of Jewish Israeli society, which are being sacrificed to the disastrous nationalist messianic Moloch. These voices seek to present a false picture of the growing Jewish presence in the West Bank and justify the enormous budgets uselessly poured there without any chance of altering the spatial and demographic balance that clearly tilts in the Palestinians’ favor.</p> \n<p>The vast majority of the terror attacks occur outside the main settlement blocs that are within the security barrier, or in the Gush Etzion settlement bloc, where the barrier was not completed due to pressure from the council heads there. Around 90,000 people currently live beyond the barrier in 49 isolated settlements. Some 93 percent of them fall into the bottom half of the socioeconomic rankings. The 2015 election results show that the poorest settlements are home to messianic, religious-Zionist, right-wing voters for Habayit Hayehudi and the Yahad party.</p> \n<p>The Netanyahu government, led by the efforts of Habayit Hayehudi’s Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked, isn’t stinting on funding for these areas. In almost 80 percent of the settlements that improved their situation, Habayit Hayehudi was the largest party. A 5-billion-shekel ($1.3 billion) plan to improve roads was also recently approved. The rate of government-ministry participation in the revenue of these communities is very high. For example, in the area governed by the Samaria Regional Council, home to just 41,000 people, this sum is 265 million shekels, or 84 percent of revenue.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; It pays off to be an Israeli settler, whether trespasser or landowner</p> \n<p>Worse, these are the settlements that with the illegal outposts comprise thousands of homes built on private Palestinian land, the situation that yielded the law that legalized settlements built on such land. Some of these settlements are the source of anti-Arab “price tag” attacks, as well as clashes with Palestinians and the army.</p> \n<p>The communities located outside the barrier also include the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea settlements, which have a smaller number of residents – 6,451 people living in 26 settlements. They’re largely associated with the Zionist Union party and fall in the upper half of the socioeconomic index. People settled here in the first decade after the Six-Day War mostly for security purposes. Some of these settlements, however, are in the bottom third of the index, with a majority of Habayit Hayehudi voters.</p> \n<p>Along the western side of the security barrier the picture is totally different. The settlements here were built according to government plans that sought to avoid placing Jewish communities in densely populated Palestinian areas. This group, comprising 51 settlements with 316,608 residents, may be divided into three subgroups.</p> \n<p>Ultra-Orthodox Israelis, or Haredim, who live in five settlements and account for 41 percent of the total, are the poorest of the three and almost all come in at the bottom of the index. The percentage of children is huge; 67 percent in Modi’in Ilit, for example. The percentage of 12th-graders who were able to earn a matriculation certificate and meet the basic admission requirements for university is scandalous – just 0.7 percent in Modi’in Ilit.</p> \n<p>In other words, 90,000 children in this group, or nearly a quarter of the Israeli population in the West Bank, will continue to need government support and remain at the bottom of Israel’s wage index.</p> \n<p>Sixty percent earn up to the minimum wage, no further. These figures also explain the high rate of government participation in these areas’ revenue – about 400 million shekels. These settlements’ contribution to the messianic choir of Bennett, Shaked &amp; Co. comes in the form of the false portrayal of population growth in the settlements, because nearly half the annual growth comes from these Haredi settlements, which are not aligned with Habayit Hayehudi’s messianic-nationalist ideology.</p> \n<p>Still in the bottom half of the index, to the west of the security barrier, is a group of 10 settlements home to less than 5 percent of the population, and where Habayit Hayehudi is the dominant party. Another 5 percent is in the settlement of Givat Ze’ev, where Likud leads.</p> \n<p>The third and largest group falls in the upper half of the index and comprises 49 percent of the population living in 35 settlements. This group includes many voters for Likud, Zionist Union, Yesh Atid and Kulanu. In these places, the percentage of children is lower at 38 percent. The percentage of students eligible for a matriculation certificate is high – 82 percent. Only one-quarter of this population earns the minimum wage or less. Government participation in these localities’ revenue is 40 percent on average, for a total of 300 million shekels.</p> \n<p>The picture revealed by the socioeconomic index shows us what people making heated calls for a “Zionist response” are trying to hide from us. They want to bring more people to the poor settlements in the “Gav Hahar” area that were put there by Gush Emunim adherents and never took off. Instead these places are simply in the heart of Palestinian areas and have been a constant cause of friction and violence.</p> \n<p>A fitting Zionist response at this point would be an evacuation-compensation law, the evacuation of the isolated settlements, the completion of the security barrier around the main settlement blocs, and the finding of a way to resume negotiations with the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>After all, only with a final-status accord will it be possible to make the strong settlements near the Green Line part of Israel proper and find a different way of handling the Haredim who were pushed over the Green Line due to the housing crunch.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, for this we need a government with a Zionist vision of a Jewish-majority democratic country that seeks peace with its neighbors, not a messianic-nationalist government.</p> \n<p>Dr. Shaul Arieli is the author of “All Israel's Borders.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Hundreds of retired high-ranking officers, joined by former senior Mossad and Shin Bet security service officials, signed a so-called professional opinion in 2005&nbsp;that said: “The disengagement is good for security.” Now that the disengagement has proved to be the best way to achieve peace and security, we all — especially those living near the Gaza border — owe a thousand thanks to the members of the Peace and Security Association. Together they achieved great success, as can be seen by the peace and security in the south in the past 13 years.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Now, riding the waves of that stunning success, some 300 people who call themselves Commanders for Israel’s Security are leading a campaign to persuade the public to finish the job; that is, to disengage (“for the sake of Israel’s security”) also from Judea and Samaria. The slogan this time: “Divorce the Palestinians.”</p> \n<p>As in every divorce, someone must be uprooted from home. From the successful precedent of Gush Katif, it’s clear who that will be. The lofty notion of displacing Jews has never lacked for supporters. Its current supporters (who are unknown; the organization refused to divulge its funding sources) are bankrolling the campaign. To advance the sacred cause, friendly editors and producers in the print and electronic media (of which there is no shortage) are happy to show the masses the justness of the divorce doctrine.</p> \n<p>As we know, many ex-defense officials volunteered to help Ariel Sharon convince the public that the worries about missiles in Ashkelon were the stuff of right-wing delusions and fears of peace. They promised the unilateral removal would make the south bloom, and that the billions of shekels that had been spent on protecting the settlers would be diverted to welfare and education. This is how they summed up their security authority: “We those undersigned state, in our professional opinion, that the voluntary disengagement plan helps strengthen the state and is vital to security. Voluntary disengagement is a move of strength.”</p> \n<p>Five years before, many of them supported, also for professional reasons of course, a similar move of strength: the heroic night flight from Lebanon. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah likened Israel’s endurance to spider webs. He has been proved right, especially in the Second Lebanon War.&nbsp;Since the disengagement, Hamas has also adopted this metaphor.</p> \n<p>We presumably will have to divorce the Palestinians. But why is it always the Jew who must leave the home, the heart of the homeland, and on his own initiative? Such a move also challenges his moral right to the adjacent home to which he must now be exiled. Once again he must shoehorn into a narrow home between Qalqilyah and Netanya, some 12 kilometers wide and vulnerable to gunfire and short-range rockets.</p> \n<p>In the flights from Lebanon and Gaza, the security experts promised that if the enemy dares shell the home front “we’ll clobber it.” We can see how Hezbollah was clobbered after we fled Lebanon in 2000, and especially how, when it pounded the home front in 2006, we left the fight before it was done. We let Hezbollah hoard hundreds of thousands of missiles, dig attack tunnels below us and act as advance guard for Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. And we haven’t stopped clobbering Hamas, which has been torturing us for 13 years.</p> \n<p>And so, well-intentioned people who have long since blinded themselves to reality seek to duplicate the brilliant model of “the disengagement is good for security” from Lebanon and Gaza in Judea and Samaria. The heart aches, and refuses to believe.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“A community has been sitting under its vine and its fig tree for years, and suddenly someone questions the ownership of the land.” The speaker was a cabinet minister, Yuval Steinitz, and he was referring to the settlers of Amona, who were compelled to leave their homes, some two years ago, after it turned out that they stood on privately owned Palestinian land. The same comment could easily be made about the residents of Silwan, a Palestinian neighborhood abutting the Old City of Jerusalem, who lived in their home for decades before the buildings were transferred to the ultranationalist Ateret Cohanim organization; or about the folks in Jerusalem’s upscale Rehavia neighborhood, who suddenly discovered, some three or four years ago, that they were living on land that the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate has sold to private developers; and also about the Jewish residents of the former Palestinian village of Lifta, at the western entrance to Jerusalem, who last year were required to vacate the homes they had lived in for 60 years.</p> \n<p>Amona, Rehavia, Lifta&nbsp;and Silwan&nbsp;have all made the headlines in recent years for the same reason: Families in each neighborhood have been evicted from their homes, or face evacuation, because they are living on land they don’t own.</p> \n<p>Each case is a separate story in its own right. No one drew a connection between the residents of Rehavia, who today are fearful for the future of their property, and the people in Silwan, who face a similar plight under far grimmer conditions. Each case has its own distinctness, and comparisons can be tricky. But the similarity of the basic plot, combined with the differences in the way the political and judicial systems in Israel have treated each case, reveal a bitter truth about equality, property rights and social status in Israel and the territories.</p> \n<p>The illegal settler outpost of Amona was established by the Binyamin Regional Council and the Ministry of Defense in 1997. It was built on privately owned Palestinian land in what is occupied territory under Israeli law, without permits and without appearing in a mandatory master plan. Twenty years later, in 2017, following a protracted legal battle waged by the Palestinian owners of the land, the outpost was evacuated. The government established a new community for the evacuees at an estimated cost of 250 million shekels (about $68 million). During the battle against the evacuation of the outpost, the Knesset passed a law that allows the state to expropriate privately owned Palestinian land in the West Bank. To date, the Palestinian landowners from Amona have not been allowed to return to their property.</p> \n<p>In the case of Rehavia, parts of neighborhoods in the center of Jerusalem were built on land that the Jewish National Fund leased in the early 1950s for decades from the Greek Orthodox and Catholic Churches. Most of the contracts will expire in another 30 years. In recent years, nearly all of this land has been purchased by private developers, most likely for the purpose of selling it back to the current residents. House prices have already plunged 30 percent, and the occupants are in danger of losing their investments. At the moment no solution is pending, though it’s likely that in the end the JNF and the state will have to reach an agreement with the developers so that the residents are not left homeless. In the meantime, MK Rachel Azaria (Kulanu) is sponsoring legislation that would allow the state to expropriate the land.</p> \n<p>Lifta was one of the largest Palestinian villages in the Jerusalem region prior to 1948. It was abandoned by its inhabitants during the War of Independence, following which the Jewish Agency and the state settled dozens of Jewish new-immigrant families from Kurdistan and Yemen to live there, in the homes of the Palestinian refugees. As in other places, such as the Tel Aviv neighborhoods of Givat Amal Bet and Sumeil, the legal rights of the new occupants of the buildings were never formalized. About a decade ago, the Israel Land Administration demanded that the “trespassers” leave. Only after a legal and public struggle, and after one of the Lifta residents, Yoni Yohanan, found a 1953 document according to which the occupants were to be granted title to the houses, did the Finance Ministry agree to compensate them. The contents of the agreement were not made public, but the assumption is that the residents who were evacuated received more or less what the market value of their homes would have been under normal circumstances. The state seized the land, demolished the homes and launched groundwork for the widening of the last stretch of the highway to Jerusalem that is currently underway.</p> \n<p>The Batan al-Hawa section of Silwan was established after 1948 by Palestinians, some of whom had been left as refugees during the war. The neighborhood was built on the site where Kfar Hateimanin, the “Yemenite Village” – a small community which lived on land owned by a Jewish public trust – had existed prior to 1938. In 1950, the Palestinians lost their rights to the property they left behind elsewhere in the country, and in 1967 Silwan was annexed to Israel. In 2001, the Jerusalem District Court appointed Ateret Cohanim as the trust’s representatives, and in 2002 the Custodian General in the Justice Ministry released the land to the trust’s possession. In recent years, hundreds of Palestinian residents of the neighborhood have been confronted with evacuation demands on the part of Ateret Cohanim. Three weeks ago, the High Court of Justice rejected the residents’ petition and allowed Ateret Cohanim to continue with the evacuation efforts.</p> \n<p>Trampled principles</p> \n<p>Each case is distinct, but each of them involves people living on land that isn’t legally theirs: settlers, members of a Jerusalem elite, descendants of immigrants from Kurdistan and East Jerusalem Palestinians. In each case their interests are in conflict with the legal landowners, or people who claim ownership: Palestinians from the West Bank in Amona, the Greek Orthodox and Catholic churches and private developers in Rehavia, the State of Israel in Lifta and the historic trust controlled by a settlers’ nonprofit organization in Silwan. A different solution was found or can be anticipated for each case. In Amona there was an evacuation and generous compensation, as well as a special law intended to preclude similar evacuations in the future but which trampled basic international legal principles in the present, not least that the legislature is precluded from enacting laws that are applied to people who lack the right to vote. In Rehavia there’s a commitment by the JNF to solve the problem, and a process has begun for the Knesset to pass a special law. Lifta saw a voluntary evacuation in return for generous compensation, while in Batan el-Hawa the Palestinians are being required to evacuate their homes and also to pay compensation to the settlers.</p> \n<p>Additional differences also exist, such as the residents’ level of awareness that the land belonged to someone else. There is evidence that in Amona, Rehavia and also Lifta the occupants knew there was a problem with the title land, and that they assumed the problem would somehow be solved. In Silwan, at least some of the people bought their homes years ago at market price without knowing about the land issue. Another difference is that only two of the groups of settlers were termed “trespassers” in the more recent legal documents: the Kurdistan Jews from Lifta and the Palestinians from Silwan. The others are not perceived publicly as intruders, but as “residents” or “occupants.”</p> \n<p>A further important difference is the reason for the occupancy and its duration. Three of the four cases – Silwan, Rehavia and Lifta – are related to the rupture of 1948. At that time, populations moved from one side to the other, property was abandoned on a large scale, homeless people settled where they could and deals were concluded quickly in order to consolidate the fledgling state. The fourth case, Amona, is related to the rupture of 1967. The settlers in Amona cannot enjoy the benefit of the doubt connected to urgent need and an emergency situation. The inhabitants of Silwan and Lifta built their lives in those places for lack of choice. Both groups were refugees in the wake of the 1948 events and had lived in their homes for some 70 years. The Amona settlers had other options and chose to live at the site for ideological reasons. They lived there for about 20 years, 10 of them after the legal procedures for their evacuation began.</p> \n<p>The differences also stand out in terms of the mobilization of the media, the judicial system and the political arena in favor of residents facing evacuation. The case of Amona brought about a general mobilization by the right wing, whose results were apparent in emotional reports about the crumbling community and the families who were being forced out of their homes. Amona also generated political crises, posed a threat to the government’s stability and gave rise to a special law tailored to the circumstances.</p> \n<p>The political response to the Rehavia case, too, suggests that the state can mobilize to prevent injustice and legal absurdities, enact special legislation, underwrite compensation and also undermine property rights, when it wants to. On the other side of Jerusalem, in Silwan, the full force of the law is being wielded against the Palestinian residents, and no one dares to acknowledge that they, even more than the inhabitants of Rehavia, are really just the victims of historical and political circumstances.</p> \n<p>Additional similarities and differences can also be found, but the hierarchy is quite clear. If you’re a trespasser it’s best to be a settler, and if not a settler then a resident of Rehavia, and if not that, then a Mizrahi from Lifta. But don’t be a Palestinian from Silwan. The same pecking order holds if you own land that someone else is living on. Here, too, it’s preferable to be Jewish: Your rights will be preserved in perpetuity, and laws will be bent so you can recoup your property. In this case again, as always, the worst is to be a Palestinian.</p> \n<p>Right-wing readers won’t understand the point of this article. From their viewpoint, it’s clear that the supreme goal of the State of Israel is to bring about Zionist settlement in the entire space between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, and accordingly policy must be intended to assist Jewish settlers and to interfere with all others. After all, that’s the essence of Zionism. We’ll ignore for the moment the question of who is more Zionist – the residents of Rehavia and Lifta or the settlers of Amona; the important point in this comparison is that it exposes the naked truth, without the veil of clich&eacute;s and slogans.</p> \n<p>One can’t reasonably argue that there is moral wrong in the uprooting of the families in Amona or in the threat to the property of the Rehavia residents, without seeing the same wrong in Silwan. It’s not reasonable to argue that the state must expropriate, pay and legislate in order to protect people who are living on their land without thinking that the residents of Lifta and Silwan are also entitled to the same protection. Nor it is possible to view Israel as a law-abiding country and Jerusalem as a unified city when the law changes according to nationality and is applied differently in the two sides of the city.</p>",

Even though the American presence did not have a decisive role in Israel’s direct campaign against Iran in Syria, the United States was an important counterweight to the Russians in establishing the rules of the game in the region. Its involvement in northern Syria helped in keeping Iranian forces away from Israel’s border in the Golan Heights.</p> \n<p>Benjamin Netanyahu’s statement on Thursday that Israel “will continue to take very strong action against Iran’s attempts to entrench itself in Syria” should not be allowed to muffle the resounding slap in the face to the prime minister’s fawning policy toward the Trump administration.

And now, Israel is paying for that.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The withdrawal of American forces from Syria sends a clear message to Israel, as well as to other U.S. allies in the region: Work things out for yourselves, because we’re looking out only for our own direct interests. Netanyahu can continue telling Israelis that today’s Washington is inhabited by a friendly president, unlike his predecessor. But in practice, declarations of support that aren’t backed by actions on the ground are worthless.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu seems to have been blinded by the gestures, some of them merely symbolic, that Trump lavished on Israel, from withdrawing America from the Iranian nuclear deal and stepping up sanctions on Iran through moving the embassy to Jerusalem to humiliating Israel’s Palestinian partner and making it irrelevant.

        "text":["<p>The Palestinian who allegedly killed two soldiers at Givat Assaf junction last week is believed to have joined his brother outside of the West Bank settlement of Ofra&nbsp;earlier that week in shooting a pregnant woman, causing the death of the baby she was carrying.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Both of the assailants were allegedly members of cell suspected of being affiliated with Hamas.</p> \n<p>The assailant at the Givat Assaf outpost, where a soldier and civilian were also badly hurt, was identified by Palestinian reports as Assam Barghouti. His brother Salah Barghouti was allegedly one of two terrorists who carried out the attack at Ofra, in which seven people were injured and an infant of one of the injured women died shortly after being delivered. Salah Barghouti was killed by the police counter-terrorism unit three days later.</p> \n<p>Assam Barghouti, 29, of the village of Kobar north of Ramallah, had served an 11-year sentence in an Israeli prison for security offenses, including planning to abduct soldiers, He was released in April.</p> \n<p>The two brothers are suspected of carrying out the attack at Ofra together. In both attacks the assailants used Kalashnikov assault rifles. While there was only one person known to be involved in the attack at Givat Assaf on the soldiers, at Ofra, one person drove a car while a passenger fired at the hitchhiking stand.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian news agency Safa reported on Thursday that Israeli army forces raided the Barghouti family’s home village and arrested four young people. Troops entered the house of Omar Barghouti – the brothers’ father – questioned his wife and other relatives and searched the house. They then threatened to have the house demolished within the next several days.</p> \n<p>Omar Barghouti is a high-ranking Hamas official in the West Bank and has spent Israeli prison terms amounting to 28 years.</p> \n<p>The cell the brothers allegedly belong to is also said to be responsible for a series of terror attacks in recent months in the Ramallah region, defense sources believe. Shortly after the attacks, former senior defense officials criticized the arrmy and Shin Bet following a preliminary evaluation that the terrorists were not lone assailants.Some of those alledgely involved in the attacks were also already known to the army and the Shin Bet.</p> \n<p>The army said in response that the attacks were not the result of an intelligence failure. Asked why the army had not detected the preparations for the attacks before they occurred, even though the unit’s members came from families known to the defense establishment, a senior Central Command officer said: “We keep asking ourselves if we could have discovered the cell earlier. It was not a case of knowing about the cell and failing to act,” he said. “We foil hundreds of attacks a year, some of them at the last moment.”</p> \n<p>But the officer added that the army will have to reexamine its intelligence analysis in the region. The army did not know whether all the squad members had been captured, he added.</p>",

        "text":["<p>You don’t need to be a strategic genius or an old-time left-winger to grasp that the West's interests in Kurdistan follows two trajectories: intervention – whether through colonial conquests in the past or its modern-day involvements in various key strategic hot spots; and serial strategic u-turns, which could also sometimes be called betrayal.</p> \n<p>For a century, oil has been a crucial factor in Western calculations. When oil was discovered in the Middle East in the early twentieth century, Western powers jousted for territorial control, while unified by the principle that 'profit comes first.'</p> \n<p>When oil was discovered in Kirkuk, today’s Iraqi Kurdistan, long before Saudi Arabia’s own discoveries, it was still part of the Ottoman Empire. Following WWI, the British betrayed their French allies, taking over the region despite the Sykes-Picot Agreement's secret carve-up of the Middle East, signed by both sides.</p> \n<p>The Kurds should have understood by that point that the great powers were not only prepared to betray them – but were also ready to betray one other.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump abandons Syria's Kurds: Will Turkey now crush their dream of a 'secular utopia?'&nbsp;| Explained&nbsp;■&nbsp;Trump has just betrayed the Kurds, America's most important defense against ISIS | Opinion</p> \n<p>Oil price can still govern and direct the domestic policies of the superpowers. Their Achilles heel remains oil and energy management. Being French, I have seen that myself just recently: The unwise decision by France’s current government to increase the price of diesel, that would have impacted the poor the hardest, has had serious consequences, with rioters attacking the symbols of the Republic.</p> \n<p>The Kurds live above an ocean of oil: they have their own political struggles, but they also stand at the interconnection of major geopolitical strategies in which they are secondary players, but whose effects are global.</p> \n<p>But there is a second global issue that pivots, to their misfortune, on Kurdish lands: international terrorism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>President Trump's announcement that he intends to withdraw troops from northern Syria poses questions on many levels. This region is dominated by the Kurds, who fought against ISIS terrorists alongside American and French troops, who constitute the bulk of the Western boots on the ground.</p> \n<p>Such a withdrawal could give rise to a strategic vacuum, quickly filled by countries that are working against Western interests in the region.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Russia and Iran have for a long time viewed this region as theirs by right. Erdogan's Turkey, a supporter of Islamists from Hamas to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, has long served as a rear-base for Syrian Islamists. It is now seeking to expand its sphere of influence deeper into Syria. The same Turkey, fearing the creation of an autonomous Syrian Kurdish entity on its southern border and its impact on the 20 million Kurds inside Turkey, is comfortable living in a region dominated by radical Islamists and has not hesitated to ally itself with movements linked to Al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>Over 2000 ISIS terrorists are currently being held in detention by the Kurds. Disruption on the ground could see them escape - with incalculable consequences, including in the West. Remember that one single ISIS-linked terrorist in Strasbourg, France, spread terror throughout the country, and killed five innocent people in cold blood.</p> \n<p>ISIS arrived on the Middle East scene proclaiming an &quot;Islamic State,&quot; swiftly conquering one-third of Syrian-Iraqi territory and sowing terror across Western capitals. Only the Kurds, with the support of the West, were able to stop this meteoric rise in a region conducive to totalitarian ideologies.</p> \n<p>The victory that has just been won by this alliance of circumstances remains very fragile, and must be consolidated, not demolished. Surely America, and the West, learnt a lesson from the too-hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and Iraq?</p> \n<p>Perhaps the Kurds should have asked the Western powers to respect their own standards and principles, the normative frameworks of human rights and self-determination, before engaging against a common enemy, just as Gideon asked God for several guarantees before fighting on his behalf. Perhaps that would have slowed this betrayal.</p> \n<p>Trump's decision isolates and elevates America's interests from those of its allies and friends. But we live in an interconnected world and the war on terror is global.</p> \n<p>The decision to withdraw U.S. troops, when implemented, will have disastrous consequences on the streets of Europe’s capitals and in the U.S. That would take both the West, the Kurds and the wider Middle East - after all the blood that's been shed and lives lost - back to square one.</p> \n<p>Akil Marceau graduated in history and humanitarian law and has worked for French media outlets and the Japanese NHK television network. He is a researcher and former director of the Representation of the Regional Government of Iraqi Kurdistan in Paris.</p>",

Proceeds from the sale benefit both the AACI and AMIT Women. The wide selection of books, audiobooks and CDs come from the AMIT-AACI library, run by retired librarian Rolene Segal and her team of 20 volunteers. “The library originated with AMIT Women,” Segal, who hails from Cape Town, told Haaretz. “It wasn’t planned but somebody left a few books behind, we put some boxes out and books started coming in.” Segal, who has run the library for over 20 years, noted the partnership with AACI began when the AACI moved into its new center. “We don’t have a budget to buy books, so all 7,000-plus titles are donations,” she added.

Bloom noted that the content was curated by Cape Town’s South African Jewish Museum, under the directorship of Gavin Morris. The evening will feature a panel of speakers from Hebrew University, including Prof. Louise Bethlehem, Gideon Shimoni and Dr. Jonathan Mirvis, as well as honorees Maxine Fassberg and Michael Dick, both South African-born business leaders.

        "text":["<p>Rob Thompson, 34, lives in Silver Spring, Maryland; arriving from Toronto</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask what you’ll be doing in Israel?</p> \n<p>I’m here for a family wedding. I have aunts, uncles, first cousins and friends here. A lot of people I know have immigrated to Israel.</p> \n<p>Have you ever thought of doing the same?</p> \n<p>Not really. Maybe one day, but not now. I really love my work.</p> \n<p>And you couldn’t do that work in Israel?</p> \n<p>Not really. I’m a librarian at a children’s library. With children, every day is a surprise, you can never know what’s going to happen.</p> \n<p>How many books does your library have?</p> \n<p>I’m working in a small branch just now, because the big one is being renovated. I think we have around 9,000 titles.</p> \n<p>And the children really read?</p> \n<p>People say that children don’t read, but I meet children who do.</p> \n<p>They all read “Diary of a Wimpy Kid,” right?</p> \n<p>A lot of them read that, and also “Captain Underpants.” And some kids will read those books over and over. But sometimes they go on to read other things. Especially if you recommend something that grabs them.</p> \n<p>Like the book you’re holding?</p> \n<p>This is actually a book for ages 10 to 12. It’s called “The Menagerie” and it’s by a writer named Tui Sutherland [and co-author Kari Sutherland]. She has an excellent series of books about dragons called “Wings of Fire.” Do you know it?</p> \n<p>No, but every book with dragons is a friend.</p> \n<p>This book is about a zoo of mythological creatures: gryphons, unicorns and dragons. It’s the first book in a series. In the meantime I’m enjoying it very much, so I’ll probably continue to the next one.</p> \n<p>It seems as though in children’s literature today, you can only publish books in series.</p> \n<p>Yes, there have been many changes in children’s literature. Not only are there a lot of series, but the books themselves are longer. It used to be that books for this age weren’t more than 250 pages, but then along came J.K. Rowling with Harry Potter. These days there are books that have 500 pages.</p> \n<p>What do you read for your own pleasure?</p> \n<p>Fortunately, I enjoy reading children’s and juvenile books, since it’s important for me to be up-to-date. I especially like fantasy books, to escape into an invented world, filled with magical things.</p> \n<p>How did you start? With “Narnia” and “Lord of the Rings”?</p> \n<p>I don’t like “Narnia” all that much, and I read “Lord of the Rings” for the first time after high school. In fact, until high school I didn’t like reading very much, which is ironic, given that I’m a librarian today.</p> \n<p>How did that come about?</p> \n<p>I read Tamora Pearce’s “Song of the Lioness” quartet, and really loved it. That was my gateway into reading.</p> \n<p>How do you get children into the world of books?</p> \n<p>For children who don’t like to read, you can suggest graphic novels. For children who like to read, it’s worth sending them to the library themselves, because parents take what they would like the child to read, and not what he wants to read. And because I’m neither a parent nor a teacher, and don’t care about the reading level, the child can tell me what he enjoys. If he doesn’t read, I can ask him what television programs he likes, or recommend a book according to a movie he liked.</p> \n<p>The book is always better – I have a pin with that on it.</p> \n<p>Could be, but in my opinion, it’s better to let the children see the movie first, because if they like it there’s a chance they will also want to read the book, and then they’ll have two things to like.</p> \n<p>Tomer, the photographer: Are you familiar with children’s books from Israel?</p> \n<p>Unfortunately I’m not. The United States imports only about 8 percent of its books.</p> \n<p>Give us a reading list for children and teens.</p> \n<p>One – Tamora Pearce; two – Angie Sage. She’s the author of the Septimus Heap series, which is a little like Harry Potter but special in its own way. Three – for little ones, a book called “We Don’t Eat Our Classmates.”</p> \n<p>Great title.</p> \n<p>It’s about a female dinosaur who starts school and is the only dinosaur in the class.</p> \n<p>Yinon and Alice Sasson, both 36, live in Petah Tikva; flying to Lisbon</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask what you’ll be doing in Lisbon?</p> \n<p>Alice: First of all, we’ll sleep. It’s been a long time since we slept a whole night through.</p> \n<p>Small children?</p> \n<p>Alice: Two sweet children, 3-and-a-half and 9 months, whom we left with Grandpa and Grandma. It’s the first time we’ve left them.</p> \n<p>Are there guilt feelings for leaving behind a baby?</p> \n<p>Alice: None. Because I know that babies have no difficulty. If anything, it’ll be harder for the older one. But we worked on her ahead of the trip.</p> \n<p>What did you say?</p> \n<p>Alice: It was mostly bribery. We promised her Elsa and Anna [dolls] and everything that goes with them. She gave us a shopping list.</p> \n<p>Yinon: With all respect to the children, it’s also important to invest in our relationship. To go out to a restaurant for two hours isn’t exactly to disconnect. Going on vacation once a year – that’s recommended.</p> \n<p>Alice: And plan early so you have something to look forward to.</p> \n<p>Yinon: But four days – more than that makes it hard.</p> \n<p>Alice: Both for the grandparents and for the children.</p> \n<p>Yinon: But the routine is grinding and it’s important to take a breathing space from the regular course of life.</p> \n<p>What’s your usual routine?</p> \n<p>Alice: I get up in the morning.</p> \n<p>Yinon: She’s a morning type, organizes herself and leaves. I’m more of a night type but I also get up at 6:30. At 7, I’m at the door with the kids. A five-minute delay means another 20 minutes in traffic.</p> \n<p>Alice: He drops them off at preschool and I pick them up. I’m always looking for something to do. In big housing projects in Petah Tikva, developers have to build playground, so we diversify. Then Yinon comes home, fixes supper and bathes them.</p> \n<p>Yinon: I don’t want to see them only when they’re in bed.</p> \n<p>Alice: Places of work are more tolerant these days, and even the most pressured dads pick up kids from school at least once a week. Times have changed.</p> \n<p>Thank God. Yinon, how are you as a cook?</p> \n<p>Alice: He makes amazing food. Just this week, our daughter said to me, “Mom, you make okay food, but Dad makes really good food.”</p> \n<p>Yinon: Keep going!</p> \n<p>Alice: He’s also an amazing father. We complement each other and there’s incredible cooperation between us. I manage the house and the tasks, and he…</p> \n<p>Yinon: Is a laborer. (They laugh)</p> \n<p>How did you meet?</p> \n<p>Alice: We were a group of girls in the army. One of the girls had a friend who brought a few guys with him and we went out together. All kinds of couples came out of the group – two other weddings besides ours.</p> \n<p>Yinon: We lived together for a few years and saw that we got along. It’s important to know how the other person gets up in the morning.</p> \n<p>Alice: I had the feeling that this was it. We were at a friend’s wedding and I just realized it and said to him, “We should get married.”</p> \n<p>Yinon: Afterward, we moved to Petah Tikva [lit., “gateway to hope”], a city with no hope [laughs]. But it’s a good place to raise kids.</p> \n<p>Alice: In my job there are lots of couples who have been together from a young age. Maybe it’s a thing with the profession.</p> \n<p>Where do you work?</p> \n<p>Alice: I’m an accountant in a bank, not exactly a “liberal profession.” Conservative people who seek small, calm things, and like big changes less. People who work in a bank aren’t looking to change jobs every year. They want to change on the inside and stay put, and that’s also reflected in the relationships they choose. Stability.</p> \n<p>Advice for a stable, good relationship?</p> \n<p>Yinon: Not to keep things pent up, inside, and if there’s a problem, to talk about it.</p> \n<p>Alice: We also don’t settle accounts with each other: “You did this to me,” “You did that to me.” We are relaxed and forgiving, and don’t bear grudges, otherwise you can’t get along.</p> \n<p>Yinon: It’s true that we’re calm, but you must work to preserve that. The way not to be harried is not to get married.</p> \n<p>Alice: Everything in life is compromises.</p>",

The agency added that the stock of unsold homes fell by 3,000 in that period.</p> \n<p>That is well under Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon’s target of 60,000 a year, much less the 70,000 many experts say Israel needs to meet current demand and to close a growing housing shortfall.</p> \n<p>“The authorities have to solve the serious housing shortage,” said Roee Fadlon, a co-CEO of the commercial and residential developer Fadlon Group. “The minute that happens, builders and buyers will get off the fence and there’ll be another rise in prices.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Only the wealthy can afford an apartment in Tel Aviv — but is that such a terrible thing? | Analysis</p> \n<p>Kahlon has placed bringing down housing costs at the top of his agenda. He has raised taxes on homes bought for investment purposes. His Mahir Lemishtaken (buyers price) program sells state land at a discount to developers who pass on their savings to buyers.</p> \n<p>Last week, the CBS said its housing price index was down 0.2% for September-October versus August-September. That brought the pace of declines in the past year to 1.8%, the first sustained decline in many years.</p> \n<p>But industry sources warn that unless the two-year slump in housing starts is reversed, supply-side pressure will force prices back up.</p> \n<p>Finance Ministry officials said in response to the CBS housing starts data wasn’t final. They said they expect an improvement in the fourth quarter, citing figures on the purchase of building materials such as concrete.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Kahlon claims first win in war against price hikes</p> \n<p>“We believe there hasn’t been a significant change in housing starts from 2017,” said one treasury official, who requested anonymity.</p> \n<p>But builders who spoke to TheMarker were less optimistic.</p> \n<p>Construction inputs aren’t a good indicator of home building because they are used for other types of construction. In any event, the fourth quarter is traditionally a weak one for new construction. More likely, starts will be down 10% in the fourth quarter from the third, they said.</p> \n<p>The biggest drop in starts was in the Haifa district, where they fell 49.5%. In the southern region they were down more than 26% and in the north 23%. Starts in the Jerusalem area fell 8%. Only the central district, where tel Aviv is located, saw a rise — of 5%.</p> \n<p>Builders said the Mahir Lemishtaken program has monopolized the marketing of state-owned land, forcing the many who don’t want to participate in the program to find land in the private market.</p> \n<p>In many case that has meant going into the cities and buying older buildings or empty land. However, building projects like that only are feasibly financially if the land itself is expensive, which effectively limits the practice to the greater Tel Aviv area, they said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In December 2016, Eyal Zak, an executive at a small startup called Cimagine, drove home to Kibbutz Megiddo with some big news. He excitedly told his wife that Cimagine had been bought by the American company Snapchat.</p> \n<p>“My son heard this and started whooping for joy,” says Zak. “He rushed to tell all his friends – ‘My dad works for Snapchat! My dad works for Snapchat!’ He used that app all the time.”</p> \n<p>The Zak family weren’t the only ones taken by surprise by the entry of Snapchat (now called Snap) into Israel. The messaging app, on which messages and pictures are only accessible for a short time, was very popular with the young generation but not perceived as having any great technological vision. Cimagine, a small company from Kfar Yehoshua that had raised just a few million dollars, developed an augmented reality technology that made it possible to “install” virtual furniture or other items in a house.</p> \n<p>The connection between the companies wasn’t totally clear then: Snap did not elaborate on its plans, and the Cimagine acquisition, for an estimated $40 million, was not officially announced. Cimagine became Snap’s Israel research and development center, headed by Zak. Eleven months ago, Snap expanded its presence in Israel with the launch of a commercial section, headed by Assaf Sagy, to work with local advertisers and sell ads.</p> \n<p>Until now, however, Snap has kept its Israeli activity under the radar. Now, for the first time, executives agreed to talk about the challenges they contend with and their search for the next big thing.</p> \n<p>Snapchat has become one of the apps most associated with the young generation. With 186 million daily users, it is far from being an empire on the scale of Google or Facebook, and has just had a particularly hard year, but it still has tremendous influence on media, social networks and digital communication.</p> \n<p>Snap is responsible for a number of ideas and features that were later adopted by the tech giants and are now considered standard: messages with selfie pictures that are deleted after being sent; Stories – a series of pictures and videos that are deleted after 24 hours; Filters and Lenses – illustrations and animations that can be added to selfies, such as a dog’s ears and tongue, or a rainbow arcing out of a person’s mouth).</p> \n<p>In the past two years, Snap has had to sit by and watch Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook shamelessly copy these features in a to ingratiate itself with the young audience.</p> \n<p>Now, Stories, Filters and Lenses can be found on Facebook and all of the apps that it owns – Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. 1.1 billion people now use the Stories feature daily on the various Facebook platforms.</p> \n<p>More precise</p> \n<p>At the beginning of 2016, Snap decided to upgrade the app’s Filters, Lenses and animation experiences and make them more realistic and more precise (for example, the illustrated dog’s ears must show up exactly on the user’s head, and a big tongue should appear when he opens his mouth).</p> \n<p>To make this happen, it needed to acquire computer vision and AR capabilities. Cimagine, founded in 2012 by Yoni Nevo, Nir Daube, Ozi Egri and Amiram Avraham (who did not work in the company), fit the bill.</p> \n<p>“There were companies in the global market that were developing a product similar to ours, but we were always one step ahead of them,” says Zak, who headed up the development of Cimagine’s mathematical engine at the time. “We’d gotten to know Snap through various conferences and get-togethers. Then one day they called and the acquisition process started.”</p> \n<p>He adds: “Snap is a serious company. They checked first to make sure the technology belonged to us and that we really developed it. They made sure we knew what we were talking about that our product really suited their needs.”</p> \n<p>Cimagine CEO Nevo headed up development at the time but recently left his position. Daube and Egri, the engineering and product team, moved to Snap’s Los Angeles headquarters.</p> \n<p>The technology developed by Cimagine eventually became World Lenses, one of Snapchat’s most popular features. Based on AR, it enables you to insert amusing virtual images in the world around you. For example, you could cause a dinosaur to wave its tail in the middle of the room, or insert a dancing hotdog with earphones.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Let’s hope China loses the tech war with America | Opinion</p> \n<p>“Snap puts a big emphasis on experiences and design. We’re not responsible for the experience itself. We’re mainly involved with what happens behind the scenes – the computer vision, the picture processing and the engineering elements of the product,” says Zak.</p> \n<p>Some of things they’re working on at Snap’s Israeli R&amp;D center include the computer vision and picture processing behind Spectacles, Snap’s smart-camera glasses. These are glasses equipped with a camera and linked to a smartphone, making it possible to take pictures and film videos from your point of view and share them on Snapchat.</p> \n<p>The original glasses were launched in 2016 amid huge buzz but ultimately were deemed a commercial flop. The company isn’t giving up: It launched a second generation of the glasses and is reportedly considering a third generation, with two cameras and the ability to create 3D effects.</p> \n<p>Why do you persist with the glasses, despite the early failure?</p> \n<p>Zak: “We’re doing a lot of cool things with Spectacles, both the ones that are around already and the coming version, with expanded capabilities and improvements. We’re working on other physical products that in the pipeline. Snap is a big believer that in the future we won’t keep using smartphones. We believe that, and we’re always looking for the next thing.”</p> \n<p>Snap’s R&amp;D center is located on Moshav Kfar Yehoshua near Yokneam and Kiryat Tivon. “The closest building to us is the cattle shed,” says Zak. “We once thought about moving somewhere else, and Kfar Yehoshua did really sound kind of strange at first. But everyone who’s ever come here has loved it and no one wants to move.”</p> \n<p>Zak isn’t your typical R&amp;D director either: He’s 39, married with six children, originally from Kiryat Ono and now lives on Kibbutz Megiddo. He commutes to work each day on a mountain bike – 40 minutes in each direction. “We have showers here,” he says reassuringly.</p> \n<p>He has a bachelor’s degree in computer science from the Technion, and before Cimagine he worked in image processing at defense company Rafael. He came to the startup through Ozi Egri, one of the company founders, whom he knew from the Technion.</p> \n<p>‘Kids go nuts’</p> \n<p>How do people react when you say you work for Snapchat?</p> \n<p>Zak: “Kids go nuts. I showed my daughter’s teacher the app, which a character that’s dancing on the floor. I told her – this is what you do with math and a degree in electrical engineering. She asked me to give a talk and this is what I did – I showed the students how AR technology works, without getting into the complicated formulas, of course. The idea was to open their minds, to use a product like Snapchat that they’re familiar to let them see that this is what you can do with math, so they see there’s a purpose for what they’re learning in school.”</p> \n<p>Though the Israeli development center is small, Zak says it’s important to Snap: “They trust us and respect us, which is why they want to enlarge the center now and are looking for more people. We’re looking for talented folks with experience in everything from mobile technology to computer vision to deep learning.”</p> \n<p>Snap’s interest in Israel also undoubtedly has something to do with Eitan Pilipski, the Israeli Los Angeles-based Snap vice president in charge of developing the company’s AR platform, who effectively also oversees the R&amp;D center in Israel.</p> \n<p>The company will not say how many workers it has in Israel, but the number is not too large. On the company’s website there are currently five positions advertised, including for a software engineer in the field of machine learning for AR, and software engineers for Android and iOS for the Spectacles product.</p> \n<p>A few weeks ago, Snap held its first client conference in Israel in an upscale venue in Tel Aviv. The company did not stint on expenses. There was a lavish buffet by chef Assaf Granit; the space was filled with posters and banners emblazoned with the Snap logo; a huge gumball machine was placed at the entrance; and guests received a gift back of designer goodies.</p> \n<p>The attendees were mainly reps from startups and online merchandising companies, as well as local content, media and advertising agencies.</p> \n<p>Curious but skeptical</p> \n<p>On the whole, they seemed curious but also skeptical about the possibilities of advertising on Snapchat. Israeli companies that wish to get their ads before young audiences around the world usually do so through Facebook, Google and Instagram – companies with billions of users worldwide. Snap wants to change this.</p> \n<p>At the start of the year, the company launched a commercial division led by Assaf Sagy (formerly with Playbuzz and McKinsey &amp; Company) and based at the Sarona complex in Tel Aviv to get more Israeli labels and organizations to invest in purchasing ads on Snapchat.</p> \n<p>But Snap has also been facing some serious challenges lately. Snapchat was once seen as a bold and sassy challenger to the giants like Facebook. The perception was that it could really dent Facebooks’ dominance, especially with young people.</p> \n<p>However, the company’s future is now in some doubt. Since it went public in March 2017, its stock price has fallen by 80% and the company has also seen a steady decline in its number of active users (In the last quarter, it lost two million). The drop has been blamed on anger over the app’s new design that displeased many longtime users, as well as on the growing competition from Instagram, which is especially popular with young people.</p> \n<p>The departures of a number of top executives over the last months has created an air of instability. Still, Snap can take solace in the fact that its third-quarter revenues for 2018 were up to $298 million, compared to $208 million for the third quarter of the previous year.</p> \n<p>Can Snap really break out today at a time when the tech giants are drawing fire for things like not safeguarding the privacy of users’ information?</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Radhika Kakkar, Snap’s vice president of operations and global online sales, who was at the Tel Aviv conference: “From the very beginning, privacy was a core component for us. In every feature that we build, we think about the users’ information and what is done with it. The Stories and pictures are deleted – which makes privacy issues easier to deal with. This approach has helped us avoid the problems that other companies are having now.”</p> \n<p>Snap is trying to attract new advertisers to the platform, but it hasn’t been easy.</p> \n<p>In its early years, Snap gained a reputation for poor accessibility for new advertisers – It was difficult for new and small advertisers to place advertisements with the company. Its reps used to work personally with big advertisers to create campaigns, but this made it harder to reach a wider group of advertisers.</p> \n<p>Later it launched a self-service platform, similar to that on Facebook and Google, which enables any label to create an ad campaign on the app.</p> \n<p>But the company still struggles to attract advertisers. “It used to be hard to advertise with them,” says one startup executive whose company advertises on Snapchat. “Only recently did it start to improve.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Tel Aviv shares tank as Wall Street continues its path downward</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv shares tumbled Thursday as Wall Street extended its losses from the day before. The benchmark TA-35 index fell 2.1% to end at 1,526.55 points, while the TA-125 lost 2% to 1,380, on turnover of 1.85 billion shekels ($490 million). The drop left the TA-35 down nearly 4.4% since the start of December. U.S. stocks slipped Thursday, continuing their declines from a day earlier. A batch of disappointing earnings reports added to the gloom after the Federal Reserve quashed hopes of a moderation in its interest rate hike trajectory. Among the biggest blue chip losers on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, Teva Pharmaceuticals declined 4.9% to 61.60 shekels, B Communications lost 7.7% to 21.70 and Elbit Systems 3.25% to 454.90. Volume leader Bank Leumi eked out an 0.25% rise to 24.15, but few others shares showed gains for the day. Investors fled corporate bonds for government shekel bonds, especially long-dated issues. (Shelly Appelberg)</p> \n<p>Communications Ministry weighs&nbsp;taking fiber optic network from Bezeq</p> \n<p>The Communications Ministry is weighing a plan that would force Bezeq to hand over its fiber optic network to rivals. The threat marks a sea change since the emergence of Case 4000, which alleges Bezeq won special favors from the ministry while Benjamin Netanyahu was minister. The threat came in a paper issued this week in response to what it calls unreasonable delays by Bezeq in rolling out the network. Israel’s largest telecommunications provider began laying fiber five years ago and today about 60% of Israeli homes are connected. But Bezeq has refused to lay more cable or install the equipment to operate it. It says regulations make it financially unfeasible to offer the service, which significantly increases data transfer speeds. The most likely candidates to get the network are Cellcom Israel and Partner Communications, Israel’s two biggest mobile providers. Bezeq shares ended down 2.1% at 3.69 (98 cents) shekels Thursday. (Nati Tucker)</p> \n<p>Housing &amp; Construction in talks&nbsp;to sell 37.5% stake for $226 million</p> \n<p>Housing &amp; Construction Limited said Thursday it is in talks to sell its 37.5% stake in property company ADO Group for about 850 million shekels ($226 million). The price represents a 15% premium on ADO shares, which closed 1% higher at 74.08 shekels. H&amp;C controls ADO with Apollo Capital and investor Moshe Dayan, who control 22% and 19.7% of shares, respectively. Under the deal, outsider GO Capital would buy 20% of the H&amp;C stock while Apollo took 10% and Dayan 7.5%, enabling them to avoid making a tender offer to buy out minority shareholders. H&amp;C will use the proceeds to either pay down its debt or issue a dividend, which Naty Saidoff, its new owner, needs to repay a loan he took to buy the company this year from Shari Arison. The company will earn a handsome profit on the sale, as the ADO stake is listed on its books at 288 million shekels. Neverthless, H&amp;C shares ended down 3.6% at 6.44 shekels on Thursday.&nbsp;(Shelly Appelberg)&nbsp;</p> \n<p>IDE wins $75 million contract&nbsp;to build Taiwan desalination plant</p> \n<p>IDE Technology, the maker of desalination technology half owned by Delek Group, said it has begun work a $75 million contract to build a reverse osmosis facility for Taiwan’s Formosa Petrochemicals. The facility, which will be built in Yunlin County, will have an annual production capacity of 36 million cubic meters of water and be operated by IDE for the first two years. It will feature the first deployment of technology developed by IDE to reduce boron from seawater, to just 0.01 parts per milliliter, the company said. Reducing boron levels was a key requirement by Formosa Chemicals, which has seen its quota for fresh water reduced by the government. IDE beat out the Singaporean firm Hiflux for the contract, which could lead to Taiwanese government contracts in the future. (Yoram Gabison)</p>",

        "text":["<p>It may be hard to get used to the idea at the moment, but not every U.S. government policy decision is only due to Donald Trump. It’s true of course that the&nbsp;abrupt timing&nbsp;of the American withdrawal from Syria&nbsp;is up to the capricious president, acting against the advice of his national security advisers, but it is totally in line with American policy over the past decade. It’s also in line with the American public’s mood at this time.</p> \n<p>In the last three presidential elections, American voters could have elected candidates who favored global intervention. They had the option to vote for Cold War warrior John McCain in 2008. In 2012, there was Mitt Romney, who warned of the return of an aggressive Russia in one of the presidential debates (only to have Barack Obama respond facetiously that “the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back”). In 2016, there was Hillary Clinton, who&nbsp;proposed a no-fly zone over Syria. </p> \n<p>In each of these elections, the candidate who was against military adventurism won. There are of course no two presidents more unalike than Obama and Trump, but when it comes to international military intervention, their policies are identical. Their motives may be different, but for both, the bottom line is that they’ve been against it.</p> \n<p>Obama preferred diplomacy and disliked talk of “American exceptionalism.” Trump wants to make America great again, but his conclusion is the same as Obama’s — that there be as little direct involvement and as few boots on the ground far from America’s shores as possible.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Syria's Kurds feel trapped between threats from Assad and Turkey</p> \n<p>There is no shortage of moral, geopolitical or historical reasons for the greatest superpower in history to commit itself to keeping world peace, but Trump, for all his manifold faults, does have his finger on the pulse of the deep aversion of the majority of Americans when it comes to continuing to send soldiers to Afghanistan, Iraq, South Korea and now to Syria. Another trait that Trump and Obama have in common is their disdain for the Washington foreign policy establishment — all those experts, diplomats, academics and generals, in the administration, at the Pentagon and at the think tanks, pushing the line in support of American global responsibility, whether the president is a Democrat or a Republican.</p> \n<p>At the critical moment, when Barack Obama decided in 2013 not to respond militarily to the Ghouta chemical attack in which the regime of President Bashar Assad massacred hundreds of Syrian civilians, the U.S. president broke all of the foreign policy establishment’s rules. And Trump, who actually did bomb a Syrian airbase early in his term following another chemical attack, has been kicking away at the establishment since before his inauguration.</p> \n<p>The world's policeman</p> \n<p>Both presidents understood what the establishment finds difficult to acknowledge: that the American people simply no longer wants to be the world’s policeman. That doesn’t mean the administration is not intervening abroad any more. Under Obama and now under Trump, America’s use of drone attacks against terror suspects has increased. But even if these targeted killings may perhaps eliminate individual threats, they don’t influence the situation on the ground.</p> \n<p>There has been some exaggeration in Israel in the reaction to the American announcement of a withdrawal from Syria. The effect of the pullback will be mainly local — on the balance of power among the Kurds, the Turks and the Assad regime. Its more long-term influence on Iran’s expansion in the region is much more difficult to predict for now.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump abandons Syria's Kurds: Will Turkey now crush their dream of a 'secular utopia?'</p> \n<p>The talk of it being a great victory for Russia is also rather ridiculous. President Vladimir Putin has long been the big winner in Russia, and the American base in the northeast of Syria hasn’t changed that, even if Trump had decided to keep it there. From the moment the Russian president chose to take advantage of the vacuum left by Obama and the other Western leaders in Syria and to send Russian forces there in 2015 to prop up the failing regime, he established himself as master of the war-torn country’s fate.</p> \n<p>There has been some criticism in political circles in Israel against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s overreliance on his great ally Trump. This is also greatly overblown. Netanyahu is the last leader who can be accused of not recognizing the weakening of American presence in the Middle East. He has been working hard, for years now, to build up both his personal relations with Putin and the strategic ties between the Israeli army and Russian forces in the region.</p> \n<p>Naturally Israel had a clear interest in American forces remaining in Syria, to balance Russia’s influence and to help block the Iranian threat. But the 2,000 American special forces personnel have not been there to protect Israel, and they were stationed far from its border.They have been there to&nbsp;support the Kurds and to fight ISIS. At no point during his presidency has Trump hidden the fact that he would like to pull American soldiers out of Syria. The fact that they remained there for the last two years is testament to the now-dwindling influence of the Pentagon.</p> \n<p>What Trump has in store</p> \n<p>The greatest concern should not be over the end of the relatively small-scale American presence in Syria, but over what Trump may still do on the international stage. He has a deep, personal animosity towards America’s traditional allies in Europe, the members of NATO. Trump is convinced they are deviously taking advantage of the United States by not investing more in their own militaries, relying on America to protect Europe from Russia.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, Trump unilaterally ended joint military exercises with South Korea, immediately after his summit with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un. Trump continues, despite clear evidence to the contrary, to lie about the North Koreans&nbsp;freezing their missile and nuclear programs. Now he has just as abruptly announced the withdrawal from Syria, with his equally false claim that ISIS has been “defeated.”</p> \n<p>The possibility that Trump will try to seriously sabotage NATO, perhaps even pull the United States out of the alliance, can no longer be easily dismissed. That should be what keeps Western leaders up at night. And Israeli leaders, too.</p>",

In recent days, however, the radar stopped working just as the wet season in the country reached its peak.</p> \n<p>The radar, which is situated in southwest Jerusalem, ran out of service several days ago due to a severe malfunction.</p> \n<p>According to Nir Stav, the manager of the Meteorological Service, the radar is not functioning because of a technical issue with the power supply system. &quot;The problem is that it is 25 years old and it's hard to find the right parts,&quot; Stav explains. &quot;Israel doesn't have a lab that can fix the specific part that's broken, so we have to get it from abroad.&quot;</p> \n<p>Stav says that it will take several months until the service will receive the necessary parts to fix the radar. In order to hasten the process, the service will try to get an expert from abroad to help out or find a suitable lab in Israel. But Stav explains that the laboratories and technology in this field are underdeveloped in Israel.</p> \n<p>Until recently, experts at the Meteorological Service thought the radar could be maintained and that they could hold off the investment necessary for purchasing a new one. But now Stav says it was a wrong assessment.</p> \n<p>The service has started a process of calling for a bid to buy a new radar, but it could take up to a year and a half until it finally arrives in Israel.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, the current radar will function partially, and the service will be using Israel Air Force equipment as backup.</p> \n<p>The radar was manufactured in the United States and purchased 25 years ago, after the Meteorological Service was unable to provide accurate information about a serious storm that hit Israel.</p> \n<p>It is essential for identifying storm clouds, the precipitation levels in rain clouds and unusual phenomena such as strong winds and thunderstorms.</p> \n<p>&quot;The public receives on our website only some of the information that we get,&quot; Stav notes. &quot;People can get information from the Water Authority and the Mekorot company's radar as well, but it, too, has been dysfunctional lately.&quot;</p> \n<p>The aforementioned radar stopped operating due to a strike by employees of Mekorot, Israel's national water company.</p> \n<p>Israel has another radar, which is operated by the Israeli military's air force. The radar is not available to the public, but serves the Meteorological Service.</p> \n<p>Israelis who want to keep up to date about the chances of rain can use the Jordanian rain radar, which provides accurate information about the region and actually includes the Golan Heights in Israeli territory (as opposed to the West Bank and Gaza). &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israeli weatherman Boaz Nehemia says that since the rain radar broke down, the Jordanian website is suffering from an influx of Israeli visitors who threaten to crash it.</p> \n<p>Residents of northern Israel can also use the Turkish radar, which is only relevant to the northernmost part of the Upper Galilee.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel is still holding the body of Hamdan al-Arda, a 59-year-old businessman killed a week ago in the West Bank by Israeli troops who suspected him of committing a vehicle-ramming attack.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Palestinians in touch with Israeli authorities say the army knows that Al-Arda did not intend to run over soldiers in the Al-Bireh industrial zone near Ramallah on December 13. The family and Palestinians&nbsp;officials say they were twice promised that the body would be returned this week, but that has yet to happen.</p> \n<p>Eyewitnesses tell Haaretz that Al-Arda, owner of a nearby aluminum painting factory was startled when a large group of armed troops appeared as he approached a store in his SUV. One person who was standing nearby and who knew Al-Arda says he was probably on his way to the store, which imports aluminum from China.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;As Israel steps up West Bank response, Palestinian Authority takes a blow | Analysis</p> \n<p>Soldiers were in the shop at the time, confiscating security cameras and questioning people. When Al-Arda approached in his car, the soldiers who were either outside the shop or suddenly exited the shop shouted at him, “Stop!,” and aimed their rifles at him. Instead of braking, Al-Arda pressed on the gas. The witness concluded that he was startled and therefore pressed down on the wrong pedal.</p> \n<p>He says he saw one soldier tossed aside by the impact of the car and another soldier who fell from the impact. The witness says four of the soldiers started shooting simultaneously at the driver. He says the car door was locked and the soldiers used an iron bar and a rifle butt to break the driver’s window and open the door from the inside, and that they kept on striking with the bar or the rifle butt or both after the door was opened.</p> \n<p>Another eyewitness, who saw the car approaching from Andalus Street,believes that Al-Arda meant to turn left at the curve in the road and to drive to his aluminum painting factory on an adjacent street. He noticed that Al-Arda was driving slowly. But when he saw the group of soldiers to his right, he kept driving straight into the yard of the store.</p> \n<p>The second witness describes bursts of gunfire coming from several guns at once. He also saw a soldier strike the left window with an iron bar and believes he kept on striking with the bar, inside the car, even after the soldiers opened the door from the inside. Meanwhile, dozens more soldiers arrived. They did not allow the medical team from the Red Crescent ambulance to approach Al-Arda and took his body and placed it an armored military vehicle.</p> \n<p>Before the soldiers confiscated the car and towed it away, a few people managed to film the dead Al-Arda, his bloody head slumped toward the passenger seat with blood pooling on the seat. They also collected some pieces of his skull and teeth that were in the car. Local residents and employees also took pictures of the car in which dozens of bullet marks can be seen on the windows and body of the car.</p> \n<p>Al-Arda, originally from Arabeh village in the Jenin district, owned an aluminum painting factory in the Al-Bireh industrial zone northeast of Ramallah. He and his family have lived in Ramallah since 1955, but they also own buildings and farmland in Arabeh, and that is where the family plans to bury him, says his nephew Nizar.</p> \n<p>He says that the entire extended family – which includes a Ramallah judge – and he himself, who works in a garage, have not been going to work as they are just waiting for the body, to be able to bury it and set up a mourners’ tent. They also don’t know if the body will be returned through a checkpoint in the Ramallah area or the Jalameh checkpoint near Jenin, so some of the relatives are waiting in Arabeh and some have remained in Ramallah. The delay of the burial is causing them more suffering. “Not only did they kill him, now they’re holding him as an administrative detainee,” says the nephew.</p> \n<p>Last Thursday, after an armed Palestinian attacked soldiers and settlers near the Givat Assaf outpost east of Ramallah, a large number of forces were deployed in the Ramallah area as well as in the Al-Bireh industrial zone. But no curfew was imposed and people were not asked to leave the area, one resident says. “The situation was unclear – People were continuing to live and work as usual, but with all the soldiers in our streets wary of everyone and endangering everyone.”</p> \n<p>The soldiers came to the aluminum shop around 3:30 P.M. Nizar says his uncle worked at his factory in the morning, had gone home for the afternoon break and returned to the industrial zone around 4:20.</p> \n<p>The Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet security service did not search the family home or interrogate the family members after the dead driver was identified, in contrast to other cases in which the army suspected a Palestinian was trying to carry out a vehicle-ramming attack.</p> \n<p>This is a strong indication that the IDF does not believe that this driver intended to harm soldiers. The Palestinian civil liaison committee is in contact with the Israeli liaison committee about returning the body but the spokesperson for the Coordinator for Government Activities (in charge of the liaison committees) told Haaretz to contact the IDF spokesperson for a response.</p> \n<p>Attorney Mohammed Abu Sneineh of the Al Quds Human Rights Center contacted the attorney general for Judea and Samaria on Sunday to request that the body be returned, but has not received any answer.</p> \n<p>The IDF spokesperson says: “On December 13, 2018, during an operational action in Al-Bireh, an IDF force spotted a vehicle coming toward it. The vehicle struck a soldier and lightly injured him. The force responded with gunfire. The driver of the vehicle was killed. The circumstances of the incident are being investigated. Regarding the return of the body, no decision has been made yet.”</p> \n<p>The IDF spokesperson did not respond to a question as to whether the intensive gunfire at the vehicle was in accordance with instructions.</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement that American troops are being withdrawn from Syria — assuming that a full withdrawal will be carried out — is of strategic importance to Syria and the entire region. It may have implications for the entire Middle East and the battle for influence between the United States and Russia.</p> \n<p>Trump was irresolute from the start about the continued U.S. military presence in the region. When he spoke of “America First” during his campaign (and exaggerated, with some rewriting of history, his opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003), his intent was also to reduce American military investment in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Washington is an ally, but only to a point &nbsp;■&nbsp;Despite the blow to its national security, Israel will bow to Trump’s Syria withdrawal&nbsp;■&nbsp;How Assad helped create ISIS to win in Syria and got away with the crime of the century</p> \n<p>But three months after Trump’s inauguration, Bashar Assad’s regime put up a challenge when it resumed using chemical weapons against civilians despite American warnings.</p> \n<p>Trump responded with unusual aggressiveness, using cruise missiles, a step his predecessor, Barack Obama, decided against at the last minute under similar circumstances in 2013.</p> \n<p>Afterward, the new president accepted the recommendation of his generals and left the U.S. soldiers in Syria; around two months ago, it was even reported that he had authorized a doubling of the force, to about 4,000 soldiers. But now he has announced that American diplomats will leave Syria within 48 hours and the last soldier will pack out in a hundred days.</p> \n<p>The argument Trump made Wednesday was pretty logical. Obama in the end sent U.S. soldiers to Syria in the summer of 2014 as part of the war he’d declared on the Islamic State. That campaign has more or less ended, in an operational victory for the U.S.-led coalition. The caliphates that Islamic State had declared collapsed, together with its hold on the cities of Mosul, in Iraq and Raqqa, in Syria, after aerial bombardment by the coalition (and ground combat by the Iraqi army in Mosul and particularly Kurdish units in Raqqa).</p> \n<p>While thousands of Islamic State militants remain active, they are not concentrated in a single zone of control and their chain of command has been badly damaged.</p> \n<p>But the line presented by the generals, led by Defense Secretary James Mattis, who abruptly resigned Thursday night, was different. Focusing the American military effort against Islamic State made it easier for the Assad regime to retake control of other parts of Syria and the south.</p> \n<p>After Islamic State was defeated, the United States maintained a presence in Syria in two main areas: the Kurdish region in the northeast and the al-Tanf enclave around a U.S. air base in southern Syria, near the border with Iraq and Jordan. The U.S. presence was seen as blocking the expansion of Iranian influence in Syria.</p> \n<p>Tanf in particular served as a “plug” that made it difficult for the Iranians to exploit the new situation and establish an active land corridor from Iran, through Iraq and Syria, to Lebanon. In recent weeks senior Israeli defense officials have said that leaving the American soldiers there is of prime importance. Now, according to Trump, they are on their way out.</p> \n<p>In recent months Russia has been pressing Iran to reduce arms smuggling to Hezbollah through Syrian territory. But the U.S. hold on Tanf, which it defended aggressively, also aided deterrence.</p> \n<p>The list of countries and parties concerned about the Trump decision is long. It includes, along with Israel, the Kurds, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that Trump informed him of the move in a telephone conversation earlier this week. The prime minister added that Israel will examine its ramifications and act to guarantee national security.</p> \n<p>In the past two years, the prime minister has enjoyed free access to Trump and apparently also has extraordinary influence on him. The administration’s decisions regarding the Middle East — the forgiving attitude toward Saudi Arabia following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the relocation of the embassy to Jerusalem and the jewel in Netanyahu’s crown, the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear agreement with Iran — all seemed to have been taken from Likud’s wish list.</p> \n<p>But Trump’s latest announcement (made on Twitter, characteristically) is deeply disappointing to Jerusalem. Israel was counting on Tanf as a bargaining chip; the Pentagon had promised it that the U.S. soldiers would leave only as part of an agreement under which Iranian forces also withdrew from Syria. Unless it emerge that the U.S. withdrawal is part of a comprehensive agreement with Russia — and for now there’s no indication of this — it will leave Moscow holding the cards in Syria.</p> \n<p>From Israel’s perspective, this has two implications: First, it is more isolated than before in its efforts to remove the Iranians from Syria, since there is still tension with the Russians in the wake of the downing of the plane in September. Second, Trump, despite his declared sympathy for Netanyahu, is taking a step that totally conflicts with the prime minister’s position. It also raises questions about the future, especially at a time when Trump will be preoccupied with the trade war with China and the cordon tightening on him from the special prosecutor’s investigation into Russian influence on the U.S. election results two years ago.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Interior Minister Arye Dery wielded pressure in Acre, to rid the seaside city of a memorial to the Palestinian author and playwright Ghassan Kanafani, a week after the prime minister and interior minister intervened to foil the appointment of the Israeli Arab Raja Zaatry as deputy mayor of Haifa. The memorial was taken down last week.</p> \n<p>Kanafani had been born in Acre but left the city with his family for Lebanon in 1948.</p> \n<p>Like many from the Palestinian intelligentsia at the time, Kanafani turned to politics and in the early 1960s, joined the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, becoming its spokesman. He was killed on July 8, 1972 in Beirut, when his car blew up. Also killed in the same incident was his nephew Lamis Kanafani, 17. The Popular Front accused Israel of carrying out the assassination in response to Palestinian terror attacks, including by the Popular Front.</p> \n<p>In Palestinian circles, Kanafani is well known as a journalist and playwright of international stature. Some of his works have been translated into Hebrew, including the well-known “Return to Haifa,” which was also adapted into a play at the Cameri theater.</p> \n<p>The memorial to Kanafani in Acre, a mixed Jewish-Arab city in northern Israel, had been set up by local activists in a corner of the Muslim cemetery in honor of the man and works. Soon after its establishment, the Interior Ministry contacted the city’s Waqf (Muslim religious trust) committee, which is in charge of the Muslim cemetery, demanding that the memorial be removed immediately. Dery also tweeted the demand, adding that Kanafani had been a member of the terrorist organization, Popular Front, which had carried out the attack on the Lod airport in the 1970s. “There shall be no memorials to terrorists in Israel,” Dery tweeted.</p> \n<p>Following a direct request from the religious affairs bureau of the Interior Ministry, the Waqf trustees committee decided to remove the memorial rather than clash with the ministry over it. The religious affairs bureau sent a clear message that failure to comply could result in punitive measures, including budgetary ones. The committee also said that it had talked with Kanafani’s relatives, some of whom still live in Acre, and they prefer that the memorial be removed rather than get into conflict with the Israeli authorities, leading to gratuitous tensions in the city.</p> \n<p>Samir Salam, a relative of Kanafani’s, confirmed that the memorial had been removed and would be moved to the garden of a relative in the city. The family understands the sensitivity, and doesn’t want to whip up tensions in Acre resulting in bulldozers entering the cemetery to raze the memorial, he said. So they consulted with Kanafani’s close relatives overseas about moving the memorial to a private garden, rather than a public space. The family also preferred that the memorial be in a place where relatives live, rather than in a graveyard, he said.</p> \n<p>The memorial was removed at the beginning of the week without incident, but some activists in the city expressed disappointment over what they called immediate capitulation to the Interior Ministry and the lack of a legal and public struggle.</p> \n<p>Ahmad Odeh, Acre city council member and one of the people behind the memorial’s establishment, told Haaretz that Kanafani is popular as a playwright, and the fact that he was active in “this or that” organization doesn’t make him a terrorist. “There is no Palestinian intellectual uprooted from his home in 1948 who didn’t join one of the Palestinian organizations operating in Lebanon or Jordan, or anywhere else,” Odeh said. “The interior minister’s intervention is crass and we would expect the Waqf committee, and the family too, to fight the decision… a person like Kanafani is a symbol for the entire Palestinian people, not only his kin.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Knesset member Aida Touma Sliman of the Joint List and a resident of Acre herself, complained about Dery to Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit, claiming the minister didn’t have the authority to make any such decision or to set the boundaries of freedom of expression based on his own world view.</p>",

He released the letter after a face-to-face meeting with Trump in which the two men also aired their differences, a senior White House official said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Trump and Obama may be complete opposites — but their Syria policies are nearly identical&nbsp;■&nbsp;Trump abandons Syria's Kurds: Will Turkey now crush their dream of a 'secular utopia?'&nbsp;■ Washington is an ally, but only to a point&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Because you have a right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,&quot; Mattis said in the letter.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>U.S. officials said the resignation had not been forced by Trump.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump announced on Wednesday that U.S. troops in Syria would be withdrawn, a decision that upended American policy in the region.</p> \n<p>U.S. officials on Thursday said the United States will likely end its air campaign against the Islamic State in Syria as well when it pulls out troops.</p> \n<p>Also Thursday, officials said the president was considering defying Mattis again by ordering a substantial U.S. pullout from the 17-year-long conflict in Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to the official, Trump is planning to withdraw more than 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops currently in Afghanistan.</p> \n<p>Mattis, a retired Marine general whose embrace of NATO and America's traditional alliances often put him at odds with Trump, had advised against the Syria withdrawal. One official said it was a contributing factor to his resignation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The news is certain to shock U.S. military allies, already bewildered by what they see as Trump's unpredictable, go-it-alone approach to global security, and raises questions about whether Mattis' successor will be as steadfast about traditional treaty commitments, including to NATO.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When Mattis interviewed with Trump for the job in 2016, he split with the president-elect on a host of issues, including on NATO and the use of torture. Trump ultimately deferred to Mattis, who opposed the latter, signaling that he could be persuaded by his advisers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But as time grew, Trump increasingly acted on his own instincts on a host of national security issues, choosing an &quot;America First&quot; agenda that contradicted Mattis' core beliefs.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Mattis' letter indicated that he disagreed with Trump's isolationist policies, writing that it was his belief the United States needed to maintain strong alliances and show allies respect.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump has withdrawn the United States from several international agreements since taking office in January 2017.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Mattis resignation letter also said that he believed the United States &quot;must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours.&quot; He identified Russia and China as countries that &quot;want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The shifts in significant aspects of U.S. foreign policy and Mattis' addition to the long list of senior Trump administration figures who have quit or been removed added to the sense of an increasingly unpredictable White House as Trump approaches the halfway point of his four-year term.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And if defense policy disagreements were not enough distraction for a president who is under investigation by a special counsel over Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, financial markets took a beating this week and a U.S. government shutdown loomed because of funding disputes over Trump's desire to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This year has been the worst for world stock markets since the 2008 global financial crisis, with MSCI's 47-country world stocks index down 10 percent.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump, announcing Mattis' departure on Twitter, said he would nominate a successor soon.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One possible candidate to replace Mattis as defense chief could be Republican Senator Tom Cotton, long considered a front-runner to eventually take the role.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump's White House has had the highest turnover of senior-level staff of the past five presidents, according to the Brookings Institution think tank.</p> \n<p>Some departed unceremoniously, such as Trump's first Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whom Trump fired via Twitter in March.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Speculation that Mattis might not last long in his post grew in October when Republican Trump said in a CBS interview that the general was &quot;sort of a Democrat&quot; and might be leaving. Mattis responded at the time by telling reporters that he had Trump's full support.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser, said Trump was entitled to a Pentagon chief with whom he could agree.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;This is an opportunity for the whole country to get a new secretary of defense who will be aligned with the president on these critical issues, whether you're talking about in Syria, whether you're talking about across the Middle East in general,&quot; Miller told CNN.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Mattis had argued for maintaining a strong U.S. military presence in Afghanistan to bolster diplomatic peace efforts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said thousands of the 14,000 troops in Afghanistan could be sent home.&nbsp;</p>",

Ezra, a 60-year-old who had served all but 10 days of a one-year sentence for using drugs, got into a fight with an 80-year-old man convicted of sex crimes while waiting at the bus stop.</p> \n<p>“It’s a disgrace that someone like him should get out early,” Ezra said. “I told him so to his face. I wouldn’t have minded sitting there for another few months just so that sex offenders wouldn’t be released early. They’re worse than Hamas terrorists.

        "text":["<p>The document reproduced here is important for three reasons. First, because of its content; second, because it's been classified; and third, because of the connection between the first reason and the second reason, which offers a lesson about the reciprocal relations between releasing historical documentation from archives and the recognition of history.</p> \n<p>The document is a “secret” letter dated December 4, 1949, half a year after the official conclusion of the War of Independence (following the signing of the armistice agreement with Syria). Its author was Walter Eytan, the first director general of Israel’s Foreign Ministry, and its addressee was Moshe Sharett, the foreign minister, who was in New York at the time.</p> \n<p>Eytan is reporting to his boss on a plan “to expel the Arab residents of a large number of places” in Galilee and elsewhere in the north of the country. He lists the villages: Fasuta, Tarshiha, Jish (where most of the uprooted inhabitants of the village of Biram had gone the year before), Hurfeish, Rihana, Majdal and Zakariya. Eytan noted that the plan called for the expulsion of more than 10,000 Arabs, most of them Christians, though some were Druze (Hurfeish) or Circassians (Rihana). The expulsion was to be carried out for “security reasons.” The deportees’ destination was not specified.</p> \n<p>Eytan writes that David Ben-Gurion, the prime minister, had already approved the transfer of the residents “by force to other places,” but wanted the agreement of Sharett and Eliezer Kaplan, the finance minister, because the cost of the operation would be about a million Israeli pounds (including the resettlement of the uprooted).</p> \n<p>Eytan had been briefed on the plan’s details from Zalman Lief, an expert on borders and land, who advised Ben-Gurion on these subjects. Lief noted that the scheme could be implemented “without unnecessary brutality.” Eytan emphasized to Sharett that the foreign minister’s agreement was needed for approval of the plan and added his opinion. “I expressed a sharply negative response for political reasons,” he wrote Sharett. “I thought it was right for you to know about the plan now, even if its fate will not be decided immediately.” During this period, Sharett was often deliberately left in the dark by Ben-Gurion and his colleagues.</p> \n<p>The expulsion, of course, was not carried out, but in the years that followed a number of attempts were made to transfer tens of thousands of Christian Arabs from Galilee out of the country to Argentina and Brazil (the idea was described as a transfer by agreement, with or without the quotation marks). One of the plans was called “Operation Yohanan” (after Yohanan from Gush Halav – John of Giscala – a leader of the Jewish revolt against the Romans, in the first century C.E.), which the Israeli leadership considered briefly in 1952-1953, until it was shelved for lack of feasibility. As we know, the town of Gush Halav (Jish, in Arabic) is still intact. In the years after the war, there was a sharp dispute within the leadership concerning the “emigration” of Arabs from the country. Moshe Dayan, for example, thought that “the country should be homogeneous” and supported the removal of the Arabs by force.</p> \n<p>We don’t know why the plan described in the letter wasn’t implemented, though it was probably due mainly to the “political reasons” Eytan mentioned in his letter. After all, the proposal entailed the expulsion of inhabitants many months after the end of the fighting. By the way, within a few years, both the Druze (1956) and the Circassians (1958) would be integrated into the Israel Defense Forces as regular conscripts. (In practice, many of them had volunteered for IDF service already during and after the 1948 war.)</p> \n<p>The fact that Ben-Gurion insisted on Sharett’s agreement for implementing the plan reveals something of the relations between the two leaders. The political disagreement between the two top figures in Mapai, the ruling party and forerunner of Labor, went a long way toward determining the future of the two peoples that share the land and the dynamics between Israel and the Arab world.</p> \n<p>Whereas Sharett urged that all the Arabs who remained in Israel be officially recognized and granted citizenship, with equal rights, Ben-Gurion was opposed to the idea and urged that the Arabs be viewed as a potential fifth column; anyone who thought otherwise was simply naive, he said. This is why, among other reasons, he opposed revoking control of the military government over the Arab population in 1966, during the period of the Levi Eshkol government. He considered its existence a necessity, contrary to the opinion of Sharett and other senior figures. Sharett probably shared Eytan’s objection to the expulsion plan.</p> \n<p>Eytan’s letter was until recently held in a file in the Israel State Archives titled “Minorities – Matters of Organization, Religion, Policy toward Minorities” (File No. 2402/29). For more than 25 years, up until about six months ago, the file had been open for public perusal. The staff of the archives would even send a scan of it via email to anyone who so requested. (In the present case, it was sent to the Akevot Institute for Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Research, whose agenda also includes removing obstacles the state places in the way of researchers who want to uncover historical documentation). But now the letter (together with an eight-page letter written by Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit, Israel’s first and last minister of minorities) has been removed from the file and is no longer accessible.</p> \n<p>Contrary to its obligations, the archives does not explain in the file why documents have been removed from it and makes do instead with leaving a blank page on which is written only the word “classified.” Sheetrit’s censored letter mentions the Riftin report, which was the subject of an article by Ofer Aderet in Haaretz earlier this year (“Why is Israel still covering up extrajudicial executions committed by a Jewish militia in ‘48?”). Sheetrit’s letter, headed “Minorities in the State of Israel,” signals its theme. The writer warns, among other points, about “theft and plunder [of Arab property] both by the army and by civilians […] violation of surrender agreements about preserving property [and adds that] the lust for robbery has turned the heads of army personnel.”</p> \n<p>Why were two documents suddenly censored after having been available to the public for years? Answers are not forthcoming. A few months ago, I wrote in these pages (“What is Israel hiding about its nuclear program in the ’50s?”) that in a great many cases, the state’s representatives who are in charge of releasing historical documentation (in this case, the chief press and media censor) do not distinguish between documents that may adversely affect state security and foreign policy, and those that may simply embarrass the state.</p> \n<p>The fact that, half a year after the end of the 1948 war, Ben-Gurion considered expelling thousands of Arabs from their homes is not very flattering (the more so because they were Christian Arabs, whose welfare would probably carry more weight in world public opinion). However, whereas the study of history is amenable (to a certain degree) to an individual’s choice, the uncovering of historical documentation should not be amenable to political considerations, must not become a privilege in a democracy and must never be susceptible to considerations that are not directly related to security.</p>",

The soul is roused and angered, but even at such a time we must admit the truth to ourselves: Shooting at an occupying army is a legitimate action according to any law. And unfortunately, in Ofra and its sister settlements, in Hebron and its environs and in all the territories occupied in the 1967 war, we are an occupying nation and army.</p> \n<p>Yes, in Judea, Samaria and Gaza we’re an occupying and oppressing nation, by means of the Israel Defense Forces, the Shin Bet security service and the settlers, who are the civilian arm of the occupation, oppressing the people living there, the Palestinians. These areas do not belong to us and not one person in the entire world (not even our savior Trump) recognizes our rights or ownership over these lands. We are a nation, an army, a security service and settlers who are occupiers there.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; I feel no sympathy for the settlers | Gideon Levy</p> \n<p>It’s not clods of earth promised by God that are under occupation there, but human beings, Palestinians who live there. And their right, as is the right of any people around the world who are living under an occupation, is to rebel against the occupier and to try to remove him from their land. Thus, shooting at soldiers of an occupying army, in this case an Israeli one, is a totally legitimate action, by any moral or legal standard.</p> \n<p>It’s not only traitorous leftists who say so, it’s also Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself, in his book “Fighting Terrorism.” He writes there that terrorists tend to call themselves guerilla fighters, and the media repeat this without giving it a second thought. But guerilla fighters are not terrorists, he writes. They are irregular soldiers fighting regular armies, not civilians. In fact, he says, guerilla fighters are the precise opposite of terrorists. In contrast to guerillas who seek battle with military forces, which are usually far stronger than they are, terrorists opt for attacking weak and defenseless civilians, including women, children and the elderly – anyone except soldiers. Terrorists try to avoid confrontations with soldiers, he writes.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Gideon Levy’s views on dead settlers are incomprehensible, inexcusable and unforgivable | Opinion</p> \n<p>In other words, according to Netanyahu, Hamas and other Palestinian “terror” organizations are actually not terrorists but guerilla fighters, to all intents and purposes, since they fight regular army forces which are much stronger than they are, whereas terrorists, according to Netanyahu, choose to attack defenseless civilians, anyone but soldiers.</p> \n<p>So who do Hamas “terrorist” civilians attack every week at the Gaza border if not army forces that are much stronger? Who did the “terrorists” shoot at last week at the Givat Assaf junction if not at soldiers who are “much stronger than they are”?</p> \n<p>The oft-recited mantra we all recite says that the Palestinians deliberately shoot children. That’s a nonsensical lie. Not because they’re better or worse than we are. It’s because the Palestinians have no way of specifically targeting children. They can’t target anything. Usually, when they do hit children, it’s happenstance, just like they sometimes hit Palestinians by chance.</p> \n<p>The opposite is actually true. It’s we who have the whole range of weaponry, the most precise ones in the world, and we kill many more civilians, including children, than they do.</p> \n<p>So, who are the terrorists and who the guerillas? According to the definition spelled out by Netanyahu, your answers, it turns out, are wrong.</p>",

Birnbaum made the announcement during a dialogue with Pepsico CEO Ramon Laguarta.</p> \n<p>SodaStream has had a tangled history vis-a-vis the Palestinians. Until three years ago, its main plant was in the West Bank industrial zone of Mishor Adumim.</p> \n<p>As one of Israel’s few high-profile companies selling to consumers, the West Bank plant made it a target of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement.

        "text":["<p>It’s a familiar phenomenon – one that I’ve written about in the past: The spirit of the law forces itself on the courthouse in which it resides and shapes it according to its twisted, deceptive image. Recently, I made several visits to the military court on the Ofer army base northwest of Jerusalem, and it struck me that it deserves to be studied according to the scientific method of “discourse and space.”</p> \n<p>Here’s how you enter the military court at Ofer, if you’re coming from the direction of Tel Aviv: On Highway 443, a little past the checkpoint that announces that you’ve passed from the area of occupied territory into Greater Jerusalem, you turn left, follow the arrow that directs you to a huge parking lot and enter through the gate that faces Israel. The occupied enter by the gate that faces the areas of the occupation; the occupiers, residents of Israel, enter through the gate that faces good old Israel. They encounter each other midway, in the Ofer military court, which is part of a large compound adjacent to the Ofer military prison. These Ofers are named for Israel Defense Forces Lt. Col. Zvi Ofer, who was awarded the Medal of Valor for the raid on Nuqeib in 1962 (an Israeli army reprisal operation in Syria). What’s the connection, you will ask, between him and the court? And what’s the connection between justice and military justice? You’ll be answered by a Palestinian lawyer, his neck wrapped in a warm scarf to protect him against the bone-chilling cold.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; A Palestinian child is guilty by default | Opinion</p> \n<p>After you pass through the gate you find yourself facing a large window, which serves as one of the allegories that the Ofer military court constitutes. The window has one-way glass: sealed and dark from one side, transparent from the other. Inhabitants of the occupied territories also stand before a dark window – not seeing but seen by policemen and Israel Prison Service guards.</p> \n<p>I’m standing opposite the shaded window and from the other side I hear a friendly voice, a veteran IPS official who remembers me from years past. The voice says, “Attorney Feldman, it’s been a long time since you visited us.” He activates the electric buzzer, I push the gate open and I enter the military court compound. To get to the individual courtrooms, which are housed in seven mobile trailers, I enter a narrow corridor enclosed by an iron fence. The corridor is like a labyrinth into which researchers release laboratory mice – where, if they succeed in finding the right way, the mice are rewarded with a slice of cheese, but if they fail and choose a turn that leads to a dead end, an electric shock awaits that’s strong enough to spur them to learn the twists and turns properly. This, too, is an allegory for the trials that take place in the military courts in the occupied territories: They’re all constructed like a kind of nasty labyrinth, whose mysteries are extremely difficult to penetrate and where one’s wanderings most times ends with an electric shock – only rarely will a bite of cheese await a particularly agile inhabitant of the territories.</p> \n<p>Here’s an allegory concerning my recent visit to the Ofer court. The occupied territories are ruled by orders issued by the military commander. The orders are issued daily, on a wide range of subjects and include instructions involving movement, roadblocks and bans on locals from using roads marked in purple on the map and on wearing masks – and possibly also on wearing a wig. These directives are aimed exclusively at the original residents of the territories, the Palestinians, and not at the others who recently arrived and settled among the occupied, whose center of judicial life is in the land of the occupiers.</p> \n<p>The orders of the military commander are the law in the territories, and ignorance of the law does not liberate you from responsibility from observing it. According to a basic rule that even the military court can’t evade, however, the law must be published. Accordingly, the clever jurists in the military prosecution set up a hard-to-find website called Kamtzam (a Hebrew acronym for “Compilation of Proclamations, Orders and Appointments”), where the orders of the military commander are published. The military court has long since ruled that publication in Kamtzam is sufficient to constitute presumption of knowledge of the law. However, the site is entirely in Hebrew and is immune to a search based on using keywords. The prospect that locals will be able to learn via the site whether the military commander has by chance declared that those who employ them are considered to be part of a terrorist organization, is nonexistent.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; After shooting a Palestinian teen, Israeli troops dragged him around – and chased an ambulance away</p> \n<p>Which is exactly what brought me to Ofer military court earlier this month. Two people were working for an organization that we’ll call “Mother Teresa’s Disciples,” which distributes food and medicines to the needy, and which is known by all and sundry as “Mother.” Three years ago, the military authorities decided to declare Mother a terrorist organization. The declaration was apparently misfiled by Corp. Carmela in the filed intended for papers connected to the “Discharge Party for Maj. Uzi.” After half a year, the industrious Sgt. Olga, Carmela’s successor, found the statement. She showed it to commanding officer Gadi, Uzi’s successor. Gadi, without lifting his eyes from Kierkegaard’s “Fear and Trembling,” which he was reading, said: “Send it for posting on Kamtzam.” “And that’s it?” Sgt. Olga asked. Maj. Gadi didn’t respond – he’d reached the harrowing passage about the Sacrifice of Isaac – and he didn’t say to PFC Yosef, “Take the jeep, Yossi, and drive five minutes to the offices of Mother and stick the declaration that they’re a terrorist organization on their window, and on the way back get me a pita with shawarma, hold the onions.”</p> \n<p>So it was that two months ago, about two-and-a-half years after the Mother was declared a terrorist organization, soldiers showed up in the dead of night and arrested two of the organization’s 15 employees, an accountant and a clerk. After they’d been in custody for a month they were charged with the serious offense of providing services to a terrorist organization and a few other offenses. In order to appear at the hearing where the prosecution requested that they continue to be remanded, until the conclusion of the proceedings against them, I walked the labyrinthine path last week asking myself what awaits me at the end – an electric shock or cheese?</p>",

There’s no delicate way of warning the Jews in the world from the dangers the government is exposing them to, except perhaps to scream at the government: Have you lost your mind?</p> \n<p>A children’s speech pathologist in Texas was fired because she refused to sign a contract that required her to pledge that she does not and will not boycott Israel or support boycotting products from West Bank settlements. This is no conspiracy theory from a new edition of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, or a new anti-Semitic cartoon posted by Yair Netanyahu. This really happened and was first reported on The Intercept site.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>American citizen Bahia Amawi had been employed for nine years as a speech pathologist in Austin, Texas, where she worked with children ages 3-11 with special needs – autistic children and students with language difficulties. In each of the nine years she signed an employment contract, until this year, when a new, irregular clause appeared in the contract requiring her to pledge that she “does not currently boycott Israel” and “will not boycott Israel during the term of the contract.”</p> \n<p>This is not an independent political whim of an evangelical employer captivated by the charm of Judea and Samaria’s rocky hills. This is a diplomatic “achievement” of Netanyahu’s government. The clause forbidding support for boycotting Israel appeared in the contract following a law signed last year by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, forbidding public employees in Texas to support a boycott on Israel.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s Israel gives a broad – positively virtuoso – interpretation to the command “if someone comes to kill you, kill him first.” From now on if someone comes to work with autistic 3-year-olds in Texas, fire him first. Similar laws exist in 26 U.S. states.</p> \n<p>Israel’s government has volunteered to provide free public relations to the boycott movement. It is making diplomatic efforts to ensure there will be no speech pathologist, road builder, fire fighter, policeman or public school teacher anywhere in the world who can’t be reached by Israel’s long legal arm, who won’t know of the Israeli occupation. Israel also insists on marking itself as a pariah state and seems to aspire to appearing in every contract between any two parties in the world, like a disturbed child who needs special consideration.</p> \n<p>We must exercise a basic capacity for empathy, on the very level of survival, and put ourselves for one moment in the other’s place, to understand the extent of damage caused by such a combative, destructive legal action. Imagine Michal Michaeli, a social worker in the Be’er Sheva municipality’s social affairs department, who is required to sign, as a condition for her continued employment, that in her free time she won’t support violations of the international sanctions against Russia due to the Crimea annexation, for example. If there was any chance that a speech pathologist from Texas would object to the settlement boycott, or at the most ignore it, this clause made sure it no longer exists. How can you not support the boycott on Israel and, heaven forbid, do worse than that, after being fired from work because you refused to accept political hush money?</p> \n<p>The speech pathologist filed suit against the law and on Wednesday the American Civil Liberties Union announced it has filed similar lawsuits on behalf of four other Texas citizens. “The state cannot use the contracting process as an ideological litmus test or to tell people what kind of causes they may or may not support,” the ACLU said in its statement.</p> \n<p>We can rely on the Americans to find a way to remove this stain from their law books. Already last year a federal court in Kansas ruled that a similar law was unconstitutional and a federal court in Arizona blocked such a law. But who will make sure to remove the Netanyahu government’s fingerprints?</p>",

        "text":["<p>As the war in Syria unfolded and President Bashar Assad pulled his troops out of the Kurdish northeast to quell uprisings in the country’s western population centers, Syria’s Kurds – with U.S. support – took it upon themselves to defeat the Islamic State on their territory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As the Kurds pushed ISIS back in brutal battles in first Kobani and later Raqqa, Rojava – or “The land where the sun sets” – began to take shape.</p> \n<p>The autonomous state was declared in 2014. While it was never officially recognized by Assad, the United Nations or NATO, it had the de facto support of the United States since its inception, as the Americans provided Kurdish fighters with air cover and weapons in their fight against ISIS. But now, with President Donald Trump ordering the full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s looming threats to attack, the days of Kurdish autonomy in Syria appear to be numbered.</p> \n<p>In 2016, Rojava morphed into the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria (DFNS) as the Kurds incorporated other ethnic groups into their governing bodies and militias – forming the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The federation was heralded as a fledgling democracy forged out of the horrors of civil war and a “secular utopia” in totalitarian, ISIS-ravaged Syria.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Trump's pullout leaves Russia holding the cards in Syria, to Israel's bitter disappointment&nbsp;■&nbsp;Despite the blow to its national security, Israel will bow to Trump’s Syria withdrawal&nbsp;■&nbsp;How Assad helped create ISIS to win in Syria and got away with the crime of the century</p> \n<p>Rojava and later the DFNS governed its some 2 million people with an ideology antithetical to ISIS: Promoting minority rights, religious tolerance, gender equality and governing by direct democracy. Kurdish women fight in the Women’s Protection Units (YPJ) and even famously held a rally in Raqqa – the former de facto capital of ISIS – to denounce violence against women after they helped defeat the terror group.</p> \n<p>The philosophy underpinning the state came from leftist revolutionary Abdullah &Ouml;calan, one of the founding members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) but currently in prison in Turkey. &nbsp;Turkey and the United States both designate the PKK a foreign terrorist organization.</p> \n<p>Syrian Kurdish parties said last Friday that Turkish threats to attack their region amounted to a &quot;declaration of war,&quot; and asked world powers to prevent an assault. Erdogan has vowed to clear Syria of all terrorists east of the Euphrates River. The Turkish president sees the Kurdish militia in Syria, the People's Protection Units (YPG), as a “terrorist offshoot” of the PKK – which has been conducting a deadly insurgency against Turkey since 1984.</p> \n<p>&quot;All the forces in north and east Syria … are asked to agree on strategies to confront this aggression,&quot; read a statement signed by Syria's main Kurdish parties and other allied groups.</p> \n<p>There are contradictory statements about the U.S.’ stance regarding the Turkish offensive. Speaking at a political rally on Monday, Erdogan said: “We talked with Mr. Trump. He gave a positive answer. We are going to sweep Syrian lands until the last terrorist is eliminated.”</p> \n<p>However, a day later, when asked by Kurdistan24 whether Erdogan’s claim about Trump’s approval for the attack on northeastern Syria was a “misstatement,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Robert Palladino responded with a direct “Yes.”</p> \n<p>‘Never U.S. soldiers’</p> \n<p>About 30 million Kurds live in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, with the Council on Foreign Relations noting that “many who remain in their ancestral lands maintain a strong sense of a distinctly Kurdish identity.” Kurds are one of the world’s largest ethnic groups without a sovereign state.</p> \n<p>Erdogan aims to keep it that way. In June 2015 he said: ‘‘We will never allow the establishment of a state in Syria’s north and our south. We will continue to fight in this regard no matter what it costs.’’</p> \n<p>As Erdogan ramped up his threats to attack, a spokesman for a Turkish-backed rebel force called the National Army, Maj. Youssef Hamoud, told Reuters last week, “The battle will be launched simultaneously from several fronts. It will be in Manbij and Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn,” he said, referring to towns about 200 kilometers (125 miles) apart near Syria’s northern border.</p> \n<p>Speaking on Wednesday, Erdogan said Turkey’s target “is never U.S. soldiers,” highlighting both the importance of the U.S. presence in the region for the Kurds and Erdogan’s growing frustration with his NATO ally.</p> \n<p>Up to 15,000 Syrian rebels, including from the Free Syrian Army (FSA), are ready to join a Turkish military offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeast Syria. On Thursday, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar was quoted as saying, they YPG “can dig tunnels or ditches if they want, they can go underground if they want. When the time and place comes, they will be buried in the ditches they dug. No one should doubt this.”</p> \n<p>The operation will be Turkey’s third cross-border operation into Syria since 2016, following the successful Operation Euphrates Shield and Operation Olive Branch, in which Turkey recaptured Afrin (a Kurdish enclave in the northwest of Syria that was part of Rojava).</p> \n<p>In June 2018, a report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) detailed large-scale human rights abuses in areas under Turkish control such as Afrin, which was taken from the YPG in March.</p> \n<p>The report said, “Civilians now living in areas under the control of Turkish forces and affiliated armed groups continue to face hardships, which in some instances may amount to violations of international humanitarian law and violations or abuses of international human rights law.”</p> \n<p>However, the YPG has been dogged by allegations of human rights abuses in areas under its control. In June 2014, Human Rights Watch reported “arbitrary arrests, due process violations, and failed to address unsolved killings and disappearances” in the three Syrian enclaves administered by the Kurds.  HRW noted that the Kurds are running a local administration with courts, prisons and police, and “Kurdish-run areas of Syria are quieter than war-torn parts of the country, but serious abuses are still taking place.”</p> \n<p>Trump’s surprise</p> \n<p>While both Erdogan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received advance notice of Trump’s order to withdrawal the 2,000 or so American troops from Syria, the Pentagon, State Department and U.S. Congress appeared to be caught mostly off guard.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“I have no idea what’s going on,” GOP Sen. Bob Corker, the outgoing Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair, said after the withdrawal announcement. “I did not know and I think I should have been [notified],” said GOP Sen. Jim Inhofe, the Senate Armed Services Committee chief. “I believe that they should have notified probably all of Congress but certainly our committee.”  The withdrawal was also met with immediate criticism from the president’s allies within his own party. Sen. Lindsey Graham called the withdrawal a “huge Obama-like mistake” and said “ISIS is not defeated” in Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan – as Trump claimed in a tweet after news of the withdrawal broke. Graham concluded, “An American withdrawal at this time would be a big win for ISIS, Iran, Bashar al Assad of Syria, and Russia.”</p> \n<p>GOP Sen. Marco Rubio even retweeted the Russian Embassy praising the withdrawal with the comment, “I found someone who is supportive of the decision to retreat from #Syria.”</p> \n<p>The United States had committed in September to keep troops in Syria indefinitely, to bolster Kurdish forces in an effort to keep Iranian influence out of the area – a commitment that infuriated Turkey and left the Americans effectively in control of a little less than a third of Syria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Mr. Kurd</p> \n<p>Also in September, during a press conference at the UN, Kurdish journalist Rahim Rashidi made headlines around the world when Trump referred to him as “Mr. Kurd.” Rashidi asked Trump what a future relationship with the Kurds would look like in a “post-ISIS” world.</p> \n<p>“We’re trying to get along very well,” Trump responded. “We do get along great with the Kurds. We’re trying to help them a lot. Don’t forget, that’s their territory. We have to help them. I want to help them. They fought with us. They died with us. They died. We lost tens of thousands of Kurds, died fighting ISIS. They died for us and with us. And for themselves. They died for themselves. They’re great people. And we have not forgotten. We don’t forget.”</p> \n<p>“Mr. Kurd” was trending on Twitter after the exchange, and while many Western journalists mocked Trump and viewed the label as crude, it became a sensation among Middle Eastern Kurds – who see their identity as rarely recognized on the world stage.</p> \n<p>“I loved it – because all the time, our identity is ignored by the Turkish government, by the Iranian government,” Rashidi told The Washington Post. “We are proud of our struggle for democracy, for justice, for freedom. He made me so happy when he called me Mr. Kurd. It was a moment of respect for us, for me.”</p> \n<p>After Trump’s plan to withdrawal was announced on Wednesday, many critics immediately saw the move as a betrayal of the Syrian Kurds who fought side-by-side with U.S. soldiers to end the atrocities of ISIS – Trump’s number one priority in Syria.</p> \n<p>Without U.S. soldiers as a buffer, the Kurds are now left to fend for themselves against the second-largest military in NATO, one that has vowed to destroy them before handing their territory back over to the Assad regime that for decades stripped them of autonomy and identity.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Vika was born in Ukraine to parents who were teachers. She describes her mother as distant and her childhood as difficult. She married a Jewish man, with whom she came to Israel to live at age 24, together with their 4-year-old daughter. In Israel their daughter was diagnosed with a serious illness, and they also learned that the girl was not eligible for citizenship. Treatment of their daughter’s illness was very expensive, Vika says, and her relationship with her husband gradually deteriorated.</p> \n<p>“I started looking for work, and I didn’t find anything. We rented an apartment and we were under financial pressure. I was helpless. One day I saw an ad in a Russian-language newspaper: ‘Looking for serious girls for a good income.’ Nothing about prostitution was mentioned. I thought that it was a regular ad. I came to a meeting with my husband and daughter, I was so clueless. The pimp took me aside and spoke to me vaguely – and he took me to a brothel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;New Israeli bill fining prostitution clients may change thousands of women's lives | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“He said to me: ‘This is the work.’ I refused. I went back to my husband and didn’t dare tell him what they had offered me. I told him it hadn’t worked out, it wasn’t suitable. I kept on looking for work. Our financial situation got worse. Our relationship went downhill. I separated from my husband and I was on the brink of starvation. My daughter was hungry. One day I told myself: ‘OK, I’ll give in to men so I can take care of my daughter.’ Every day I struggled with myself and I persuaded myself to give in to men – to sell my soul for money to take care of my daughter.”</p> \n<p>Vika, now 51, is one of 10 women in the cycle of prostitution whose poetry makes up a unique exhibition currently on display at Tel Aviv University’s Sourasky Library for humanities and the arts.</p> \n<p>“I started writing for the first time about three years ago when I was in a rehabilitation program for prostitutes run by the Social Services Ministry and the Haifa municipality. The poetry broke out while I was coming off of drugs and prostitution, when I had to clear a lot of thoughts, to express myself, to break free. I’ve written a lot of poems since then, all in Russian.”</p> \n<p>I Was Born of Tall Grass</p> \n<p>By Vika</p> \n<p>“I was born of tall grass</p> \n<p>Flowers named me</p> \n<p>Winds spun me a coronet</p> \n<p>And morning, it was so splendid</p> \n<p>And I sang sang sang</p> \n<p>I thought I was born to joy</p> \n<p>I was born, I thought to joy</p> \n<p>*</p> \n<p>They buried me in the tall grass</p> \n<p>Only a cold wind wept</p> \n<p>Only wind wept”</p> \n<p>(Translated from Hebrew by Vivian Eden)</p> \n<p>The exhibition, open until the end of the month, was the initiative of Idit Rosen, a senior librarian at the library and a doctoral student in semiotics and culture at TAU, and Miriam Gvaram, a student of gender and African studies at the university, as well as an anti-prostitution activist. “The exhibition is meant to present the voice of the women themselves and without mediation, in the most dignified way, and not to present one specific narrative in their lives,” Gvaram says. “Society must understand that women in prostitution are also human beings and they have their own view of this world, words of their own to conceptualize prostitution and that their range of emotions and experiences is rich, and it’s worth reading how this world is reflected through their eyes.”</p> \n<p>After Dr. Naama Scheftelowitz, director of the Sourasky Library, approved the idea of the exhibition, Gvaram started looking for and collecting poetry from women who had worked in prostitution. She posted a call on a Facebook page that helps women move out of the field, and she was also given poems that had been collected in the past by attorney Michal Leibel when she headed the non-profit Task Force on Human Trafficking and Prostitution.</p> \n<p>So far Gvaram has collected 25 poems from 10 poets. Idit Rosen says that she was “amazed at their ability to write and their talent. I looked at this with the eyes of a human being and not a researcher. I was full of appreciation at the courage, the ability to transmit a very complex experience through words. It left me speechless.</p> \n<p>‘I cried out loud but no one paid attention’</p> \n<p>Vika’s first place of employment as a prostitute was at 49 Ben Yehuda Street in Tel Aviv. “It was called a health club. I went in and sat with the prostitutes, but I couldn’t go in with a client to a room. I went one day, two days, a week, but I didn’t have the courage to go through with it. Until they decided that I’d go together with a prostitute and a client, and I would see what she does. She was like my ‘instructor.’ She spoke to me in Russian, that the client couldn’t understand, and she told me what I was doing right and what I was doing wrong. That’s the way they broke the barrier for me.”</p> \n<p>Vika worked as a prostitute for many years, during which she quickly began using hard drugs. Her addiction led her to move to the area of the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station. “No pimp in an exclusive place wants an addict who misses her shifts, or who shows up high,” she says. “That’s how the decline starts and you end up on the street.”</p> \n<p>Remembering her time at the bus station, where she was trapped for years, brings her to tears, even now. “You’re in a never-ending cycle – getting into a car, getting out with money, running to the drug dealer. That’s the way it is, 24 hours a day. No break. Client, drug, dealer, client, drug, dealer. And all with insufferable hallucinations from the drugs: Someone who hasn’t experienced this personally can’t understand what hallucinations you have when you’re on hard drugs from the Central Bus Station. I got to where I had one foot in the grave. I lost consciousness from an overdose, and was brought in an ambulance to the hospital.</p> \n<p>“Only God saved me from this thing,” she says, weeping. “I didn’t believe I’d get out of it. The truth is, I didn’t want to live. I did everything I could to die. But one day I heard an inner voice – ‘Get up and go.’ I head these words in a tone of love and strength and so I got up and got to the program, and started my rehabilitation, which has been successful so far.”</p> \n<p>As for the prostitution industry in Israel, Vika says: “The country is full of brothels today. People don’t have any idea how extensive the industry is. The police and the state have no control over its expansion. Pimps lure in and hire girls 16 or 17 years old.”</p> \n<p>Here</p> \n<p>By Vika</p> \n<p>“Here I am</p> \n<p>Naked at the corner</p> \n<p>And everything is visible.</p> \n<p>Where am I –</p> \n<p>Naked? At the corner?</p> \n<p>Visible?</p> \n<p>You didn’t see me</p> \n<p>An infinite babushka doll</p> \n<p>You thought you’d bought me</p> \n<p>But what you bought wasn’t</p> \n<p>It</p> \n<p>I traded only in my pain</p> \n<p>Now there’s no difference between us</p> \n<p>Except the light</p> \n<p>I see the colorful spectrum in blue</p> \n<p>As black on grey</p> \n<p>Can anyone condemn me</p> \n<p>To live my fate?</p> \n<p>Have you cast all your stones at others</p> \n<p>Or is there one left for me?”</p> \n<p>(Translated from Hebrew by Vivian Eden)</p> \n<p>“Anybody who’s an artist or creator wants his creation to reach a wider public,” says Vika. “It moves me that my writing will reach people and maybe touch their hearts. Sometimes, people don’t have a lot of patience to hear about other people’s troubles. So if by the medium of poetry people can understand what I went through, they’ll understand something about the experience of prostitution, they’ll know that you can get out of drugs and prostitution, they’ll realize that one can come from darkness to light and change and it’s important to change because life is short and worth living, so this certainly moves me to tears.”</p> \n<p>“The poems were written by them and are in their voices, they bring the reader to meet the woman herself and not some imaginary representation or with a writer’s fantasy about prostitution or with its usual representation in literature,” says Idit Rosen. “When reading the poetry, what prostitution really is becomes clear, its complexity and how it is experienced for them.”</p> \n<p>The Ashtray Poem</p> \n<p>By Miri</p> \n<p>When I’m doing it</p> \n<p>I feel like an ashtray, filthy,</p> \n<p>Into which you toss your cigarette butts.</p> \n<p>Because you who give me money for it</p> \n<p>Are in fact giving me dirty coins</p> \n<p>Change you have in your pocket</p> \n<p>That no one wants or needs.</p> \n<p>If I am an ashtray that means that</p> \n<p>I am worth spit, I am transparent,</p> \n<p>I am unworthy.</p> \n<p>Say thank you that I even agreed</p> \n<p>To contain you.</p> \n<p>Though most times you did it</p> \n<p>Even when I refused, loudly, quietly,</p> \n<p>With extinguished eyes, with a silent scream.</p> \n<p>But hey, an ashtray doesn’t even speak.</p> \n<p>Nevermind scream.</p> \n<p>And if I am an ashtray, I don’t have feelings.</p> \n<p>I didn’t burn up inside when you stubbed out</p> \n<p>The butts of your loneliness.</p> \n<p>I wasn’t humiliated when you spat out your urges on to me.</p> \n<p>Sometimes I get to thinking</p> \n<p>I want to go see a doctor.</p> \n<p>But not just any doctor,</p> \n<p>I want a doctor who will cure me of the street,</p> \n<p>You know, the street-type situation where I am.</p> \n<p>Until I realize</p> \n<p>The doctor, too, likes to smoke.</p> \n<p>(Translated from Hebrew by Vivian Eden)</p> \n<p>The exhibit will close at the end of the month.

        "text":["<p>A Jewish family whose application to join a cooperative village in the north was rejected by the admission committee found that an expert opinion on their suitability was greatly revised to their detriment – and the applicants never learned about the change or received a chance to appeal.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Documents obtained by Haaretz show that the admission committee appealed because of the “gap between the opinion of the person who wrote the report and the committee’s impression.” A representative of the community added that “there was no compatibility” between the description of the family and the institute’s evaluation.</p> \n<p>The family only received the second report and discovered the existence of the first version only seven years later as part of the debate over an appeal by the Israel Land Authority’s “reservations committee.”</p> \n<p>In an unusual move, in the case in question, the admission committee disqualified both opinions by the institute, but still rejected the family.</p> \n<p>Israel’s admission committees have already been widely criticized for denying entry to Israeli Arabs, but evidence also seems to exist of overly close ties between communities and screening institutes.</p> \n<p>Eight years ago the Jewish family asked to join the community as full members; the family had moved in two years earlier and hoped to become full members ahead of the community’s plans to expand and sell plots to more families.</p> \n<p>The admissions committee referred the family, as customary, to the Adam Milo Institute for evaluation, and the institute recommended rejecting the family’s request due to the father’s “unsuitability” to the “community’s character.”</p> \n<p>But after receiving the institute’s first opinion, the community appealed and the institute issued a second version. The family was not notified about the first opinion or the appeal. Even the members of the government committee that reviews appeals against admission committees' decisions did not know about it.</p> \n<p>The Adam Milo Institute decided to comment.</p> \n<p>The use of such institutes to screen applicants is extremely common following the amendment to the 2011 admission-committees law that allowed the use of such institutes if it’s deemed that a candidate might be “socially unsuitable.”</p> \n<p>'Tool to harm'</p> \n<p>Attorney Adi Nir-Binyamini, of Tel Aviv University’s Human Rights Clinic, says that “contrary to the law, which envisioned a professional objective procedure to protect the applicant from arbitrary decisions, the institutes’ evaluation process is used by the communities and admission committees as a tool to harm the applicants.”</p> \n<p>As she put it, “The screening institute was required – and agreed – to adjust its opinion to that of the community that ordered it.”</p> \n<p>About six months ago Binyamini asked the Justice Ministry, the Israel Land Authority and the Registrar of Cooperative Societies to set a procedure “to ensure the severing of ties between the screening institutes and the communities.” She says the applicant should choose the institute, while the authorities should review the efforts of the committees and institutes.</p> \n<p>Speaking to Haaretz, the Israel Land Authority declined to comment, and the Justice Ministry said the “issue is being examined at the Israel Land Authority.”</p> \n<p>The two opinions on the family were issued about seven years ago, a few months apart. The Adam Milo employee who received the appeal wrote that the father had “a potential for difficulty in integrating into the community.”</p> \n<p>But after receiving the appeal from the community and reevaluating the findings, it was decided to disqualify the couple due to the potential “for creating a subcommunity and harming the existing community’s character.”</p> \n<p>According to Nir-Binyamini, the first version of the opinion did not use the term “subcommunity” at all. “Subcommunity” is one reason allowing a community to reject applicants.</p> \n<p>The differences between the two reports are considerable. For example, in the clause “ability to contribute to the community” and “managerial capability,” the father’s grade fell to 3 from 7. For “ability to fit into an interpersonal system,” “tolerance for other people – attentiveness, caring and empathy for others” and “ability to cooperate in a team,” the number fell to 3 from 6.</p> \n<p>For “personal integrity,” the father’s grade fell to “mediocre” from “good.” For “personality strength to endure adjustment,” a high mark fell to “mediocre.”</p> \n<p>Also, in the later opinion, comments on the father were removed such as “is willing to compromise,” “doesn’t openly come out against others” and doesn’t appear to “favor processes for a sweeping change of the community’s way of life.”</p> \n<p>Also deleted was a sentence depicting the man as an “individualist who chooses his way” and “isn’t looking to unite with others but to be unique.” Instead, a comment was added that the man’s “behavior could create a subcommunity and harm the existing community’s character.”</p> \n<p>Overall, the first opinion gave the father an overall grade of 6 on a scale of 1 to 9 – “recommended with reservation.” He then dropped to 3 – “not recommended.” The family’s grade overall dropped to 3 from 7 (“recommended”).</p> \n<p>'Ensuring full satisfaction'</p> \n<p>The descriptive part was also revised. Deleted were sentences about both parents “seeing themselves involved and contributing to the community, and both are characterized as seeking a stable, relaxed atmosphere without unnecessary friction.”</p> \n<p>The conclusions that the family “is suitable for admission” and the father “is not expected to create a subgroup or enter into confrontations” disappeared. Instead, a new sentence was added saying that “there is potential for creating a subcommunity or at the very least harming the character of the existing community.”</p> \n<p>Both the community and the institute said the changes were made as part of an orderly procedure including the input of a senior psychologist who was not part of the psychologist team in the first report.</p> \n<p>“The conduct of the community and admission committee is extremely problematic regarding the screening institute, because they had to inform the applicants about the results of the first opinion,” the Israel Land Authority’s reservations committee said at the time.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, other institutes appear to maintain direct ties with various communities, while building their screening process based on specific requirements.</p> \n<p>For example, a major institute’s website boasts of ties with a community, knowing its features and demands, and guiding the admission committee in using the evaluation reports.</p> \n<p>Another institute promises that “to ensure the clients’ full satisfaction, the institute encourages a preliminary meeting” with the admission committee “to coordinate expectations and positions about the applicants and draft criteria for preliminary selection.”</p> \n<p>In 2014 the High Court of Justice denied a petition by human rights groups against the law regulating admission committees.</p> \n<p>“It seems that the institutes’ professional involvement in screening applicants is not a real supervision system that can resist the clients’ – the communities’ – desires,&quot;&nbsp;one of the justices at the time, Salim Joubran, said in his minority opinion. &quot;This raises fears that the institutes will serve as fig leaves for the admission committees’ decisions.”</p> \n<p>He added that the “professional opinion is not subjected to administrative oversight or legal review.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The U.S. government was headed toward a partial shutdown at midnight on Friday after President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans in the Senate failed to muster the votes needed to approve $5 billion he has demanded for a border wall fiercely opposed by Democrats.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump said the impending shutdown of key parts of the federal government could last &quot;a very long time,&quot; and he sought to blame Democrats. They, in turn, put the blame squarely on him for his Thursday demand for wall funding after earlier backing bipartisan short-term government funding legislation passed by the Senate on Wednesday without any such money.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy informed lawmakers on Friday they will be given a 24-hour notice before a vote to end the shutdown, pushing a reopening of government until at least Saturday night.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Congress could reopen the government sooner if they reach unanimous consent and approve legislation on a voice vote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Trump picked Mulvaney for his loyalty, then video resurfaces of him calling Trump a 'horrible human being'&nbsp;■&nbsp;Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller are the most assimilated Jews in America | Opinion</p> \n<p>The impending shutdown was the latest evidence of dysfunction in Washington and might not bode well for next year, when Democrats will have a stronger hand as they take control of the House of Representatives.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;President Trump has thrown a temper tantrum and now has us careening towards a 'Trump shutdown' over Christmas,&quot; Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;You're not getting the wall today, next week or on January 3, when Democrats take control of the House,&quot; Schumer added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hours before the deadline, lawmakers met with Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials in a last-ditch effort to find a compromise government funding bill acceptable to both political parties and Trump. There was little indication any such agreement was imminent, but senators said talks would continue.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Congressional funding for about one-quarter of the federal government's programs expires at midnight (0500 GMT), and a shutdown would ensue if Congress, controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, does not pass legislation to provide money to keep the agencies open.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Before meeting with Senate Republicans at the White House, Trump wrote on Twitter that &quot;Democrats now own the shutdown,&quot; despite having said last week that he would be &quot;proud&quot; to close the federal government over the issue of border security and &quot;I'll be the one to shut it down.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The House adjourned just before 7 P.M. (0000 GMT on Saturday) without approving government funding, and the Senate adjourned about an hour later, bringing an end to congressional business for the day and thereby ensuring a government shutdown.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Senate is set to return from recess at noon on Saturday (1700 GMT on Saturday).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Negotiators were discussing $1.6 billion for a range of border security measures - not specifically for a wall - and retaining financial assistance for areas hit by natural disasters that was added by the House, according to a Republican Senate aide.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That $1.6 billion would only be $300 million more than the amount the Senate approved in a temporary funding bill it passed late on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;It's possible that we'll have a shutdown. I would say the chances are probably very good,&quot; Trump said at the White House.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We're going to get a wall,&quot; Trump added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking was a key Trump campaign promise in the 2016 election, when he said it would be paid for by Mexico, and he sees it as a winning issue for his 2020 re-election campaign. Democrats oppose the wall, calling it unnecessary and ineffective.&nbsp;  Procedural vote</p> \n<p>With Pence casting a tie-breaking vote, the Senate, where Republicans have a 51-49 majority, passed a procedural measure on Friday related to legislation approved by the House on Thursday with the wall money that Trump wanted. But Senate Republicans came up short of the votes needed to pass the wall funding.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the procedural vote merely ensured the White House and Democrats could keep discussing a potential compromise to avert a shutdown. Schumer said he was willing to continue talks. A Schumer spokesman said the senator met with Pence, Trump's new chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and Trump son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;There are some people on the White House team who think this can be done in hours. There are others that think it takes 24 (hours),&quot; Republican Senator Bob Corker said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Republican Senators Lamar Alexander and Marco Rubio expressed frustration with what they said was a shifting position by the White House. Rubio said that earlier in the week the Republicans went with their funding bill, which included $1.3 billion for general border security but nothing specifically for a wall, because Pence had told them the White House was open to such a proposal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;We had a reasonable path and there was every indication from the president that he would sign it,&quot; Alexander said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In a series of early-morning tweets on Friday, Trump called on McConnell to use the &quot;nuclear option&quot; to allow a Senate vote on legislation with a simple majority, rather than the standard &quot;supermajority&quot; of 60 votes. But there was not enough support among Republican senators to do so.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The possibility of a government shutdown fed investor anxieties that contributed to another down day on Friday for U.S. stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.82 percent, the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.06 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.99 percent.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The showdown added to tensions in Washington as lawmakers also grappled with Trump's sudden move to pull troops from Syria, which prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign and furthered concerns over the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election that Trump won.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Three-quarters of government programs are fully funded through the end of the federal fiscal year next September 30, including those in the Defense Department, Labor Department and Health and Human Services. Funding for other agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, Justice Department and Agriculture Department, was set to expire at midnight on Friday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A partial government shutdown could begin with affected agencies limiting staff to those deemed &quot;essential&quot; to public safety. Such critical workers, including U.S. border agents, and nonessential employees would not get paid until the dispute ends. National parks also would close unless the government declares them essential.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>More than half of the 1,700 people who work for the executive office of the president would be furloughed.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>It is a common practice among Hasidic Jews to abstain from studying the Torah on Christmas Eve. This tradition is remarkable, since for one thing, religious Jews do not usually have customs associated with Christian holidays. For another, studying of Torah is considered one of the most important things Jews must do, and they otherwise only abstain &nbsp;on solemn days, such as Tisha B’Av. Why would they eschew this sacred duty on &quot;Nittel Nacht&quot;, the night before Christmas?</p> \n<p>The Yiddish name for Christmas is Nittel. It derives from the medieval Latin name of the holiday, Natalis Dies Domini, “the Lord’s birthday”, which also gave French and Italian their names for the holiday, No&euml;l and Natale respectively.</p> \n<p>(Despite Nittel's clear derivation from Latin, medieval Jews commonly believed that the word was derived from the Hebrew word nitleh - &quot;hanged one,&quot; which was a common name for Jesus among Jews at the time due to his association with crucifixion.)&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While we find references to Nittel in rabbinic literature throughout the Middle Ages, the first mention of abstaining from Torah study on Christmas Eve appears only in the second half of the 17th century.</p> \n<p>According to Prof. Marc Shapiro of the University of Scranton, who conducted the most thorough study of the subject to date, the first known reference to the practice in rabbinic writings is a single line in Rabbi Yair Bacharach’s book Kitzur Halakhot. What Bacharach, one of the most important rabbis in 17 century Germany, actually wrote about the practice was lost, but the reference to it in his index has survived: “And the practice of canceling Torah study on Christmas.”</p> \n<p>Although that earliest reference to the practice in Jewish texts dates to the 1600s, it could well have existed earlier. It is possible and indeed likely that Jews would have refrained from mentioning the practice in writing for fear that Christians would read about the custom and punish them for it.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, as Shapiro notes in his article &quot;Torah Study on Christmas Eve,&quot; apostates (Jews who converted to Christianity) in the 16th and 17th centuries are not known to have mentioned the practice in their anti-Jewish polemics, which in and of itself indicates that they did not know about it. The requisite conclusion is that either the practice did not exist yet, or perhaps was not widespread yet.</p> \n<p>The crime of apostasy</p> \n<p>According to medieval Jewish belief, for his crime of apostasy – teaching laws to the Jews that were not in the Torah&nbsp;– Jesus is confined to a pool of sewage in Hell for eternity. A common theme in the anti-Jewish writings by medieval apostates in Germany is that on Christmas Eve specifically, Jesus “has to wander in all pits of excrement or latrines throughout the world,” as one such apostate Johann Pfefferkorn wrote in 1511.</p> \n<p>As for the practice of abstaining from Torah study in relation to Christianity, the earliest mention isn't even about Christmas. Shapiro cites the writings of the apostate Johann Adrian from 1609, who wrote that Jews do not study Torah on Ascension Day, not Christmas. That is because, Adrian wrote, Jews believe that Jesus spends the night crawling through sewage, and that if he hears the Torah being studied in a house, he gets a respite from this dreadful punishment. Thus, by abstaining from Torah study, they deprive him of that respite.</p> \n<p>Adrian also mentions that parents tell their children “See that the hanged one does not pull you in,” meaning into the toilet.</p> \n<p>We can infer that had Adrian known about the practice of abstaining from Torah study on Christmas Eve and its reason, he would have happily mentioned it.</p> \n<p>The same applies to another apostate, Julius Conrad Otto, who published an anti-Jewish polemic in 1613 in which he claims that Jews curse Jesus on Christmas Eve, but he says nothing about abstaining from Torah study.</p> \n<p>The specific prohibition on studying Torah on Christmas eve first appears in writing, according to Shapiro's research, in 1614, in the writings of the apostate Samuel Friedrich Brenz. His stated grounds are the same as given by Adrian for abstaining from Torah study on Ascension Day: doing so gives Jesus a respite from crawling through excrement. Brenz also claims that Jews consume a lot of garlic on this day, no doubt out of the belief that this will ward off the feared Jesus. The belief that garlic wards off demons is attested in Jewish writings.</p> \n<p>Two years later, in 1616, another apostate named Dietrich Schwab repeated the charge that Jews believed that Jesus roamed the world’s toilets on Christmas Eve, mentioning that they “instill in their children and other members of their house great fear and horror… they do not desire to go into the latrine on this night unless they are in the most extreme need and are forced to do so.” Schwab also mentions the custom of abstaining of Torah study on this day in order to give Jesus “no rest or respite” from his “terrible anguish.”</p> \n<p>Based on these references, it appears that the tradition of not studying Torah on Christmas Eve appeared, or at least became widespread, in the early 17th century, and that it was based on the notion that by doing so they made Jesus’ divine punishment - crawling through excrement - worse.</p> \n<p>The tradition caught on in subsequent generations, markedly in Eastern Europe, which had a large population of Jews.</p> \n<p>By the 19th century, or perhaps earlier, the original reasoning behind the practice was forgotten. But still Jews continued to behave in the way learned from their rabbis.</p> \n<p>Writings in this period make up different explanations for the practice, but by far the most common is that Jews were habitually attacked by Christians on Christmas Eve. To prevent this, they stayed home and didn’t study Torah. This is evidently a later rationalization.</p> \n<p>So today some Jews continue the tradition of abstaining from Torah study on Christmas Eve just as their rabbis did over the generations, not knowing that the reason for this was an old, dark superstition that was held by German Jews in the 17th century, one in which no one today believes.</p>",

Police said there was nothing to suggest the crippling of one of Europe's busiest airports was a terrorist attack.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Gatwick's drone nightmare is thought to be the most disruptive yet at a major airport and indicates a new vulnerability that will be scrutinised by security forces and airport operators across the world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The army and police snipers were called in to hunt down the drones, thought to be industrial-style craft, which flew near the airport every time authorities tried to reopen it on Thursday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>No group has claimed responsibility publicly and police said there was no evidence another state was involved.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sussex Police Assistant Chief Constable Steve Barry said they were keeping an open mind about who was responsible.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;In terms of the motivation, there's a whole spectrum of possibilities, from the really high-end criminal behavior that we've seen, all the way down to potentially, just individuals trying to be malicious, trying to disrupt the airport,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After a boom in sales, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a growing menace at airports across the world. In Britain, the number of near misses between private drones and aircraft more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Thermal imaging?</p> \n<p>The British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA) said it understood &quot;detection and tracking equipment&quot; had been installed around Gatwick's perimeter.</p> \n<p>BALPA said that it was extremely concerned at the risk of a drone collision. Flying drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary is punishable by five years in prison.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The defense ministry refused to comment on what technology was deployed but drone experts said airports needed to deploy specialist radar reinforced by thermal imaging technology to detect such unmanned flying vehicles.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Other ways to tackle them is typically by frequency jamming that can disable or disrupt control signals and the GPS signals that allow the drones to navigate.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Britain's Press Association (PA) reported that an Israeli-developed system was in use at Gatwick, which can detect drones via radar and jam communications between drone and operator.</p> \n<p>The Telegraph newspaper had reported earlier that the perpetrator had circled the drone around the airport building and flashed its lights. A description of the drone by witnesses had enabled experts to determine the model of the machine, according to the report.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The drone sightings caused misery for travellers, many sleeping on the airport floor as they searched for alternative routes to holidays and Christmas family gatherings.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Flights were halted at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted near the airport. The disruption affected at least 120,000 people on Wednesday and Thursday but flights were restarted at 0614 GMT on Friday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At 1740 GMT flights were suspended again but restarted less than an hour later.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It was not immediately clear what the financial impact would be on the main airlines operating from Gatwick including easyJet, British Airways and Norwegian.</p> \n<p>Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said it considered the event to be an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot; meaning airlines are not obliged to pay compensation to affected passengers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Airlines will have to refund customers who no longer wish to travel, however, and try to reschedule flights to get passengers to their destinations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some airport staff handed out chocolate and Christmas elf toys to stranded passengers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some, like Sarah Garghan-Watson, chose to stick it out at the airport overnight, having arrived at 8 A.M. on Thursday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;It's now 2 o'clock in the morning at Gatwick, and it's very bright and very noisy. It's now also very cold,&quot; she said in a video shown on Sky.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;All I can see tonight ... is a sign that says 'no more sleeps until the beach'.

        "text":["<p>“What did the resistance know?” This simple question has been the focus of fierce debate in Norway in recent weeks. The answer to this question, which is emblazoned on the cover of a new book by journalist Marte Michelet, threatens to shatter Norway's greatest myth: the heroism of the resistance that fought the Nazis and saved half the country’s Jews during World War II.</p> \n<p>At the center of the debate is a terrible event Norwegians would prefer to erase from the history books. On November 26, 1942, a cargo ship sailed from Oslo carrying about 530 Norwegian Jews who had been arrested with the help of the local police. The ship headed for Poland; the Jews were then sent to Auschwitz. The vast majority did not survive the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>According to Norway’s received version of events, the Norwegian resistance did not find out about the deportation in time. The story goes that the deportation was a complete surprise, though the resistance did help hundreds of Jews escape to Sweden.</p> \n<p>But documents Michelet found over years of research reflect a more complex picture. It turns out that the resistance did know about the Germans’ intention to deport Norway’s Jews, months before the arrest order was issued. Still, the resistance did not try to save Jews but rather&nbsp; concentrated on the fight against the Germans.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Secretly photographing the Holocaust: A rare exhibition of photos taken by Jews in the ghetto</p> \n<p>In her Norwegian-language book, Michelet says Helmuth James von Moltke, the German military intelligence officer who opposed the Nazis and was executed by the Gestapo in 1945, gave information about the deportation plans to the resistance and to the Norwegian government in exile in London. He did this after the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, where the Nazis discussed their plans to annihilate Europe’s Jews.</p> \n<p>Michelet also found a shelved interview that historian and Norwegian resistance fighter Ragnar Ulstein conducted with underground hero Gunnar Sonsteby, the most decorated Norwegian. In the interview, Sonsteby said he and his comrades knew about the deportation plan three months before it was carried out. “We knew with 100 percent certainty that the Jews would be deported from Norway,” he said.</p> \n<p>In the Norwegian media, it has been argued that the very fact the interview was mothballed at the Resistance Museum in Oslo could indicate that resistance historians and heroes worked together to blur a mixed past.</p> \n<p>Ulstein, who is now 98, has criticized Michelet’s conclusions. “Every decade someone crops up and thinks he knows more than what we knew,” he told the newspaper Dagsavisen. “And with hindsight they ask why the resistance didn’t do this or that. I’m tired of this. It’s a pointless discussion.”</p> \n<p>He said “Michelet doesn’t understand the nature of the war,” adding that the resistance didn’t have concrete intelligence about the deportation, while the atmosphere was one of rumor under “the fog of occupation.”</p> \n<p>A business in every respect</p> \n<p>Still, Michelet discovered documents and testimonies about anti-Semitism that was common in the resistance. She also learned that despite the resistance’s decision not to help the Jews, some activists realized the economic potential in rescuing them.</p> \n<p>Thus, groups in the resistance that needed money to finance their operations against the Germans helped smuggle Jews to Sweden simply for large sums of money. The rescue operation emerges in her book as a business in every respect, one that left the surviving Jews impoverished. Wealthy people who could pay were saved, and those without means were sent to Auschwitz.</p> \n<p>Norwegian historians are confirming the findings and are revealing equally damning details about groups within the resistance that competed to save Jews for money. Archival documents show that in a number of cases people in the resistance informed on their colleagues to the Germans, jealous of their profits. The price was paid of course also by any Jews who were being hid by the group that was informed on.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How a Nazi sympathizer helped found one of Sweden's most powerful parties</p> \n<p>In recent weeks these revelations have caused a stir in Norwegian newspaper editorials and elsewhere. Michelet faces criticism from establishment historians, especially those of the Jewish Museum in Oslo and the Resistance Museum in Oslo, who have cast doubt on her findings and attacked her professional integrity. But a former president of the Jewish community in the Norwegian capital, Ervin Kohn, has defended her, noting that most of her revelations were known to the Jewish community, adding that the Norwegian “heroism narrative” began to crack years ago.</p> \n<p>A tree at Yad Vashem</p> \n<p>At the center of this narrative was the notion that the Norwegian nation was a victim of the Nazis. Collaborators with the Germans were depicted as a treacherous minority and punished. Most people were depicted as having resisted the Germans, with resistance members depicted as national heroes.</p> \n<p>After the Nazi invasion in April 1940, the king and the government fled to London while in Norway a puppet government was established that operated at the behest of Nazi Germany. Half of Norway’s Jews, about 800 people, were sent to the death camps, with the help of the Norwegian authorities. Most of them were deported on a ship that left Oslo in the fall of 1942.</p> \n<p>But the resistance smuggled hundreds of Jews – half the community – across the border to safety in Sweden. A tree has been planted in the underground’s honor at Yad Vashem.</p> \n<p>Most of the resistance’s glory stems from the daring operation to blow up the heavy water production plant the Nazis used as part of their nuclear weapons program. The commander of that operation, Joachim Ronneberg, who died in October at 99, was a national hero.</p> \n<p>But over the years it turned out that the number of Norwegians who volunteered for the German army was far greater than the number who fought in the resistance.</p> \n<p>In 1996, discussion began on the Jewish property that was stolen and nationalized by the authorities during the war. Amid public pressure, a government commission was set up to examine the issue; a majority in the commission ruled that the government was not responsible for the Nazis’ crimes, therefore the compensation could be symbolic. But the government adopted the minority opinion and paid reparations to the Jewish community.</p> \n<p>Later it emerged that it was the Norwegian police who carried out the mass arrests of the Jews, not German soldiers, and many Norwegians helped the police or turned a blind eye. In 2012, Norway’s prime minister officially apologized for the role Norwegians played in the arrest and deportation of Jews. A few months later the Norwegian police also apologized, followed by the national rail company in 2015.</p> \n<p>In 2014, Michelet published her debut book, whose title translates as “The Ultimate Crime: Victims and Perpetrators in the Norwegian Holocaust.” It immediately sparked a controversy. Michelet said she began to research the topic when she moved into an apartment in Oslo once owned by Jews who were deported form Norway and murdered at Auschwitz.</p> \n<p>Yet the national narrative continued to glorify the resistance’s role in saving Jews. Michelet’s new book, “What Did the Resistance Know?” is threatening to take even that credit away. The Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet has called it “the most important book of the year.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The central bank of Yemen, split into two rival head offices reflecting a country divided by war, has been slow to finance imports of food needed to fend off widespread hunger, sources with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia agreed in July to lend $2 billion to the central bank office located in the southern port of Aden, the seat of the Riyadh-backed government, to help finance imports of basic goods.</p> \n<p>The loan would enable importers to exchange Yemeni rials for dollars to buy food for a country where a collapse in the currency has left many unable to afford basic foodstuffs.</p> \n<p>But an Aden central bank document circulated in November, seen by Reuters and corroborated by two of the sources, made clear that only a little over $170 million had been authorized for payment.</p> \n<p>Deputy Governor Shokeib Hobeishy told reporters earlier this month that the total had risen to $340 million, but it was unclear how much had reached companies wanting to import food.</p> \n<p>“There were a lot of regulations that we needed to complete but we have overcome that,” he said at his office in the Aden central bank. A sniper perched on a rooftop across the street to provide security.</p> \n<p>The rival central bank headquarters in Sanaa, the national capital now controlled by the Houthi group that has been fighting a coalition led by the Saudis for almost four years, did not receive any funds from the Saudi loan.</p> \n<p>That was to be expected, given the realities of the war. But with the Saudi loan going to Aden, money has been directed away from Houthi-controlled areas in the north where most food imports arrive.</p> \n<p>Traders who previously did business through the central bank in Sanaa are now scrambling to work through Aden, a switch that has created more holdups and payment problems.</p> \n<p>Some traders say the Aden office favors government-held areas. Hobeishy denied that, saying there was no question of his bank issuing letters of credit to those doing business in some areas of the country and not others.</p> \n<p>He also cast doubt on the status of the central bank in Sanaa. “There is no such thing as two central banks in Yemen, there has always been just one bank and we moved to Aden,” he said.</p> \n<p>The government moved the central bank to Aden in 2016, accusing the Houthis of squandering $4 billion of bank reserves on the conflict. The Houthis say the funds were used to finance food and medicine imports.</p> \n<p>Officials at the Sanaa central bank could not be reached, while a Houthi spokesman had no immediate comment.</p> \n<p>A senior official at the Aden central bank, who declined to be named, said the bank was having difficulties.</p> \n<p>“There is confusion at the central bank level ... no one has a clue about the whole landscape,” the official said. “This is happening because there is no senior leadership or oversight.”</p> \n<p>In a move that could make it easier to bring in food, the two sides agreed at United Nations peace talks earlier this month on a truce and troop withdrawal from the Houthi-held port of Hodeidah.</p> \n<p>Opening Hodeidah was a vital starting point to get imports flowing, a UN official told Reuters.</p> \n<p>“Then we need to solve the other problems like access, in particular, to currency from the central bank,” said Abdessalam Ould Ahmed, the FAO’s assistant director general and regional representative for Near East and North Africa.</p> \n<p>Hodeidah handles 70% of Yemen’s imports of commercial goods and aid. It is a lifeline for 15.9 million people facing severe hunger in the impoverished nation of 30 million.</p> \n<p>The World Food Program said the truce should allow access to 51,000 metric tons of its wheat stocks cut off since September due to fighting.</p> \n<p>One big importer, who declined to be named, said it was not possible to ship new wheat cargoes to the ports of Hodeidah and Salif due to lack of payment. The importer was still waiting for over $50 million in foreign currency.</p> \n<p>A second grain importer had yet to receive about $20 million in foreign currency and had stopped new shipments.</p> \n<p>“Private traders have to pay for the goods before they are even shipped out, so they are already out of pocket,” the second trade source said.</p> \n<p>The United Nations said Yemen needs billions of dollars in external support to avoid another currency collapse.</p> \n<p>The central bank is struggling to pay public-sector wages as foreign exchange reserves dwindle. It has access to a Federal Reserve account of $200 million while around 87 million pounds sterling are frozen in a Bank of England account. The Bank of England declined to comment.</p> \n<p>Authorities sought to boost liquidity last year by printing money. Since then the rial has halved in value.</p> \n<p>The United Nations and the International Monetary Fund are working to reunite the rival central banks.</p> \n<p>The chairman of Yemen’s Gulf of Aden Ports, Mohammed Alawi Amzerbah, said around 85% of goods arriving in Aden can make it to Houthi-held areas. But a day later, a celebration at a location two hours from Aden to launch a road to transport goods northwards was canceled for security reasons.</p> \n<p>Yemen’s problems go further than importing food. In Aden’s fish market onlookers cheered as a fisherman displayed his catch, a small shark, but customers were scarce.</p> \n<p>“Before, you could buy that shark for 2,000 rials. Now you need 7,000 rials,” said Nasser Bureik Nasser, a fisheries ministry employee.</p>",

It has often proposed its army as an alternative to Kurdish forces in fighting ISIS, but has consistently been rebuffed.</p> \n<p>The Kurds, who demonstrated impressive effectiveness in that war, not only served a vital military function but also gave the United States a foothold in the diplomatic process that Russia is leading to end Syria’s civil war and establish a new government. Turkey set up the National Liberation Front – comprised of Syrian militias including the Free Syrian Army – to gain military and diplomatic leverage in Syria. Washington used the Kurds for the same purpose. Part of their function was to ensure that American interests are upheld in the future as well.</p> \n<p>To this end, the Americans planned to set up observation posts in Syria near the Turkish border to warn of and deter any Turkish assault on the Kurds. Granted, Washington’s official justification was to protect Turkey from attack, but Turkey didn’t buy it.</p> \n<p>Kurds abandoned</p> \n<p>This week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that he intends to send Turkish forces even deeper into Syria to liberate the city of Manbij from Kurdish control. This would violate his agreement with Washington under which American and Turkish forces would jointly patrol outside the city. Thus his announcement presented Washington with a dilemma – continue supporting the Kurds or acquiesce to Turkey’s demands?</p> \n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw all American forces – some 2,000 combatants and advisers – from Syria shows that Turkey won this round. The United States’ Kurdish allies have been abandoned, left with no American protection except diplomatic pressure, which has already proved ineffective.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Trump abandons Syria's Kurds: Will Turkey now crush their dream of a 'secular utopia?'</p> \n<p>It’s not clear whether Washington’s decision stemmed from an agreement under which Turkey would cancel or freeze the S-400 deal. But from Turkey’s standpoint, this is a green light to continue taking over all the Kurdish areas from the city of Afrin eastward, to prevent the establishment of an autonomous Kurdish zone like the one in Iraq.</p> \n<p>Erdogan said he spoke with Trump this week about his intent to conquer territory east of the Euphrates River and “Trump gave his consent.” If that’s true, it seems likely there was some kind of deal linking America’s withdrawal to the S-400 purchase.</p> \n<p>Russia and Iran, its diplomatic partner in Syria, can breathe a sigh of relief now that the United States is leaving and go ahead with their own plans. The Kurds say Russia is actually pushing Turkey to conquer parts of eastern Syria in order to force the Kurds to join the diplomatic process, which would eliminate one of the biggest obstacles to the formation of a unified rebel negotiating team.</p> \n<p>This week, Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed for Syrian government and rebel negotiators to meet in Geneva early next year under UN auspices. The conference is slated to include 50 government representatives, 50 rebel representatives and 50 “independents” about whose identity the parties are still wrangling.</p> \n<p>The conference aims to create a constitutional drafting committee that would decide on issues such as the president’s powers, and also prepare for parliamentary and presidential elections in Syria. Washington recently said it wouldn’t oppose Syrian President Bashar Assad’s remaining in power if he won a free election.</p> \n<p>But it hasn’t said a word about what kind of government it wants to see in Syria, constitutional protections for minorities like the Kurds, security arrangements and the withdrawal of foreign forces. In short, America understands that it can no longer even influence, must less dictate, the shape of Syria’s new regime.</p> \n<p>Idlib's future</p> \n<p>One critical question relates to Syria’s postwar reconstruction, which is expected to cost $300 billion to $400 billion. Washington and Europe have both said they won’t contribute a cent unless there’s a consensual, stable government. But anyone who isn’t involved in the reconstruction won’t be able to influence the regime.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Syrian army must still conquer at least one major enclave to finish retaking the country. That’s the Idlib district, currently home to between 100,000 and 150,000 rebel fighters who moved there from throughout the country after Russian-sponsored cease-fire agreements.</p> \n<p>In October, Idlib was on the verge of suffering a major offensive that could have killed of thousands of people. But under Turkish and American pressure, Russia agreed to postpone the assault in exchange for a Turkish promise to get the rebels to remove all heavy weapons from the city of Idlib and join the diplomatic process.</p> \n<p>Idlib, which was declared a de-escalation zone under a Russian-Turkish-Iranian agreement, is technically under Turkish supervision. But Ankara has only partial influence over the rebel militias, and none over the Al-Qaida-linked Tahrir al-Sham (formerly the Nusra Front) and other extremist groups.</p> \n<p>The fear is that if Turkey doesn’t keep its promise to Russia in the coming days, Russia will decide to help the Syrian army take Idlib by force. This fear has already led thousands of people to flee the city, and if heavy fighting does take place there, Turkey is likely to face a new flood of Syrian refugees.</p> \n<p>Another thing Assad can be pleased about is the Arab states’ new attitude toward Syria. The first harbinger was the visit to Damascus by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, and Iraqi President Barham Salih is expected to follow suit soon.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi plans to take advantage of an upcoming economic conference in Beirut to ask Arab leaders to invite Assad to the Arab League summit in Tunisia in March. If Assad is invited, it will be the first time Syria has participated in an Arab League summit since it was suspended in November 2011.</p> \n<p>The league has been strikingly ineffective in handling the Syrian crisis. But its unusual decision to suspend Syria was nevertheless an important symbolic gesture of protest against Assad’s slaughter of his own citizens.</p> \n<p>Still, if Syria returns to the Arab League in the near future, that would be much more than a symbolic gesture. It would be a slap in the face to Saudi Arabia, which doesn’t want Assad remaining in power. It would also be a clear sign both that the Arab coalition against Iran is developing cracks and that the stature of its leader, Saudi Arabia, is declining.</p> \n<p>Trump is being pressured by Congress to freeze arms deals with Riyadh, and Saudi Arabia is now persona non grata on Capitol Hill. The Arab states are beginning to speak out against Saudi leadership and are also watching the United States leave Syria with its tail between its legs. And with all that happening, Russia presumably won’t remain on the sidelines.</p> \n<p>All this shows that Trump’s withdrawal decision is another colossal error, or at least a poorly-thought-out move that could redraw the map of the Middle East’s blocs in a way that could undermine America’s position in the region – and certainly undermine Israel’s.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Women, some without headscarves, drove themselves to a Formula-E car race where thousands of young Saudis and hundreds of international visitors partied into the night at concerts by Enrique Iglesias, The Black Eyed Peas and DJ David Guetta.</p> \n<p>It’s a vision of Saudi Arabia that epitomizes Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s top-down reform efforts. The spectacle would have been unthinkable until recently in the ultra-conservative kingdom where religious police used to enforce strict gender segregation, scolded women for not covering their hair and barged into restaurants to demand music be turned off.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: Trump's decision to stand by Saudi prince has Netanyahu's fingerprints on it | Analysis ■&nbsp; Saudi-Israel backchannel 'takes hit' after officials dismissed over Khashoggi's murder</p> \n<p>The concerts and car race cap several months of profound change in Saudi Arabia, including the opening of the first movie theater in April and the lifting of the world’s only ban on women driving in June.</p> \n<p>But there’s a hard limit to the reforms — as revealed by the brutal killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents close to the crown prince in October and the reported torture of several women’s rights activists in detention. While the arena for fun is widening, the space for political engagement and dissent has virtually disappeared.</p> \n<p>The 33-year-old crown prince, backed by his father King Salman, presides over a nation where he alone defines the pace and scope of change.</p> \n<p>It’s difficult to gauge the prince’s domestic popularity, given the reservations and fear many have of criticizing the leadership. But his reforms are popular among young Saudis who believe their cities should offer some of the glitz and entertainment of neighboring Dubai or Abu Dhabi.</p> \n<p>“This is a major change in Saudi Arabia and we are proud of it,” said Abdelrahman al-Mahmoud, 29, a spectator at the electric car race in the capital, Riyadh. He expressed pride in a nation he feels is finally coming into its own.</p> \n<p>When asked about the crown prince, al-Mahmoud described him as “the most popular guy” in Saudi Arabia. Pressed for his thoughts on Khashoggi’s killing, he tensed up, like other Saudis interviewed at the race, and said he came to enjoy the day and didn’t want to discuss politics.</p> \n<p>The death of Khashoggi, who was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, seemed a world away from the carefree atmosphere at the race last weekend where concert-goers belted out “Long live Salman” to house beats remixed by Guetta, the DJ.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of town, three prominent women’s rights activists are being held in Riyadh’s Ha’ir Prison. They were arrested in May, enduring abuse and torture at the hands of masked interrogators in the Red Sea city of Jiddah before being transferred to Riyadh this month.</p> \n<p>The women, among more than a dozen female activists being held, were whipped and caned on their backs and thighs, and electrocuted, according to five people with knowledge of their treatment. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal and to protect personal details about the detainees.</p> \n<p>They said some of the women were forcibly touched and kissed, at least one was water-boarded and one attempted suicide during confinement. They said one woman was threatened with being raped, killed and dumped in a ditch, allegedly by a senior official wearing a mask. The detainee purportedly recognized him by some of his features.</p> \n<p>The allegation could not be confirmed independently.</p> \n<p>The government has denied charges of abuse as “wild claims” that are “simply wrong.”</p> \n<p>The arrest of women’s rights activists, accused of vague national security crimes, was one of the incongruities in the reform agenda that Khashoggi wrote about in Washington Post columns before he was killed.</p> \n<p>The kingdom denies the crown prince knew of the plot. He’s been supported by President Donald Trump who has touted U.S.-Saudi ties. The U.S. Senate, however, passed a unanimous resolution saying it believes the crown prince is to blame for the murder. His critics point to U.S. intelligence reports and say an operation like this could not have happened without his knowledge.</p> \n<p>The killing badly damaged Prince Mohammed’s international image as a transformational leader committed to changes Saudi Arabia’s allies in the West long hoped for.</p> \n<p>Those changes are being promoted cautiously at home.</p> \n<p>While the English-language Saudi newspaper Arab News touted the Formula-E as a “coming of age” event for the reform agenda, the more widely seen Arabic-language state TV channel only briefly carried images of the crown prince at the race and did not show the concerts or women without headscarves— images that much of the Saudi public strongly disagrees with.</p> \n<p>For 22-year-old Maram Ali, who normally wears a headscarf in public, the race was a rare chance to literally let her hair down. Like many women at the event, she kept the required loose-fitting robe, known as an abaya, on but walked around without a head-covering.</p> \n<p>“These changes should have happened a long time ago,” she said, crediting the crown prince. “People are opening up. ... It’s not like before where we were going backward and the world outside is moving forward.”</p> \n<p>The reform agenda is fueled in part by the need to power the economy in the face of lower oil prices. Unemployment has risen to almost 13 percent, while the cost of electricity and water have skyrocketed as subsidies are rolled back. This week, the king announced an extension of a multibillion-dollar package of monthly allowances for much of the public.</p> \n<p>A father of two who goes by the name Abu Turki said he’s been out of work for six months after he lost his job because of company cost-cutting. He supplements his government benefits, some of which run out in six months, working as a driver for the ride-hailing app Uber.</p> \n<p>Like many Saudis, he’d heard of the Formula-E race, but for religious reasons that for decades have been propagated in this conservative nation home to Islam’s holiest sites, he didn’t agree with the idea of unrelated men and women mixing.</p> \n<p>Speaking from behind a black face veil, Jawaher Othman, 55, had mixed feelings. She said the cool weather encouraged her to visit the race, but she had no intention of staying for the concert.</p> \n<p>“May God correct their path and bless them,” she said of young concert-goers. “I personally don’t agree with the concerts and it’s not for me, but it’s not up to me ban it or say anything.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s sudden announcement this week&nbsp;that the United States' military presence and humanitarian aid in northeastern Syria would be ending surprised and disappointed the Kurds in the region who rely on U.S. support. They weren’t the only ones to be surprised.</p> \n<p>A senior official in the Democratic Union Party, the Kurdish party also known as the PYD that controls the region through its own militia, spoke to Haaretz from his home in Qamishli in northeastern Syria near the Turkish border. He said the decision had surprised everyone, including U.S. military personnel.</p> \n<p>“American military officials have excellent ties” with the Kurdish fighters and “up to this moment, they have stood in unison [in the battle] against ISIS terrorism,” he said. “I don’t know when the withdrawal will be carried out. Just two days ago, international aid in the fight against ISIS arrived.” In interviews with Haaretz, activists and journalists from northeastern Syria confirmed the entry into the region just a few days ago of dozens of trucks packed with arms from Iraq.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Despite the blow to Its national security, Israel will bow to Trump’s Syria withdrawal&nbsp;■&nbsp;U.S. withdrawal from Syria shows Washington is an ally, but only to a point</p> \n<p>The American decision was made after Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke. Turkey had fervently opposed American support for the PYD party's militias, which are the Syrian branch of the Kurdish guerilla organization the PKK, which has been active since the 1980s in Turkey. In December, Turkey sent thousands of Turkish fighters as well as Syrian Arab rebels operating under its auspices to the Turkish-Syrian border. It has been threatening to launch an invasion from Turkey into Kurdish-ruled northern Syria to secure the border.</p> \n<p>Speaking to Haaretz hours after the American declaration was announced, residents of northeastern Syria expressed fear about two possible scenarios in the wake of the withdrawal: the Turkish conquest of the region or a renewed takeover by the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad. Kurdish journalist Akid, who lives in the town of Al-Hasakah, expressed the view of many Kurds interviewed by Haaretz when he described the sense of being caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, there is the threat of the return of the Syrian regime to the Kurdish region; on the other, there is the threat from the Turkish army. “They are not different from one another,” he said. “Either way, we face a real danger. People are scared to death. They fear a loss of security and immediate threats,” he said.</p> \n<p>A Turkish invasion</p> \n<p>The concern over the threat of a Turkish invasion stems in part from reports from the Afrin region of northwestern Syria, an area captured by Turkey with the help of Syrian rebels in March of this year. Since the Turkish conquest, this Kurdish region, which had been under the control of the PYD's Kurdish militias, has undergone a significant demographic shift. Syrian Arabs who had been living in areas under the control of the opposition and who were expelled this year when the rebels in the area surrendered have moved into the homes of Kurds who fled Afrin during the Turkish assault. In addition to the demographic shift, armed Syrian factions acting under Turkey’s auspices have looted Afrin and are continuing to rob the residents, humiliate them at roadblocks and arrest anyone who is suspected of harboring opposition to the new rulers, particularly opposition to Syrian Arabs who have taken over Kurdish homes.</p> \n<p>The threat of a return of the Assad regime also frightens local residents. Under Assad's Baath regime, prior to the civil war, Kurds suffered from ethnic cleansing in border areas as a result of a policy of confiscation of their lands and suppression of their identity. Describing life prior to the outbreak of the civil war in 2011, H., a journalist who lives in the town Amuda, recounted: “They stripped the Kurds of citizenship, banned speaking our language and imposed the Baath party ideology on us.”</p> \n<p>In 2012, after Syrian rebels invaded Aleppo, the Assad regime decided to withdraw its forces from the Kurdish regions and to transfer control to the PYD party's militias to address the manpower shortages in its ranks. The regime and the PYD militias have maintained a tense peace for the duration of the war.</p> \n<p>In July 2018, with increasing indications from the Trump administration that the United States intended to withdraw from Syria, the PYD attempted to obtain concessions from the Assad regime in exchange for an orderly and partial return of central power to areas under PYD rule. The negotiations failed, apparently because the regime insisted on a full return to the situation prior to the war and a refusal to grant the Kurds any hallmark of autonomy.</p> \n<p>The journalist from Amuda said he believes the PYD will negotiate with the regime “and agree to any conditions that would prevent the entry into the region of Turkey even at the cost of surrendering the dream” of Kurdish autonomy. The senior official from the PYD concurred, stressing that the most significant danger in the region is posed by Turkey and its Arab allies, whom he regards as jihadists.</p> \n<p>An end to Kurdish autonomy</p> \n<p>Whether Turkey and its allies conquer the Kurdish-controlled regions or whether the Assad regime retakes the area, the Kurdish dream of autonomy in Syria is coming to an end. Kurdish autonomy has been a far cry from democracy, but for the first time in decades, it gave the Kurds the chance to learn their language, to speak it in public and to celebrate their holidays. This week's declaration by President Trump regarding a U.S. withdrawal from Syria dealt a fatal blow to PYD's capacity to extract concessions, even minimal ones, from the Assad regime, which now knows that all it has to do is wait for the U.S. withdrawal to take place.</p> \n<p>Residents of the region don’t harbor any hopes that negotiations will lead to the granting of any rights to the Kurds, said D., a student from Al-Hasakah. “The Kurds are left without any supporters in the war.... As a result, I don’t think the regime will agree to any concessions in negotiations with democratic Syrian forces. They have never agreed to political negotiations with us, not even at the height of American support.”</p> \n<p>A human rights activist who lives in Derik in northeastern Syria is also convinced that the regime will not grant any rights to the Kurds. “The regime will not agree to anything except for dictatorial rule through force,” he said.</p> \n<p>The journalist from Amuda also expressed concern about the response of his Arab neighbors who have lived under oppressive Kurdish rule over the last few years. “If only we could return to what it was before 2011,&quot; he remarked. &quot;The [Assad] regime and the Arabs who were brought to the region to Arabize the area [in the 1960s] will intensify their violence against the Kurds because they are not prepared to come to terms with the fact that we ruled them.”</p> \n<p>M., a Kurdish electrician from the town of Kobani, which was almost completely destroyed during fierce battles against ISIS in 2014, summed up the wistful feelings of many in the area when he said: &quot;With God’s help, the Americans will not disappoint the [Kurdish] people and won’t disappear. May God grant us patience.&quot;</p> \n<p>Elizabeth Tsurkov is a research fellow at the Forum for Regional Thinking. Her research focuses on Syria.</p>",

        "text":["<p>State Prosecutor Shai Nitzan’s recommendation to indict Benjamin Netanyahu on bribery charges in two cases does not leave Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit much wiggle room. (Case 4000, the Bezeq affair, involves allegations that telecommunications tycoon Shaul Elovitch gave the premier favorable media coverage on his Walla website in exchange for regulatory favors, while Case 2000 relates to Netanyahu’s dealings with Yedioth Ahronoth publisher Noni Mozes.) In military terms, one would say that he’s surrounded.</p> \n<p>All the law enforcement agencies, both the ones that were slandered by Netanyahu and the ones that the tarnishing machine does not yet have in its sights, are falling in line. First it was the police, followed by Liat Ben-Ari, from the taxation and finance department of the State Prosecutor’s Office, who accompanied the police investigation, and now also the penultimate level – all are of one mind, at least with respect to the Bezeq-Walla-Elovitch case. This is a serious affair, one involving allegations of bribery, plain and simple. With regard to Case 1000, which centers around the legality of gifts received by Netanyahu from wealthy patrons, opinions are split. If Mendelblit is looking for an escape hatch for Netanyahu, he might latch on to these differences in opinion or interpretation in order to save him from a triple bribery indictment.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Netanyahu’s 61 partners in crime | Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;To survive three bribery cases, Netanyahu may push Israel's democracy to the brink&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;What's at stake for Netanyahu after police recommend bribery charges&nbsp;| Explained&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In light of these new developments one can say without a doubt that Netanyahu will be indicted. At least in one instance, Case 4000, he will most likely be accused of bribery – the gravest charge – as well as fraud and breach of trust. Nir Hefetz and Shlomo Filber, the two state witnesses who belonged to the most intimate circle surrounding Netanyahu, when he served as communications minister, have provided the incriminating evidence. Otherwise, the AG would never have approved signing such generous and lenient deals with them.</p> \n<p>There is also no doubt that the preliminary decision on an indictment, subject to a hearing, will be made in the first quarter of 2019, by March at the latest. Mendelblit knows the investigative material very well. No evidence or testimony he’s presented with can be expected to catch him unawares.</p> \n<p>This brings us to the political arena. The attorney general’s decision will be taken before any Knesset election. It could come in the midst of an election campaign. The grounds for the decision will be made public, and will include snippets from the testimony provided by Hefetz, Filber and the state witness in Cases 1000 and 2000, Ari Harow.</p> \n<p>The meaning of this is that Likud and its candidate for prime minister will be campaigning in 2019 under circumstances that are quite different than any experienced in the past. There are those who believe that the fact that Netanyahu will be in the position of a persecuted victim will only add votes to the party, or at least will not detract from its support. There are those who think otherwise.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s dilemma is this: Should the critical and fateful hearing be conducted while he is prime minister (and also defense minister), secure in his post while managing the country’s affairs, which his lawyers believe will help him – or should he risk a wide-open election campaign, with only God knowing how it will end.</p> \n<p>To be (prime minister during a hearing), or not to be, that is the question.</p> \n<p>The date of the next election will probably be set in a month, after time runs out on the extension granted by the High Court of Justice to the government for passing a new military conscription law. At the present, late January seems like the most likely date for the Knesset to be dissolved, which would mean an election in May or early June. Netanyahu could keep the coalition afloat in various ways even beyond that, perhaps until September 2019. Would that be good for him, or bad? One shouldn’t envy him.</p> \n<p>Pointless protest</p> \n<p>This week’s attack on Netanyahu by cabinet ministers Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked (Habayit Hayehudi) from both sides of the table was planned and coordinated in advance. It was a two-pronged ambush. Bennett, whose bruises from the fiasco of his fruitless resignation threat have still not yet healed, charged that the (at the time still) acting defense minister should have known about the breach in the fence around the West Bank settlement of Beit El, through which the terrorist who attacked and seriously injured a soldier penetrated the settlement.</p> \n<p>Bennett’s charge is about as valid as someone calling out the education minister for failing in his duties because he was unaware that a certain school was employing a teacher who in the past had been the subject of a criminal action on pedophilia charges.</p> \n<p>Shaked declared that she could not vote in favor of the prime minister’s appointment as defense minister, since Israel needs a full-time defense minister. She and Bennett abstained in the cabinet vote. But on the following day, they supported the appointment in the vote in the Knesset, after being compelled to do so by dint of coalition discipline.</p> \n<p>Such an evolution the two of them are undergoing. From a supposed threat to resign due to the immense damage done to state security because of Bennett’s non-appointment as defense minister, to pushing the button in the Knesset plenum in favor of Netanyahu’s appointment, with a side-trip along the way to stage a pointless act of protest.</p> \n<p>Their actions are not surprising. There is something about these two that is childish and immature. They would have done better to leave this entire ridiculous affair behind, not to mock, not to tease, not to be petty, but simply to be silent and cast a vote. They will not make any political hay by reviving traces of the earlier gaffe. On the contrary.</p> \n<p>Their sense of distress is understandable: They are seeking separation, separation, separation from Netanyahu. That is the objective. As for the means – there’s nothing to write home about.</p> \n<p>Prior to Sunday’s cabinet meeting, Bennett and Shaked took part in a demonstration held by the settlers on the hill across from the Knesset, in protest of “the government’s failure to act against terror.” Governmental norms in Israel have no parallel in any other country of the world. They are a blend of neighborhood, special-ed class and gang war.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t only the three Habayit Hayehudi ministers, Bennett, Shaked and Uri Ariel, who came to demonstrate against the government, and specifically against the defense minister responsible for all the helplessness: Four Likud ministers were also in attendance – Zeev Elkin, Yariv Levin, Haim Katz and Ofir Akunis – along with ministers Eli Cohen and Yoav Gallant from the Kulanu party. Nine ministers with a fuzzy sense of reality and an obsequious attitude toward the settlers, who applauded all of the slogans, clich&eacute;s and hollow statements that the speakers offered the crowd, from Cohen’s suggestion that the home of Abu Mazen (Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas) be demolished, to the regular mantra of Levin that if we would only abolish the High Court of Justice, security would be restored to the territories big-time.</p> \n<p>While Levin and Elkin can be associated with an ideology that would explain their presence there, when it comes to Akunis and Katz, ideology doesn’t enter the picture. For them, it’s just politics. The specter of primaries is what brought them to the stage. Afterward, they said that they just came to show their support for the bruised and battered settlers.</p> \n<p>Little big lies</p> \n<p>Last Thursday, just hours after the terror attack at the Givat Assaf junction in the West Bank, and a few days after the attack across from the settlement of Ofra, opposition leader Tzipi Livni asked the coordinator of the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee to urgently convene its Subcommittee for Intelligence and Secret Services. She felt members of that panel ought to be updated on the situation in the territories by relevant parties in the Shin Bet security agency and the Israel Defense Forces. The subcommittee is known to be hermetically sealed: Its members receive briefings on the most sensitive information, and nothing leaks out.</p> \n<p>A few hours later, Livni received an invitation – not to a closed-door session but to what promised to be a total circus: a session of the full committee to be held in Ofra, in two parts. The first part would take place in camera, in the presence of IDF representatives; and the second part in public, along with the heads of regional councils in Judea and Samaria.</p> \n<p>The committee is chaired by Avi Dichter (Likud), who will find himself running in his party primary. Last time around, he barely held on to the 26th place on the slate. Regional council heads in the West Bank wield much influence among the Likud electorate, and as we know, a little currying of favor never hurt anyone. Those invited to the Ofra event would surely be thankful to him for the platform they were given, even if it would come at the expense of the forum’s self-respect.</p> \n<p>In the meeting’s public part, in front of the cameras, it was the turn of the opposition chairwoman to speak. Livni long ago ceased to grovel before the settlers. “You have an ideology, and that is legitimate,” she said to those present. “I want separation from the Palestinians; you want annexation. Okay. But don’t pretend that construction and annexation contribute to security. They harm security. What you are demanding is implementation of your political agenda.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, the circus was not long in coming. Yossi Dagan, chairman of the Samaria Regional Council and the most self-righteous and loudest of the bunch, attacked Livni, screaming: “Why do you hate us? Why do you patronize us? We buried a resident, a 3-day-old baby. We expected that when you came here, you would express your condolences and help us obtain greater security for the settlements.”</p> \n<p>Livni was not fazed by Dagan’s show of righteous indignation. “The baby you buried may be your resident, but he is the citizen of all of us. Your pain is my pain. But this is a political argument, and I will not pretend that it has to do with security. Those that decide on the security steps we take are the cabinet, the IDF and the Shin Bet – not you. Construction [of settlements] is not an answer to terror. There have been mass terror attacks in Tel Aviv, but you didn’t see me demonstrating and demanding to build in Tel Aviv.”</p> \n<p>“They’re lying, lying, lying,” she told me this week. “They know the same as we do that the attackers are coming from Hamas. They know that the Palestinian Authority is fighting them, and cooperating with the IDF and the Shin Bet in attempting to prevent terror attacks. But from the settlers you hear nothing but Abu Mazen and Abu Mazen, and construction, construction, construction, construction. Under the cover of [fighting] terror, they are pushing their agenda. I do not accept it.”</p> \n<p>I asked Livni if she doesn’t think she is carrying on a rearguard battle. After all, she and her colleagues are specialists in waging lost battles.</p> \n<p>“I am expressing my opinion, and in this instance it is also the position of the defense establishment. My guess is that it is also the position of the prime minister,” she replied. “What needs to be done now is to calm tensions, not fan the flames and ignite the surroundings. What is truly dangerous is the ‘price-tag’ atmosphere in the territories. More and more construction just means augmenting the friction. Why hasn’t Netanyahu built up until now? Because he gets it. I hear him in closed forums. But he feels politically weak in the face of the extreme right. I am very worried by what his weakness vis-a-vis [Habayit Hayehudi MK Bezalel] Smotrich and Bennett could lead to with Netanyahu as defense minister.”</p> \n<p>As security chief, I told her, Netanyahu acts deliberately and cautiously. He is not someone who is happy to go to war, and he’s even prepared to pay the political price for that with his electorate. On these matters you can trust him.</p> \n<p>“That’s correct,” Livni admitted. “Bibi will not go out and start a war. In that respect, he is responsible. But he is incapable of being less right-wing than Habayit Hayehudi. And they are pushing to build and to authorize the unlawful, and to evict families of terrorists, and he caves in to them. I’ll say it again, it isn’t him. I’ve spent hundreds of hours with him [as justice minister in an earlier Netanyahu government, in which she was responsible for diplomatic negotiations] – his actual positions are different.”</p> \n<p>Groaning hilltops</p> \n<p>An atmosphere of anarchy pervaded the Knesset this week. Two legislative bills were passed in preliminary votes, over both of which waved black flags of illegality and recklessness. The two MKs who introduced the bills – one that called for the deportation of families of terrorists, and the other for the “whitewashing” of unlawful settlement outposts – are the most extreme members of the Habayit Hayehudi faction: Smotrich and Moti Yogev.</p> \n<p>In any normal parliament, these two would be spending their entire terms on the back benches of the plenary chamber or some other far-off corner where they could vanish from the public eye. But here, in the Netanyahu coalition, they are overseeing the passage of laws that could have strategic significance and dramatic security, legal, judicial and international – not to mention even that foul word, moral – implications.</p> \n<p>Yogev and Smotrich are the tails that wag the dog that is the coalition and the prime minister. They seek – and succeed – to impose on the government of Israel the same standards that are practiced on the hilltops of the West Bank. That is where the sheep of their flock are inciting and striking, uprooting and imposing terror. The Netanyahu coalition that voted in favor of both the deportation law and the second version of the land-expropriation law, despite the legal opinion of the attorney general and the opposition of the defense establishment, is the governmental reflection of the hilltop bullies. The location of the government campus, in the part of Jerusalem known as Givat Ram (Hebrew for “High Hill”), is taking on new meaning.</p> \n<p>On Thursday morning, Attorney General Mendelblit appeared at the Israel Business Conference, sponsored by the financial newspaper Globes. He railed against politicians who take pride of the fact that they are pushing through legislation that runs counter to his legal opinion, which is binding. “They are acting against the law and against the rule of law, which are the basis of our democracy,” he said.</p> \n<p>Mendelblit is careful not to go too far and say that given such turbid currents, one might have expected that the prime minister and perhaps also the justice minister would be pounding on the table and dumping these abominations of bills into the trash can. But that’s not his style. There was a time that Netanyahu would have stopped such initiatives in the embryonic stage, and openly criticized them. That was the old Bibi, he of his two previous terms, between 2009 and 2015. Today he is like a fallen leaf.</p> \n<p>“It is amazing to me,” one of Netanyahu’s ministers said to me this week, “that he permits these bills to pass. Because each of these bills is equivalent to a war crime, according to international law. Isn’t he afraid of receiving a summons to The Hague?”</p> \n<p>Joining the hopeless festival of nationalism and security-fixation this week was the Yesh Atid faction. At the directive of party chair Yair Lapid, all of its members voted in favor of the law to deport terrorists’ family members.</p> \n<p>One can’t expect much from Likud and Habayit Hayehudi or from the ultra-Orthodox parties. From Kulanu, maybe a little. From Yesh Atid and its half-baked pretensions, however, one might have expected that it would not support a piece of legislation that the attorney general had explicitly deemed unconstitutional – one that the Shin Bet chief and the IDF chief of staff had also cautioned against because its consequences are liable to be disastrous, and which, in an earlier form, had been disqualified by a special panel of nine Supreme Court justices some time ago.</p> \n<p>Smotrich and Yogev operate on the basis of a messianic religious ideology. They don’t profess to be something other than what they are. They welcome every step, every law, every directive that promotes even by a single centimeter the annexation of the territories and the transformation of the State of Israel into an apartheid state. By dint of what explanation does Lapid instruct his party to support a bill, other than out of his own bloated ego, his standard nonsensical claim that when it comes to matters of security, he is “more right than Netanyahu,” and his pitiful attempts to confer upon himself the mantle of security maven simply because he was a member of the security cabinet member for a year and three quarters?</p> \n<p>Here is my guess: If in the recent polls Yesh Atid had not lost the support of the equivalent of five Knesset seats to the hypothetical political party of Lt. Gen. (res.) Benny Gantz, Lapid would not have backed this legislation.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Hospitals significantly improved their performance of several critical procedures last year, according to an annual Health Ministry report.</p> \n<p>The report, which has measured various performance indicators for the last five years, will be published later this month. Haaretz has obtained the data on five of the most important indicators, including response times to heart attacks and strokes and operations to repair hip fractures.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Heart attacks are the second-biggest cause of death in Israel (after cancer), and some 4,000 urgent catheterizations are performed every year to save patients. Medical literature shows that death rates drop significantly if catheterization is performed within 90 minutes of a patient’s arrival.</p> \n<p>When the ministry began measuring performance indicators in 2013, only 68 percent of catheterizations were performed within this time frame. Last year the number was recorded at 91 percent. Ichilov in Tel Aviv was reported as having the fast time-frame, followed by Bnei Zion in Haifa and Assaf Harofeh in Tzrifin. in Netanya, Meir in Kfar Sava and Sheba in Tel Hashomer were reported as having the slowest response times.</p> \n<p>Strokes are Israel’s fourth-biggest cause of death and leading cause of disability. Best professional practice calls for an MRI or CT to be performed within 25 minutes of the patient’s arrival to determine whether the problem is internal bleeding or a blood clot, and for a diagnosis to be made within 45 minutes.</p> \n<p>In 2015, when the ministry first added this indicator, the average wait for an MRI or CT was 55 minutes, and in some hospitals, it was 90 minutes or more. But last year, the average fell to 33 minutes. The best performing hospitals, by which all MRIs and CTs were performed under 25 minutes, were Hadassah Ein Karem in Jerusalem, Western Galilee in Nahariya and Ziv in Safed. The worst were Yoseftal in Eilat, Haemek in Afula and Wolfson in Holon.</p> \n<p>A transient ischemic attack (TIA), is a minor stroke, but those who have one are left at greater risk of a having a major stroke in the near future. The ministry recommends that a Doppler ultrasound of the carotid artery be performed within 72 hours of the patient’s arrival to monitor his blood flow.</p> \n<p>In 2015, when the ministry introduced this indicator, only 58 percent of these tests were performed within this time. But last year, the rate rose to 78 percent. The best performers (90 percent or more) were Hadassah Ein Karem in Jerusalem, Rambam in Haifa and Western Galilee. The worst were Bnei Brak’s Mayanei Hayeshua, Holon’s Wolfson and Beilinson in Petah Tikva.</p> \n<p>For people who have a major stroke, a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), and brain catheterization can prove beneficial. Both increase blood flow to the affected region and thereby reduce brain damage. A TPA should be done within four and a half hours of the first signs of stroke and a brain catheterization within eight hours.</p> \n<p>Last year, 1,393 patients received appropriate treatment within the proper time frame, up from 857 in 2015.</p> \n<p>Hip fractures are common among the elderly, and while they not only substantially reduce quality of life, they often lead to further health complications. An operation within 48 hours of a patient’s arrival can significantly improve outcomes – though there are cases where operating isn’t the preferred treatment. The ministry’s target was for 85 percent of patients to be operated on within the 48 hours time frame.</p> \n<p>In 2013, only 71 percent of patients underwent a timely operation. But in 2017, the rate rose to 86 percent. The hospitals closest to the ministry’s target were Haifa’s Rambam, Soroka in Be’er Sheva, Hillel Yaffeh in Hadera and Holon’s Wolfson. The lowest rates were at Netanya’s Laniado and Afula’s Haemek, and three hospitals had rates in the high nineties – Kaplan in Rehovot, Nazareth’s Scottish Hospital and Kfar Sava’s Meir.</p>",

Taher Khalef, a Jordanian citizen who was employed as a construction worker at the port, attacked two Israelis with a hammer three weeks ago, leaving both of them in moderate condition.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors called it a terrorist attack in the indictment filed in Be’er Sheva District Court, and claimed Khalef has been planning to attack Israelis for over a decade. He managed to get past Israeli security forces who conduct background checks of Jordanians before granting them entry permits to Israel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;As attacks rise, Abbas' weakness and Israeli elections talk may hurt war on terror | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Khalef was indicted on a number of counts of attempted murder, conspiracy to commit a terrorist act and other crimes related to terrorism. His lawyer denied that the attack was an act of terrorism, saying it was a criminal offense stemming from a disagreement between coworkers.</p> \n<p>According to the indictment, Khalef received a daily work permit in November and then planned to carry out an attack. On November 29 he entered Israel and worked in the port of Eilat for the first time, returning to Jordan that night. Upon returning home he told cousins of his plans to carry out a terrorist attack against Jews and asked them to film a video clip of him. Khalef also informed his family &nbsp;of his plan and made a will. He spoke in praise of jihad, ending with a line from the Koran saying that those who die as a martyr for Allah are not considered dead but are alive with God. Khalef was unsuccessful in his attempt to obtain a gun, but decided to use a hammer instead in the attack.</p> \n<p>The next day, his second day working in Israel, Khalef carried out the attack. He chose two divers, the only two Jews working in the area where he was and decided to murder them, prosecutors say. Another Jordanian worker tried to stop Khalef, but he told him: “We’re Muslims and they are Jews.”</p> \n<p>Prosecutors say Khalef views himself as a Palestinian, growing up in a nationalistic home and viewing jihad as an important act.</p> \n<p>In June 2014, the Israeli government approved the entry of up to 1,500 Jordanian workers for the hotel industry in Eilat.

Peskov also said the Kremlin needed to watch whether the withdrawal would actually happen as a previous U.S. pledge to leave Afghanistan had not translated into action.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Afghan officials and America's Western partners also reacted with unease to reports that the U.S. planned to withdraw more than 5,000 of its 14,000 troops from Afghanistan.</p> \n<p>Although there has been increasing acceptance in Kabul that Trump was impatient for progress in ending the 17-year war, comment from a U.S. official that he was planning to withdraw at least 5,000 troops, coupled with the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, came as a surprise.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Mattis has been widely seen in Afghanistan as a guarantor of U.S. engagement, and his departure would inevitability raise worries in the minds of many Afghan officials.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The news followed a two-day meeting in Abu Dhabi between U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives at which the two sides discussed the withdrawal of international forces and a ceasefire in 2019.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, with the plans still unconfirmed and further meetings expected in Saudi Arabia in early January, it was unclear whether a ceasefire was close and whether the news heralded a wider settlement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;The withdrawal will certainly affect overall operations but we will have to wait and see which units are going to go home first.

It is seen as an unraveling of Trump’s relatively restrained national security policies and as a harbinger of potentially dangerous instability in the months to come.</p> \n<p>But the shock waves may be reverberating loudest in Israel, which has staked its entire national security policy on Trump’s friendship and is one of a handful of countries in which the U.S. president was widely admired. The upheaval in Washington threatens to undermine the Israeli public’s trust in the American leader and, by extension, to undercut political support for Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump’s foremost advocate and defender.</p> \n<p>The official reaction in Jerusalem to the&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;pullout has been generally muted so far. Netanyahu and his ministers have struck to the refrain “We will know how to defend ourselves” without commenting directly on the ramifications of Trump’s abrupt decision. Private briefings to journalists have exposed a sharp split, however, between the political and defense establishments: The former have tried to diminish the impact of the U.S. withdrawal on Israeli security, while the latter have described it as an unmitigated disaster.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump and Obama may be complete opposites — but their Syria policies are nearly identical | Analysis ■&nbsp;Donald Trump's big lie on Syria will come back to haunt America | Opinion</p> \n<p>Mattis’ resignation, amplified by his unusually frank and critical letter of resignation, is likely to further exacerbate the apprehensions of Israeli generals and security officials. As in much of the Western world, the former commander of NATO and U.S. Central Command was seen as the last responsible adult in Trump’s inner circle and as someone who spoke the same pragmatic lingua franca as most Israeli officers. Senior officials dismayed by Netanyahu’s unchecked embrace of the U.S. president were consoled by the presence of old and trusted hands such as Mattis, outgoing Chief of Staff John Kelly and even former National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster in Trump’s inner circle. With Mattis’ departure, all three are gone.</p> \n<p>And while the Israeli public has hitherto ignored Trump’s questionable handling of relations with NATO, Russia and North Korea – never mind his legal entanglements and nationalistic incitement - the withdrawal of troops from Syria hits far closer to home. Netanyahu’s description of Trump as the best friend that Israel has ever had in the White House does not square with his unilateral retreat from Syria, which is widely seen as abandoning Israel to fend for itself against Russia and Iran. It raises suspicions, hitherto brushed off as well, that Trump is, as his critics have alleged, a stooge of Russian President&nbsp;Vladimir Putin.</p> \n<p>The Syrian disappointment may not have much of an impact on right wing ideologues and religious-Zionist messianics, whose only concern is the perpetuation of Israeli control of Judea and Samaria and the concurrent sidelining of the Palestinians. But for a large and rational chunk of Israeli public opinion, convinced by Netanyahu that Trump has Israel’s back, the U.S. withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan, along with Mattis’ resignation, provides a nasty wake up call. With friends like Trump, some may wonder, who needs Barack Obama?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syria pullout: Israel left with false Russian promises and a volatile U.S. president&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>It was an improbable fantasy from the outset. The thought that Donald Trump could be a pugnacious, ignorant, erratic, shoot-from-the-hip president everywhere else but a steady, rational and determined statesman in the Middle East, as Netanyahu has portrayed him, was nothing less than delusional. The past 48 hours have made it clear there is only one Trump, not two, and that he can be just as disruptive to Israel’s national security interests as he’s been to U.S. relations with its other close allies, from Canada and Mexico through France and Germany to NATO and the WTO.</p> \n<p>The realization by Israel’s rational right and center-right that it may have been living in a fool’s paradise could prove most damaging, perhaps even fatal, for Netanyahu’s political prospects. His prestige as Israel’s ultimate Mr. Security has already been tarnished in recent months by his restraint in Gaza, by the constriction of Israel’s freedom of action over Syria after the September downing of a Russian spy plane over Syria and, among the cognoscenti, by the potential collapse of his gamble on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the wake of the murder of dissident Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The reliance on the alliance with Trump, however, was the most crucial of Netanyahu’s credentials, his jewel in the crown. It proved him wiser, supposedly, than critics who had bemoaned his belligerent attitude to Obama and warned of dire days to come.</p> \n<p>The timing of the disruption in the Trump administration could not have been worse, as far as Netanyahu is concerned. With elections looming in eleven months at the very latest, but probably sooner, Netanyahu’s image as Israel’s ultimate maven in foreign affairs and defense matters was supposed to offset his mounting legal problems and the growing public disgruntlement over Israel’s high cost of living. If Trump will now be seen as a fair weather friend whose administration is going off the rails, Netanyahu’s main claim to fame will be eroded, if not demolished completely.</p> \n<p>When Barack Obama repeatedly declared that the U.S. is not the world’s policeman, it was taken in Israel as further proof of the liberal president’s ill-advised view of the world and malevolent attitude towards Israel. When Trump says the same thing, the isolationist statement supposedly flies in the face of everything Israelis have come to expect from the president. They may have heard of Trump’s America First credo, but convinced themselves that Israel would always be the exception that proves the rule.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu often boasts that with Trump’s backing, Israel is stronger than ever, militarily as well as diplomatically. After the Syria pullout, Mattis’ departure and the ensuing prospects of a rogue Trump presidency, Israel suddenly seems weaker and potentially more isolated than ever before.</p>",

She was said to be recovering well the following day.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ginsburg, who made her name as an advocate for women's rights, is one of four liberals sitting on the court, to which she was appointed in 1993 by then President Bill Clinton.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The court's 5-4 conservative majority was restored last month when the Senate confirmed U.S. President&nbsp;Donald Trump's appointee Brett Kavanaugh after&nbsp;a contentious nomination process, in which Kavanaugh denied a sexual assault allegation from his youth.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If Ginsburg were unable to continue serving, Trump could replace her with a conservative, further shifting the court to the right.

She has bounced back from previous medical issues and has fallen twice before at her home, in 2012 and 2013, leading to rib injuries.

Indiscriminately – men, women and children. Not that this would help, but a few bodies would put the gleam back in their eyes. They’d be happy to get up one morning and see that the Arabs have disappeared, that this headache is gone. That we were left here alone with Yair Netanyahu, Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>But we aren’t here alone. They are still here. Too many to kill, to put in detention camps, or load onto trucks. Perhaps they cannot be killed, but we can make their lives miserable. How would you feel about someone who was trying to make your life miserable, keeping you off the roads, crowding you into endless queues and judging you in ridiculous trials? You would think that person has a very high opinion of himself, that he thinks he should be the ruler and you the slave. That he is supreme and you are garbage.</p> \n<p>What would you do to someone who thinks that you’re garbage? After all, you wouldn’t kill civilians, including women and children. Ah, and not their soldiers either, right? One second, did I hear someone say that it’s permitted to kill soldiers? To kill the children of all of us? Okay, I knew that couldn’t be right. So without killing and without marches to the border fence and without protests to the United Nations, okay? Deal?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Shooting at soldiers of occupation is legitimate | Opinion</p> \n<p>And what would you do if the one making your life miserable would also be demanding that you sit with them to negotiate? He wouldn’t be coming just to talk, he would be coming with conditions. The first condition is that you agree that he could build settlements as if there were no negotiations, and that you continue with negotiations as if he isn’t building anything. The second condition is that the negotiations continue indefinitely. For how long? Oh, a thousand, two thousand years or so.</p> \n<p>And so that you shouldn’t come to him later with complaints, he tells you in advance that in the end you won’t get anything. Yup, you heard right – nothing. It’s not because he doesn’t want to, but because of things that you’ll never understand, like coalitions, the Gerrer Rebbe, things like that.</p> \n<p>So what would you do if you were in their place? You, the liberals, left-wingers and peace lovers? Obviously you’re a little embarrassed; you’re embarrassed because you’re also a little involved. That’s true, you say. We’re partners to this, but silent ones, Shimon Peres-style.</p> \n<p>Are you dreaming, as Peres did, that an “economic horizon” will calm them? Perhaps a “new Middle East?” One that would give them such good lives that they won’t even think about terror attacks? You’ll offer them a partnership – you’ll bring the technology and they’ll be the hired hands! You’ll give them internet and they’ll pay you back with cleaning services! Give them a horizon and it will all work out.</p> \n<p>But it won’t work out. They don’t want you or your horizon. So what the hell do those bastards want? They want independence and sovereignty. They want to separate from you and your technology. But go and explain to them that it’s impossible to separate; it’s impossible because of Bennett, because of Case 3000 and because of Sara. Because Sara isn’t particularly fond of Naftali and can’t stand Ayelet, and because you don’t know yet what it’s like to sit with Yaakov Litzman.</p> \n<p>So there would be no point in talking, and the only option left to you would be terror attacks. It sounds bad – pretty hopeless, actually – but who’s talking about hope, as if we have hoped? Gideon Sa’ar is hope? Yisrael Katz? Ayelet Shaked? So, please calm down. Hope isn’t part of the deal. If you want to take out your anger caused by checkpoints and the shooting at children, then put on yellow vests and demonstrate against higher prices for electricity, cheese and Bamba.</p> \n<p>“What would you do in their place?” is not a theoretical question, because it almost happened to us. We were almost there. Almost, because the British Mandate wasn’t like the Israeli occupation, because the British were not Israelis, because the English built infrastructure for a state, education, administration and transportation here, and didn’t think they were doing anyone a favor.</p> \n<p>And how did we respond? Were we grateful? Did we beg them to stay? No. We wanted them out of here as soon as possible with all their horizons. We wanted independence and sovereignty. We shot them, hanged them, and blew them up. If they had had women and children here, we would have killed them, too.</p> \n<p>Fine, but we were “fighting the foreign occupier,” and the Palestinians are “murderers of innocents.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved increasing the 2019 budget for a plan to fight domestic violence on Wednesday, raising it from 30 million shekels ($8 million) to 50 million shekels (about $13.2 million). This sum is part of the 250 million shekels planned for fighting domestic violence over the next five years.</p> \n<p>Much of the additional money – about 14 million shekels of the 20 million – will go mostly to treating abusive and violent men. The 2018 budget for combating domestic violence was 12 million shekels (approximately $3 million). It is still not clear where the additional funds will be coming from, but it seems most likely that it will come from an across-the-board cut in all government ministries.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu heads the ministerial committee on dealing with domestic violence, and over the next few weeks, his staff will examine additional funding for the Public Security Ministry and police on the issue.</p> \n<p>The additional money will be used to establish four new emergency centers for victims of domestic violence and another transitional housing center for female asylum seekers who suffer from domestic violence, at a cost of 5 million shekels. About 60 social workers who specialize in treating violent men will be funded at a cost of 10 million shekels, and a day treatment center for such men will be established at a cost of 1 million shekels – along with centers for housing and treating these men, at a cost of 2 million shekels.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Criminal neglect: The Israeli government is complicit in the murder of Arab women | Analysis</p> \n<p>The committee on domestic violence was also presented with a survey of the cases in which abusive men received lenient punishments. Netanyahu asked for a study comparing the punishment and rehabilitation of abusive men in western countries within the next two weeks.</p> \n<p>Social Equality Minister Gila Gamliel presented a plan on Wednesday for dealing with domestic violence in Israel's Arab community, at a cost of 295 million shekels over two years. But the plan for dealing with domestic violence for all of Israel, at a cost of 250 million shekels over five years, has not yet been funded in full. The budgetary shortage for dealing with the issue was one of the major causes of the recent protests against domestic violence. Some of the money for the plan for Arab women will come from the funding intended for the national plan, said sources close to Gamliel.</p> \n<p>Gamliel formulated her plan at Netanyahu’s request, in light of the large number of cases of violence against women in the Arab community. The plan still requires approval from the ministerial committee and funding from the Finance Ministry. Her ministry will be in charge of implementing the plan, said Gamliel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The additional funding, for 2019 and 2020, would go toward removing abusive husbands from their homes to hostels for rehabilitation; opening two new hostels for Arab women suffering from domestic violence (only two such facilities are in operation today); hiring more female Arab investigators and police officers; issuing restraining orders against abusive men; establishing a council of religious and spiritual leaders – half men and half women – to write and issue Islamic religious rulings (fatwas) forbidding violence against women; a public relations campaign in mosques on the issue; and preparing a curriculum for the matriculation exams on gender equality specifically for the Arab community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The organizers of the women’s protest called the additional budget “an enormous achievement for civil protest. We have proved that together we have power. After hundreds of thousands of women and men proved that the issue must remain on the agenda – we have succeeded in achieving real and important results that will affect the lives of women in this country. This is further proof that the struggle has succeeded.”</p> \n<p>The organizers said that now they will continue to ensure that the budgets that are supposed to be allocated over five years will arrive, and they are demanding that the funding be set in law.</p>",

The NSC then set up the call.</p> \n<p>Pompeo, Mattis and other members of the national security team prepared a list of talking points for Trump to tell Erdogan to back off, the officials said.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump and Obama may be complete opposites — but their Syria policies are nearly identical&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Donald Trump's big lie on Syria will come back to haunt America&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>In the following days, Trump remained unmoved by those scrambling to convince him to reverse or at least delay the decision to give the military and Kurdish forces time to prepare for an orderly withdrawal.</p> \n<p>“The talking points were very firm,” said one of the officials, explaining that Trump was advised to clearly oppose a Turkish incursion into northern Syria and suggest the U.S. and Turkey work together to address security concerns. “Everybody said push back and try to offer (Turkey) something that’s a small win, possibly holding territory on the border, something like that.”</p> \n<p>Erdogan, though, quickly put Trump on the defensive, reminding him that he had repeatedly said the only reason for U.S. troops to be in Syria was to defeat the Islamic State and that the group had been 99 percent defeated. “Why are you still there?” the second official said Erdogan asked Trump, telling him that the Turks could deal with the remaining IS militants.</p> \n<p>With Erdogan on the line, Trump asked national security adviser John Bolton, who was listening in, why American troops remained in Syria if what the Turkish president was saying was true, according to the officials. Erdogan’s point, Bolton was forced to admit, had been backed up by Mattis, Pompeo, U.S. special envoy for Syria Jim Jeffrey and special envoy for the anti-ISIS coalition Brett McGurk, who have said that ISIS retains only 1 percent of its territory, the officials said.</p> \n<p>Bolton stressed, however, that the entire national security team agreed that victory over ISIS had to be enduring, which means more than taking away its territory.</p> \n<p>Trump was not dissuaded, according to the officials, who said the president quickly capitulated by pledging to withdraw, shocking both Bolton and Erdogan.</p> \n<p>Caught off guard, Erdogan cautioned Trump against a hasty withdrawal, according to one official. While Turkey has made incursions into Syria in the past, it does not have the necessary forces mobilized on the border to move in and hold the large swaths of northeastern Syria where U.S. troops are positioned, the official said.</p> \n<p>The call ended with Trump repeating to Erdogan that the U.S. would pull out, but offering no specifics on how it would be done, the officials said.</p> \n<p>Over the weekend, the national security team raced to come up with a plan that would reverse, delay or somehow limit effects of the withdrawal, the officials said.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Bolton, Mattis and Pompeo met at the White House to try to plot a middle course. But they were told by outgoing chief of staff John Kelly and his soon-to-be successor Mick Mulvaney that Trump was determined to pull out and was not to be delayed or denied, according to the officials. The trio met again on Tuesday morning to try to salvage things, but were again rebuffed, the officials said.</p> \n<p>The White House had wanted to announce the decision on Tuesday — and press secretary Sarah Sanders scheduled a rare briefing specifically to announce it. But the Pentagon convinced Trump to hold off because the withdrawal plans weren’t complete and allies and Congress had not yet been notified, according to the officials. The first country aside from Turkey to be told of the impending pull-out was Israel, the officials said.</p> \n<p>Word of the imminent withdrawal began to seep out early Wednesday after U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Joseph Votel started to inform his commanders on the ground and the Kurds of the decision.</p> \n<p>Following the official announcement the White House emphasized that the U.S. will continue to support the fight against ISIS and remains ready to “re-engage” when needed. But in a tweet, the president said U.S. troops would no longer be fighting IS on behalf of others.</p> \n<p>“Time to focus on our Country &amp; bring our youth back home where they belong!”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The resignation of U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis reflects turmoil that is exceptional even in the roller coaster ride known as the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>Mattis was seen, including by his many acquaintances in Israel’s defense establishment, as an island of sanity and stability in that roiling sea. Midway through the term, Donald Trump’s administration mirrors the president: capricious, struggling to weigh complex considerations and as a result unpredictable and dangerous to himself and his surroundings.</p> \n<p>The resignation letter, a little over a page long, that Mattis sent to the president is instructive. In it, Mattis clarifies to Trump, as one would explain to a slow child, the principles that have guided U.S. policy in recent decades: The American duty to advance a democratic international order, its important allies and its strategic opponents (China and Russia).</p> \n<p>Mattis concludes: You have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned with yours. The letter contains not a single kind word for the man who appointed him and it’s hard to believe that it was due to a sudden loss of good manners on the part of Mattis.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump’s Syria withdrawal and Mattis’ resignation startle Israel – and undercut Netanyahu&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;How Trump told Erdogan U.S. was leaving Syria&nbsp;■&nbsp;Will Turkey crush Syrian Kurds' secular utopia?&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israel left with false Russian promises, a volatile Trump</p> \n<p>The immediate catalyst for Mattis’ resignation was Trump’s decision, issued Wednesday, to withdraw American troops from Syria, followed by the announcement of a drawdown of forces in Afghanistan. In both cases, the president is returning to his campaign promises and isolationist messages from more than two years ago.</p> \n<p>The more Trump frees himself of his fear of his advisers — and the advisers themselves — the more he follows the instincts he so prides himself on.</p> \n<p>Those instincts suit the suspicions of some of his supporters, to whom the U.S. pretension to serve as the world’s policeman (especially in the days of presidents Clinton and Bush; to a lesser degree in the days of Obama, as well) was a dangerous and unnecessary waste of money.</p> \n<p>The decision to pull out of Syria probably had more immediate political reasons. The investigations of the president are advancing. Next month an adversarial U.S. House of Representatives will be sworn in, making it more difficult for Trump to effect changes in domestic policy. He needed a quick move to distract and satisfy his base.</p> \n<p>But it’s clear they are the only ones who will be pleased. A brief appearance before the press, in which Trump announced that the Islamic State organization was defeated, pointed to the sky and declared that the soldiers who died in battle would be pleased to hear the news of the retreat from Syria, raised many concerns.</p> \n<p>Even more worrisome was a detailed report by The Associated Press, according to which Trump decided to pull out of Syria after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told him during a telephone conversation that the Islamic State militants had been removed from 99 percent of the territory they had held.</p> \n<p>U.S. media outlets have named nearly 40 top administration officials who have resigned since Trump’s January 2017 inauguration, an unprecedented figure. Without Mattis, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, it seems the president will lose the remainder of the checks and balances that kept him in line.</p> \n<p>Trump has expressed doubts in the past concerning America’s membership in NATO and military presence in South Korea and Japan. In the next two years, there may be new surprises.</p> \n<p>Russia realizes its star has risen</p> \n<p>Close to Israel, the withdrawal from Syria and Mattis’ resignation signal a weakening of U.S. influence in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>They also render somewhat ridiculous the flattery Israeli politicians and media personalities showered on Trump after his retaliatory attack in Syria, withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran and relocation of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>“Instead of putting an emphasis with the Americans on Syria, we insisted on the embassy move,” a former head of Israel’s National Security Council said Thursday.</p> \n<p>“God only knows what how we benefited from that move,” Maj. Gen. (ret.) Giora Eiland said in an interview Israel’s 103 FM radio station.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Russia understands more clearly now that its position in the Middle East has improved. The Americans will not be quick to confront it in regard to Syria in the future. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was right to cultivate ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the start of Moscow’s military intervention in Syria, in September 2015. Those ties have since brought Israel considerable advantages.</p> \n<p>Still, it was unrealistic to think Netanyahu could manipulate the superpowers to his will. Only his foolish admirers believed that. For Trump, the personal interest (which he may perceive as the American interest) is growing now. Putin might even allow a limited confrontation between Israel and Iran in Syria, as long as that strengthens Russia’s position as the only possible mediator between the two parties and does not pose an immediate danger to Putin’s main project in the region — preserving Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime.</p> \n<p>The number of U.S. troops in Syria was relatively small, at 2,000, and recently it was reported that the administration sought to double that amount. But Trump also announced the end of the campaign against the Islamic State. That presumably means an end to air attacks in Syria — and, even more important for Israel, a retreat from the American enclave surrounding al-Tanf, near the Syrian border with Iraq and Jordan, frees the obstruction to Iranian traffic along the inland corridor between Tehran and Beirut.</p> \n<p>If Syria indeed becomes the playing field of a single superpower, this is a worrying turnaround for Jerusalem. Putin is far from being an Israel-sympathizing mediator, and Tehran might interpret the U.S. pullout and Mattis’ resignation as encouraging developments that will increase its freedom to act in the area. Indirectly, even if Moscow doesn’t wish for it, the danger of war in the north could increase in 2019.</p> \n<p>The danger does not stop there. Any comparison between Trump and Netanyahu is flawed; the prime minister is far more experienced, responsible and cautious than the U.S. president on security issues. But 2019 is an election year for Israel; before or during the campaign, the fate of the criminal investigations against Netanyahu will be decided.</p> \n<p>Against the backdrop of a pending election and the disintegrating government coalition, Israel’s moves against Palestinians — from the demolition of terrorists’ homes to dangerous draft laws allowing the displacement of their families — are becoming more extreme. While Netanyahu is staving off a military confrontation with Hamas in the Gaza Strip as best he can, the Israeli measures in the West Bank could eventually set off unrest in parts that are under the control of the Palestinian Authority, which continues reluctantly to maintain security coordination with Israel.</p>",

He and a few dozen other adventure travelers seeking to visit every country in the world checked the desert kingdom off their list this weekend.</p> \n<p>“Saudi Arabia’s always been an exotic place ... and I didn’t think I’d ever be able to come here,” he said as circus performers entertained guests in between races.</p> \n<p>Some 1,000 foreigners from 80 countries received the new “sharek” visa, which is linked to a specific entertainment event, the authorities said.</p> \n<p>That is a fraction of what they eventually hope to attract.</p> \n<p>“Hopefully we will learn from this and see what we need to do for the future, but I can tell you from now that there is a lot of demand,” said Prince Abdulaziz Bin Turki Al Faisal Al Saud, vice chairman of the General Sports Authority.</p> \n<p>Whizzing electric race cars wound through the ruins of Diriyah, the capital of the first Saudi state built by the ruling Al Saud family three centuries ago.</p> \n<p>The UNESCO world heritage site is undergoing a multimillion dollar renovation, celebrating a telling of national history that puts the dynasty and its clerical allies front and center.</p> \n<p>Plans to admit significant numbers of tourists from abroad have been discussed for years, only to be blocked by conservative opinion and bureaucracy.</p> \n<p>Now the crown prince is seeking to develop new industries to wean the world’s top oil exporter off petrodollars.</p> \n<p>Tourism is high on the agenda, despite a shortage of infrastructure.

        "text":["<p>Saudi Arabia is slowing a drive to cut its huge fiscal deficit in order to revive the economy, but the state budget plan for 2019 suggests it may not have room to boost growth by much.</p> \n<p>With unemployment among Saudis at a record 12.9%, creating jobs is becoming increasingly important to justify reforms launched over two years ago by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who aims to diversify the economy beyond oil exports.</p> \n<p>The 2019 budget, released last week, reflected that. It promised a 7% increase in spending, which officials said would lift growth in the non-oil part of the economy and start bringing down unemployment from next year.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;OPEC: The monster that never was&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Under Saudi threat, Qatar ramps up major air and sea power buildup</p> \n<p>But even that moderate rise in spending will come at a major cost, the budget plan showed: a dramatic reduction in the pace at which Riyadh shrinks the deficit, which it has pledged to eliminate entirely by 2023.</p> \n<p>For three years — ever since Riyadh ran an eye-popping deficit of 367 billion riyals ($98 billion) in 2015, or about 15% of gross domestic product, threatening its financial stability — fiscal policy focused to a large extent on reassuring markets by cutting the deficit.</p> \n<p>The Finance Ministry said last week the deficit shrank to 136 billion riyals, or an estimated 4.6% of GDP this year, from 230 billion riyals in 2017.</p> \n<p>The 2019 budget, however, projected that the deficit would shrink only marginally to 131 billion riyals, or 4.2% of GDP, next year. Many private analysts said the budget’s spending and revenue numbers implied that the deficit would actually rise.</p> \n<p>Bilal Khan, senior regional economist at Standard Chartered, predicted a deficit of 5% in 2019, and Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, forecast over 7%.</p> \n<p>Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, estimated that if oil prices did not rebound from current levels, the deficit would near 10% in 2019 — a figure that Saudi Arabia could not sustain in the long run.</p> \n<p>That would leave Riyadh in danger of missing the 2023 target for eliminating the deficit by a wide margin, which could revive markets’ concern about the health of Saudi finances, or of being pressured into drastic austerity steps between 2020 and 2023 in order to hit the target.</p> \n<p>For these reasons, Saudi Arabia’s room to pursue a go-for-growth fiscal policy is limited, and it will not be able to abandon austerity steps entirely next year, economists said. This could keep expansion of the non-oil sector sluggish.</p> \n<p>“While there may be some fiscal loosening in the first half of next year, we think that austerity will probably resume in the second half of 2019,” Tuvey said.</p> \n<p>The non-oil part of the economy grew just 2.3% in 2018, far too slowly to have much of an impact in cutting unemployment in a country where the population of Saudi citizens is expanding at an annual rate of close to 2%.</p> \n<p>Riyadh originally set a 2020 date for balancing its budget, pushing that back to 2023 a year ago as the economy struggled. In recent months, officials have not abandoned the 2023 deadline but they have sought to soften its significance.</p> \n<p>In late October, after much planning for the 2019 budget was completed, Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters that while Riyadh would balance its budgets over the medium term, it would accept some deficits after 2023 if they were needed to spur the economy.</p> \n<p>In post-budget news conference last week, senior officials said they remained committed to fiscal balance but did not specifically mention 2023.</p> \n<p>Some aspects of the budget indicated that key austerity policies would go ahead, however. Jadaan said Riyadh had no intention of changing policy toward fees that it charges for hiring expatriates and issuing residence permits to their dependents.</p> \n<p>The fees are due to rise next year, increasing financial pressure on the private sector, which had lobbied for the rises to be delayed.</p> \n<p>Also, officials declined to rule out last week the possibility of further hikes in domestic fuel prices. Under previously announced policy, domestic prices of fuels including gasoline, diesel and kerosene may be raised in 2019.</p> \n<p>Domestic fuel price rises may be the only way Riyadh can achieve a projection in its 2019 budget for oil revenues to rise 9% to 662 billion riyals, as many economists think international oil prices are unlikely to rise much if at all.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group, has resigned in protest to President Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, joining Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security officials.</p> \n<p>Only 11 days ago, McGurk had said it would be “reckless” to consider the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, defeated and therefore would be unwise to bring American forces home. He decided to speed up his plan to leave in mid-February.</p> \n<p>McGurk, appointed to the post by President Barack Obama in 2015 and retained by Trump, said in his resignation letter that the militants were on the run, but not yet defeated, and that the premature pullout of American forces from Syria would create the conditions that gave rise to ISIS. McGurk also cited gains in accelerating the campaign against ISIS, but that the work was not yet done.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: Trump's Syria withdrawal and Mattis' resignation startle Israel and undercut Netanyahu | Analysis ■ Trump and Obama may be complete opposites but their Syria policies are nearly identical</p> \n<p>His letter, submitted Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was described to The Associated Press on Saturday by an official familiar with its contents. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before the letter was released and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p> \n<p>McGurk, whose resignation is effective Dec. 31, was planning to leave the job in mid-February after a U.S.-hosted meeting of foreign ministers from the coalition countries, but he felt he could continue no longer after Trump’s decision to withdraw from Syria and Mattis’ resignation, according to the official.</p> \n<p>Trump is acting to pull all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria and has now declared victory over ISIS, contradicting his own experts’ assessments. Many lawmakers have called his action rash and dangerous.</p> \n<p>Mattis, perhaps the most respected foreign policy official in the administration, announced on Thursday that he will leave by the end of February. He told Trump in a letter that he was departing because “you have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.”</p> \n<p>The U.S. began airstrikes in Syria in 2014, and ground troops moved in the following year to battle ISIS and train Syrian rebels in a country torn apart by civil war. Trump, in a tweet this past week, abruptly declared their mission accomplished.</p> \n<p>The decision will fulfill Trump’s goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back for months, arguing that the ISIS group remains a threat and could regroup in Syria’s long-running civil war. U.S. policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated.</p> \n<p>McGurk said at a State Department briefing on Dec. 11 that “it would be reckless if we were just to say, ‘Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now.’ I think anyone who’s looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.”</p> \n<p>A week before that, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. had a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of ISIS and stabilize Syria. He said it would take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of that number had been trained.</p> \n<p>McGurk, 45, previously served as a deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, and during the negotiations for the landmark Iran nuclear deal by the Obama administration, led secret side talks with Tehran on the release of Americans imprisoned there.</p> \n<p>McGurk, was briefly considered for the post of ambassador to Iraq after having served as a senior official covering Iraq and Afghanistan during President George W. Bush’s administration.</p> \n<p>A former Supreme Court law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, McGurk worked as a lawyer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and joined Bush’s National Security Council staff, where in 2007 and 2008, he was the lead U.S. negotiator on security agreements with Iraq.</p> \n<p>Taking over for now for McGurk will be his deputy, retired Lt. Gen. Terry Wolff, who served three tours of active duty in Iraq.</p> \n<p>Jim Jeffrey, a veteran diplomat who was appointed special representative for Syria engagement in August, is expected to stay in his position, officials said.</p> \n<p>ISIS militants still hold a string of villages and towns along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria, where they have resisted weeks of attacks by the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces to drive them out. The pocket is home to about 15,000 people, among them 2,000 ISIS fighters, according to U.S. military estimates.</p> \n<p>But that figure could be as high as 8,000 militants, if fighters hiding out in the deserts south of the Euphrates River are also counted, according to according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through networks of local informants.</p> \n<p>The SDF, a Kurdish-led force that is America’s only military partner in Syria, said Thursday: “The war against Islamic State has not ended and the group has not been defeated.” The group is at the front lines of the battle against ISIS along the Euphrates River.</p> \n<p>It said a U.S. withdrawal would leave Syrians “between the claws of enemy forces.”</p> \n<p>At their height in 2014, Islamic State militants controlled approximately a third of territory in Syria and Iraq, including major cities in both countries. The group flourished in the political vacuum of Syria’s civil war, in which President Bashar Assad has violently put down a 2011 uprising against his family’s 40-year rule.</p>",

Many attempts have been made to censor and silence him.”</p> \n<p>Walker also noted that she is a supporter of BDS, the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement targeting Israel.</p> \n<p>“I believe the attempt to smear David Icke, and by association, me, is really an effort to dampen the effect of our speaking out in support of the people of Palestine,” she writes.</p> \n<p>Walker also defended her habit of reading, or trying to read, books that are “extremely problematic,” a list she said includes the Koran, the Talmud, the Bible and Adolf Hitler’s manifesto “Mein Kampf.”</p> \n<p>“I read everything. I even tried once to read Mein Kampf but found it too steeped in German history to make sense. It also seemed pedantic and boring,” she writes. “But after hearing so much about it, I wanted to know what it said for myself.”</p> \n<p>In addition to its explication of German history, “Mein Kampf” lays out Hitler’s thesis that the Jews are&nbsp;the “enemy race” of the German people.</p> \n<p>Walker has previously recommended Icke’s book to her fans, and in The New York Times Book Review, in a recurring feature called “By the Book,” she noted that his book was among several on her nightstand. She called his book, which includes dense theorizing about the Jewish and extraterrestrial forces that control the world, a “curious person’s dream come true.”</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, the editor of the Book Review, Pamela Paul, defended the section’s decision to present Walker’s recommendation without explanation or qualification. “The intention for By the Book is to be a portrait of someone through his or her reading life,”&nbsp;she told a Times interviewer. “What people choose to read or not read and what books they find to be influential or meaningful say a lot about who they are.”</p> \n<p>When asked if she had considered asking Walker about Icke’s book, Paul said no.</p> \n<p>“When we interview anyone, whether it’s a public official or a foreign leader or an artist, The Times isn’t saying that we approve of the person’s views and actions,” she said. “We’re saying we think the subject is worthy of interviewing.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>There’s no realistic possibility that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won’t be indicted, a former state prosecutor said Saturday.</p> \n<p>“Theoretically, anything is possible, but it’s very unrealistic,” Moshe Lador said, speaking at a public forum in Mevasseret Zion, outside of Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the state prosecution recommended that Netanyahu be charged with taking bribes in two of the corruption investigations being conducted against him.</p> \n<p>Lador based his conclusion on Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit’s closely involvement in the investigations, including signing agreements to turn state’s evidence with three people.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: To survive three bribery cases, Netanyahu may push Israel's democracy to the brink ■ Surrounded on all sides: Netanyahu's indictment is now inevitable | Analysis</p> \n<p>“The prosecution’s recommendation didn’t land on the attorney general’s desk out of the blue,” Lador explained. “He’s been sitting at the head of the table for two years, perhaps almost three, and has monitored the police investigators and the prosecutors handling the case. So he’s very familiar with the material, like all the other members of this forum. Thus nothing there ought to be new to him.”</p> \n<p>In one case, Netanyahu is suspected of conferring regulatory benefits on the Bezeq telecommunications company in exchange for favorable coverage from Walla, the firm’s news website. In the other, he is suspected of discussing a deal under which the Yedioth Ahronoth daily would provide favorable coverage if he took measures to undermine Yedioth’s main rival, the free daily Israel Hayom.</p> \n<p>Lador rejected Netanyahu’s claims that his talks with both media outlets were standard practice between politicians and journalists and that favorable coverage doesn’t constitute a bribe.</p> \n<p>“Not everyone does this,” Lador said. “And even if there are meetings between editors in chief and politicians interested in favorable coverage, the moment what you receive from me is conditioned on what I expect from you, this is an unacceptable situation that could easily prove to be bribery.”</p> \n<p>Asked by the event’s moderator, the veteran journalist Shalom Yerushalmi, whether this analysis was valid even if, as in the Yedioth case, the alleged deal was never carried out, Lador replied, “If I shoot a man with the intention of hurting him, but he isn’t hurt, am I not committing a crime?” He noted that under Israeli law, attempting to commit a crime is a crime in its own right, even if the actual crime never takes place.</p> \n<p>“In the crime of bribery, it’s not at all important for the bribe taker to have done what he promised, and it doesn’t even matter if he never intended to do what he promised,” Lador continued, referring to Netanyahu’s claim that he never intended to carry out the deal with Yedioth. “It’s enough that whoever gave him the bribe assumed and expected that he would then do something to his benefit, even if he didn’t actually do so.”</p> \n<p>The third case against Netanyahu, in which prosecutors recommended that he be charged with breach of trust rather than bribery, involved his receipt of expensive gifts from businessmen. It is commonly termed “the gifts case” in Hebrew, but Lador said this name is inappropriate for a case in which goods worth hundreds of thousands of shekels were routinely delivered to the prime minister’s residence.</p> \n<p>“They weren’t bringing this for a birthday or a dinner, the way we all sometimes give a bottle of wine or a book,” he said. “Based on what has been reported, the recipients would call and say, ‘Look, the goods are about to run out, so you have to arrange a continued supply.’ I am absolutely not willing to accept that these were gifts. These aren’t gifts.</p> \n<p>“None of us is familiar with a situation like this — a regular arrangement for luxuries on demand, via other people, with no connection to the timing, to a holiday, to a bar mitzvah or a wedding. ... This kind of friendship isn’t pure friendship; there’s an interest that’s being supplied continuously by IV.”</p> \n<p>What the businessmen gain in exchange, Lador added, is a close relationship with the prime minister. “This friendship gives the businessman stature, stardust,” he said. “But it also gives him an address to which he can turn if he needs it.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Executions in Saudi Arabia doubled during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s first eight months in power, according to a new report by a U.K. human rights group.</p> \n<p>Reprieve said there were 133 executions in the kingdom between June 2017 and March 2018, compared to just 67 in the eight months prior. Among those executed were scores of poor migrants who had allegedly been coerced into smuggling drugs.</p> \n<p>The foreign workers, mostly from South Asia, were among nearly 150 executions in Saudi Arabia during 2018, according to the report.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Reprieve said there have been nearly 700 executions in Saudi Arabia since 2014. There were an average of 13 executions a month this year, although that number peaked in July when 27 people were executed – including seven on a single day.</p> \n<p>The nonprofit said the kingdom remains among the world’s top five executing states.</p> \n<p>Reprieve noted that when he became crown prince, MBS (as he is commonly known in the Western media) had claimed he would be getting rid of the death penalty for drugs offenses.</p> \n<p>“We’re tried to minimise executions,” he told Time Magazine last April. “If a person kills a person, they have to be executed in our law. But there are a few areas that we can change it from execution to life in prison.”</p> \n<p>Despite this pledge, the number of people executed for drug offenses has actually gone up since he came into office.</p> \n<p>Reprieve Director Maya Foa said: “Despite promises of reform from the crown prince, the kingdom is executing drug offenders at an alarmingly high rate, and at least 30 people – including some arrested as teenagers – face imminent execution for exercising their democratic rights.</p> \n<p>She said the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s Turkish consulate in October “exposed the brutality of Saudi Arabia’s rulers to the world. Now the kingdom must be held to account for its use of the death penalty, as political prisoners and vulnerable economic migrants await the executioner’s blade.”</p> \n<p>The CIA concluded last month that Crown Prince Mohammed personally ordered the killing of the Saudi journalist.</p> \n<p>Nearly 40 percent (58 people) of those executed in 2018 were convicted of drugs offenses, with 77 percent of them foreign nationals. Overall, 49 percent of the people executed this year were foreign nationals</p> \n<p>“These are typically poor migrant workers, coerced into smuggling drugs in their intestines,” Reprieve said in its press statement.</p> \n<p>In October, Saudi Arabia executed one foreign national – Indonesian housekeeper Tuti Tursilawati – without either her family or the Indonesian government being informed. The maid was found guilty in June 2011 of killing her Saudi employer the previous year. She said she had acted in self-defense after he tried to rape her.</p> \n<p>Reprieve said only one person executed in 2018 was convicted in the kingdom’s Specialised Criminal Court, which deals with prosecutions for political crimes and terrorism. But it added that “at least 54 people are facing death sentences for opposing the regime, of whom 30 are at risk of imminent execution.”</p> \n<p>One of the condemned prisoners is Abbas al-Hassan, sentenced to death in 2016 on charges of treason, including spying for Iran, spreading the Shia faith and attending protests. Earlier this year, a UN investigation said his trial did not meet “fair trial and due process guarantees,” and the charges were “in contravention of the right to freedom of religion.”</p> \n<p>Last month, the death sentence on Hassan and 11 co-defendants, including two minors, was ratified by King Salman, meaning they can be put to death at any time.</p> \n<p>Another defendant, Ali al-Nimr, was convicted while still a minor and sentenced to death by crucifixion, which in Saudi Arabia involves beheading and public display of the body.</p> \n<p>Foa said Nimr’s planned execution, “based apparently on the authorities’ dislike for his uncle, and his involvement in anti-government protests, would violate international law and the most basic standards of decency. It must be stopped.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Last week I participated in a conference on “Zionism 3.0”, organized by the Oshman Family Jewish Community Center of Palo Alto and the Reut Group. The gathering, dedicated to “Uniting a Divided People”, was sold out - an indication, presumably, of the concern felt by many Jews over the growing rift between Israel and American Jews. The degree of engagement was thus encouraging and depressing at the same time.</p> \n<p>This was my second Z3 conference in Palo Alto. The first, cosponsored by Haaretz, was held three years ago, in a completely different era. Relations between Israel and American Jews were already troubled, but hardly at the top of the conference agenda; Iran, the peace process and BDS seemed to matter more. The Kotel deal with the Reform and Conservative had yet to be concluded and then dumped. And Israel’s government had yet to take such a decisive right-wing turn.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;The seven deadly sins shared by right-wing politicians in Israel and the U.S.&nbsp;■&nbsp;Netanyahu’s formula is doubly dangerous in an Israel prone to fascism</p> \n<p>More importantly –&nbsp;critically in fact – even though Donald Trump had already declared his candidacy, no one in his right mind believed he would one day be elected president, with all that this milestone, still inconceivable for many, has entailed. Trump wasn’t on the official agenda last week either, but he was certainly on the lips of many participants who approached me on the sidelines. &nbsp;Specifically, as one participant phrased it, with undisguised hurt: “What is going on over there? Why do Israelis like Trump so much? Don’t they realize who we’re dealing with here?”</p> \n<p>I did my best to answer. Israelis appreciate Trump’s pro-Israel policies, I suggested, and Benjamin Netanyahu describes him as the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House. Israelis are naturally less exposed to, and less interested in, Trump’s domestic agenda or legal complications, I added. In any case, much of Trump’s politically un-correct agenda dovetails, unfortunately, with the views of Israeli public opinion, especially on the right, I opined.</p> \n<p>My interlocutors nodded, said they understood and walked away unconvinced. No matter what the explanation, notwithstanding their understanding for Israel’s need to foster good ties with any U.S. president and despite their declarations of continued support for the Jewish state, in the eyes of most American Jews, the mutual bear hug between Israel and the U.S. president is unconscionable and unforgiveable.&nbsp; It repels them. It injects raw and inconsolable emotion into a relationship that was already fraught with tensions. It renders repair a hundred times harder.</p> \n<p>The issues that divide America’s largely liberal Jewish community and Israel’s increasingly conservative right-wing government are well known and well documented: Religious pluralism, Jewish settlements, the lack of a peace process, a basic divergence of worldviews etc. These divisions have plagued the relationship for years. The presidency of Barack Obama, who American Jews admired and Israeli Jews mostly disdained, made things worse. The presidency of Donald Trump, who American Jews mostly abhor and Israeli Jews applaud, may have turned the relationship totally toxic.</p> \n<p>For most American Jews, Trump’s policies towards Israel, even if one views them as positive, cannot offset his glaring deficiencies. His America First agenda gives them the creeps. His agitation against immigration scares them. His perceived encouragement for white supremacists terrifies them. His conduct in office disgusts them. Trump, in many ways, is the epitome of everything they fear and loathe in America. Exaggerated or not, many have come to view the Trump presidency as a clear and present danger to the very wellbeing of the American Jewish community.</p> \n<p>Many American Jews are naturally perplexed by Israel’s seeming indifference to their plight, and worse, by its disdainful dismissal of their concerns. Netanyahu’s government is seen as standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump, even if that means sacrificing the interests of the Jewish community itself. This was nowhere more evident than in the Israeli government’s shameful defense of Trump in the wake of the October massacre in Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue. According to a poll conducted by J Street and GBA Strategies on Election Day, 72% of American Jews view Trump’s divisive rhetoric as “very” or “partially” responsible for the attack. The Israeli government told them this was poppycock.</p> \n<p>The same is true of the clear majority of American Jews who feel that since Trump took office, right-wing extremism is on the rise (79%) along with racism (80%) and anti-Semitism (81%). In the aftermath of Pittsburgh, Israeli representatives challenged their perceptions, dismissed their concerns or tried to convince American Jews that it’s BDS and radical Islam they should worry about, even though both had nothing to do with the Pittsburgh atrocity.</p> \n<p>By doing so, Israel joined the ranks of Trump enablers and apologists, who see no evil, hear no evil and certainly speak no evil of their revered president. Israel became the Kellyanne Conway of Trump’s race baiting, the Rudy Giuliani of his America First agenda, which most American Jews despise. In the hyper-partisan political atmosphere now prevailing in America, to which American Jews are certainly not immune, Israel’s isn’t simply guilty by association. It is often perceived as aiding and abetting a president who many American Jews view as their community’s worst enemy.</p> \n<p>And the friend of my enemy is, by definition, an enemy as well. In the binary “with me or against me” division that is an inevitable by-product of hyper-partisanship, Israel is increasingly associated by American Jews with the latter rather than the former.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Israel’s fawning apologia for Trump taints Israel with his stains, casting it as a purveyor in its own right of his unique brand of ethnocentric nationalism. Israel’s overenthusiastic alignment with Trump shines a negative light on its own policies in general and on its attitude towards American Jews in particular. Israel’s refusal to engage with the Palestinians, support for Jewish settlements, anti-democratic legislation or subservience to the Orthodox monopoly were all bones of contention even before Trump was elected, but now seem retrospectively like an extension of his obnoxious policies. Israel’s embrace of Trump isn’t simply a matter of realpolitik or diplomatic expediency but a wholehearted endorsement of the man and what he stands for.</p> \n<p>Small wonder that the resentment felt by the clear majority of American Jews towards Trump is spilling over into their feelings towards Israel as well. Israel’s identification with Trump poisons the attitude of his Jewish critics, corrodes their tolerance and eats away at their willingness to compromise or seek a middle ground. Optimists obviously believe that the deterioration is reversible, but it’s a race against time. The question is whether the relationship will survive long enough, even on life support, or whether it succumbs to its Trump-induced malignancy before he leaves office and a remedy is found.</p>",

        "text":["<p>After weeks of massive and often violent protest by the so-called Yellow Vests in France, a few people in Israel got the idea that we should be doing the same thing.</p> \n<p>Israeli activists could only be envious of the French working class protesters pouring into the streets by the tens of thousands, and forcing Emanuel Macron to stage the biggest policy climb-down of his presidency.</p> \n<p>In Israel, the timing of the protests was fortuitous. The same week the Israeli yellow vests were planning their democracy, the government announced big increases in electricity and water rates. A host of food companies have been raising prices and municipal taxes are due to go up, too.</p> \n<p>Elections are on the horizon. It wouldn’t stretch the imagination to see Bibi knuckling under to masses of angry protesters filling the streets and breaking things.</p> \n<p>It was a fantasy, alas, that didn’t happen. Only a few hundred people showed up on the street outside the Azrieli shopping mall in Tel Aviv last Friday.</p> \n<p>Even the threat (“Next week, there will be 10,000 people here”) of David Mizrahi, one of the organizers, was pathetic. If people really believed that Israel’s poor and middle class are being crushed by the high cost of living and can’t spare another shekel, there should be hundreds of thousands in the streets, not dozens.</p> \n<p>The reality is very different. Israel does have very high levels of income inequality and poverty, but the rates have been falling and by the standards of socio-economic changes, they have been falling very fast.</p> \n<p>Mall rats with a peeve</p> \n<p>For the Israeli middle class, the last few years have been good ones. Consumer prices have been declining and wages have been rising. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon has cut taxes, in particular customs and purchase taxes on consumer favorites like smartphones and cosmetics. Shopping on overseas websites, where prices are cheaper than at home and exempt from the value-added tax, has become the national pastime. Thanks to lower airfares from the Open Skies reforms, Israelis are travelling abroad in record numbers.</p> \n<p>Even home prices, which have soared to painful levels, have moderated in the past year. In any case, the impact of home prices on consumers is limited. They are a problem for first-time buyers; for the great majority who already own a home or are moving to a different one, rising prices are increasing the value of their assets or are of little consequence.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Consumers are not going to welcome rising costs for electricity, water and food, but it’s not going to drive them into the streets. The middle class families that are the most likely to be politically engaged enough to attend a rally are too busy shopping.</p> \n<p>The activists who showed up last week may rail against bigger electricity bills, but what really animates them is hatred of the system.&nbsp; They hate big business and Netanyahu to such a degree that they can’t see what’s happening around them.</p> \n<p>But for the great majority of people in Israel or elsewhere if the system is delivering, they are willing to live with its faults. In France and much of the West there is a clear feeling among substantial numbers of people that it is not and that has surfaced in populist voting and the rise of the extreme right.</p> \n<p>None of which has occurred in Israel – yet. Israel has enjoyed 15 years of continuous economic growth, which has been the main reason why Israelis are so content.</p> \n<p>But there are plenty of signs that we may be reaching the end of an era.</p> \n<p>The government’s chief achievements over the era were to coax more Israelis into the labor force and maintain budget discipline while leaving the high-tech sector alone to thrive. What it didn’t do was address Israel’s fundamental problems. These problems are coming to the fore at an inauspicious time, when the world economy and the government’s commitment to tight budget policies are both looking shakier.</p> \n<p>Activists like the ones on the Champs Elysees or by the Azrieli Center think big socio-economic problems can be solved simply by government increasing social spending.</p> \n<p>In an extreme case of this fallacy, Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez took the country’s oil profits and handed them over to the poor (with his cronies skimming off some for themselves). It helped the poor while oil prices were high; when they fell there was not only no money but no jobs because Chavez hadn’t invested in infrastructure, education or industry or reformed the economy.</p> \n<p>The real task for policymakers is to ensure their economies can generate good jobs. In a globalized economy, this means being competitive and innovative. &nbsp;Israel’s challenge in this context is to raise its low productivity levels, improve the caliber of its schools and workforce, and force the ultra-Orthodox into the job market.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, none of this has been pursued with any seriousness and in the case of the ultra-Orthodox, what progress has been made is being lost. The typical finance minister doesn’t have the patience and the public doesn’t have the understanding or appreciation to pursue. Better to cut taxes and increase spending – the public will love you.</p> \n<p>A policy wonk by nature, Macron thought he could implement the difficult reforms the French economy needs despite widespread opposition. He is paying the price. Israel’s leaders haven’t been so daring, and the result is that the public will pay the price.</p>",

        "text":["<p>After the owners of the U.S. conservative magazine, the Weekly Standard, announced last Friday it was shutting down and firing dozens of people during the holiday season, U.S. President Donald Trump quickly took to Twitter to celebrate.</p> \n<p>Trump wrote, “The pathetic and dishonest Weekly Standard, run by failed prognosticator Bill Kristol (who, like many others, never had a clue), is flat broke and out of business. Too bad. May it rest in peace!”</p> \n<p>For Trump, his obnoxious glee was clearly justified. The end of the Weekly Standard further shrinks the space on the right for anti-Trump conservatives, and is yet another sign of just how much Trump has remade the Republican Party in his own image - a fundamentally different set of values and policies to those once proudly espoused by U.S. conservatives.</p> \n<p>Founded by Kristol and Fred Barnes in 1995, just after the GOP’s historic Congressional sweep and Newt Gingrich’s Contract with America, the Weekly Standard grew to become the focal point of intellectual conservatism in the U.S. - nicknamed the “in-flight magazine of Air Force One” during the George W Bush administration.</p> \n<p>The magazine featured some of the right’s most respected voices from Charles Krauthammer to David Frum to Christopher Hitchens to David Brooks and was a major force in pushing for and selling both the war on terror and the war in Iraq.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, it is likely to be best remembered for its last two years or so, in which it served as a platform for some of Trump’s most potent critics. The magazine’s writers, Kristol among them, serially called the president out for his “America First” agenda, his betrayal of conservative values, his mistruths, attacks on American institutions and traditions and lack of coherent policy. It appears that The Weekly Standard’s subscribers will be moved over to the relaunched Washington Examiner magazine, a publication far less committed to principled opposition to Trump.</p> \n<p>Anti-Trump conservatives had become that rare voice in American media life: commentators, often with deep experience in government if not White House service under Republican presidents, offering fact and morality-based criticism of Trump, which could break though the partisan echo chambers and both left and right.</p> \n<p>But the Weekly Standard’s demise is just one sign of how fragile and contested that ground is with many in the “Never Trump” movement becoming ever fiercer critics of the president as Trump loyalists close ranks behind him. Former top GOP strategists and policy makers who have consistently raised the alarm against Trump - such as Frum and Ana Navarro - are now considered irredeemably &quot;fake news&quot; by most Trump supporters, who also reject the calls to rethink and resurrect American conservatism from its deterioration and contamination by Trump.</p> \n<p>Anti-Trump conservatives are now more likely to find a welcome and employment in mainstream centrist/center-left media such as the New York Times, the Atlantic and the Washington Post.</p> \n<p>Indeed, the week preceding Friday’s announcement offered yet another example of the depths to which mainstream pro-Trump media has descended - &nbsp;on Fox, Trump’s in-house cable network.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, on Laura Ingraham’s high-ratings Fox News show, Ann Coulter claimed that the Democratic party was constituted by “Muslims and the Jews and the various exotic sexual groups and the black church ladies with the college queers” united only by their hatred of “white men.” Coulter was quickly called out from across the political spectrum as a racist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Later that same day, Fox host Sean Hannity and ex-White House assistant and Fox News contributor Seb Gorka discussed the sentencing of disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn who plead guilty to lying to the FBI. Gorka and Hannity repeatedly attacked the integrity of the FBI, minimized Flynn’s actions and called the whole affair “entrapment.” Gorka’s spin went so far as to suggest Trump should pardon Flynn and make him his new chief of staff.</p> \n<p>Then on Thursday to top it all off, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, whose popularity has surged since he took a sharp right-hand racist turn, declared immigrants make the United States “poorer and dirtier.” Ironically, Carlson was part of the Weekly Standard’s first staff and featured on the masthead of its first issue.</p> \n<p>While the pro-Trump media is actively working to discredit Trump’s detractors and the legal challenges swirling around him, and attempting to make some of his more hardline policies - like his stance on immigration - seem more palatable and urgent, the Weekly Standard did none of that, its writers held fast to modern conservative principles: free trade, respect for rule of law and standing up to foreign despots.</p> \n<p>The Weekly Standard also focused on enlarging the conservative movement to include women, minorities and younger voters. Ben Shapiro, in May this year, offered a prescription for how to win them back. He argues that young people should be attracted by the new GOP’s emphasis on fighting political correctness, “Freedom of speech is good because you have value as an individual human being with a unique point of view; you’re not reducible to your skin color, your ethnicity, or your income.”</p> \n<p>The magazine became synonymous with neo-conservatism. While that term has become pejorative, its principles explain why many of the magazine’s writers never embraced Trump. Neoconservatives, many with Jewish roots, strove to ensure that the hard won victories of the twentieth century over fascism and communism, for human rights and against genocide, would be preserved, at all costs. Hitchens wrote in the Standard in September 2005, in defense of the war in Iraq, “Coexistence with aggressive regimes or expansionist, theocratic, and totalitarian ideologies is not in fact possible.”</p> \n<p>Despite the obvious and tragic policy failures of neo-conservative policy not least in the Mideast, it still declared its fidelity to a moral backbone, the Constitution and what were once more universally accepted as conservative American values.</p> \n<p>That was why the Weekly Standard had such a long-running feud with GOP Rep. Steve King, well-known as America’s white supremacist Congressman, who quickly jumped on the Trump bandwagon slamming the Weekly Standard after its demise. King tweeted, “.@RealDonaldTrump is right on The Weekly Standard’s deserved demise (“pathetic and dishonest”). If the articles targeting me were redacted until only truth remained, there would not be much left to read.”</p> \n<p>The feud was particularly fierce regarding vile anti-immigrant remarks that the Standard reported King made. King later denied that the audio of his remarks existed and even taunted the magazine to release the tapes - which it eventually did.</p> \n<p>Adam Rubenstein, the magazine’s former assistant opinion editor shot back at King on Twitter, “...We released the audio recording of what you said, after you dishonestly disputed my reporting. As Hayes [the magazine’s former editor-in-chief] put it, we &quot;wouldn’t focus on your bigotry if you weren’t a bigot.&quot;</p> \n<p>And the founding Weekly Standard deputy editor John Podhoretz had this to say about Steve King, once an unpleasant but gratifyingly outlier GOP congressman: “The problem with this tweet [dancing on the Standard’s grave] is that you are a foul, disgusting liar and a stain on American public life. The stench of your deceit and your views pollutes your district, your state, your party, and the United States.”</p> \n<p>In a week when U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who once passionately led the charge to impeach Bill Clinton in 1999, says of Trump today&nbsp;that he has “no problem” with the president “lying about sex.” And when the longest-serving GOP senator in history, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee, says he doesn’t care if the president commits a crime, there can be little doubt as to just how much conservative principles are quickly eroding.</p> \n<p>While it’s a cheap win for the president to herald its collapse as a victory for Trumpism, it should also be noted that many of the Weekly Standard’s storied writers have gained vastly enlarged audiences for their anti-Trump columns and public events in the non-conservative media landscape - a far larger megaphone with which to righteously berate the president.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Fox News host Tucker Carlson sounded off on Monday night as to why the U.S. Congress should fund U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall - citing Israel as an example. Trump himself, who promised Mexico would pay for the wall, repeatedly cites Israel when arguing for the border wall.</p> \n<p>Carlson began by arguing, “The estimated cost of a border wall is about $25 billion. That is estimated so let's say it is twice that. That is still a tiny fraction of the price of the pointless stalemate we're now waging in Afghanistan. That costs about $45 billion every year, not including the human cost. Compare that to $25 billion needed to restore sovereignty with the wall.”</p> \n<p>Trump and Congressional Republicans are currently in a political chess match with Congressional Democrats over whether or not to shut down the government or pass an appropriations bill to keep it open without funding the wall - which Democrats are refusing to do.</p> \n<p>“Why is Congress happy to pay for border barriers in Jordan, Tunisia, and Israel?” asked Carlson, without citing any specific evidence.</p> \n<p>“Nancy Pelosi says that walls are immoral, but for some reason, she is not flying to Jerusalem to lecture the Israelis about how they are wasting U.S. aid building walls that don't work. Israelis know how effective walls are, that is why they have them,” he continued.</p> \n<p>“Israel's wall on the Egyptian border almost completely halted illegal immigration from that country. In fact, by some measures, not one person came over once they made it taller. It turns out there is a limit to the height of ladders.”</p> \n<p>Novelist Stephen King had offered his opinion on the wall earlier in the week, something Carlson apparently didn’t see. King tweeted, “Wait a minute, wait! Wasn't...um, Mexico going to pay for Trump's useless, just-tunnel-under-it wall?”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The decision by the Ministerial Committee for Legislation to approve a bill that would retroactively legalize illegal construction in the West Bank for a two-year period demonstrates that neither security nor the rule of law are what interests this government – only its political survival.</p> \n<p>To this end the bill’s sponsor, Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi), had to get his share to satisfy the right-wing settler base without passing the Likud party from the right. If Habayit Hayehudi chairman Naftali Bennett couldn’t get the defense portfolio, let them at least be comforted by trampling on the rule of law. After all, it’s inconceivable that there should be a terror attack without extracting some political benefit from it. Everything goes in the effort to strengthen the Jewish hold on the West Bank at the Palestinians’ expense. Even the horrifying linking of innocent blood with the strengthening of the settlement project deters no one, as if the former were a condition for the latter.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Editorial:&nbsp;Israel has weaponized the settlements&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israeli settlers embrace new strategy in bid to achieve million-resident vision</p> \n<p>The ministerial committee was rightfully told that Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit vehemently opposes the bill for constitutional reasons, i.e., because the bill conflicts with the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty given the sweeping harm it poses to the right to property, not to mention the legal difficulties it raises in the context of equality before the law and the rule of law. Mendelblit was also right to warn the ministerial committee, through his deputy Raz Nizri, of the international implications of the bill and the real risks Israel would be exposed to in this respect.</p> \n<p>Indeed, we’re talking about a serious provocation of anyone who holds international law dear. Even in the current diplomatic reality, with the weakened status of international law, it’s still liable to bite. But the ears of the ministers are sealed to responsible legal counsel. Even the alternative suggested by Mendelblit – to make more selective use of the&nbsp;market regulation&nbsp;concept (a dubious alternative) – did not satisfy the ministers. There is nothing more permanent than the temporary nature of the bill, since if it becomes law, it will in practice lead to the legalization of everything that was built illegally, including what is built on private land - unless the High Court of Justice intervenes.</p> \n<p>The arrangement will in reality be irreversible. Given the way the attorney general’s opinion was ignored, the impression is that Habayit Hayehudi and the extreme right parts of the Likud are deliberately leading to a showdown with the High Court, while constantly raising the stakes. The idea is to intimidate the justices so that they do not dare stand up to these thieving laws, and if they do, the way will be paved to undermine the authority of the court in the name of loyalty to the Land of Israel.</p> \n<p>For decades, ever since the first Yehudit Karp report in 1982, which confirmed for the first time that settlers who harm Palestinians enjoy de facto immunity from criminal proceedings, there has been serious doubt as to whether Israel’s rule in the West Bank is the rule of law. The bill advanced Sunday once against makes it clear that for this government there is no rule of law but rule of theft. It’s also clear that legitimizing the violation of past laws invites the violation of future laws, so that instead of laws, the Jewish rulers will prevail by force. Instead of the law serving to protect basic rights, it will become a tool for undermining them, based on discrimination between Jews and Arabs, between those who see themselves as the lords of the entire land and those who are considered by them to be trespassers, even on their own property.</p> \n<p>What do the terrorists want? To bring those they are batting to lose their composure and to take steps that will only bring more terror. The decision by the ministerial committee shows a loss of judgment and it will lead to more attacks. It’s false to claim that incitement is the only explanation for terror. Israeli seizure of Palestinian land, while undermining the rights to private property and destroying the chance of establishing a Palestinian state is a clear factor that encourages terror. So it is with home demolitions and other measures that harm those who weren’t actually involved in terror.</p> \n<p>The ministers are thus serving the terrorists by playing into their hands. What else will it take for us to understand that this government has reached the end of the line?</p>",

        "text":["<p>On a very rainy evening in Tel Aviv last month, a few hundred people crowded into the cinematheque for the premiere of new Israeli TV series “Ir Miklat” (“Asylum City”). While two of the show’s stars, Hani Furstenberg and Mali Levi, dazzled in evening gowns, most of the other cast members avoided ostentatious fashion statements.</p> \n<p>The exception was Sean Mongoza, who was sporting a colorful silk suit and pair of blue velvet moccasins. Mongoza, 24, had never experienced so many flashing cameras before, not even while working as a model. But what really excited him was the presence of his parents in the auditorium.</p> \n<p>“My family had never been to such a large and dazzling event,” Mongoza tells Haaretz afterward. “My father is very proud to see his son become part of Israeli society and a well-respected actor. He even helped me with my outfit. This is something he’ll remember all of his life. Think about it: He came from a country where this would not be possible.”</p> \n<p>That country is the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Mongoza was born and where he lived until age 5. When he was still a baby, in the mid-1990s, his father left home in search of a safer place to resettle the family. He flew to Egypt and crossed the border into Israel, which he saw as a safe alternative to their war-torn homeland.</p> \n<p>After four years of being apart, Sean Mongoza and his mother joined Mongoza Sr. in the Jewish state. Since then, his parents have been living in Israel on temporary visas that are renewed every year. Sean Mongoza received his Israeli ID card three years ago.</p> \n<p>At first they all lived in Netanya, north of Tel Aviv, where Mongoza’s father was a chef’s assistant. Within a few months, though, the family had moved to south Tel Aviv’s hardscrabble Hatikva neighborhood.</p> \n<p>“My parents started working and I remained home alone,” recalls Mongoza. “I was a curious boy and couldn’t stay indoors for even a moment – so the minute they left, I went outside and roamed through the local market, going to the Dohl [cultural] Center and the Beit Dani Community Center. I was magically drawn to the theater even at that young age. That’s how I learned Hebrew.</p> \n<p>“When I started roaming like that, my father became violent, beating me every time I returned home. He was worried about me – but it didn’t help. I kept going out, and at some point I realized I could no longer return home.”</p> \n<p>Because you knew he’d beat you?</p> \n<p>“Exactly. I couldn’t stay home. I tried watching the Children’s Channel on TV, but that didn’t work for very long. I tried cooking for myself, but kept burning the frying pan. One day, I postponed going home by an hour, then another – and suddenly it was midnight. I stood outside my door and felt that if I went in, I’d be dead. My legs started moving, then running. I went to a police station and complained that my father beat me. Within four hours I was placed in a foster family in Tel Aviv.”</p> \n<p>A slap in the face</p> \n<p>The foster family turned out to be less protective than expected. Within a few months, with the help of a social worker, Mongoza was transferred to the Beit Hayeled boarding school in Tel Aviv, alternating between there and the family home. He continued his schooling in the Hatikva neighborhood, which was when he became aware of racial abuse being directed at him. “It was classic racism: I’d walk through the neighborhood and some thugs would chase after me, calling me names,” he recounts.</p> \n<p>That year, at age 7, something happened for the first time in his life: he had a birthday celebration of sorts. “I remember my first white friend at school. He came over a few times. I made up a [story about a] birthday I was about to have in a few days. He got excited and bought me a gift. That day, my parents came home early from work. I was showering and heard someone knocking at the door. My father opened the door and asked who it was. This kid had bought me a soccer ball, but my father told him ‘Sean doesn’t have a birthday,’ and shut the door. That was on a Friday, and when we went to church I saw the gift wrap flying around on the sidewalk.”</p> \n<p>Thankfully, his childhood improved as he grew older. He made new friends at the boarding school and was embraced by its counsellors and other staff members. He attended high school at the Herzliya Gymnasium, where he set up a youth band and became popular with his peers. He smiles broadly as he remembers his days at the boarding school. “For the first time I felt warmth from people, not fear and alienation. That’s where I developed,” he says.</p> \n<p>However, aspects of his violent homelife did occasionally resurface at the boarding school, where he admits to “violent outbursts” if he ever encountered racism: “I’d go from 0 to 100 in one second flat. If I didn’t get what I wanted, I’d close the door and not speak to anyone. I took out my anger mainly on objects. There was a lot of anger there.”</p> \n<p>At 16, when he first attempted to get his ID card, he encountered institutional racism as well. When he arrived at the Interior Ministry branch to receive his card, he was forced to line up alongside hundreds of asylum seekers from Sudan and Eritrea. Mongoza couldn’t understand why someone who grew up in Israel and spoke fluent Hebrew, and whose friends were all Israeli, needed to go through the same bureaucratic channels.</p> \n<p>At the time, he felt he had nothing in common with those Africans waiting in line. Now, though, his r&eacute;sum&eacute; includes roles playing African asylum seekers in the series “Alifim” (“Ninth-Graders”) – which he landed at age 17 – and then “Betoolot” (“Mermaids”) and “Metim Lerega” (“Dead for a Moment”), the latter two coming while he was still studying at Tel Aviv’s Nissan Nativ Acting Studio.</p> \n<p>Persistent casting director</p> \n<p>“Asylum City,” which premiered on Yes Edge in Israel last week, is Mongoza’s first starring TV role. He plays Gabriel, an Eritrean who entered Israel illegally with his sister, having seen her be raped in front of him as they were crossing the desert. In Israel, he joins a refugee center where he meets a volunteer (Mali Levi), who pays a high price for trying to be the Don Quixote of south Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>The series is directed with great sensitivity and tries, according to director Eitan Tzur, to be an Israeli version of David Simon’s groundbreaking show “The Wire.” And after watching the first two episodes, it seems that such lofty pretensions are not completely unfounded.</p> \n<p>Mongoza, Levi and Furstenberg (who plays a police officer trying to crack a criminal case) are all equally impressive, each of them part of a dark and disturbing mosaic in which asylum seekers are the weakest link.</p> \n<p>Mongoza wasn’t exactly busting a gut when he attended his audition. To him at the time, the part seemed like another of those stereotypical African refugee roles. But the casting director, who saw him facing the camera with an air of disinterest, did not give up and asked him to concentrate. Some 18 months later, he received an offer and was asked to show up for filming two weeks later. “I came to the first rehearsal and asked Eitan the director, ‘Why did you choose me? You could have taken any non-actor Eritrean who knows the language.’ He said he wanted an actor who could hold it all together. I told him, ‘Great, that was good for my ego.’”</p> \n<p>The actor contradicts my assumption that he probably doesn’t have much in common with his character. “I found many points of identification with him, actually,” he says. “The fact that he’s a painter and an artist was important for me, as well as his loyalty to his family. I learned a lot from the character. It led me to appreciate my family and my place as a black man in Israel.</p> \n<p>“Gabriel did not have the opportunities I have had. He walked through the desert with his sister, who was raped. He performed menial jobs here, but still kept his joie de vivre – which I can relate to. Something about his dignity really impressed me.</p> \n<p>“As a child, I felt that my color differentiated me,” continues Mongoza, saying it was only as he grew older that he learned to live at peace with his identity as a black man in Israel. “When it came to relationships – with the parents of partners who didn’t want me because of my color or because I’m not Jewish – that was very painful,” he admits. “Some people have blue eyes that they can cover with colored lenses; I can’t paint myself white. That’s my personality, my identity and scar – and it’s there for the better.”</p> \n<p>Now he’s the star of a TV series and has become something of a household face, he doesn’t deny that he is part of the Tel Aviv art scene and a proud member of Israeli society. “It’s the embodiment of a new generation: I’m a Congolese-Israeli,” he smiles, “another color in the world, another genre. It has been confusing for me in a way since for many years I’ve distanced myself from my culture, my African identity, and I didn’t want any part of it. I feel like I don’t know my roots.</p> \n<p>“I’m interested in going to Congo one day, but don’t want to go as a tourist,” he says. “In any case, I’ll feel different there. I don’t speak Lingala very well. They’ll immediately spot that I’m different. And I don’t want to go on a ‘root-finding’ mission. When I go, I want to do something significant – maybe set up a school. It has to be something else.”</p> \n<p>Warning sign</p> \n<p>Although Mongoza has Israeli citizenship, he notes that many members of the Congolese community here are at risk of deportation. For him, “Asylum City” serves as a warning sign. “The Interior Ministry recently decreed that everyone who came here from the Democratic Republic of Congo must leave by the beginning of next year. This doesn’t apply to my nuclear family, but it does to my uncle and to a good friend of my mother.</p> \n<p>“There are 4,000 Congolese in Israel, not a significant number,” he says. “How does it hurt the country to let these people live here? For me, this TV series is a protest, it’s part of the whole issue. There is an entire community here. Jews also experienced hardships, they went through the Holocaust. Now they come to someone and deport him – it’s as if you forgot what you went through and where you came from. I never for one moment forget where I came from. Even when I’m in the limelight I don’t forget it.”</p> \n<p>I ask Mongoza how racist Israel is and he doesn’t hold back. “It’s really racist. The fact that I can’t marry a Jewish woman here is racist. We’re living in 2018 and that’s a racist law. And that’s before you’re called ‘N*****,’ and before they make you go through hell to get an ID card. Look at Tsahi Halevi and Lucy Aharish, who had to conceal their relationship,” he says, referring to the Jewish actor and Arab news anchor who secretly married in October. “You are always on the defensive living here. I ask myself if I want my children to live like that. I don’t want them to go through what I went through. It wasn’t easy.”</p> \n<p>Despite those damning words, Mongoza concedes there have been small signs of improvement. “Israel is changing slowly. The generation of Africans who were born here is slowly integrating into Israeli society and its cultural world. We have some influence over the way Africans are accepted here. It’s easy for young Africans to complain about how they’ve been deprived. If something doesn’t suit you – try to change it. You can start with your own milieu or your art or with how you talk or see the world. A lot is in our hands too.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Back in 1964, it was something of a surprise that “Mary Poppins” became such a big hit, adored in equal measure by children and adults, and subsequently a movie that continues to resonate in the cinematic memory. Just about everyone can hum at least one of its songs, perhaps “Chim Chim Cheree,” which won the Best Original Song Oscar – or pronounce, and maybe even sing, the word “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.”</p> \n<p>Until “Mary Poppins,” Disney’s non-animated movies hadn’t garnered the acclaim his works of animation did: They were considered rather unsophisticated, folksy entertainment. The company that Walt Disney founded didn’t expect the arrival on the big screen of the amazing nanny created by P.L. Travers to be any different in this regard. The making of the film was entrusted to veteran director British-born Robert Stevenson, who came to Hollywood in the 1930s, and had already directed several of Disney’s comedies. Stevenson was never considered one of Tinsel Town’s top directors, but he was a dedicated professional, and his pre-“Mary Poppins” filmography contains at least one work worthy of distinction: his 1943 version of “Jane Eyre,” starring Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine.</p> \n<p>To portray Mary Poppins, Disney chose Julie Andrews, then known to the theater-going public in America's big cities for her performance as Eliza Doolittle in the original stage production of “My Fair Lady,” and as Queen Guenevere in the Broadway musical “Camelot,” with Richard Burton as King Arthur. But to most Americans she was largely anonymous, although they may have caught her on television programs such as the “Ed Sullivan Show.” The same year “Mary Poppins” was released, Andrews also starred in Arthur Hiller’s brilliant satirical war film “The Americanization of Emily,” but the picture was a failure. Andrews also suffered another disappointment that year, when she was passed over for the role of Eliza Doolittle in the film version of “My Fair Lady,” because she wasn’t well known enough. (The role went to Audrey Hepburn, whose singing was voiced by Marnie Nixon.)</p> \n<p>It seemed only right, then, that in the same year in which Rex Harrison won the Oscar for his performance as Professor Higgins in “My Fair Lady,” Julie Andrews also won as Best Actress for “Mary Poppins.” The success of that movie transformed Andrews’ status, and she achieved super-stardom a year later, again in a governess role, as Maria in “The Sound of Music.” In “Mary Poppins” she was teamed with Dick Van Dyke, who was mostly known to television viewers. (The 93-year-old Van Dyke has a small role in the new film.)</p> \n<p>As a result of the relatively low expectations from “Mary Poppins,” a certain degree of modesty and simplicity pervades the film, and those qualities enriched and imbued it with a certain captivating intimacy. It’s surprising that it took 54 years for the Disney company to make a sequel to the original – which cost around $6 million and earned more than $100 million in the United States – in 1964 terms.</p> \n<p>Today Walt Disney Pictures, which perhaps reflects Hollywood-style capitalism more than any other company, if such a comparison can be made, is currently in an era of recycling, though not necessarily of the ecological variety. In the year ahead we can look forward to live versions of “Dumbo” and “The Lion King” – the latter is the biggest hit in Disney’s history – which are certain to become blockbusters. “Mary Poppins Returns” is a sequel whose plot differs from that of the original and is set a few decades later, during the Depression years in England, but there isn’t one scene or one song in it that doesn’t reference the 1964 version, only on a larger scale, in keeping with Disney’s far greater economic expectations from this movie.</p> \n<p>So it’s not surprising that, if in the previous film Mary Poppins dropped down from the sky with her suitcase and umbrella in order to help Michael and Jane, the children of the Banks family, to get the attention and love of their father, the busy banker, and their mother, the Suffragette activist – in “Mary Poppins Returns” it’s money that plays a central role. Money drives the plot and money promises the tranquility – and happiness – of the family at the center of the film. This theme casts a certain chill over the film, in contrast to the warmth exuded by the earlier version.</p> \n<p>Mary Poppins returns because Michael and Jane, now adults, are in trouble. Particularly Michael (Ben Whishaw), who has become a widower, is raising three children – the twins, John and Annabel, and little Georgie – and has debts that could cost him his house. He owes the money to the bank where he himself works, and can save his family and his home only if he finds a certificate attesting that his father bought shares in the bank, and presents it to the wily bank manager, who wants to repossess the house. But where is the certificate? I doubt that there will be any viewers who won’t guess from the first minute where it’s hidden.</p> \n<p>Jane (Emily Mortimer) is a single, socially active woman, and the search for the document is joined by Jack (Lin Manuel-Miranda, who is making his first important film debut here, though his resum&eacute; already includes a Pulitzer Prize and two Tony awards for writing the book, music and lyrics for the musical “Hamilton”), a lamplighter, whose role in the film is to take the place of Bert – the chimney sweep from the 1964 version, played by Dick Van Dyke. The new picture has a musical segment featuring the participation of all the lamplighters, echoing the number with the chimney sweeps in the original “Mary Poppins.”</p> \n<p>The emphasis in “Mary Poppins Returns” on heft hurls the movie in too many directions, and even though there are likeable and even lovely moments, there’s nothing that generates a “Wow!” of the kind the filmmakers were after. Even the scene in which all the characters float through the air with the aid of miraculous balloons doesn't generate that feeling. It just looks like a scene in which all the characters fly through the air to the sounds of a song performed by the Balloon Lady, played by actress Angela Lansbury, who’s also 93 and is supposed to reprise the Bird Woman from the first movie, whose melancholy singing haunts the memory.</p> \n<p>Too calculated to recreate the lightness of the 1964 version, the new film suffers from a certain absence of charm and, worst of all, an absence of soul. It lacks an emotional focus, which the director, Rob Marshall, has been unable to provide. Marshall represents a somewhat peculiar phenomenon in contemporary cinema. He gained well-earned esteem for directing the Oscar-winning “Chicago,” but his subsequent work in musicals for the silver screen – such as the deplorable “Nine” and the more successful “Into the Woods” – was less impressive. There are some good songs in &quot;Mary Poppins Returns,&quot; written by Shaiman and Scott Wittman, like the one Lin-Manuel Miranda performs at the beginning, but Marshall lacks the finesse and sophistication that an accomplished maker of musicals requires for the songs to take off. His direction of the musical numbers, in terms of choreography and editing, is that of a genre technician.</p> \n<p>The absence of a narrative and emotional focus alike in the picture is reflected, for example, in an embarrassing scene with Meryl Streep, who is costumed grotesquely and whose deliberately off-key singing leads to a number that takes place in a reverse reality. This scene in particular, which could have been thrilling but fails, exemplifies the uninspired nature of Marshall’s work. The scene recalls, but does not match, the scene in the original movie in which the eccentric uncle’s outbursts of laughter send him floating to the ceiling of the Banks family’s home for his afternoon tea.</p> \n<p>All this leaves us with Emily Blunt, who plays Mary Poppins. Blunt is one of the finest actresses of our time. Possessed of both dramatic and comic skills, she does her work well, even if at times she seems to be obeying some kind of marching orders. The filmmakers were right to cast a level-headed actress in the part, completely different from the sui generis Julie Andrews – and from this perspective, too, her performance is satisfying. Of the other actors, Miranda proves that he possesses a winning screen presence, but the predictable relationship between him and Jane is vacuous.</p> \n<p>“Mary Poppins Returns” is one of those contemporary films that attack us with weightiness instead of wrapping us in warmth. That’s unfortunate, because Mary Poppins, whose whole essence represents a traditional, decent British way of life, would have wished for a movie that personifies her more appropriately. But she’ll be back.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Thousands of people marched in anti-government protests Friday in Budapest, upset over labor law changes, increasing corruption and limits on academic freedom under Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government.</p> \n<p>The protests, which started last week, have given the country's fragmented opposition a chance to work together as they challenge Orban, who has led the country with increasing powers since 2010.</p> \n<p>The satiric Hungarian Two-Tailed Dog Party hosted a downtown march Friday night in the Hungarian capital with speeches, chants and signs critical of Orban.</p> \n<p>One sign said &quot;I want to give birth to a stadium,&quot; poking fun at two of Orban's preoccupations: Increasing the nation's birthrate and filling the country with white-elephant sports facilities.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Will Israel abet Hungary’s whitewash museum?&nbsp;■&nbsp;Netanyahu and Europe's right wing: Quite a success story&nbsp;■&nbsp;Why are Netanyahu, Erdogan, Trump and Orban so afraid of Soros?</p> \n<p>Protesters gathered outside Parliament and marched to the offices of President Janos Ader in Buda Castle to rebuke him for signing the labor changes as well as other legislation creating a new court system under government control.</p> \n<p>The new courts will hear most cases involving the state, from taxation issues to electoral disputes, so having them under government control creates a sharp conflict of interest and reduces their independence.</p> \n<p>Since returning to power eight years ago, Orban has been reshaping Hungary. New laws governing the media and churches have been enacted while the state has an ever-increasing presence in all walks of life, from industry to the arts and sports.</p> \n<p>With unorthodox policies, Orban's governments have sought to centralize control and shore up the Hungarian economy, which a decade ago needed to be bailed out by the International Monetary Fund. His Fidesz party remains popular,&nbsp;securing a third consecutive two-thirds majority in April.</p> \n<p>Emboldened by his latest big majority in parliament, Orban has forced a Budapest-based university founded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros to&nbsp;move most of its programs to Vienna. He retains his fiery rhetoric against migrants and has refused to join a new European Union public prosecutor's office focusing on fraud and corruption.</p> \n<p>However, the recent protests have invigorated the opposition.</p> \n<p>The catalyst for the protests was a new labor code dubbed the &quot;slave law&quot; by critics and approved by lawmakers on December 12. It would increase the number of overtime hours employers could ask workers to put in voluntarily, essentially bringing back a six-day work week, and allow overtime payments to remain unpaid for up to three years.</p> \n<p>&quot;I think the slave law is a spark, with the protest banner saying 'We've had enough' capturing it best,&quot; said Csaba Toth of the Republikon Institute think tank.</p> \n<p>On Monday, several opposition lawmakers were physically expelled from the cheadquarters after spending the night in the building trying to get their demands read on air.</p> \n<p>Akos Hadhazy, an independent lawmaker who was among those assaulted by security guards, said Hungary was now closer to becoming a dictatorship. Government officials, meanwhile, called on the opposition to respect the law.</p> \n<p>Opposition lawmakers were silenced by parliamentary authorities during the labor law bill's debate and government-party legislators swept aside in a single vote some 2,800 amendments to the bill.</p> \n<p>The opposition also attempted to delay the vote by blocking access to the speaker's podium and blowing whistles and sounding sirens during the vote, all to no avail.</p> \n<p>&quot;Whatever we try to do within the normal parliamentary framework — like presenting amendments or draft laws or debating in the committees — falls on deaf ears and everything is forcefully brushed aside,&quot; said Timea Szabo, a lawmaker with the Dialogue party.</p> \n<p>&quot;We have reached the point where we simply have to resort to other means, within the frame of non-violence,&quot; she said.</p> \n<p>Lawmakers and supporters from a wide range of parties — from the nationalist Jobbik party to the Socialist Party, as well as the new Momentum party and others — have been participating in the protests.</p> \n<p>&quot;For now it's a fragile cooperation, but we are working to strengthen it,&quot; Szabo said. &quot;The mere fact that we have reached the point at the end of 2018 that we can cooperate with Jobbik on some issues is a great result. Our hope is that in the long term it can result in a new kind of cooperation.&quot;</p> \n<p>There have been few effective protests against Orban since 2010, although the government scrapped plans for a tax on internet usage after several rallies in 2014 by mostly students.</p> \n<p>&quot;There is an emerging unity of the opposition and you can also see the unions and the civil organizations working together. All that might result in something,&quot; Toth said, noting that national elections aren't scheduled until 2022. &quot;Any attempt to go against the government starts with the opposition solidifying its own base.&quot;</p> \n<p>Hadhazy was confident that after a break for the holidays, enthusiasm among government critics would remain strong.</p> \n<p>&quot;These protests have shown that people are truly very dissatisfied ... we are already now preparing for a large protest on January 5,&quot; Hadhazy said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Maccabi healthcare fund is looking into allegations leveled by the organization Physicians for Human Rights Israel that one of its senior researchers, the pediatrician Dr. Gideon Koren, behaved unethically while doing research in Canada.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One of such instances of unethical behavior was research into a drug at Toronto University two decades ago, with the support of Apotex, the company that developed the medication. According to a report by a Toronto hospital with which Koren worked in the study, risks were discovered, but the drug company prevented notification to patients, in violation of professional and ethical obligations. According to Physicians for Human Rights Israel, Koren published findings that the drug was safe, and the company used his writings to push use of the drug. Physicians for Human Rights Israel notes that the hospital and university both took disciplinary action against Koren because of misconduct.</p> \n<p>In a second incident exposed in 2017, The Star reported that in 1999, Koren wrote anonymous &quot;poison pen&quot; letters about a whistleblower colleague, Dr. Nancy Olivieri, sending them to his colleagues at SickKids and to the press, among other things calling her and her supporters a &quot;group of pigs&quot;.</p> \n<p>Among the fallout is doubt shrouding no less than thousands of child protection decisions throughout Canada based on flawed tests for drugs and alcohol in hair from 2005 to 2015. The tests Koren used were not credible, other doctors have charged. A local Canadian court refused to allow a class action to proceed against him and the lab he led; Koren himself stated that the tests had not been the overriding consideration in the welfare authorities' decisions and that most results were verified by other sources.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The suspicions against Koren, founder of the Motherisk and SickKids programs, were reported in Canada a year and a half ago, when The Star revealed that in a rare move, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario confirmed its investigation into Koren.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children announced a review of all of Koren's published work, The Star said, which reports its own investigation finding&nbsp; &quot;what appear to be problems&quot; in more than 400 of Koren’s papers.</p> \n<p>The local probe in Israel ensued after the Physicians for Human Rights Israel organization urged the ethics bureau at the Israel Medical Association and the Maccabi management, in October, to investigate.</p> \n<p>The Physicians organization called for that Koren's work at Maccabi, including his guidance for researchers, to be terminated. &quot;It is only proper that caution be exercised regarding a person who has fallen badly twice, and that he not be chosen for a position in which ethics, integrity and fairness are necessary conditions,&quot; the Physicians for Human Rights Israel's ethics chief Hadas Ziv wrote. The allegations focus on two issues in which Koren was involved.</p> \n<p>Koren, 71, completed his medical degree in the 1970s and now lectures at a number of Israeli universities and volunteers at the Asaf Harofe medical center. He has been considered a global expert on toxicology and teratology, not least regarding fetal alcohol syndrome. He has published 15 medical books and over 1,700 papers. He also founded the Israeli band The Brothers &amp; the Sisters, which was active from 1971 to 1983 and had a number of hits to its credit; he also wrote the children's play &quot;Fitz the Mouse&quot;.</p> \n<p>Koren commented that there is nothing to prevent him from engaging in research. &quot;After the Olivieri report was published, I continued to hold senior positions,&quot; he stated. Regarding the lab tests, he said that not a single child had been taken from its parents, or returned to them, based on the findings.</p> \n<p>&quot;The lab I headed was clinical, not forensic, and even won praise,&quot; he said. He also claimed umbrage at the organization for &quot;attacking without checking the facts&quot; and said that claims of biased or misleading research were outright libel. Maccabi, commenting further to the letter it received some weeks ago, said a team is looking into the matter.</p>",

Then, over the last miserable couple of weeks, I realized that it's time I brought this up, to the surface, and, at long last, dealt with it.</p> \n<p>It's about Zionism. Zionism as a form of toxic masculinity.</p> \n<p>Toxic masculinity, as in: I, as a self-decreed Alpha, can do whatever the Capital Eff I please, to whomever I please, for whatever personal benefit I can extract, with absolutely no fear of negative consequence.</p> \n<p>As in: I should be able to badger and bludgeon anyone I please, in order to get my way, regardless of the issue, regardless of how many people it hurts, demeans, infuriates, oppresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Why? #BecauseZionism.</p> \n<p>It has to do with toxic masculinity in behavior, policy, enforcement, in word and deed.

        "text":["<p>As planned, Israel launched a diplomatic campaign against the Lebanese government and Hezbollah this week after uncovering the tunnels dug by the Shi’ite organization under the Israel-Lebanon border. On Wednesday, a few hours before a UN Security Council session on the matter, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the tunnels were part of Hezbollah’s plans for war, adding that the group uses “every third house in southern Lebanon.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu called on the council to define Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and impose sanctions on it – two things that probably won't happen in the near future.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Israel takes tunnel op to world stage before potential use of unprecedented force in Lebanon&nbsp;■&nbsp;'Hezbollah's Operation Barbarossa': How army chief pushed Netanyahu to go after the tunnels</p> \n<p>The success of Israeli intelligence in locating the tunnels won't be translated into a fundamental change along the border. Israel will have to salvage whatever it can from the achievement, mostly by increasing pressure on the United Nations' UNIFIL forces to show greater resolve in southern Lebanon.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Officers who until recently served in UNIFIL told Haaretz that the possibility of attack tunnels under the border came up in talks with Israeli officers in recent years. The former UNIFIL officers said UN troops would need a court order to search houses in villages in southern Lebanon. They admitted that UNIFIL, because of the restrictions placed on its activities, is hard-pressed in providing a reliable picture of what's happening along the border.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Although no one in the United Nations admits it directly, the main constraint comes from UNIFIL’s senior command itself. It's clear to the force’s officers that Hezbollah will lash out the minute it senses danger.</p> \n<p>The group acted that way in 2007, the year after the Second Lebanon War. The Spanish battalion was very active in its sector, before a car bomb blew up near one of its patrols and killed six Spanish soldiers. The message was received – and according to the finest of Lebanese traditions. Since then, Hezbollah has had nearly no problems with undesired supervision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hezbollah has been keeping total radio silence since the Israeli surprise. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah declared back in September that he would no longer respond publicly to every “Israeli provocation.” His announcement came shortly after Netanyahu revealed to the UN General Assembly Hezbollah's efforts to improve the precision of its missiles. At the same time, the Lebanese government – which denies it knew about the tunnels – has responded by harshly condemning the “Israeli violations of its sovereignty” and, more importantly, the air force's flights over Lebanon.</p> \n<p>It's clear to all parties that the debate over the tunnels is just a preview of the much broader disagreement expected to occur over Hezbollah's precision-missile factories in Beirut – first as an Israeli diplomatic effort and later, possibly even as justification for preemptive military action against the missiles. The missile factories will be at the center of Israel’s affairs this coming year, according to many defense officials.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But for now, it seems that Netanyahu – like U.S. President Donald Trump – expects more pressing personal problems. With all due respect to the American withdrawal from Syria and the tunnels from Lebanon, the most dramatic headline of the past week concerned the state prosecutor's recommendation to charge Netanyahu for allegedly offering benefits in return for positive news coverage. (This refers to Case 2000 involving the tabloid Yedioth Ahronoth and Case 4000 involving the Bezeq telecommunications company's Walla website.)</p> \n<p>The prosecutor's recommendation is an earthquake that could affect the timetable for the next Israeli election, and possibly even the election itself.&nbsp; With all this going on, it could be that Hezbollah's precision-missile plants in Beirut will have to wait.</p> \n<p>No A for effort</p> \n<p>The Knesset continued dealing intensively last week with the criticism by the Israel Defense Forces' ombudsman, Maj. Gen. (res.) Yitzhak Brik. On Monday, the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee said goodbye to Brik, who will finish up his term in three weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the subcommittee on military preparedness presented the conclusions of its work since Brik’s criticism of the IDF’s ground forces' preparedess for war. The subcommittee, chaired by MK Omer Bar-Lev (Zionist Union), studied the defense establishment’s internal reports, visited the bases where reserves units’ equipment is stored and met with General Staff generals, division commanders and battalion commanders in the reserves.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>The subcommittee’s conclusions are very different from Brik’s loud warning bells. Bar-Lev was impressed that the military under Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot has significantly improved its preparedness for war during the four plus years since the 2014 Gaza war. But Bar-Lev also identified major gaps, and the subcommittee recommended the IDF to finish the work. The subcommittee accepted Eisenkot’s conclusion that the military must invest resources and give precedence – in training and equipment – to its elite divisions over a few reserve divisions.</p> \n<p>The subcommittee’s report is a lot like a school report card, a member of the subcommittee said. The student, the IDF, is progressing very nicely but could try harder. The General Staff is pleased with the conclusions of the Bar-Lev subcommittee. To the generals, this is an objective and independent response to Brik's harsh accusations against the military.</p> \n<p>In comparison, Brik – who it seems has upped his media efforts as the end of his term nears – has expressed much less satisfaction. The members of the subcommittee “missed out on the one-time opportunity to help the IDF rescue itself from the mire in which the ground forces are sinking,” Brik said.</p> \n<p>The next chapter in the Brik-Eisenkot saga will start next week. The steering committee appointed by Eisenkot, headed by retired major generals Doron Almog and Avi Mizrahi, will present its own report. This should be a short document that won't directly address the dispute with Brik and won't deal with Brik’s (accurate) criticism of the IDF’s organizational culture.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Almog-Mizrahi committee is expected to focus on the issues that need improvement concerning the ground forces' preparedness for war. Eisenkot will have his say in his television interviews before he finishes his term in mid-January. But the changes will be carried out by his successor, Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi.</p>",

At most it has been the accomplice of human restlessness.”</p> \n<p>Joseph Conrad, “The Rescue” (1920)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While working on the “Dark Waters” project along the shores of Spain, Italy and Greece, I saw a beautiful and tranquil waterline. By contrast, in the stormy areas, breakwaters are common, blocking the natural movement of the waves toward the coast. I traveled there as part of the project, supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross, to see the new gates to Europe up close. Along the beaches, I searched for clues of the immigration crisis – among the items that washed up on the sand, in the architecture, in the landscape and in the movements of the sea.</p> \n<p>Millions of Africans have crossed the Mediterranean and reached these shores since the 1990s. Tens of thousands have lost their lives en route, some disappearing without a trace. The wave of immigrants is slowly changing the face of Europe, and despite the slowdown reported during the past year, there is no reason to think it’s about to end. Climate change, economic gaps, endless wars – all indicate that the mass migration will continue. In southern Italy, I spoke to people who survived the journey. They told me about the trip, the trials they experienced en route and their confrontation with the sea within. They all sought a better life. They all encountered death.</p> \n<p>Saidia, 45, Algeria. Mother of six children. Her son Najar Ilyas, 22, disappeared at sea</p> \n<p>“I arranged to meet him at 10 P.M. on the beach. He did not show up, and I called him for two weeks, and no one answered. The police reassured me, ‘He’s here, do not worry.’ No one was there when I arrived. I told my son not to come with the boat because my heart is not calm, because the sea is not safe. I cannot look at the sea. Every time I go to the beach, I cry because my son is inside there somewhere. I do not eat fish anymore, I think about my son. My heart tells me my son is alive, that he is not dead, but I do not know where he is.&quot;</p> \n<p>Wallace, 23, Burkina Faso</p> \n<p>“In 2017 I tried to cross the sea to Italy, but the engine broke down. We lost 13 friends. We threw bodies into the sea so avoid panic. This year it worked. Again I spent days at sea, tired and hungry and despondent. I just waited for death. Sometimes when I wake up, I don’t believe I’m in Europe.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Adama, 27, Ghana. Married with three children</p> \n<p>“At 4 o’clock in the afternoon, our boat capsized, the fuel spilled into the sea and swirled about us in waves, creating a solution that causes burns. Only at 2 A.M. did they arrive to rescue us. I could not support my children, so I decided to cross the sea, to try and take care of their future. I grew up near the sea in Ghana; as children we played soccer on the beach. Today when I remember the sea, I cry. I will never enter the sea again.”</p> \n<p>Amado, 22, Senegal</p> \n<p>“I had a difficult journey. I passed through Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Libya, where I was jailed twice. I decided to try to reach Italy after my parents died in war. My little brother also left for Libya, and on the day I arrived there, I was told that he had died in the desert after robbers took his food and water. When we set out to sea, there were 150 of us, and in the middle of the trip we couldn’t continue. Only 16 of us remained.&quot;</p> \n<p>Emmanuel, 22, Ghana. Married with a 1-year-old boy</p> \n<p>“When we began the trip, there were 142 of us; at the end, we were 61. When the chaos started, I grabbed onto an empty gas canister, which allowed me to float. I saw many people drowning around me. I wanted to save them, but I knew that when people are drowning, they grab onto anything, and they would drag me down with them. In the end, I gave my gas canister to someone who was exhausted. He fell asleep on the canister and disappeared into the sea.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Jacob, 31, Ghana. Married with two children. During the trip he was imprisoned and sold as a slave;&nbsp;he later escaped</p> \n<p>“The engine of the boat broke down, it was horrifically hot, people who could not swim, complete chaos. From 11 A.M. until midnight we were in the water, not knowing how we would survive. Everyone was looking for something to hold on to. I can swim a little and it helped ... I thought that this was it, that I would not survive. I saw dozens of dead people, so I knew I could die, too. I loved the sea.

        "text":["<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump’s Syria withdrawal and Mattis’ resignation startle Israel – and undercut Netanyahu</p> \n<p>With the thrust of the sword, or really with strike of just one tweet, U.S. President Donald Trump ruined all the plans of his advisers and generals. For many months, all of them have been explaining – from Secretary of Defense James Mattis,&nbsp;who announced his resignation Thursday,&nbsp;to National Security Adviser (Trump's third in less than two years) John Bolton – to Trump how important the American presence in Syria is to blocking Iranian expansion, containing Russian influence in the Middle East and bolstering the international standing of the United States.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, along came Trump and pulled the rug out from under their feet. Diplomats and other U.S. government employees will leave Syria within 24 hours, and the last American soldier will leave in 100 days.</p> \n<p>Who is the wise man who can understand what led to Trump’s decision? Was it something he saw on television, on the Fox network where he spends so much of his time? Maybe he wanted to quickly divert the media debate to another topic, after another catastrophic week in which it seemed the noose that special prosecutor Robert Mueller is readying around him is growing even tighter? Or maybe he just remembered his campaign promise to make America great again by reducing its spending on wars far from its shores?</p> \n<p>As far as Israel is concerned, this story has one immediate lesson and one long-term conclusion. The immediate conclusion is that the desire to distance Iranian forces and the Shi’ite militias from Syria is nowhere near being realized. Russia sold Israel barren promises, which crumbled after six months or so – and the United States is not excited about helping out. And even if the Israel Defense Forces racked up an impressive achievement in the series of confrontations with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Syria last spring, this does not mean that Tehran has given up on its plans.</p> \n<p>The long-term lesson is that Trump, in his situation, has become someone who cannot be relied on. Even if he is basically sympathetic to Israel, and even though he is surrounded by family, advisers and weathly people who are Jewish, Trump is in such big trouble and acts in such an erratic manner that the Israeli government cannot be certain of his support over the long term.</p> \n<p>The chances that the American administration will advance a coherent “Deal of the Century” peace plan with the Palestinians now seems to be minimal, similar to the possibility that Trump will suddenly reconcile with the Iranians, in the same way he fell in love with the North Korean dictator – and in the same breath he announced, without any foundation, the end of Pyongyang’s nuclear threat. But it is simply impossible to know when it comes to Trump – and the decision makers in Jerusalem need to take into account the increased sphere of uncertainty in which they are operating.</p> \n<p>The Kurds have the real right to complain</p> \n<p>The Israeli disappointment is just another relatively small matter compared to the betrayal that the Kurds certainly feel, after they sacrificed thousands of their fighters to aid the American campaign against the Islamic State, and will now remain without any military support to fall back on in Syria.</p> \n<p>In comparison, the U.S. retreat from Syria has been received with satisfaction in the broad camp that supported the Bashar Assad regime in the Syrian civil war, led by Russia and Iran. Russian President Vladimir Putin can, for now, consider his Syrian adventure to be an impressive success.</p> \n<p>Assessments heard in the Israeli defense establishment, to the effect that Russia would sink deep into the mire in Syria, a sort of Russian Vietnam (or another Afghanistan for Moscow), were proven wrong. Putin’s decision in September 2015 to send two squadrons of Russian combat planes to help out Syrian President Bashar Assad has paid off. It tipped the balance in the civil war in favor of the regime, which at the time was on the verge of collapse, and later it shored up Moscow’s international standing.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;Trump and Obama may be complete opposites — but their Syria policies are nearly identical&nbsp;■&nbsp;Washington is an ally, but only to a point</p> \n<p>Prof. Dmitry Adamsky, from the School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, is one of the outstanding analysts of Russian strategy. In a policy paper, “Moscow’s Syria Campaign: Russian Lessons for the Art of Strategy,” published recently by independent French think tank IFRI, Adamsky describes the deep influence of Russian military involvement in Syria on “Russian strategic thought and operational art.”</p> \n<p>Moscow entered the campaign in Syria for a combination of reasons: Defending its ally (Assad); preserving its assets (most important of them, maintaining control of the port of Tartus on the Mediterranean Sea); striking the Islamic jihadists, some of whom came from its neighboring countries in Central Asia; attempting to improve its international and regional position; and diverting attention from its moves in Crimea and in eastern Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Adamsky identifies three Russian strategic principles that were played out in Syria. The first principle is preserving friction at a high, but controlled level, which allows Moscow to strengthen its status as a broker in its contact with all the parties, all of whom need the Russians. Russia was part of the problem in Syria, but is also part of the solution. The contacts it kept with all the sides gave it an advantage in its competition with the Americans. In every conflict, Russia will work to underscore the limits power of each of the parties and their dependence on the Kremlin, writes Adamsky.</p> \n<p>It should be noted that these are the principles implemented in Russia’s contacts with Israel, too: First establishing a hot line to prevent aerial confrontations between planes from both countries, and later – recently – the cold shoulder Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received from Putin after the Ilyushin spy plane was shot down by Syrian antiaircraft fire.</p> \n<p>The second principle, according to Adamsky, is the avoidance of what the Russians view as the greatest danger, the uncontrolled expansion of the campaign – what the Americans call “mission creep,” a mission that gradually exceeds its original scope. The third principle is preserving strategic flexibility, while remaining aware of the limits of their power and while implementing rapid adaptations when they are necessary.</p> \n<p>Putin has reasons to be satisfied by Russia’s strategy, says Adamsky. It is not just the fact that Russia succeeded in stabilizing the Assad regime, but also that the cost of the war, in both casualties and money, was reasonable as far as the Russians were concerned. Their regional and international status was bolstered, military officers gained operational experience and the troops managed a complex campaign filled with intelligence and technology, in which Russia tested the validity of new combat doctrines and displayed its military capabilities and its modern weapons systems, for all to see in the international arena.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Simcha (Kazik) Rotem, one of the outstanding and last surviving fighters of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, died on Saturday at 94.</p> \n<p>Warsaw-born in 1924, Rotem joined the HaNoar HaTzioni (i.e. Zionist youth) youth movement at the age of 12. German bombing raids destroyed his family’s home at the outbreak of World War II, killing his brother Yisrael, his grandparents, aunt and uncle. He and his mother were wounded in the raid.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The story of the Warsaw Ghetto as told by the Jews, not the Nazis</p> \n<p>“I remember that our house was bombed one day after Yom Kippur. Two bombs smashed through the building and many of the people were injured and killed. Of my family alone, seven close members were killed, including my grandparents and my brother Yisrael, who was younger than me by a year and a half. My mother was injured and I myself was badly wounded,” Rotem said in an interview with Yad Vashem.</p> \n<p>“When I regained consciousness, I found myself under the wreckage of the house. Only after I managed to extricate myself did I see that our house was totally destroyed and no sign of life was to be seen. I got to the shelter of the neighboring house and found both my parents and my sisters. I learned that the rest of the family had been killed.&quot;</p> \n<p>After the Jews of Warsaw had been sent to the ghetto, he was sent to live with relatives in the town of Klwow.</p> \n<p>“I remained there for three months, until mid-1942. Klw&oacute;w had a ghetto without a wall and it was here that I saw for the first time a German killing a Jew and how his blood flowed. He had been caught outside of the ghetto and even though there was no wall, it was prohibited to exit the ghetto limits. The head of the Judenrat arrived and begged for the Jew’s life, but to no avail. They shot and killed him, departing on their horses. Simple. That was the first time I witnessed killing,” Rotem told Yad Vashem.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Secret archive of Warsaw Ghetto goes on display to mark uprising's 75th anniversary</p> \n<p>In 1943, he returned to the Warsaw Ghetto and joined the Jewish Combat Organization, which was commanded by the legendary Mordechai Anielewicz.</p> \n<p>“We knew that something was about to happen. But to tell the truth, even at this stage, meaning in the final stage before the ghetto's liquidation, we probably still couldn't accept this thing... A total annihilation, in the twentieth century, in the very heart of Europe — something like this is just impossible. It was hard to accept this notion,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>The uprising began on April 19, 1943, and Rotem acted as a liaison between the bunkers in the ghetto and the Aryan side of the city.</p> \n<p>“Right at the beginning, when I saw the mass of German forces enter the ghetto, my initial reaction — and I guess I wasn’t alone in this — was one of hopelessness. What chance did we have with our miserable supply of firearms to hold off this show of German force with machine-guns, personnel carriers and even tanks? With masses of infantrymen, hundreds if not thousands, of soldiers on motorcycles and ambulances and more… An absolute sense of powerlessness prevailed,” he said.</p> \n<p>But the mood changed swiftly and turned into &quot;extraordinary exhilaration,&quot; he said. “It had been for this moment that we had anxiously waited! In other words, our emotional reactions were like extreme swings of the pendulum, from hopelessness to great exhilaration... over the mere fact that we could handle the all-powerful Germans, whose mere sight imposed terror and fear and completely paralyzed you,&quot; he added.</p> \n<p>At first the Germans retreated, after suffering losses and getting several of their troops wounded in attacks by ghetto fighters. &quot;We thought they would keep entering [the ghetto] and we would have face-to-face battle. We would kill as many of them as we could, and we knew that our end was completely spelled out. But they did it differently. They retreated and did the destruction work from outside. And we had no means to handle that. Within three to four days, the ghetto was in flames,&quot; Rotem recounted.</p> \n<p>He fought under Marek Edelman’s command. In May, Rotem fled the ghetto through the sewers to link up with Anielewicz’s deputy, Antek Zuckerman, in order to get outside help to continue the revolt.</p> \n<p>On May 8, three weeks after the rebellion had begun, the command bunker at Mila 18 was attacked. Anielewicz, the leader of the revolt, continued to fighter there as well as the others. He and many of them committed suicide to avoid surrender.</p> \n<p>Rotem headed the effort to rescue fighters from the burning ghetto: Among them were Edelman and another revolt leader, Zivia Lubetkin.</p> \n<p>Later he would say in an interview that &quot;At Mila 18, something took place that happened everywhere else in the end. Everything was destroyed and done with. My commander, Marek Edelman, he claimed that it was actually all a matter of understanding and thinking. And that they shouldn't have committed suicide there. It's hard to argue with that. He may be right. Nobody could argue one way or the other. It could be that they would have lucked out and they would have been able to get out with the group that left. Because after all, several dozens of people left. Not that it's a lot, among the hundreds of thousands who were in the ghetto... it was very much a matter of luck. And except for luck, you then you needed to make decisions within seconds, and either you decide well or you make a poor decision, and the price was high. That is all.&quot;</p> \n<p>Rotem later joined the Polish rebellion in Warsaw, was part of a group that took revenge against the Germans and helped the Beriha movement of Holocaust survivor refugees seeking to immigrate to pre-state Israel. In 1946, he made aliyah and fought with the Haganah in the Independence war.</p> \n<p>In 2013, in honor of the revolt's 70th anniversary, Rotem participated in a ceremony that was held in Warsaw, where he received a badge of honor from the Polish president.</p> \n<p>“During the Holocaust I met people worthy of the adjective 'human beings,' even among the Poles. But there were also people who without any clear interest other than evil intent, sentenced a Jew to death in a word. I cannot and do not wish to understand them. Just as I do not wish to understand those who participated in the pogroms in Poland after the war,” he said.</p> \n<p>Rotem is survived by children and grandchildren. His funeral will be held on Monday afternoon at Kibbutz Harel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“It started as a normal raid. Shortly before 6 A.M. on Sept. 11, Turkish anti-terrorism police showed up at my apartment door in Ankara with an arrest warrant. They rifled through my books, found some supposedly incriminating titles (largely political works about the Turkish left) and took me into custody.”</p> \n<p>This is how Max Zirngast, an Austrian journalist and social activist, begins his November 30th piece in The Washington Post, which he managed to translate and get out to the same newspaper Jamal Khashoggi wrote for.</p> \n<p>“On my first day in police custody, nothing extraordinary happened. I was placed in a cell, where I slept on a piece of wood, with a thin blanket and no pillows,” Zirngast continues. “It was freezing, and the light bore down on me around the clock. The food rations were sparse and ice cold. After a few days, I had an upset stomach, cramps and diarrhea.” His interrogators sought to know details about books he had and his ties with the Kurds (because of one of the books found in his home), as well as with left-wing organizations in Turkey.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Turkey, jailer of journalists, now slams Saudi Arabia - for murdering a journalist | Opinion</p> \n<p>Now Zirngast is waiting for a decision by Turkish prosecutors on whether to try him for “supporting terror,” that same vague charge that’s applied to most political prisoners.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Austrian government is trying to get him released. Although Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called last week for Zirngast’s freedom, Austria can’t exert the same pressure as the United States, which with one swipe of sanctions this summer managed to get Pastor Andrew Brunson released from a Turkish prison in October after he’d been held for two years.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Zirngast has a better chance of being released than the 239 Turkish journalists who are currently in detention or in prison (as of October 31). Foreign journalists at least have a homeland attempting to help them, as opposed to Turkish journalists, whose homeland is imprisoning them.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; There are no checks and balances in Turkey, there's only Erdogan, Israeli expert explains</p> \n<p>These journalists have difficulty gaining international support because Turkey rebuffs all questions about them by claiming that their detention is Turkey’s domestic affair or part of its war on terror. Any effort to challenge these claims gets this crushing Turkish response: “Anyone who criticizes Turkey for jailing terror activists is himself a partner in terrorism.”</p> \n<p>It’s not only journalists who have become synonymous with terrorists. Last week a Turkish court sentenced one of the country’s leading neurologists, Prof. Gencay Gursoy, 79, to 26 months in prison for signing a petition three years ago calling for reconciliation with the Kurdish minority and renewing the national dialogue with them. The petition was signed by more than 1,100 intellectuals and professionals in response to the brutal military operation in the city of Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey that destroyed large parts of its Old City. Gursoy could have received a reduced sentence if he had expressed regret, but he insisted he had nothing to regret. Until he was arrested he continued to write articles criticizing the government’s conduct, articles that “proved” to the prosecution that the defendant was not worthy of mercy.</p> \n<p>The list of celebrities sentenced to prison terms for “terrorist activity” or “intent to violate the constitutional order” includes Saide Inac, a German singer of Kurdish origin who was arrested in the city of Edirne during last June’s election campaign for being supportive of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is defined as a terrorist organization. Last month she was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment.</p> \n<p>The arrest of celebrities still manages to snare a few headlines in the Western press, but every such publicized arrest makes people forget the ongoing harassment of thousands of journalists, writers, judges, teachers and academics who are sitting in jail or awaiting trial. No one talks anymore about the destruction of 29 publishing houses over two years ago and the confiscation and destruction of tens of thousands of books. Thousands of libraries have had to remove books banned by the government from their shelves, and bookstores visited by police, who removed thousands of volumes, are now forced to scrutinize every new book that’s published, lest buying it put the purchaser in violation of the terror law.</p> \n<p>As a result of this behavior Turkey ranks 157th out of 180 countries surveyed in the World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Even Belarus and Russia rank higher. Under it are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Iraq and several other countries that do not aspire to join the European Union.</p> \n<p>When it comes to countries that are at the bottom of the table, there is mostly despair about anything ever changing in this realm. But with Turkey, efforts are still being made to persuade President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to adopt a more liberal policy. The European Union has warned the Turkish government that continued repression will reduce Turkey’s chances of joining the EU, but no country is threatening it with sanctions such as those imposed by several countries on Saudi Arabia, including the recent U.S. Senate decision to stop selling arms to the Saudis.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon presented new intelligence material against Hezbollah at a United Nations Security Council session on Wednesday, claiming that information given to the&nbsp;UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) on attack tunnels entering its territory reached Hezbollah through officials in the Lebanese army.</p> \n<p>Danon was speaking at a session requested by Israel and the United States after Israel discovered four such attack tunnels in recent weeks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The special session focused on breaches of Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War and limits Hezbollah's activity in southern Lebanon, and came as part of an Israeli&nbsp;public diplomacy campaign against the Lebanese organization.</p> \n<p>Danon presented aerial footage of what he called a &quot;private compound&quot; in Kafr Kela, a town in southern Lebanon located some 80 meters from the Blue Line, under which an attack tunnel crosses into Israel - passing meters away from a UNIFIL observation post.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel takes tunnel pp to world stage before potential use of unprecedented force in Lebanon&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;'Hezbollah's Operation Barbarossa': How army chief pushed Netanyahu to go after the tunnels</p> \n<p>Danon said Israel &quot;gave UNIFIL precise information about the location of the tunnel. After UNIFIL told the Lebanese army, it was then stopped when it tried to reach the area. Sources within the Lebanese army informed Hezbollah about the information, which enabled the terrorist organization to conceal the tunnel's operations and thwart Israel's defensive actions.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Lebanese army officials are working for Hezbollah, while UNIFIL is not working to fulfill its mandate in the region in the necessary manner,&quot; added the ambassador.</p> \n<p>Danon presented a second aerial photograph of Kafr Kela documenting Hezbollah's expansive terrorist infrastructure, including two tunnels crossing into Israel and two intelligence-gathering outposts and weapons' storage facilities.</p> \n<p>Calling Kafr Kela &quot;a terror terminal&quot; on the Israeli border and within civilian population, Danon said Hezbollah is not only blatantly violating Resolution 1701, but persists in using Lebanese citizens as human shields. This, Danon added, is all financed by Iran. &quot;If Hezbollah dares to attack Israel – we will bury it in the rubble of Lebanon,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>Danon also called upon the council to condemn Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, as it did ISIS.</p> \n<p>The Russian envoy at the Security Council said that Hezbollah attack tunnels were indeed discovered and that their existence was indeed acknowledged by UNIFIL. The Russian envoy said that while Moscow understood Israeli concerns, it believes&nbsp;that for the &quot;sake of stability,&quot; all sides ought to refrain from an escalation and hold a dialogue.</p> \n<p>Both sides, the Russian envoy stressed, have to stop breaching UN resolutions. The envoy added that Russia acknowledges Israel's right to protect itself but that it hopes that in doing so, it will not breach the Blue Line (the international border between Israel and Lebanon).</p> \n<p>The envoy went on to say that Russia was pleased with signals from both sides that they are trying to avoid an escalation, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin heard as much from Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>What we need now, the ambassador added, is responsible behavior to quell tensions.</p> \n<p>Speaking after Russia, the Lebanese envoy said that current tensions are raising concerns in Lebanon as they evoke memories of traumas from &quot;previous Israeli invasion.&quot;</p> \n<p>She noted that Lebanon is taking the situation seriously and that it is not interested in an escalation: &quot;These are not mere words,&quot; the envoy said, &quot;but our real interest.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Lebanese ambassador claimed that while Lebanon did not violate any UN resolutions, Israel has: &quot;Over the past month, there have been at least 150 breaches&quot; of resolutions.</p> \n<p>The envoy further accused Israel of sending threatening messages to Lebanese citizens and causing panic. She addressed what she called a &quot;double standard,&quot; asking why Israeli violations Lebanon reports are not being handled by the UN. The envoy also said that what Israel views as actions it carries out in self defense, Beirut sees as a threat.</p> \n<p>The Israeli media is right by questioning the timing of the Israeli campaign to destroy Hezbollah tunnels, the envoy noted, before calling for a complete cease-fire.</p> \n<p>France, Sweden and the Netherlands condemned the Hezbollah tunnels and called for them to be investigated by the Lebanese Armed Forces in cooperation with UNIFIL, to allow for long-term stability in the region.</p> \n<p>China called for an independent inquiry of the tunnels, and called on both Israel and Hezbollah to avoid an escalation and promote stability. Unilateral actions from either side, said Chinese envoy Ma Zhaoxu, should be eschewed.</p> \n<p>Ahead of the discussion, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed that the Lebanese Army, to the best of Israel's knowledge, was not aware of the tunnels being dug by Hezbollah from Lebanon into Israel, but noted that Israel sees Lebanon responsible for demolishing them.</p> \n<p>Danon also said Tuesday that after UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping force on the Israeli-Lebanese border, &quot;confirmed that Hezbollah's tunnels were an outright breach of 1701, the time has come for the Security Council to act, using all means, against the Hezbollah terror infrastructure that continues to grow stronger under the government of Lebanon.&quot;</p> \n<p>In recent days, Netanyahu&nbsp;has been emphasizing his message that Hezbollah's tunnels breach Resolution 1701. Addressing Israeli ambassadors at a meeting last week at the Foreign Ministry, Netanyahu said the goal of exposing the tunnels was also to lead a diplomatic initiative against Hezbollah.</p> \n<p>&quot;The exposure of Hezbollah's terrorist tunnels on the northern border is part of an effort, which is not just military, but it is also a public diplomacy, economic and diplomatic effort to impose increased sanctions on Hezbollah, to designate all subdivisions of Hezbollah as one organization,&quot; he said in a statement.</p> \n<p>&quot;It is also necessary to increase sanctions on Iran, which is behind this organization and is also behind Hamas's similar attempts,&quot; he added in the statement on the website of the Prime Minister's Office.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu said these efforts would be seen at the Security Council session, but that &quot;it is much more than that. You need to go country by country, foreign ministry by foreign ministry, government by government, and tell them: Take a stand here against Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization. Hezbollah flagrantly violated our sovereignty. Hezbollah is violating UN Security Council Resolution 1701. This is your time to act.&quot;</p> \n<p>Speaking ahead of the discussion, Danon was asked about the U.S. decision to withdraw its troops from Syria, a move that was announced hours earlier.</p> \n<p>Danon said that Israel would respect any U.S. decision, but that Jerusalem still had its qualms about Iranian presence in Syria and that Israel would continue to act —in collaboration with Americans and Russians —to protect its people if necessary.</p> \n<p>Also Wednesday, Netanyahu said he spoke with Trump and with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. &quot;The U.S. administration has told me that it was the president's intention to&nbsp;pull out their troops from Syria. They clarified that they have other ways to wield their influence in that arena,&quot; the premier stated.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu added that Israel will closely follow the time table of the American troops' withdrawl and what repercussions this move will have on Jerusalem. &quot;In any case we will make sure to ensure the safety of Israel&nbsp; and protect ourselves from this arena.&quot;</p>",
